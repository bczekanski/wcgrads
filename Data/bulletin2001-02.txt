HISTORY OF THE COLLEGE

   The chartering of Williams College in 1793 was an act of faith and certainly an act surpassing the
modest intentions of Colonel Ephraim Williams, for whom the college is named.

   Colonel Williams had not intended to found a college. Enroute with his regiment of Massachu-
setts militia to join the battle with the French and Indians at Lake George, the Colonel had tarried
long enough in Albany to write his last will and testament on July 22, 1755. In it he bequeathed his
residuary estate for the founding and support of a free school in West Township, where for some
years he had commanded a detachment of militia at Fort Massachusetts, farthest outpost of the
province. The will stipulated that West Township, then in dispute between Massachusetts and New
York, must fall within Massachusetts and that the name of the township must be changed to Wil-
liamstown, if the free school was to be established at all.

   On September 8, 1755, Colonel Williams was killed at the Battle of Lake George. On October 26,
1791, after many delays, fifteen scholars were admitted to the free school in Williamstown. Within a
year the trustees, not content with the original modest design of the founder, were captivated by the
idea of creating a college where, as they put it, "young gentlemen from every part of the Union" might
resort for instruction " in all the branches of useful and polite literature." The proposal was extremely
ambitious, to be sure, but ambition was a common American ailment. England did not develop a third
university until the nineteenth century; Williams was the twenty-first institution of higher learning to
flower in onetime British colonies, the second in Massachusetts, the sixth in New England. On June
22, 1793, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts granted a charter to Williams College.

                                            I

   The bold decision to plant a college in the wilderness betrayed the intentions of Colonel Wil-
liams; yet the new vision had been fed by the same sort of dreams that had led Ephraim Williams to
see a school and a comfortable community where only a military outpost had stood. The early trust-
ees and the legislature of the Commonwealth were to be remembered for their foresight, but in the
decades after 1793 they had reason to acknowledge that the soil they had chosen was stubbornly
uncongenial--so uncongenial, in fact, that for many years the trustees of Williams spent more time
and energy in trying to close the College than in trying to keep it open.

   In 1819 they petitioned to move the college to Northhampton, and in 1821, having been spurned by
the legislature, President Zephaniah Swift Moore took matters into his own hands. Convinced that
almost everything about Williams was impossible--its location, its funds, its enrollment--he led a
group of students over the mountains into the Connecticut Valley. There he became their president
once again, at the struggling new college known as Amherst. As for Williams, one member of the
senior class wrote home to his father: "It remains for us to say whether it shall die suddenly, or whether
it shall linger along for two or three years."

   In the past the public had come to the support of the institution. A lottery furnished funds essen-
tial to the opening of the free school. A public subscription was the answer of Berkshire County to
the threat of removal in 1819. What saved the College in 1821 was the willingness of the Reverend
Edward Dorr Griffin to take the job of president and the determination with which he drew upon the
College's reputation for religious conservatism to collect much-needed funds. By 1828, the Rever-
end Griffin could be seen standing in the middle of Main Street, supervising the construction of a
handsome new building, housing a chapel, a library, and classrooms, a testament to his confidence
and his skill. The building is now known as Griffin Hall.

   The College which had been taking shape under Griffin and his predecessors was not unlike
many other New England colleges where the classical curriculum and a moral atmosphere served as
the basis for training young men for professional life. The college turned out its share of clergymen,
doctors, lawyers, and teachers, serving the needs of Western Massachusetts and surrounding com-
munities in New York and Vermont. But Williams was not yet a place to which "young gentlemen
from every part of the Union" resorted. In fact, Nathaniel Hawthorne, attending the commencement
exercises in 1838, jotted in his notebook some observations on the Williams students he saw there:
"Country graduates--rough, brown-featured, schoolmaster-looking...A rough hewn, heavy set of
fellows from the hills and woods in this neighborhood; unpolished bumpkins, who had grown up as
farmer-boys."

                                                 ­3­
History of the College

   Williams seldom knew financial security until the end of the nineteenth century. But it did have
assets that enabled it to develop into a prototype of the small New England liberal arts college. Scen-
ery, a reputation for moral soundness, a loyal body of alumni, and a devoted faculty went a long way
toward compensating for inadequate funds.

   Of the scenery, Thoreau remarked, after a visit in 1844, "It would be no small advantage if every
college were thus located at the base of a mountain." For Thoreau the location of Williams was "as
good at least as one well-endowed professorship."

   In the early years the religious reputation of the College depended on the essential orthodoxy of
its presidents and faculty. It gathered strength from the famous episode of the "haystack meeting" in
the summer of 1806. Five Williams undergraduates, seeking to continue their prayers and conversa-
tions in spite of a sudden thunderstorm, retired from a grove of trees to the shelter of a nearby hay-
stack, where they were inspired to launch the great adventure of American foreign missions. The
extremely informal ties with the Congregationalists saved it from the sometimes stifling strangle-
hold of an organic denominational connection.

   During a crisis in the affairs of the College in 1821, a group of alumni met in Williamstown and
organized the Society of Alumni, dedicated to the future welfare of the College. Their action gave
Williams the distinction of organizing the first college alumni society in history. Alumni loyalty was
rewarded when, in 1868, the College provided for official alumni representation on the board of trust-
ees, an act of recognition in which only Harvard, among American colleges, anticipated Williams.

                                            II

   But essentially the College has built its reputation around teachers and teaching. Mark Hopkins,
who was a Williams professor from 1830 to 1887 and president of the College from 1836 to 1872, has
become a symbol of this emphasis. In American education Hopkins pioneered in making the student
the center of the educational experience, and he did it so well that one of his former students, U.S.
President James A. Garfield, immortalized his achievement in an aphorism which has passed into the
lore of American education: "The ideal college is Mark Hopkins on one end of a log and a student on
the other." The Hopkins tradition has become one of the College's great assets. It has been perpetuated
in the lives of generations of teachers.

   Scenery, a reputation for building sound character, loyal but not especially affluent alumni, and
devoted teachers could keep the College open, but like most other colleges Williams did not experi-
ence growth and prosperity until the closing decades of the nineteenth century. The scenery, of
course, remained constant, but it developed into an even greater asset as the United States became
more urbanized and industrialized. Williams was still a country college; a Massachusetts court de-
cision of 1888 declared that cows owned by the college were tax exempt. The discovery that busi-
nessmen could profit from liberal education sent college enrollments upward as the century drew to
a close; now more Williams alumni were men of affairs, fewer were clergymen. By 1906, of all the
colleges in New England, Williams drew the largest percentage of students from outside New Eng-
land.

   From 1793 through 1870 the Commonwealth of Massachusetts appropriated for Williams College
over $150,000, a sum of such importance that Mark Hopkins himself observed that he did "not see
how the College could have got on" without state aid. A new and more dependable source of financial
support was developed as the century drew to a close. In the 1890's Frederick Ferris Thompson of the
Class of 1856 became the first of many individuals to supersede the Commonwealth as the largest
benefactor of the College. Ephraim Williams' original bequest of $9,297 has since grown by addition-
al gifts and bequests to an endowment valued at approximately $1.3 billion.

                                           III

   Williams moved into the twentieth century firm in its intentions to remain a college, at a time when
aspirations toward university status were unsettling many of the old colleges. It adhered to a curricu-
lum that was designed for undergraduates; it made room for the elective principle, but it subjected
course election to safeguards and controls. The idea of a liberally educated man was not jettisoned in
favor of the widely accepted idea of almost complete student freedom in course election. A survey of
the college curriculum in 1925 showed that Williams had combined the principles of prescription and
election, the goals of concentration and distribution, in such a way as to be the only major American

                                                 ­4­

college without any absolutely required courses and without any uncontrolled wide-option electives.
The Williams curriculum has continued to evolve, but it has not undergone such a series of major
overhauls as characterize curriculums inspired by the popular educational fancy of the moment. Not
having abandoned itself to the elective principle in the nineteenth century, Williams did not need to
rescue itself with the general education principle of the twentieth century.

   During its long history much of the life and tone of the college was shaped by students. While the
same influence continues, the competitive pressure for admission since World War II has allowed
for a new and significant degree of selectivity on the part of the College. Among the consequences
of this change have been a quickening of the intellectual life of the College and a reconsideration of
traditions and emphases no longer considered appropriate for an institution of liberal learning.

   Among the first traditions to go was compulsory religious exercises, abandoned in 1962 after a
hundred years of gradual but steady erosion. Voluntary worship in the form of ecumenical chapel
services and the activities of student religious organizations carry on another long tradition. In re-
sponse to the concern of undergraduate leaders and the faculty and in recognition of the failure of
Greek Letter Fraternities to fulfill adequately objectives consistent with college purpose, the Trust-
ees in 1962 took the first of a series of actions that replaced fraternities with a residential house sys-
tem. Williams became, as a result, a much more open community. The decision to become coeduca-
tional and the admission of women to Williams as degree candidates in 1970 have reinforced the
spirit of equality and freedom conducive to a climate of learning.

   In this atmosphere of change and heightened purpose the curriculum underwent appropriate
transformations, as a careful comparative study of the yearly catalogues readily shows, leading to
the present 4-1-4 curriculum and a more flexible and wide-ranging schedule and program both on
and beyond the campus. Changes in the curriculum included the addition of majors and the
introduction of interdisciplinary programs, along with the expansion of language offerings to in-
clude full, four-year cycles in Chinese and Japanese. Continuing the tradition of putting the student
at the center of the educational experience, Williams in the Fall of 1988 introduced in each depart-
ment at least one course taught as a tutorial, in which, typically, pairs of students meet weekly with
the professor to discuss a paper, problem set, or work of art produced by one of the students. By
1992 some 40 percent of the graduating class had experienced at least one tutorial course either in
Williamstown or in the Williams-Oxford program, run in association with Exeter College, Oxford,
which provides each year for some 30 Williams juniors a year-long immersion in the life of Oxford
University.

   This curricular expansion reflected, and in part resulted from, the fact that the makeup of the col-
lege community was changing to mirror more closely the growing racial, ethnic, and religious di-
versity of American society. The percentage of Williams students who identified themselves as
members of one or more American minority group rose to 25 percent; of faculty almost 13 percent.

   In spite of change, however, the guiding spirit of the College has not wavered from the sentiment
expressed by Mark Hopkins in his inaugural address of 1836: "We are to regard the mind, not as a
piece of iron to be laid upon the anvil and hammered into any shape, nor as a block of marble in
which we are to find the statue by removing the rubbish, nor as a receptacle into which knowledge
may be poured; but as a flame that is to be fed, as an active being that must be strengthened to think
and to feel--and to dare, to do, and to suffer."

   Our colleges will not be rich enough until they are able to bring the education they offer within the
reach of the poorest young man in the land.

   Dedicated to the welfare of the great common life of the State, [the College] may not much longer
close its doors to one half of the community because of their sex, neither may it narrow its labors or its
sympathies to any class, to any favored few.

                                                                                         James D. Canfield '68
                                                                                    Centennial Oration (1893)

   [Young people] now entering college, if given their biblical life span--and who knows what more or
less than three score and ten?--will be carrying responsibilities well into the 21st century...No one can
pretend to more than a guess at what they will then be called upon to comprehend. This much we do know:
that no training in fixed techniques, no finite knowledge now at hand, no rigid formula they might be given
can solve problems whose shape we cannot yet define. Nor have they time to waste in pursuit of transitory
expedients, the ephemeral, the shallow or the merely popular.

   The most versatile, the most durable, in an ultimate sense the most practical knowledge and intel-
lectual resources which they can now be offered are those impractical arts and sciences around which
the liberal arts education has long centered: the capacity to see and feel, to grasp, respond and act over
a widening arc of experience; the disposition and ability to think, to question, to use knowledge to
order an ever-extending range of reality; the elasticity to grow, to perceive more widely and more
deeply, and perhaps to create; the understanding to decide where to stand and the will and tenacity to
do so; the wit and wisdom, the humanity and the humor to try to see oneself, one's society, and one's
world with open eyes, to live a life usefully, to help things in which one believes on their way. This is
not the whole of a liberal arts education, but as I understand it, this range of goals is close to its core.

                                                                                President John E. Sawyer '39
                                                                                     Induction Address (1961)

   The longer history of education in our own culture has been such as to suggest the openness, resil-
ience, flexibility and power of that age-old tradition of education in the liberal arts that at its best is
consciously geared to no less inclusive an activity than that of living itself...[And] no education which
truly aspires to be a preparation for living can afford to ignore the fundamental continuities that exist
between the cultivation of specific areas of specialized knowledge, expertise or skill (without which
we could scarcely endure) and that more fundamental and wide-ranging attempt to penetrate by our
reason the very structures of the natural world, to evoke the dimensions and significance of the beauti-
ful, to reach towards an understanding of what it is to be human, of one's position of the universe, and
of one's relations with one's fellows, moral no less than material. Towards that attempt we seem im-
pelled by the very fiber of our being. In its total absence, while doubtless we survive, we do so as
something surely less than human.

   The history, moreover, of that most American of educational institutions, the independent, free-
standing liberal-arts college, witnesses forcefully to the power of that central educational institution
when wedded to the other long-standing conviction that education is not a process that can wholly be
confined to classroom, laboratory, studio or library, but one to which the diverse experience and richly
variegated moments of life in a residential community must all combine to make their particular con-
tribution. Extracurriculum as well as curriculum; play as well as work; fellowship as well as solitude;
the foreign as well as the familiar; discomfort as well as ease; protest as well as celebration; prescrip-
tion as well as choice; failure as well as success.

                                                                                     President Francis Oakley
                                                                                     Induction Address (1985)

cial wealth, and the absolute finest students in all of American higher education, we are obligated to

realize a vision of educational excellence worthy of our extraordinary resources. That vision undoubt-
edly involves the optimal use of new technologies to enhance the special relationship between a stu-
dent and a faculty member; the breaking down of departmental boundaries, fostering cutting edge
interdisciplinary teaching and research; a way to link more effectively the education that takes place
within the classroom with the education that takes place in the dorm rooms and dining halls and on the
playing fields; a program that allows our students to venture out into the world in ways that reinforce
their classroom experiences; and a commitment to redouble our efforts to educate our students in an
environment that reflects the great strength of our diverse society and to keep the precious prize of a
Williams education open to the most talented students in the nation regardless of family background.

   We have never wavered in understanding that our mission is to provide the highest quality under-
graduate education possible, centered on an appreciation and indeed a love of the liberal arts. We can
build on that legacy. This is a time for Williams to set a new standard of excellence in undergraduate
education for an entire industry crying out for guidance. Let history one day note that our community
had the courage to seize the moment.

THE CURRICULUM

   Williams College offers a course of study leading to the degree of Bachelor of Arts. The course
requirements prescribe both the number of courses to be completed and the minimum grade level to
be achieved; the curriculum also requires that each student explore several fields of knowledge and
concentrate in one. The full requirements for the degree include meeting the minimum academic stan-
dards stated below, residing at the College, fulfilling the distribution requirement, completing a major,
and completing the physical education requirement.

   The academic year is divided into two regular semesters and a Winter Study Program. The student
takes four courses in each semester and during January pursues a single program of study on a pass-
fail basis.

   The Winter Study Program, which began in 1967, is intended to provide students and faculty with a
dramatically different educational experience in the January term. The differences are in the nature of
the courses, the nature of the learning experience, and the change of educational pace and format from
the fall and spring semesters. These differences apply to the faculty and students in several ways: fac-
ulty can try out courses with new subjects and techniques that might, if successful, be used later in the
regular terms; they can explore subjects not amenable to inclusion in regular courses; and they can
investigate fields outside their usual areas of expertise. In their academic work, which is graded Hon-
ors, Pass, Perfunctory Pass, or Fail, students can explore new fields at low risk, concentrate on one
subject that requires a great deal of time, develop individual research projects, or work in a different
milieu (as interns, for example, or on trips outside Williamstown). In addition, Winter Study offers
students an opportunity for more independence and initiative in a less formal setting, more opportunity
to participate in cultural events, and an occasion to get to know one another better.

REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR OF ARTS DEGREE

Academic Requirement

   To be eligible for the Bachelor of Arts degree a student must pass 32 regularly graded semester
courses and receive grades of C minus or higher in at least 19 of those semester courses, pass four
Winter Study Projects, fulfill the distribution requirement, complete all requirements for the major
including an average of C minus or higher, and complete the physical education requirement.

Residence Requirement

   Students who begin college at Williams must spend a minimum of six semesters in residence at
Williams. Students transferring to Williams from other institutions must spend a minimum of four
semesters in residence at Williams, and those entering as sophomores are expected to spend six se-
mesters in residence. Students are considered to be in residence if they are taking a program of study
under the direction of the Williams College Faculty. Students must be in residence for both semesters
of the final year.

   The degree requirements must be completed within eight semesters, including any semesters for
which a student receives credit while not in residence at Williams. Thus, semesters spent away on
exchange programs with other colleges or on junior year abroad are included in the eight semesters.
Similarly, if a student requests, and the Committee on Academic Standing grants, degree credit based
on Advanced Placement scores, then these semesters are also included in the limit of eight.

Distribution Requirement

   The distribution requirement falls into two parts.
   (1) First, there is a divisional requirement designed to ensure that in their course of study at Wil-
liams, students take an appropriately diverse distribution of courses across the full range of the curric-
ulum.
   For the purposes of the divisional requirement, courses are grouped into three divisions: Division I,
Languages and the Arts; Division II, Social Studies; and Division III, Science and Mathematics. A full
listing of the subjects in each division appears below.
   Students must complete at least three graded semester courses in each division. Two such courses
in each division must be completed by the end of the sophomore year. No more than two of the courses
used to satisfy the requirement may have the same course prefix.
   Courses which fulfill the distribution requirement in Division I are designed to help students be-
come better able to respond to the arts sensitively and intelligently by learning the language, whether
verbal, visual, or musical, of a significant field of artistic expression. Students learn how to develop

                                                 ­8­
                                                                                     The Curriculum

the capacity for critical discussion, to increase awareness of the esthetic and moral issues raised by
works of art, and to grow in self-awareness and creativity.

   Courses which fulfill the Division II requirement consider the institutions and social structures that
human beings have created, whether knowingly or unknowingly, and which in turn markedly affect
their lives. These courses are intended to help the students recognize, analyze, and evaluate these hu-
man structures in order that they may better understand themselves and the social world in which they
live.

   Courses which fulfill the Division III requirement are intended to provide some of the factual and
methodological knowledge needed to be an informed citizen in a world deeply influenced by scientif-
ic thought and technological accomplishment, and to cultivate skill in exact and quantitative reason-
ing.

   (2) Second there is a requirement in peoples and cultures intended to help students to begin to un-
derstand the cultural diversity of American society and the world at large, so that, as citizens of an
increasingly interconnected world, they may become better able to respond sensitively and intelli-
gently to peoples of varied social backgrounds and cultural frameworks. Courses which fulfill this
requirement are thus designed to familiarize students with some dimension of American cultural di-
versity or that of the non-Western world. Each student must complete one graded semester course
primarily concerned with : (a) the peoples and cultures of North America that trace their origins to
Africa, Asia, Latin America, Oceania, or the Caribbean; Native American peoples and cultures; or (b)
the peoples and cultures of Africa, Asia, Latin America, Oceania, or the Caribbean. Although this
course, which may be counted toward the divisional distribution requirement, may be completed any
semester before graduation, students are urged to complete the course by the end of the sophomore
year.

   Courses that may be used to meet the requirement in peoples and cultures are marked with an aster-
isk after the title. A list of courses offered in 2001-2002 which meet the requirement is on pages
322-324.

Major Requirement

   The Major Requirement is designed to assure that all Williams undergraduates will have the experi-
ence of disciplined and cumulative study, carried on over an extended period of time, in some impor-
tant field of intellectual inquiry. Juniors are required to declare a major field of concentration; the actu-
al selection of a major is normally made at the time of registration in the spring of the sophomore year.

General Structure of Majors

   1) A student ordinarily must elect at least nine semester courses in his or her major field. A particu-
lar major may also require an additional course and/or one Winter Study Project during the junior or
senior year.

   A student may also fulfill the minimum requirements for a major by taking eight semester courses
in the major field and two semester courses, approved by a major advisor, in associated fields. In inter-
departmental majors, such as Political Economy, a larger number of courses may be required.

   2) A prescribed sequence of courses, supplemented by parallel courses, and including a major
seminar, is required in some major fields. Other majors ask the student to plan a sequence of elective
courses, including advanced work building on elementary courses in the field, and ending in a one- or
two- semester faculty-organized course or project in the senior year. All majors provide a system of
counseling to help students plan programs reflecting individual interests as well as disciplined and
cumulative patterns of inquiry.

   Courses in many major programs require prerequisite courses in related areas. A full description of
the detailed structure of each major is found under the heading of that major in the section, "Courses of
Instruction."

Contract Major

   Students who wish to undertake the coherent study of an interdisciplinary subject not covered by a
regularly offered major may propose to be contract majors. Procedures for arranging a contract major
and for honors work in such a major are described in the section, "Courses of Instruction." Students
interested in this option should begin consulting with the Dean's Office and with potential faculty ad-
visors early in the sophomore year. A student completing a contract major may not do so in conjunc-
tion with a second major. For further details, see page 142.

Double Major

   A student may complete two majors with the permission of each major department and the Com-
mittee on Academic Standing. Although a student may be granted permission to use a course from
one major to fulfill a particular requirement in the other, the student nevertheless must take the mini-
mum number of courses in each field without counting any course twice. A student may be a candi-

                                                ­ 11 ­
The Curriculum

date for Honors in either or both of the majors, but a course for Honors in one major may not be used
for an Honors course in the other.

Co-ordinate Programs

   In addition to majoring in a field, a student may choose to concentrate elective courses on a single
topic or area, such as African and Middle Eastern Studies; African-American Studies; Biochemistry
and Molecular Biology; Environmental Studies; Neuroscience; Science and Technology Studies; or
Women's and Gender Studies. Descriptions of such possible co-ordinate programs appear under the
appropriate heading in "Courses of Instruction." If the co-ordinate program courses are directly re-
lated to the major, a student may be allowed to reduce the number of courses required to complete the
major.

Certificate in European Languages

   Students may pursue a Certificate in four European languages offered at Williams (French, Ger-
man, Russian, and Spanish). The program certifies a particular degree of proficiency, cultural literacy,
and experience with the language in the context of one's college education. In order to gain the profi-
ciency and experience certified by the program, students must have taken a) at least five semesters of
college language (or the equivalent) and b) a standardized proficiency test administered by the depart-
ments. In addition, students are required to gain familiarity with the culture in question by taking at
least one course each in a) the literature, music, art, or philosophy, and b) the history, economics, or
politics of the cultural area. Students must take seven courses altogether, up to two of which may be
taken abroad. Please refer to the respective language programs for details on the specific certificates.

Physical Education Requirement

   The Physical Education requirement provides students the opportunity of establishing and main-
taining a general level of fitness and well-being; of developing abilities in carry-over activities; of
discovering and extending their own physical capabilities; and of developing skills in activities with
survival implications, such as swimming, life saving, and water safety.

   A swim test is required of all first-year students at the start of the academic year. Students who fail
to complete the test must pass a basic swim course given in the Physical Education program during the
first quarter of the year.

   Students must complete four quarters of physical education by the end of the sophomore year un-
less excused by the Dean of the College and the Director of Health. Students must enroll in at least two
different activities in fulfilling the requirement.

   Participation in a fall or spring intercollegiate sport is equivalent to two activity units and participa-
tion in a winter sport is equivalent to three units. A maximum of three credits may be attained while
participating in intercollegiate sports with the exception of a two sport athlete who can fulfill the
physical education requirement by totaling four units in two sports. Students may receive a maximum
of two activity units for participation in a club sport; the remaining two units must come from the
physical education activity program.

ADDITIONAL CURRICULAR OPPORTUNITIES

Advanced Placement

   At the discretion of the appropriate departments, students presenting satisfactory scores in Ad-
vanced Placement tests may be placed in advanced courses not regularly open to them, may receive
course credit toward the major, and/or may receive course credit toward the degree. A.P. credit, if
granted, can be used as a prerequisite; in partial fulfillment of the major requirement; and (if in two or
more subjects) for acceleration, i.e., completion of the degree in fewer than four years. A.P. credit
cannot be used to reduce the normal course load of any semester, to make up a deficiency incurred at
Williams, or to satisfy the Distribution Requirement.

Independent Study

   When a particularly able student wishes to pursue the study of a subject not covered by the normal
course offerings of the College, arrangements may be made for him or her to undertake courses of
independent study under faculty supervision. Arrangements for independent study are made with the
appropriate department at the time of registration.

Student-Initiated Courses

A Student-Initiated Course is one proposed and organized by students and sponsored by the Inter-

departmental Program for Experimental and Cross-Disciplinary Studies. In such courses, the students

carry a heavy burden of the leadership in proposing requirements, selecting material to be covered and

conducting discussions, as well as in conceiving the basic outline of the course. The instructor super-

vises the syllabus, student participation, and performance, and is responsible for evaluation of the stu-

dents.

1) In order to provide for planning, students should discuss plans for Student-Initiated Courses in

the coming year at the beginning of the previous spring semester.

2) Interested students should propose Student-Initiated Courses to the Interdepartmental Program

for Experimental and Cross-Disciplinary Studies and to a faculty instructor by the following

deadlines:

        Fall Semester courses:    before the end of Spring Registration

        Spring Semester courses:  before the end of Fall Semester

3) Proposals for Student-Initiated Courses should include descriptions of the aims and anticipated

techniques of the course, as well as a statement concerning any anticipated constraints on enroll-

ment. Enrollment might be based on such educational considerations as the student's back-

ground of knowledge, individual potential for growth and development, maximum feasible size

of discussion groups, and availability of special materials or resources.

4) All Student-Initiated Courses, including criteria for enrollment, must be approved by:

a) a faculty member who agrees to be the instructor of the course;

b) the Interdepartmental Program for Experimental and Cross-Disciplinary Studies;

c) the Committee on Educational Policy.

Normally, each section of a student-initiated course will be limited to 15 students.

5) A student may enroll in no more than one Student-Initiated Course each semester. No more than

six such courses may be credited toward a Williams B.A.

6) At the end of each Student-Initiated Course, the faculty instructor files with the Program and

with the CEP a report on the course's content, a summary syllabus, and an evaluation.

Honors Program

   Williams awards the degree with Honors to those students who have demonstrated imagination,
initiative, and intellectual independence within the major. The Honors program requires two or three
courses constituting a clearly interrelated pattern of study, whether in the form of a thesis, specializa-
tion within the major, or interdisciplinary study with courses from other programs or departments. At
least one of the courses must be in addition to the minimum number required for the major; one may
be a Winter Study Project. A student who is a double major may be a candidate for Honors in either or
both of the majors, but a course for Honors in one major may not be used as an Honors course in the
other. Some programs also award honors for their concentrations.

   Individual departments and programs describe special criteria, procedures, and patterns of study
for Honors in the "Courses of Instruction" section. Students should consult with their departments on
their Honors options prior to the senior year. Before the student has begun the last of the required
course units, the department or program determines whether the student is admitted to Honors candi-
dacy. The degree is awarded with Honors or Highest Honors at the end of the senior year if, in the
judgment of the department, its criteria of excellence have been met.

Tutorial Program

   In the Fall of 1988, Williams introduced a Tutorial Program. Many departments offer one tutorial
during the academic year and some offer more than one. Students should examine the tutorial offer-
ings carefully in order to understand fully the subject matter of each tutorial and its operation. A com-
plete description of each tutorial to be offered appears in the relevant department's section under
"Courses of Instruction." No student is required to take a tutorial, but any student who has the ap-
propriate qualifications may apply to do so.

   Tutorials generally consist of two students meeting with the tutor for a weekly session. For each
meeting, one student prepares a presentation--for instance, an essay, solutions to a set of problems, a

                                                ­ 13 ­
The Curriculum

report on laboratory exercises, or a study of a work of art--and replies to the questions and sugges-
tions of the other student and the tutor.

   Assignments are designed to require the student to spend no more time over a week preparing for a
tutorial than for a conventional course. Grading and testing will be described by the tutor at the first
meeting of the tutorial. Students may obtain detailed information about a specific tutorial from the
tutor.

   Please refer to page 45 for more information.

Clusters

   Both faculty and students are sometimes eager to work in areas that cut across departmental and
program lines. Interdepartmental clusters are a new initiative designed around such areas of interest.
Clusters are listed in the catalog in alphabetical order. Current clusters are Jewish Studies, Latin
American Studies, Leadership Studies, Materials Science Studies, and Performance Studies. Clusters
are for educational purposes only, and will not appear on a student's transcript.

Study Away From Williams

   Students may receive credit for work at institutions other than Williams, under certain circum-
stances. A student who wishes to enroll in another institution and to transfer credits to Williams should
consult in advance with the Dean's Office and with the appropriate department chair. Applications for
study away require the approval of the chair of the student's major, the Dean's Office, and the Com-
mittee on Academic Standing. Petition deadlines are in March of the preceding year. See the Student
Handbook and the Guide to Study Abroad for more information.

Williams-Mystic Maritime Studies Program

   The Williams-Mystic Program offers students a challenging opportunity to focus one semester and
a winter study on the sea. Williams College faculty members serve as the Maritime Studies Program
Director and Marine Scientist. While living in historic cooperative houses at Mystic Seaport Museum,
students take full advantage of its outstanding maritime collections and library, well-equipped marine
laboratory, and diverse coastal environment. Participants enroll in a multidisciplinary program of four
Williams College courses: American Maritime History, Literature of the Sea, Oceanography or Ma-
rine Ecology, and Marine Policy. Students also learn maritime skills under professional instruction,
including music of the sea, shipsmithing, sailing, or celestial navigation. In addition, the Program of-
fers four field seminars each semester, including a two-week offshore voyage on a research schooner,
eight days exploring the coasts of California or Oregon, a three-day trip to Nantucket Island, and a
two-day trip to New York Harbor.

   The incomparable facilities of Mystic Seaport, Mystic's varied marine habitat, and the companion-
ship of fellow students with diverse backgrounds, but all interested in the sea, provide an exceptional
setting for maritime studies. Interested students should consult the "American Maritime Studies" sec-
tion of this catalog and the Dean's Office for a Williams-Mystic catalog and an application. Admis-
sion is competitive. Applications must be made in the spring of the preceding year. Check with the
Dean's Office for deadlines.

Williams-Oxford Programme

   Williams offers a year-long programme of studies at Oxford University in cooperation with Exeter
College, Oxford. Based at Ephraim Williams House, Williams' study center at Oxford, the Pro-
gramme is designed to offer the fullest possible integration of the students into the intellectual and
social life of one of the world's great universities. It makes full use of the Oxford tutorial system and
the Oxford three-term calendar is followed.

   In addition to extensive opportunities to pursue British and Commonwealth studies, the Pro-
gramme also offers instruction in other fields for which Oxford is particularly noted or which are rep-
resented only marginally or infrequently in the Williams curriculum. Interested students should con-
sult the Dean's Office and the "Courses of Instruction" section of this catalog.

Exchange Programs

   The Twelve College Exchange Program includes Amherst, Bowdoin, Connecticut College, Dart-
mouth, Mount Holyoke, Smith, Trinity, Vassar, Wellesley, Wesleyan, Wheaton, and, for a semester
program, the National Theatre Institute, in Waterford, Connecticut. In addition, the College maintains
an exchange with California Institute of Technology, Howard University, Fisk University, the Thayer
School of Engineering at Dartmouth, and with Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.

   Information on the programs and copies of the participating schools' catalogs are available at the
Dean's Office. Application deadline is in February of the preceding academic year.

Study Abroad

   Williams participates in study abroad programs in Spain and France (in cooperation with Hamilton
College); in China (as part of the Associated Colleges in China); in Sweden (in cooperation with
twelve other colleges and the University of Stockholm); in Denmark (with the University of Copen-
hagen Danish International Studies); and in Kyoto (the Associated Kyoto Program, run by a group of
eleven colleges). Williams students may also receive credit for approved programs at a wide variety of
other institutions, or for work done directly in a foreign university or accredited four-year American
university if acceptable evaluation is possible. Students interested in study abroad should consult the
Dean's Office. Students must submit a pink petition and essay to the Dean's Office by March of the
preceding academic year for which they wish to study off campus. Students must be in good academic
standing with no deficiencies and follow the procedures as set out in the Guide to Study Abroad.

Cross-Enrollment Programs

   A limited number of students may register at Bennington College or Massachusetts College of Lib-
eral Arts for courses not offered by Williams. Interested students should contact the Registrar's Office
about arrangements.

Combined Program in Liberal Arts and Engineering

   The 3-2 program enables qualified students to combine a liberal arts education at Williams with
undergraduate professional training in engineering. In this program, a student studies at Williams for
3 years, completing 24 courses and 3 Winter Study Projects. He or she then transfers to a leading engi-
neering school and studies for a Bachelor of Science degree, usually for 2 more years. Upon success-
ful completion of this program, the student receives a Bachelor of Arts degree from Williams and a
Bachelor of Science degree from the engineering school. For students majoring in physics, chemistry,
computer science, or mathematics at Williams, the requirements for the senior year courses and major
exercise are waived for the Williams degree. Only students who have taken the prerequisite courses,
who have at least a B average in scientific subjects, and who have a good record in other subjects will
be recommended by their major department and approved by the Committee on Academic Standing
for this program.

   Williams has a formal agreement that simplifies the application process to the 3-2 engineering pro-
gram at Columbia University. Other engineering schools offer 3-2 programs which might be ap-
proved on a case-by-case basis. All engineering schools expect that 3-2 students will have completed
several science and mathematics courses at Williams, so it is necessary to plan course selections care-
fully. The booklet "Choosing First Year Courses" includes a list of Williams courses recommended to
prospective engineers.

   The 3-2 program offers an established route to entry-level employment as an engineer. In recent
years, however, most Williams students have chosen to complete the Williams B.A. in the usual 4
years and then go to graduate programs in engineering. Please see the section of this catalog titled
"Preparation for Graduate and Professional Study." Also, prospective engineers at Williams have the
opportunity to take undergraduate engineering courses at other institutions through various exchange
programs. For information about these opportunities, please see the section titled "Exchange Pro-
grams."

   The pre-engineering advisor, Professor Sarah Bolton, will be happy to assist students interested in
any of the options leading to engineering careers.

ACADEMIC STANDARDS AND REGULATIONS

Attendance

   In order to give students a larger share of responsibility for their own education, Williams College does
not administer a general system of required classroom attendance. The College expects students to make
full use of their educational opportunities by regular class attendance and to assume the academic risks
incurred by absences.

   Although no formal system of class attendance is maintained by the College, instructors may set such
standards of attendance as they feel are necessary for the satisfactory conduct of their courses. Students
who fail to meet these standards may be warned by the instructor and notice sent to the Dean that continued
absence will result in their being dropped from the course. A failing grade will be assigned to any course
dropped after the regular course change period. Students who do not attend the first class meeting in a
semester course or Winter Study Project may be required to withdraw by the instructor. Attendance is re-
quired at announced tests and final examinations unless the student is specifically excused by the instructor
or the Dean's Office. Satisfactory attendance in eight quarters of activities approved by the Department of
Physical Education is required except for students excused by the Dean and the Director of Health.

Registration

   Registration for fall and spring semesters and for the Winter Study Program takes place at designated
periods during the academic year. A late fee of $25 may be assessed for registration materials accepted
after the announced deadlines.

   New students register by mail in early summer; soon after arrival at Williams, they meet with their as-
signed Academic Advisors to discuss the curriculum and their course selections. All course changes for
new students are made with the approval of the Faculty Advisors. During the first two years of study, stu-
dents are limited in the number of courses they may take in one department or subject each semester. For
full details, see pages 43-45.

Course Change Period

   Course changes may be made during a designated period at the beginning of each semester. No course
changes may be made after that period except with the approval of the Committee on Academic Standing,
after consultation with the Dean's Office. During Winter Study, a second Winter Study Project may be
added if the instructor approves but the original Project may not be dropped. A processing fee of $5 per day
is assessed for each course change accepted after the announced deadline.

   First-year and first-semester transfer students may be permitted to withdraw from one course (incurring
a deficiency but no grade penalty) as late as the tenth week of the semester. Upperclass students also may
once in subsequent years withdraw from a course under the same conditions. A withdrawal, recorded on
the transcript as a "W," is granted only with the approval of the instructor and a dean and only if there is
complete agreement between the instructor and the dean that, despite conscientious effort to do the work,
continuation in the course would be detrimental to the overall educational interest or health of the student.
The deficiency thereby incurred must be removed in the normal manner. See references to making up defi-
ciencies on page 18.

Course Load

   Students are required to take and complete four courses each semester. In exceptional cases, students
may, upon petition to the Committee on Academic Standing and with departmental approval at the time of
registration, elect a pattern of five semester courses in the fall semester and three in the spring or three in the
fall and five in the spring; a pass-fail course cannot be used as the fifth course in this pattern.

   If a student with a disability believes that he/she is unable to pursue a full course of study, the student
may petition the Disabilities and Accommodations Advisory Group for permission to pursue a reduced
course load. Such a petition must be accompanied by a professional evaluation which addresses the stu-
dent's inability to maintain a full course of study and discusses the rationale for a reduced course load.
Upon consideration of a student's petition and supporting documentation, the Disabilities and Accom-
modations Advisory Group makes a recommendation to the Committee on Academic Standing which
renders decisions. Such cases are considered on an individual basis and may be initiated at any time during
the student's tenure at Williams.

Fifth Course Pass-Fail Option

   Except in the case of the unbalanced course program described above, a student may, at the beginning of
any semester, enroll in a fifth course with the permission of the instructor and on a pass-fail basis only; this
course must be specified as the pass-fail course. By the sixth week, a student must decide whether to contin-
ue the course, and if so, whether on a pass-fail or regularly graded basis. A form for designating the option
chosen will be sent from the Registrar's Office. A processing fee of $5 per day is assessed for 5th course
grading option designations accepted after the announced deadline. A course graded "Pass" may not be
used as one of the thirty-two semester courses required to complete the degree, to fulfill distribution or
major requirements, or to make up a deficiency. A pass-fail course converted to a fifth regularly graded
course may be used to fulfill distribution or major requirements or to make up a deficiency incurred in a
prior term. The grade received will be included in the calculation of the student's cumulative grade-point
average.

Winter Study Project

   Students must take and pass a Winter Study Project in each of their four years. Winter Study Projects are
graded Honors, Pass, Perfunctory Pass, or Fail. All work for Winter Study Projects must be submitted by
the last day of the Winter Study Program; work may be accepted after this date only with the permission of
the Dean. Students who fail their Winter Study Projects will be placed on Academic Probation by the
Committee on Academic Standing and will be required to make up the deficiency (see page 18). Students
who fail through gross neglect of work will normally be required to resign. A student who receives a se-
cond Perfunctory Pass grade in Winter Study will be required to pass a fifth course, which may be graded
on the regular A-E or pass/fail basis, in the following spring or fall semester.

Grading System and Records

   Williams uses the following system of grades: A, excellent; B, good; C, fair; D, passing; E, failing.
These letters, with plus and minus value, have the following numerical equivalents in calculating grade
averages:

A+ = 4.33  B+ = 3.33           C+ = 2.33  D+ = 1.33  E=0
A = 4.00   B = 3.00            C = 2.00   D = 1.00
A­ = 3.67  B­ = 2.67           C­ = 1.67  D­ = 0.67

   A grade report is sent by the Registrar to every student at the close of each term. A permanent record of
each student's grades is kept and this official record forms the basis for any academic action by the College.

   A transcript of a student's cumulative academic record is available from the Registrar's Office upon
written request. Transcripts will not be issued for students who are in financial arrears.

   Provisions relating to student records, access to them, and safeguards on their use are in the Student
Handbook.

First-Year Student Warnings

   In the middle of each semester, instructors report to the Registrar those first-year students whose grades
at that time are unsatisfactory. The students and their academic advisors receive notices of warnings as a
matter of routine. The Asssociate Dean for Academic Programs will inform parents of students who re-
ceive two or more warnings unless instructed not to do so by the student within three working days of the
receipt of the warnings.

Extensions of Deadlines

   Deadlines for course work are set by the instructor with the following limitations:

         for courses with final exams, the latest that written work may be due is 5:00 p.m. on the last
            day of reading period.

         for courses without final exams, the latest that written work may be due is 5:00 pm. on the
            third-to-last day of the exam period.

   If work is due before these deadlines, the instructor may grant an extension up to these deadlines solely
at his or her discretion. Short extensions beyond these deadlines may be granted by a dean but only with the
concurrence of the instructor. No extensions will be granted beyond the examination period except in the
case of serious illness.

                               ­ 17 ­
Academic Standards and Regulations

   Instructors may require students who have missed announced quizzes or hour tests to present satis-
factory explanations to a dean before they are permitted to make up the exercises.

   If a student is absent from a final examination, a make-up examination may be given only with the
permission of a dean and at a time determined by the dean.

Deficiencies

   A student receives credit for a course by obtaining a grade of at least D minus. If the student fails a
course, he or she must make up the deficiency.

   If a failure occurs in the first semester of a full-year course, the student may, with the consent of the
instructor, continue the course and receive credit for the second semester only. If a failure occurs in the
second semester of a full-year course, credit for passing the first semester may be retained only upon the
recommendation of the department concerned and with the approval of the Committee on Academic
Standing.

   A senior who incurs a failure in the first semester in a required major course may be dropped from the
College at midyear.

   Normally deficiencies can be made up only by courses taken after the deficiencies have been incurred.
Thus, for example, Advanced Placement credits may not be used to make up deficiencies.

   A student must make up a deficiency in one of these ways:

  1) obtain a grade of at least C minus in a summer school course, approved in advance by the Registrar,
       at a regionally accredited four-year college or university; (The grade will not, however, be included
       in the calculation of the student's cumulative grade point average.)

  2) pass an extra graded course at Williams in the semester following the failure;

  3) in the case of a first-semester failure of a year-long language course, obtain a grade of at least a C minus
       in the work of the second semester of that course. The failure for the first semester will, however, re-
       main on the student's record and will be included in the cumulative grade point average.

   A deficiency must normally be made up before the start of the following academic year, or in the case of
a deficiency incurred in the spring semester, no later than the following fall semester. A student may, in
consultation with the Dean's Office, petition the Committee on Academic Standing with an alternate plan.

Separation for Low Scholarship

   It is the policy of Williams College not to permit a student to remain in residence after it has become
evident that he or she is either unable or unwilling to maintain reasonable standards of academic achieve-
ment. At the end of each term, the Committee on Academic Standing reviews all academic records that fail
to meet the following minimum academic requirements:

For first-year students: Three grades of C minus or better and no failures each semester, and
                             at least Perfunctory Pass on the Winter Study Project

For upperclass students: Four grades of C minus or better each semester, and
                             at least Perfunctory Pass on the Winter Study Project

   Students whose records fail to meet these minimum academic requirements or whose records otherwise
fail to show adequate progress may be placed on academic probation or required to resign.

   Students who are required to resign from the College for academic reasons are normally not permitted to
return for at least one year from the date of their resignation. A student who has been required to resign
from the College may petition the Committee on Academic Standing through the Dean for reinstatement
on two conditions only: all deficiencies must have been made up and a letter submitted to the Committee
that offers convincing evidence that the student is ready and able to complete work toward a degree at
Williams without further interruption.

   When required to resign, students must vacate their rooms promptly. Financial aid students must also
see the Director of Financial Aid before leaving to discuss loan repayment and renewal of aid in the event
of readmission.

   A student who fails to meet minimum academic standards in his or her final semester at Williams may
be required by the Committee on Academic Standing to meet them by earning grades of at least C minus
elsewhere before the B.A. will be awarded. If such work is required, it must be completed within three
years unless stipulated otherwise, and the courses must be approved in advance by the Registrar.

Withdrawal from the College in Good Standing

   Students in good standing occasionally wish to take a personal leave of absence from the College for
sound educational reasons. Students wishing to leave the College should discuss their plans with the Asso-
ciate Dean before departure; they must submit a letter requesting permission to withdraw, pay all College
bills, and vacate their rooms promptly. Financial aid students must also meet with a representative in the
Office of Financial Aid before leaving to discuss loan repayment and renewal of aid upon return.

   Normally, a student may not voluntarily withdraw from the College in good academic standing after the
eighth week of each semester. After that date, a student is expected to complete the work of the semester,
and grades will be recorded for each course in which he or she is enrolled.

   A withdrawal is granted by the Associate Dean for a period of at least a full year and up to three years.
   Students who leave in good standing may return with the approval of the Associate Dean. Upon return,
students are expected to complete degree requirements without further interruption.

Refunds

   Payment refund or credit in the event of withdrawal is described on page 26.

Eligibility for and Completion of Majors

   To be eligible for any major, students must have received grades of C minus or better in each course in
the major taken in the first two years of college and Honors or Pass on any Winter Study Project taken in
that department. A senior may enter a major only upon the approval of the department chair and the Com-
mittee on Academic Standing.

   In addition to passing each major course and, where required, a major Winter Study Project, the student
must maintain an average in the major of 1.67 or higher. Seniors who have an average below 1.67 in the
major field will normally not be allowed to continue. A senior who receives a grade of E in the first semes-
ter of a required major course may be dropped from the College at mid-year. A student who falls below
these standards may continue in the major only with the approval of the Committee on Academic Stand-
ing.

   A senior major exercise is not required by every department but is by some. All departments requiring
such an exercise specify it as such in the description of their major programs in the "Courses of Instruction"
section, and all students in those departments must complete the exercise satisfactorily.

Eligibility for Extracurricular Activities

   A student is eligible to represent the College in any athletic, dramatic, literary, or musical event and be in
the student government, or other organization as a member, substitute, or class officer, unless he or she is
declared ineligible:

   1) by the Dean;
   2) by vote of the Discipline Committee; or
   3) by vote of the Committee on Academic Standing because of a dangerously low record.

   The Student Honor Committee may recommend to the Dean loss of eligibility as a penalty for a viola-
tion of the Honor Code.

Dean's List

   All students who attain a semester average of 3.50 or higher in a program of four or more courses are
placed on the Dean's List for that semester.

Phi Beta Kappa Society

   Students of the highest academic standing are eligible for election to membership in the Phi Beta Kappa
Society in accordance with the following rules:

   1) The requirements for election to membership shall be a grade point average of 3.3 and Honors or
Pass in all required Winter Study Projects. There shall be two elections of new members for each class, at
the end of the junior and senior years.

   2) At the end of the junior year, all students in the highest five percent of the class, ranked by cumulative
grade point average, shall be eligible for election provided they have met the requirements and have com-
pleted enough courses to be considered candidates for the B.A. degree in the following year. A student who
leaves Williams at the end of the junior year to attend graduate school may be elected under the above
procedures.

                                                ­ 19 ­
Academic Standards and Regulations

   At the end of the senior year, all students not yet elected and in the highest 12.5 per cent of the class,
ranked by cumulative grade point average, shall be eligible for election provided they have met the require-
ments.

   3) Students shall be eligible for election only if they have been students at Williams College for at least
two years.

   4) Honorary members may be elected from distinguished alumni of at least twenty years' standing. No
more than one such member shall be elected each year.

   5) Any student who shall have gained his or her rank by unfair means or who in the judgment of the
Dean of the College is not of good moral character is ineligible to election.

   6) The name of a member elect shall be entered on the roll only after he or she has accepted the election
and has paid to the Treasurer the regular entrance fee.

   7) Any undergraduate member who withdraws from the College before graduation or who falls short of
the minimum Phi Beta Kappa scholastic standing may, upon a two-thirds vote of the members present at
the annual meeting, be deprived of membership in the society.

   8) Any undergraduate member who is expelled from the College shall be deprived of membership in
the Society.

   9) While connected with Williams College as an officer of instruction or administration, any graduate of
Williams College who is a member of another chapter of Phi Beta Kappa shall be considered a regular
member of the Williams chapter.

   10) While connected with Williams College as professor, associate professor or assistant professor, or
an officer of administration, any member of another chapter of Phi Beta Kappa shall have all the privileges
of the Williams chapter, including holding office and voting. While connected with Williams College, any
other officer of instruction or administration who is a member of another chapter shall have all the privi-
leges of the Williams chapter, except holding office and voting.

Awarding of Degrees

   By vote of the Trustees, the degree of Bachelor of Arts is conferred at Commencement upon students
who have completed the requirements as to courses and grades to the satisfaction of the Faculty, have paid
all College dues and other College charges, and have returned all books belonging to the Library. The right
to a degree may, however, be forfeited by misconduct at any time prior to the conferring of the degree. No
degree in absentia will be conferred except by special vote of the Trustees on petition presented to the
Dean.

Graduation with Distinction

   The Faculty will recommend to the Trustees that the degree of Bachelor of Arts with distinction be con-
ferred upon those members of the graduating class who have passed all Winter Study Projects and obtained
a four year average in the top:

       35% of the graduating class -- Bachelor of Arts cum laude or higher
       15% of the graduating class -- Bachelor of Arts magna cum laude or higher

        2% of the graduating class -- Bachelor of Arts summa cum laude

ACADEMIC ADVISING

   A variety of academic advice and counsel is provided to students during the course of their undergradu-
ate education. Instructors, departmental and administrative officers, and some special programs are avail-
able to help students explore and develop their academic interests and talents and take advantage of aca-
demic opportunities available through the College.

   In the first year each student is assigned an academic advisor from the faculty or staff. This advisor
discusses course choices and academic requirements with the student. The Associate Dean for Academic
Programs coordinates this advising program, reviews the academic progress of individual students,
and--when appropriate--calls students in to discuss their situations.

   In the sophomore year, students may seek advice from deans, former advisors, and instructors, along
with preprofessional and other special advisors (see page 412). Sophomores are also encouraged to discuss
major options and requirements with faculty members from departments and programs in which they have
an interest before declaring a major in the spring semester.

   The student-run Senior Advisor program provides additional advice and information for sophomore
students in particular, as well as for first-year students and any others with questions about particular
courses, departments, majors, or areas of study. Senior Advisors are nominated by departments and pro-
grams from among the year's senior majors. During the course of the year the Senior Advisors hold several
Course and Majors Fairs, maintain regular office hours at the student centers, keep informed about any
changes in faculty and curriculum in their departments, and generally make themselves available for con-
sultation by students.

   In the junior and senior years students are advised by faculty from their major departments or programs.
Each department or program determines its own advising system for its majors, although chairs are regu-
larly available for consultation.

ACADEMIC ASSISTANCE
   Additional programs of academic assistance are also available through the Dean's Office. After confer-

ring with the instructor, a student needing extra help in a particular course may request a tutor recom-
mended to the Dean's Office by the department; costs of this tutoring are covered by the Dean's Office.
Students seeking to improve their writing skills in any course may take advantage of the Writing Workshop.
Trained and supervised by a coordinator, student writing tutors provide help with problems on papers al-
ready corrected and with drafts of papers in progress. The Math and Science Resource Center, a drop-in
help center staffed by student assistants, is also available to students of Chemistry 153, 155, 156, 201 and
202, Biology 101, 102 and 202, Mathematics 103, 104 and 105, Statistics 101, and Physics 131, 132, 141
and 142.

EXCHANGE AND STUDY ABROAD
   Advising of exchange students and of Williams students wishing to study abroad in the junior year is

coordinated by the Dean's Office. Special orientation and information meetings are held during the fall
semester for new students and for students wishing to study abroad. Orientation and counseling of interna-
tional students is arranged by the International Student Advisor in the Dean's Office.

POSTGRADUATE AND PROFESSIONAL STUDY
   For advice about planning for postgraduate opportunities, students may consult departmental advisors,

ACADEMIC HONESTY

   All students are expected to be familiar with the Williams College Honor Code and to reaffirm their
commitment to the Statement of Academic Honesty by signing an Honor Code Pledge at the beginning of
each academic year. The Honor Code covers all aspects of academic honesty, including the writing of pa-
pers and laboratory reports as well as all quizzes, homework assignments, hour tests, and examinations.

Statement of Academic Honesty

   As an institution fundamentally concerned with the free exchange of ideas, Williams College has al-
ways depended on the academic integrity of each of its members. In the spirit of this free exchange, the
students and faculty of Williams recognize the necessity and accept the responsibility for academic hones-
ty.

   A student who enrolls at the College thereby agrees to respect and acknowledge the research and ideas
of others in his or her work and to abide by those regulations governing work stipulated by the instructor.
Any student who breaks these regulations, misrepresents his or her own work, or collaborates in the mis-
representation of another's work has committed a serious violation of this agreement.

   Students and faculty are to report violations and alleged violations of this agreement. Such reports are to
be submitted to the Student Honor Committee, consisting of eight student members of the joint Faculty-
Student Honor System-Discipline Committee. This committee is responsible for determining the guilt or
innocence of the accused person or persons, and for recommending appropriate punishments to the Dean.
A committee of faculty members to be designated by the Faculty will sit with the Student Honor Commit-
tee in an advisory capacity.

   A quorum of three-quarters shall be required for the Committee to meet. A vote of guilty by at least
three-quarters of those present is necessary for conviction. A recommendation for dismissal must be made
by unanimous vote of those present, and shall be carried out only with the assent of the President of the
College.

   The Committee is responsible for informing the student body of the meaning and implications of this
statement. The aforementioned faculty committee shall be responsible for informing faculty members of
the meaning and implications of this statement.

   Any amendments to this statement must be made through a student referendum in which two-thirds of
the student body votes, and in which two-thirds of those voting vote for the amendment. These alterations
must be ratified by the Faculty.

                                                                                                                                                       Adopted 1971

Guidelines

   Instructors are encouraged to submit to the Honor Committee a written statement defining how the
Statement of Academic Honesty applies to their courses or laboratories, and to explain such guidelines to
their students. Instructors may set any type of final examination or hour test, ranging from closed-book,
alternate-seating classroom exercises to open-book, "take-home" examinations or papers, and any require-
ments for laboratory exercises. Some instructors encourage cooperation among students but others do not.
If a student is unsure how the Honor Code applies in a particular situation, it is ultimately the student's
responsibility to find out from his or her professor, or from a member of the Honor Committee, how the
Honor Code applies in that situation. An open and highly individualized system can last only as long as
both the students and the faculty work together to create a true academic community.

   In written material, students are expected to avoid the possibility of even unintentional plagiarism by
acknowledging the sources of their work. Careful observance of accepted standards of reference and
attribution is required. The basic rules are summarized below. Students are further advised to consult a
recognized style manual to learn how to acknowledge sources correctly. While academic honesty does not
demand a footnote on statements of common fact, it does require that a student provide clear footnotes or
other appropriate documentation and give credit in the bibliography to ideas, interpretations, and facts that
particular sources have contributed to the student's final work.

                                                ­ 22 ­
                                                                                  Academic Honesty
   The basic rules of attribution require that:
   1) A direct quotation (whether a single word or a phrase, sentence, paragraph, or series of paragraphs)
must always be identified by quotation marks, by indenting and single spacing, or by reduced type size of
the quoted material, and a note must be used to state the exact source.
   2) A paraphrase of the work of another must be acknowledged as such by a note stating the source.
   3) Indebtedness to the specific ideas of others, or the summarizing of several pages, even though ex-
pressed in different words, must be acknowledged by a note stating the source.
   4) Every instance of the use of another student's laboratory reports, computer programs, or other mate-
rial must be acknowledged by a note.
   5) Even the use of a student's own previous work must be acknowledged; thus, a student must obtain
the prior permission of all instructors concerned before submitting substantially the same paper in more
than one course.
Procedures for Alleged Violations
   Students or faculty members who have discovered a violation or a possible violation of the Honor Code
should report it promptly either to the faculty chair or to the student chair of the Honor Committee. As
soon as possible after receiving a report of an alleged Honor Code violation, the Student Honor Committee
will convene to hear the case. The person bringing the charge will present the evidence to the Committee in
the presence of the accused student, who may then speak in his or her own defense both with and without
the accuser present. After the accused student has left the proceedings, the Committee will determine inno-
cence or guilt and, if the latter, will recommend an appropriate penalty to the Dean. Depending on the
circumstances of the violation, penalties then imposed by the Dean may include such possibilities as a
directed grade of E in the course, disciplinary probation, or temporary or permanent separation from the
College.

EXPENSES

   Within the limits of available funds, Williams endeavors to offer its educational opportunities to all who
qualify for admission. Income from its endowment and annual contributions from its alumni and friends
have enabled Williams to keep its tuition at about half the actual cost per student to the College.

Payment of Term Bills

   College bills for one-half of all tuition and fees are mailed to parents twice a year (in mid-July and mid-
December) for payment on August 15 and January 15; a fee of $250 may be charged if payment is re-
ceived after these dates. Term bills must be paid before the semester's classes begin or the student will not
be permitted to enroll in classes or remain in residence at the College. Billing statements for accounts with
outstanding balances or current activity will be issued monthly and are due upon receipt.

   All outstanding balances must be paid to the Bursar, and all books and materials must be returned to the
Library, before the student is entitled to a degree or a transcript.

College Bills

College charges for tuition, room, board, and fees for the academic year 2001-2002 are as follows:

Tuition                                                              $25,352

Other Expenses

Based on a study of expenses reported by financial aid students, a minimum normal budget for a college

year at Williams includes additional expenses estimated as follows:

Books                                                                600

Estimated year's total, exclusive of travel expenses**               $33,870

________________

*A student activities fee for support of non-athletic student organizations is charged to all un-
dergraduates as part of the College term bill. It includes, for example, subscriptions to the col-
lege newspaper, and admission to most drama productions and musical events on campus.

**Travel expenses are not included in figures listed above. The cost of two round-trip tickets is
added into each successful financial aid candidate's award.

Additional Items

   A House Maintenance Fee of $50 per year is charged to upperclassmen as a part of the College term bill.
It is used to provide a base for the social and cultural programs of each residential House and to meet any
unusual maintenance expenses for the Houses. First-year class dues of $50 are charged at the rate of $25
each semester.

   The Commonwealth of Massachusetts requires that, effective September 1, 1989, all full- and part-time
students enrolled in institutions of higher education located in Massachusetts must participate in a qualify-
ing student health insurance plan offered by the institution or in another health insurance program affording
comparable coverage.

   The College offers a qualifying student health insurance plan to all students. The College will allow
students to waive participation in this insurance plan if the student will certify in writing, before the begin-
ning of the academic year, that the coverage offered by an alternative program chosen by the student is
comparable to that of the qualifying program available at the College.

   Information about the student health insurance program offered by the College, including current details
of its cost, is mailed to all students each year. Additional information about this program or about the Com-
monwealth's requirements is available through the Thompson Health Center at (413) 597-3166.

   Late registration or enrollment entails a charge of $25. There is a $5 per day processing fee for any
course change cards or 5th course grading option choices accepted after announced deadlines. There is a
charge of $25 for a lost key.

Payment of College Bills

   A non-refundable deposit of $200 to reserve a place in the first-year class is required from all admitted
candidates (except certain financial aid recipients) by the Candidate's Reply Date of May 1. The deposit
appears as a credit on the term bill rendered in July.

   College tuition statements for one half of all fees are mailed to the billing name(s) and addresses on
record twice a year--in July, payable by August 15, and in December, payable by January 15. Payment
may be made by check, money order, or wire transfer. Credit cards can not be used to pay tuition and fees.
A fee of $250 may be charged if payment is received after these dates.

   Students who receive a scholarship(s) that was not awarded through the Williams Office of Financial
Aid must complete a Scholarship Information Sheet and mail it to the Bursar Office by early June. Provi-
sional credit will be posted to the semester bill for the following; anticipated disbursements of direct loans
for which a promissory note has been signed and returned to the Office of Financial Aid, anticipated dis-
bursements of outside loans approved by the lender, outside scholarships which have not yet been received
and applied against the student account and any remaining semester contract amount for the Ten Month
Payment Plan. If actual payment for the above provisional credits are not received by the date anticipated,
the provisional credit will expire and be removed from the student's account creating a balance due.

   A check returned to the College for any reason such as "account closed" or "insufficient funds" will be
charged to the student's term bill and a "return check charge" of $20.00 will be assessed. The College
reserves the right to require that payment be made in the form of cash, cashier check or money order.

   Students with bills still unpaid at the start of the semester who have not made satisfactory arrangements
with the Bursar will not be permitted to enroll in classes or remain in residence at the College. Furthermore,
if arrangements for payment after the start of the semester are approved by the Bursar and these expected
payments are not made on time, students may not be allowed to enroll for the next semester.

   If efforts by the Bursar's Office to collect the monies owed are unsuccessful, the account could be
placed with a collection agency, and if the delinquency persists, the College's experience with the account
may be reported to a national credit bureau. It is the policy of the College to pass on to the debtor all reason-
able costs associated with collection of the debt through a collection agency. If at any time the student
believes information concerning payment delinquency is inaccurate, he/she should notify the College c/o
The Bursar's Office, P.O. Box 406, Williamstown, MA 01267.

   There are several loan options available to parents through outside sources. These include the MassPlan
Loan through the Massachusetts Educational Financing Authority and the Federal Plus Loan Program.
Information on these loans can be found in the brochure A Guide to Borrowing for College.

   Williams also offers an installment plan, administered by Key Education Resources, whereby the yearly
charges are paid in 10 equal installments starting in June, with no interest charges. There are no income
restrictions. Monthly payments will be the total cost (less any scholarships, Stafford or parent loans) di-
vided by 10. There is an administration fee for this program. Information on this program is sent each
spring to all parents or can be obtained by calling Key Education Resources at (800) 539-5363.

   Students who are considering withdrawal from the College should be sure to meet with the Dean's Of-
fice, the Financial Aid Office and the Bursar's Office before rendering their final decision.

   *Housing and miscellaneous fees are not pro-rated after the start of classes. Coverage under the Col-
lege's student health insurance plan generally terminates on the date of withdrawal. The unused portion
will be credited to the student's account.

   For students receiving Title IV federal funds, repayment of federal funds on a pro-rata basis will be
determined up to the 60% point of the semester per federal regulation. Please note that withdrawal late in
the semester could result in a balance owed to the College for federal aid that must be returned to the pro-
gram.

   Repayment is first made to federal programs in the following order: Unsubsidized Federal Direct Staf-
ford Loan, Subsidized Federal Direct Stafford Loan, Federal Perkins Loan, Federal Direct PLUS Loan,
Federal Pell Grant, Federal SEOG, Federal SSIG, Robert Byrd Scholarship. Any remaining credit balance
reimburses other sources in the following order: Williams scholarship, other scholarships, other parent loan
programs and family. Specific examples are available on request.

   The College offers, through A.W.G. Dewar, Inc., a Tuition Refund Plan which supplements the Wil-
liams College Refund Policy in certain circumstances. A brochure describing this plan will be sent to you
under separate cover, or you may contact Dewar, Inc. directly at (781) 380-8770.

Financial Aid

   Williams has a substantial financial aid program to promote the greatest possible diversity in the social
and economic background of the student population. Students interested in financial aid policies and pro-
cedures should consult Williams College Prospectus, the Student Handbook, or the Office of Financial Aid.

Distinctive Undergraduate Scholarships

   Williams College, through the Office of Financial Aid, administers over three hundred endowed schol-
arships, all of which are based on demonstrated need. Limited space prohibits the complete listing of these,

PREPARATION FOR GRADUATE AND PROFESSIONAL STUDY

   Although the principle function of Williams is to provide a broad and solid liberal education that will be
of lasting value no matter what the vocation a student may pursue, the College recognizes that no funda-
mental conflict exists between a liberal education and preparation for a professional career; on the contrary,
a foundation of liberal studies increases professional competence in any field. A student should plan his or
her program of study so as to provide as much educational breadth and enrichment as circumstances per-
mit. A student should also give serious consideration to post-college plans early in the college career.

   Each departmental major provides the foundation for graduate study in the corresponding field. Stu-
dents should consult the departmental programs listed under "Courses of Instruction" for requirements,
and for special advice regarding preparation for graduate study. Students should also consult with the ap-
propriate departmental chairman or the special faculty advisors as early as possible in their college careers
to make certain they have taken all the necessary factors into consideration.

   Particular attention is called to the foreign language requirements of graduate study. Candidates for the
degree of doctor of philosophy at almost all graduate schools are required to have a reading knowledge of
both French and German. Under certain circumstances another language may replace French. Many grad-
uate schools require also a knowledge of Latin for students of English and Romantic Languages. Candi-
dates for the master of arts degree are required to have a reading knowledge of either French or German.
Students should consult departmental chairmen or the faculty advisors for the requirements in specific
fields of study.

Visual Arts

   Although requirements set by various art and architectural schools differ, the basic requirements for a
variety of visual arts fields are summarized in the pamphlet "Guide to the Studio Art Major," available
from the Department of Art office in the W.L.S. Spencer Studio Art Building or the Office of Admission. A
summary of the requirements of all art and architecture schools offering Master of Arts and/or Master of
Fine Arts is available in the bulletin of the College Art Association (CAA), "MFA Programs in the Visual
Arts: A Directory." According to the current edition:

      Admission to MFA programs should be based on the nature, extent, and quality of undergraduate
      preparation, including courses in studio, art history, and other academic subjects. Quality of studio
      preparation can best be judged on the basis of careful evaluation of work done at the undergraduate
      level; therefore, a portfolio review (usually represented by slides) is regarded as an absolute necessity
      in the admission process.

         While many institutions consider the BFA to be the standard qualifying degree, the fact that the
      applicant has attended a BA- or BS-granting institution does not necessarily rule out acceptance in
      most MFA programs. Whatever the undergraduate degree, most entering graduate students tend not
      to be completely prepared in one or more of the areas cited above and will require remedial make-up
      work...

        Some institutions use the MA degree as a qualifying prerequisite for final acceptance into MFA
      candidacy, allowing the student to apply the earned credits toward the higher degree. (pp. 139-40)
   Students are advised to take into consideration not only current minimum requirements but also recom-
mended courses. A summary of the essential information required for curricular planning may be found in
the "Guide to the Studio Art Major" and in the pamphlet "Choosing First Year Courses."

Business Administration

   Williams offers no special course in preparation for a business career for graduate study in business
administration. The qualities which are important to succeed in business, and which graduate business
schools are seeking, are an ability to reason and to express oneself logically and clearly in written and oral
exposition; a good understanding of the physical and social environment in which business operates; a
solid background in quantitative skills; and an appreciation of human motivations and goals. This means
that a broad liberal arts program is preferred over a highly specialized one.

   Within this broad prescription it may be desirable to have at least one year of economics and one year of
mathematics (including statistics and calculus). For those interested in production management or opera-

                                                ­ 29 ­
Preparation for Graduate and Professional Study

tion research, additional work in any quantitative course and/or a course in computer science would be
helpful.

   But there is no particular major at Williams that is designated as preparation for the business profession.
Students interested in futures in business are encouraged to undertake a broad educational program in the
arts, humanities, and sciences. It is important that one gets involved in extra-curricular activities and that
one holds a leadership position.

   Students interested in graduate work in business administration should consult with Fatma Kassamali at
the Office of Career Counseling.

Engineering

   Many Williams graduates enjoy productive careers in engineering, applied science, or technical man-
agement. Successful engineers need to be able to communicate effectively, reason logically, and under-
stand both the technical and the social dimensions of a problem. A prospective engineer should pursue a
broad liberal arts education at Williams, with a strong grounding in basic science and mathematics. Most
often he or she will complete a Williams B.A. majoring in one of the sciences (usually physics, chemistry,
mathematics, or computer science) and then go to an engineering school for professional training leading
to a master's degree or doctorate in engineering. While it may be necessary to make up a few undergradu-
ate engineering courses, the opportunities at Williams to participate in scientific research and the breadth of
a liberal arts education prepare Williams graduates to succeed in engineering graduate study and in their
careers.

   The booklet "Choosing First Year Courses" contains a list of Williams courses recommended to pro-
spective engineers. Students interested in engineering also have the opportunity to take undergraduate en-
gineering courses at other institutions. Williams maintains formal exchange programs with California
Institute of Technology, Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth College, and Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute. Williams students can arrange to study at one of these leading engineering schools for one or two
semesters, typically during the junior year. Individual arrangements may be possible at other engineering
schools. The 3-2 program offers another opportunity to study engineering at the undergraduate level. For
information about these opportunities, please see the sections of this catalog titled "Exchange Programs"
and "Combined Program in Liberal Arts and Engineering."

   The pre-engineering advisor, Professor Sarah Bolton, will be happy to help plan course selections and to
discuss the possible paths to a career in engineering.

Law

   Williams graduates regularly proceed directly to law schools on the strength of their liberal education.
No special courses are presented for pre-law students.

   Students intending to study law should consult with the Pre-Law Advisor, Mary M. Winston, at the
Office of Career Counseling.

The Health Professions

   Although a majority of students consider themselves "pre-med", many actually pursue careers in public
health, physical therapy, and dentistry (to name a few). Consequently, the Health Professions Office re-
cently expanded its services to include resources and information on a variety of careers in healthcare.
General information is available online at http://www.williams.edu/admin-depts/hp. However, it is not wise
to rely solely on this site throughout the four years spent at Williams.

   Students interested in the health professions should pursue a broad liberal arts education at Williams.
With early planning, it is possible to choose from any number of majors, while still meeting the require-
ments for a health professions program. And, since program requirements vary from school to school, stu-
dents are advised to consult with the Health Professions Advisor to determine the required and recom-
mended courses for specific areas of interest.

   The "Choosing First Year Courses" booklet contains a list of Williams Courses required for students
interested in applying to medical school. The courses are similar to those required for other health profes-
sions, but be sure you're taking the correct courses for your program by contacting Susan Salko, Health
Professions Advisor, in the Thompson Biology Lab Building.

                                             Preparation for Graduate and Professional Study

College Teaching/Research

   The most important qualification for careers in teaching at any level is proficiency in a major. Students
interested in college teaching and research should prepare themselves at Williams for graduate work in the
subjects of their choice, whereas those interested in teaching at the elementary or secondary level should
plan to meet certification while an undergraduate or to proceed from a sound undergraduate major to a
Master of Arts in Teaching program in a reputable graduate school. (Some states and many private schools
appoint teachers without certification.) Opportunities are available during Winter Study for teaching in-
ternships at the elementary and secondary level. Certification is not required if one is interested in teaching
in private schools.

   Students interested in college teaching should consult with the chairs of the departments in which they
intend to major. Those interested in teaching at the elementary and secondary level should consult with the
Director of the Program in Teaching or the Office of Career Counseling.

Teaching Directly after Williams

   The most important qualification for careers in teaching at any level is proficiency in a major. Students
interested in teaching at the elementary or secondary level directly after graduation from Williams should
consult with either Mary Winston or Fatma Kassamali at the Office of Career Counseling. Certification is
not required to teach in a private school nor is it required to teach in the Teach for America program or in
similar programs. The Office of Career Counseling has a very active on­campus educational recruiting
program that includes many private schools as well as Teach for America. The program begins in the fall
and continues through the spring.

Religious Study

   Students intending to go to theological seminary are not required to pursue a special course. Various
majors are acceptable and most liberal arts courses can be useful to the prospective minister, priest, rabbi,
or teacher of religion. However, given the increasing variety of complexity of post-graduate vocational
choices in the field of religion, it is strongly recommended that the preseminarian secure a basic foundation
in the study of religion while an undergraduate. Students contemplating advanced academic work in
religion preparatory to a career of teaching and scholarship should give serious consideration to concentrat-
ing their undergraduate studies in religion. Ordination requirements for various denominations vary wide-
ly depending on the particular religious tradition; in some cases it may be possible for the prospective min-
ister, rabbi, or religious professional to make progress on certain academic requirements or other creden-
tials during the undergraduate years. Students with such vocational interests are urged to make themselves
known to one of the chaplains (or, where appropriate, one of the local clergy) as soon as these interests
begin to come into focus.

   Anyone interested in graduate programs in religion should consult with the faculty advisor in that field.

GRADUATE PROGRAMS AT WILLIAMS

Master of Arts in Development Economics

   The Center for Development Economics, which opened at Williams College in 1960 with the support of
a grant from the Ford Foundation, offers an intensive one-year program in economic analysis and quantita-
tive techniques leading to the degree of Master of Arts in Development Economics.

   The program is specifically designed for economists from developing countries who are already em-
barked on professional careers in public agencies. It includes required courses in development economics,
international trade and finance, monetary and fiscal policy, econometrics, and public finance. Center Fel-
lows choose among seminars in such fields as open-economy macroeconomics, environmental econom-
ics, and economic transition.

   Fellows are normally nominated by the public agencies from which they will be on leave. A candidate
must have a B.A. or B. Sc. degree of honors quality in Economics, have two or more years of relevant
work experience, and have an effective command of spoken and written English.

   Juniors and seniors majoring in economics or political economy who have special interest in economic
development or in a particular area of the world may, with the consent of the Chair of the Center and of the
individual instructor, satisfy some of their degree requirements by taking courses at the Center.

   All communications relating to the degree of Master of Arts in Development Economics should be ad-
dressed to the CDE, Assistant Director, 1065 Main Street, Williams College, Williamstown, Massachusetts
01267, or e-mail cde@williams.edu.

Master of Arts in the History of Art

   In cooperation with the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute, Williams College offers a two-year
course of study leading to the degree of Master of Arts in the History of Art. The objective of the program
is to offer to a small number of students a thorough professional preparation for careers in teaching and
museums, and to enable them to pursue further research whether independently or at other institutions of-
fering higher degrees. The curriculum consists of seminars in art historical subjects and an intensive study
of foreign languages in the context of the general literature of art. Problems of criticism, connoisseurship,
and conservation arising from the study of original works of art are fundamental to the program, and op-
portunities are provided for practical experience in museum work at the Clark Art Institute , the Williams
College Museum of Art, and the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art. The study of primary ma-
terials is further extended by field trips to other collections. The degree is normally awarded after two years
of resident graduate study. To earn the degree, students must take ten courses, at least six must be graduate
seminars (including 504). In connection with the preparation of a paper for the Graduate Symposium, stu-
dents will register for an eleventh course (ArtH 509), to be graded pass/fail, in their fourth semester. A
demonstration of proficiency in reading two foreign languages is required. Of these two, German is re-
quired, and French is recommended. In January of the first year, students participate in a European study
trip with a member of the faculty; in January of the second year, students must complete a Qualifying Pa-
per. In addition to all course work, students must, at the end of the second year, either pass an oral examina-
tion in a declared field of concentration or present a shortened version of the Qualifying Paper in a graduate
symposium to be held in late May. To enter the program a successful applicant must have been awarded
the degree of Bachelor of Arts or its equivalent from an accredited institution. An undergraduate major in
art is not required for acceptance to the program.

   For further information, write: The Director, Graduate Program in the History of Art, Box 8, Williams-
town, Massachusetts 01267, telephone (413)458-9545, or email gradart@williams.edu.

   UNITED COLLEGE, CHINESE UNIVERSITY OF HONG KONG. Begun in 1961, this two-year fellowship is offered
to a member of the graduating class for teaching English and possibly other subjects at United College, one
of three sister colleges comprising the Chinese University of Hong Kong. The appointee, known as a
Teaching Fellow or Tutor, also studies Chinese (Mandarin or Cantonese) and selected aspects of Chinese
culture. Students are chosen by a selection committee, chaired by Professor Crane. Interested students
should contact Professor Crane for application forms. Deadline November 30th.

   SUN YAT-SEN UNIVERSITY OF MEDICAL SCIENCES, GUANGZHOU. Supported by alumni, the College, and the
trustees of the Lingnan Foundation, this one-year fellowship is awarded to a member of the graduating class
for teaching English language and literature to doctors and staff and for continuing study of Chinese lan-
guage (Mandarin or Cantonese) and culture. Students are chosen by a selection committee, chaired by Pro-
fessor Crane. Interested students should contact Professor Crane for application forms. Deadline November
30th.

Teaching Assistantship Program for Graduates in France

   Each year the Department chooses one or sometimes two students to participate in a French Government
assistantship program. The Williams student chosen spends the year following graduation teaching English
at a lycée in the Paris area and is the recipient of a French government stipend. Interested students must
apply to the Department early in the second semester. Priority will be given to French majors.

 COURSES OF INSTRUCTION 2001-2002

 COURSE NUMBERING SYSTEM
    Courses designated by a single number are semester courses.
    Year courses are designated by an odd number and an even number joined by a hyphen; the work

 of the two semesters constitutes an integral, indivisible course. Therefore, if a student does not pass
 the second half of a year-long course, he or she forfeits credit for the first half and incurs a deficiency
 as a result of the forfeiture. Students who register for a year course are required to do both semesters
 of that course within the same academic year.

    In some departments, course numbers have special meanings that are explained in their listings.
    The (F) or (S) following a course's number indicates the semester, fall or spring, in which the
 course will be offered.

 REGISTRATION REMINDERS:
    All on-campus students must register through SELFREG, the online registration system.

 1) A course in which registration is deemed insufficient may be withdrawnatthe beginning of the semester
    without previous notice.

 2) An instructor has the right to: a) require a student to drop a course if the student does not attend the first
    scheduled meeting of that course; b) refuse permission to add a course if a student has not attended the
    first scheduled meeting of that course.

 3 a) First-year students may take no more than one course with the same course prefix, nor more than two
       in one department, in a semester.

   b) Sophomores may take no more than two courses with the same course prefix, nor more than three in
       one department, in a semester.

   c) Sophomores may take no more than three courses with the same course prefix, nor more than four in
       one department, during the full year.

   d) A student may take no more than a total of five courses with the same course prefix, nor more than
       eight in one department, during the first two years.

   e) Any exception to the above early concentration rule may be requested by a petition (goldenrod) to the
       Committee on Academic Standing (C.A.S.) filed at the time of registration.

 4) An incoming junior must declare a major by filing a "Major Declaration Form" during preregistration.
    A current junior or senior may change or add a major by filing a "Major Declaration Form" subject to
    the approval of the C.A.S.

 5) Declaration of a double major is subject to the approval of the C.A.S. Contract majors are ineligible for a
    second major.

 6) Students wishing to undertake an independent study must submit a petition (green) to the C.A.S. before
    the start of the semester in which a student plans to take the independent study.

 7) Forms for any of the above requests may be obtained at the Registrar's Office.
 8) When choosing a course cross-listed in two or more subjects, students should specify which designation

    they wish to have recorded--at the time they register for that course.
 9) Courses listed as (Not offered 2001-2002) normally will be offered in the following academic year.
10) Courses normally meet three times a week in fifty-minute periods, twice a week in seventy-five-min-

     ute periods, or once a week for 150 minutes as indicated within the course description. The days of
     the week that courses meet are represented by the first letter of each day. For example, M for Monday
     (except that R is used for Thursday).

 CLUSTERS
    Both faculty and students are sometimes eager to work in areas that cut across departmental and

 program lines. Interdepartmental clusters are a new initiative designed around such areas of inter-
 est. Clusters are listed in the catalog in alphabetical order. Current clusters are Jewish Studies, Latin
 American Studies, Leadership Studies, Materials Science Studies, and Performance Studies. Clus-
 ters are for educational purposes only, and will not appear on a student's transcript.

 THE CRITICAL REASONING AND ANALYTICAL SKILLS (CRAAS) INITIATIVE
    To one degree or another, every class at Williams goes beyond its subject--be it mathematics,

 Machiavelli, or modernism--to teach intellectual skills that have wide application in other fields as
 well as outside of the academy: scientific reckoning, expository writing, rhetorical analysis, oral
 presentation, and so on.

    Courses offered under the CRAAS initiative--those with a tilde symbol (~) following the course
 title--foreground such analytical skills. While each CRAAS class covers a different topic, all are

Courses of Instruction

aimed particularly at developing the processes necessary for excellence in a range of fields: tech-
niques for analyzing ideas, data, texts or artworks; approaches to interpreting, synthesizing, and
developing arguments; strategies for presenting ideas and results.

   CRAAS classes typically emphasize the practices of meta-analysis--self-criticism, editing, and
revision--with the goal of constant improvement. Many classes feature peer tutoring, small group
work, and intensive one-on-one engagement with the professor. Students should leave a CRAAS
course with a substantially heightened ability to approach problems, analyze texts, and craft argu-
ments in whatever discipline they may go on to explore.

   A few CRAAS courses are restricted to advanced students, but the majority are open to all, and
some are specifically targeted for first year students. Most have strictly limited enrollment. Because
these classes cultivate the general strategies of effective scholarship, students are encouraged to
consider taking a CRAAS course early in their academic careers.

   A list of CRAAS courses offered in 2001-2002 is on page 321.

PEOPLES AND CULTURES DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENT
   An asterisk following a course title indicates that the course may be used to meet the Peoples and

Cultures Distribution Requirement. A list of courses offered in 2001-2002 which meet the require-
ment is on pages 322-324.

                                         *****

STUDENT-INITIATED COURSES
   A Student-Initiated Course is one proposed and organized by students and sponsored by the In-

terdepartmental Program for Experimental and Cross-Disciplinary Studies. In such courses, the
students carry a heavy burden of the leadership in proposing requirements, selecting material to be
covered and conducting discussions, as well as in conceiving the basic outline of the course. The
instructor supervises the syllabus, student participation, and performance, and is responsible for
evaluation of the students.

  1) In order to provide for planning, students should discuss plans for Student-Initiated Courses in
      the coming year at the beginning of the previous spring semester.

  2) Interested students should propose Student-Initiated Courses to the Interdepartmental Pro-
      gram for Experimental and Cross-Disciplinary Studies and to a faculty instructor by the fol-
      lowing deadlines:
         z fall semester courses: before the end of spring registration
         z spring semester courses: before the end of fall semester

  3) Proposals for Student-Initiated Courses should include descriptions of the aims and antici-
      pated techniques of the course, as well as a statement concerning any anticipated constraints
      on enrollment. Enrollment might be based on such educational considerations as the student's
      background of knowledge, individual potential for growth and development, maximum feasi-
      ble size of discussion groups, and availability of special materials or resources.

  4) All Student-Initiated Course proposals, including criteria for enrollment, must be approved
      by:
      a) a faculty member who agrees to be the instructor of the course;
      b) the Interdepartmental Program for Experimental and Cross-Disciplinary Studies;
      c) the Committee on Educational Policy (C.E.P.).
      Normally, each section of a Student-Initiated Course will be limited to 15 students.

  5) A student may enroll in no more than one Student-Initiated Course each semester. No more
      than six such courses may be credited toward a Williams B.A.

  6) At the end of each Student-Initiated Course, the faculty instructor files with the program and
      with the C.E.P. a report on the course's content, a summary syllabus, and an evaluation.

                                         *****

WRITING-INTENSIVE COURSES
   Courses designated as "writing-intensive"--those with a plus symbol (+) following the course

title--stress the process of learning to write effectively. Such courses include a substantial amount
of writing (cumulatively, at least 20 pages), usually divided into several discrete assignments. Nor-
mally, at least one of these assignments is returned for revision and resubmission. Instructors pay
close attention to matters of punctuation, grammar, style, and the construction of arguments when
assigning grades to written assignments, and these issues are further pursued in class discussions
and individual meetings. A list of writing-intensive courses offered in 2001-2002 is on page 325.

STUDY AWAY FROM WILLIAMS
   Students may receive credit for work completed at other institutions or programs. Applications

for study elsewhere require the approval of the chair of the student's major, the Dean's Office, and
the Committee on Academic Standing. Students studying away during the junior year should have
already completed the physical education requirement and at least two courses in each division to-
ward the divisional distribution requirement.

                      THE TUTORIAL PROGRAM AT WILLIAMS

   In the fall of 1988, Williams introduced a tutorial program. Students are invited to examine the
tutorial offerings carefully in order to understand fully the substantive content of each tutorial and
its mode of operation. A list of the tutorials to be offered in 2001-2002 is included in this section,
and a complete description of each may be found in the relevant department's section of this catalo-
g. No student is required to take a tutorial, but any student who has the appropriate qualifications is
invited to do so.

   While the details of the functioning of tutorials will vary in order to accommodate the diverse
subject matter of the various departments of the College, there are important common characteris-
tics to all tutorials.

   Tutorials place a much greater weight on student participation than do regular courses or even
small seminars. In general, each tutorial will consist of two students meeting with the tutor for one
hour or 75 minutes each week. At each meeting one student will make a prepared presentation--
read a prepared essay, work a set of problems, report on laboratory exercises, examine a work of art,
etc.--and the other student and the tutor will question, probe, push the student who is presenting his
or her work about various aspects of the presentation. The student then must respond on the spot to
these probings and questions. A tutorial is directly concerned with teaching students about argu-
ments, about arriving at and defending a position, and about responding quickly to suggestions and
questions. This kind of exercise will help the student gain insight and understanding of what knowl-
edge is and how it is accumulated, and how there can be different interpretations and different un-
derstandings of the same phenomenon. The student presentation drives the tutorial, and the presen-
tation by the student obviously means that student preparation and response are crucial to an effec-
tive tutorial. The presentation is based on assigned and suggested reading and other work (laborato-
ry, art work, theatre, etc.) by the tutor.

   In some tutorials both students will make a shorter presentation each week and both will react and com-
ment on the other's presentation. In all cases the tutorial is built around presentations by students.

   In most instances there will be no more than 10 students in a tutorial. In the first and last week of
the semester, the whole group may meet together, and in the 10 weeks in-between students will meet
in pairs with their tutor. Students should therefore expect to make 5 presentations that occupy about
an hour, or 10 that require one half hour. Assignments will be designed such that the student should,
in general, be required to spend no more time over a week preparing for the tutorial than for a con-
ventional course. It is likely, however, that as students begin their first tutorial course, they will have
to spend somewhat more time preparing for it than for other courses. Once the routine becomes
more established and familiar, the tutorial is expected to require about the same total time per week
as does a regular course. The student should appreciate, however, that the weekly tutorials require
exceptional regularity and on-time performance.

   Grading, testing, and similar details will be described by the tutor at the first meeting of the entire group.
   Drops and Adds: Because of the particular arrangements of the tutorial, it is necessary to limit
adds to the first week of classes only. No adds can be made after that time. Spaces in tutorials are
limited, and a late drop may unfairly deprive another student of an opportunity. Students are urged,
therefore, to think very carefully about their initial decisions.

PLEASE NOTE: Tutorials cannot be taken on a pass/fail grading basis.

   African and Middle-Eastern Studies is an interdisciplinary program focusing on the politics, so-
cieties, cultures, and historical development of the peoples of Africa and the Middle East. The pro-
gram offers a wide range of courses in the area, as well as opportunities to study abroad and possibi-
lities for graduate fellowships and careers.

   Students considering completing the concentration are urged to register with the chair of the pro-
gram during their sophomore year. Normally, students will be expected to take six courses from at
least three different departments. One of these courses should be from among the "Concepts
Courses" listed below. Four should be from the "Core Courses." The sixth course will be African
and Middle-Eastern Studies 401 or 402. In special cases the chair may permit substitution of an
approved winter study project, or work completed elsewhere, for one or more of the electives. Pro-
posals for honors work in African and Middle-Eastern Studies, normally involving at least a one
semester thesis and an oral examination, must be submitted in writing by the beginning of the senior
year and approved by the African and Middle-Eastern Studies Committee.

   Fulfillment of the requirements of the concentration will be recorded on the student's official
transcript.

   African-American Studies is an interdisciplinary program that examines the history, the cultures,
and the social and political experiences of people of African ancestry in the Western Hemisphere.
The program encourages students to take advantage of its interdisciplinary focus and to examine
the vibrant and varied intellectual traditions that constitute the study of the African Diaspora.

   All candidates for a concentration in African-American Studies must complete a total of five
courses: one United States subject, one Caribbean or South American, one African, and two electi-
ves. At least one of these courses must be in the performing or fine arts.

   Students may select their required courses from the following:

   One course in a United States or Canadian subject:

HONORS PROGRAM IN AFRICAN-AMERICAN STUDIES
   A candidate for honors in African-American Studies must maintain at least a B+ average in the

concentration and be admitted to candidacy by the program faculty. An honors candidate must com-
plete her/his project in a semester (and Winter Study). A candidate will enroll for either AAS 491 or
492 (and Winter Study) during her/his senior year to write a forty-page thesis or to do an equivalent
project in the performing and studio arts. A faculty advisor, in consultation with the chair, can
change the particulars of an honors project.
An honors project should demonstrate unusual creativity, depth, and intellectual rigor. A candidate
for honors is permitted and encouraged to pursue non-traditional projects, such as presentations in
the performing arts, visual arts, or creative writing, as well as more traditional interdisciplinary stu-
dies. The advisor will evaluate an honors project, and the program faculty will decide whether to
confer honors. A student wishing to become a candidate for honors in African-American Studies
should secure a faculty sponsor and inform the program chair in writing before spring registration
of her/his junior year.

AAS 491(F), 492(S) Senior Project
Non-honors candidates do a regular winter study project offered by the program or a "99." Candi-
dates for honors in African-American Studies must do W030 for the winter study period following
491 or prior to taking 492.

THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN STUDIES CONCENTRATION AND THE AMERICAN STUD-
IES MAJOR

   Several courses in African-American Studies count for credit in the American Studies major. There-
fore, students in American Studies can easily complete requirements for an African-American Studies
concentration by electing one course in an African subject and by taking African-American Studies 491.
Another three courses must be chosen which satisfy both American Studies and African-American
Studies requirements.

GENERAL PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
   The American Studies Program uses interdisciplinary approaches to develop students' under-

standing of the complexity of the culture(s) usually labeled "American." Examining history, litera-
ture, and other forms of expression, we explore the processes of cultural definition as contested by
diverse individuals and groups. We ask new questions about aspects of American life long taken for
granted; we also use American culture as a laboratory for testing classic and contemporary theories
about how cultures work.

NON-MAJORS, FIRST-YEAR STUDENTS, AND SOPHOMORES
   American Studies 201 is open to non-majors including first-year students with Advanced Place-

ment credit in American History. All elective courses are open to students who meet the require-
ments of the departments that sponsor those courses. American Studies 302 and 403 are open to
non-majors with permission of the instructor.

RATIONALE FOR COURSE NUMBERING
   The introductory course is offered at the 200 level to suggest the desirability of some preliminary

training in college-level history, literature, sociology, or political science. The intermediate course,
302, is offered primarily for juniors, although it is open to sophomores who have had 201 and will
be away from campus during the spring of their junior year. 300-level independent study courses
are offered to upperclass students. 403 is designed for senior majors; it, like 302, is open to students
who can demonstrate adequate preparation to the instructor.

THE MAJOR

   Required major courses:
      American Studies 201
      American Studies 302
      American Studies 403

   Elective courses:
      Eight courses: five should be chosen from one of the specialization fields listed below, the other three
      chosen from among any of the electives listed. Students are expected to take courses from at least two
      disciplines when choosing the courses that make up their specializations. Students are also required
      to take at least one course from a list of pre-1900 courses. Advanced Placement credit in appropriate
      areas, or departmental courses not listed here, may be substituted for electives in the major, with per-
      mission of the program chair.

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN AMERICAN STUDIES
   Candidates for honors in American Studies will undertake a substantial, year-long independent

project during their Senior year. All students who wish to write an honors thesis should consult with
a prospective faculty advisor in the spring of their junior year. Applicants should have a solid record
of work of high caliber, normally defined as maintaining at least a 3.4 average in courses taken for
the major. Students writing honors theses will register for AMST 491, W030, and AMST 492. The
awarding of honors will be determined by the American Studies Program Committee, based on the
recommendation of the student's advisor and two other faculty readers.

ADVISING
   All majors will be assigned a faculty advisor. Majors must meet with their advisor during the first

week of classes during the fall semester and at the time of the spring semester registration period in
order to have their courses and plans for the American Studies major approved. Both majors and
non-majors are encouraged to talk at any time with the program chair or other affiliated faculty
about the major.

AMERICAN STUDIES AND OTHER PROGRAMS
   Students majoring in American Studies are encouraged to consider pursuing concentrations in

African-American, Environmental, and Women's and Gender Studies. Many of the courses
counted for those concentrations may also earn credit toward the American Studies major.

STUDY AWAY FROM WILLIAMS

   We encourage students to pursue cross-cultural comparative studies. A major in American Stud-
ies can be combined with study away from Williams for a semester or a year if plans are made care-
fully. Many courses that will be approved for College credit may also count toward the American
Studies major if their subject matter is American culture.

   Students planning to be away in the junior year should have taken American Studies 201 before
they leave; those away for junior-year spring term should take American Studies 302 in their sopho-
more year. Students should consult as early as possible with the chair or their advisor about their
plans for fulfilling the requirements of the major.

AMST 201(F,S) Introduction to American Studies

To be an "American" means something more than U.S. citizenship. In this course, we focus on the

problems and possibilities of American identity. Access to American-ness is shaped by factors such

as class, race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, religion, and region--categories which themselves

change in meaning over time. Given the geographical, racial, and cultural diversity of the United

States, the ways in which Americans imagine nation inevitably vary over time, according to place,

and among different individuals and groups. Rather than a survey of any one aspect or period of

American history, literature, or popular culture, this course is an introduction to the interdisciplin-

ary field of American Studies, a field defined both by the range of texts we read (essays, novels,

autobiographies, photographs, films, music, architecture, historical documents, legal texts), and by

the questions we ask of them: How have different Americans imagined what it means to be an

American? What ideas about national history, patriotism, and moral character shape their visions of

American-ness? How do the educational system, mass media, government policies regarding citi-

zenship and immigration shape American identities? How are boundaries of inclusion and exclu-

sion in the nation drawn? What uses have been made of the claim to an American identity, and what

is at stake in that claim? How have Americans imagined a national landscape, a national culture,

and to what ends?

AMST 302(S) Junior Seminar in American Studies: American Utopias

The junior seminar will focus on utopian thinking, social practices and expressive arts in nine-

teenth- and twentieth-century America: philosophy, literature and art; social experiments; urban

planing; science; education; and recent historical and theoretical work in American Studies, much

of which displays a decidedly utopian bent. Since most reforming and idealizing visions develop

from a heightened sense of what is wrong with American society, we will analyze and interpret dys-

topian views as well. These will include recent art, architecture and film in which an almost saccha-

rine representation of American life is revealed to be a meditation upon the impossibility of hope.

Enrollment limited to Junior American Studies majors and to those American Studies majors who

need to take this course because they will be or have been away during their Junior year. Expected

enrollment: 16.

AMST 388(S) Representing Cultural Contradiction in Contemporary Art and Criticism (Same
as ArtH 466)
How should we understand and represent "difference"? What are the advantages and disadvantages
of "identity" for critical work? The tremendous force of racism, sexism, homophobia, and class an-
tagonism in American social life can make it easy to forget that the corresponding catego-
ries--"race," "gender," "sexuality," and "class"--are historical artifacts, the result of specific his-
torical and global processes working in collaboration. In our time, refutations of the clean and natu-
ral appearance of these identity categories have become a commonplace. This demonstrates, in
part, that culture is something constantly made and remade; that it provides raw materials for cre-
ative processes which redefine and re-present identity for specific concerns; and, that the applica-
tion, defense, and meaning of "values" occupy negotiable terrain. But if difference is so structured
into the mechanisms of society, what can explain our difficulty coming to terms with its increasing
presence/ ubiquity in representation? This course will provide students with an opportunity to en-
gage closely with the language and imagery at work in some of the pressing critical debates of to-

day. The seminar will be taught through a series of comparative case studies across critical writing

and visual culture, to include texts by Baldwin, Berkovitch, Bersani, Butler, Dyer, Fuss, Gilroy,

Hall, Morrison, Owens, and Pearce; artists Beecroft, Candyass, Hammons, Ligon, Opie, Piper,

Rauschenburg, Serrano, Smith, Weems, Walker, Wojnarowicz, and Yates; exhibitions Black Male

at the Whitney, Sensation at the Brooklyn Museum of Art, New Histories, and No Place Like Home;

and, selected films and videos.

Evaluation of seminar participants will be based on class participation, several position papers and

oral presentations, and a research paper of 15-20 pages. Enrollment limited to 15.

AMST 403(F) Notions of Race and Ethnicity in American Culture (Same as History 469)*

While "race" and "ethnicity" have always played fundamental roles in shaping the course of Amer-

ican history and the image of American society, our understanding of the concepts of race and eth-

nicity has often been less than clear. Our goal in this course is to determine and examine how Ameri-

cans have defined race and ethnicity at various points in our history and how these notions have

been acted out in policy, practice, and theory. Examples of the social and legal construction of race

and ethnicity and their expression in American culture will include white-Native American rela-

tions, slavery and its legacy, the "Yellow Peril," science and race, and contemporary race relations.

Students will be evaluated on class participation and three written assignments: an annotated bibli-

ography, an historiographical essay, and a final research paper.

Enrollment limit: 18. Priority given to American Studies senior majors and then to History majors.

SPECIALIZATION FIELDS

   To provide focus for work in the major, each student will choose one of the Specialization Fields
listed below and record this choice when registering for the major. (This commitment can be re-
vised, in consultation with the chair.) At least five electives will be taken from among those desig-
nated to support a specialization field. In extraordinary cases, students who wish to do so may be
permitted to design their own specialization field. Fulfillment of concentrations in African-Ameri-
can Studies, Environmental Studies, and Women's and Gender Studies may be used as the basis for
individually designed specialization fields. All such arrangements must be approved by the Ameri-
can Studies Committee.

POWER, POLITICS, AND BELIEF

   Any political or social movement is ultimately based on a set of beliefs about what the world is, or
ought to be. This specialization examines American society in terms of its underlying belief system
and ideologies, how these are translated into political, institutional, and cultural life, and how they
shape the nature and distribution of power in society.

   This specialization takes up the question of American identities as those are determined and
sometimes confounded by racial and ethnic difference. How has difference within the American
"community" been defined, and by whom? What have been the real historical, cultural, economic,
and social effects of these discursive definitions?

ANTHROPOLOGY AND SOCIOLOGY (Div. II)

                                  Chair, Professor DAVID B. EDWARDS

Professors: M. F. BROWN*, D. EDWARDS, JACKALL, JUST. Assistant Professors: FOIAS, NO-
   LAN.

   The Department of Anthropology and Sociology at Williams aims to help students achieve an
integrated understanding of biography, history, culture, and social structure in both traditional and
modern societies.

   Anthropology explores the full range of human experience by introducing students to the study
of tribal and peasant societies, especially those on the periphery of the West, as well as to the cultural
complexities of stratified, industrial societies such as our own. Integrated with the study of specific
peoples is an examination of the various analytical schemes anthropologists have developed to un-
derstand them. Courses offered in the department represent two of Anthropology's major subfields:
sociocultural anthropology--that is, the comparative study of human social life, institutions, and
beliefs--and archaeology, the study of the origins and lifeways of prehistoric peoples.

   Sociology studies the social and institutional intricacies of modern industrial societies and the
social psychological dilemmas facing the individual in our epoch. Sociology courses introduce stu-
dents to classical and contemporary social thought about men and women and society, to the sys-
tematic analysis of social institutions and social interaction, and to the social analysis of modern
culture. The Sociology major at Williams emphasizes the humanistic tradition of sociology, stres-
sing qualitative approaches to understanding how social reality is constructed.

MAJORS

   The department offers separate majors in both Anthropology and Sociology, with a broad and
diverse array of courses in both disciplines. The department is committed, however, to the unity of
the social sciences. To this end, Anthropology and Sociology offer joint core courses in methodolo-
gy and theory, as well as several elective courses in common. All joint courses are designated
"ANSO."

Requirements
   For the degree in Anthropology or Sociology, students must complete a minimum of nine courses

as outlined below:

(1) Core Courses. Majors in both disciplines must take a sequence of four core courses. Three of these
      are joint (ANSO) courses. The sequences are:

Anthropology                    Joint (ANSO)     Sociology

                                ANSO 205         Sociology

                                ANSO 305

                                Senior Seminar

(2) Elective Courses. Majors in Anthropology or Sociology must take five elective courses from the
      course listings of their respective disciplines or from the joint ANSO listings. Two of the courses
      chosen are normally at the 300 level or above. In close consultation with their departmental advisors,
      students may take some selected courses from other disciplines to fulfill major requirements in either
      Anthropology or Sociology.

(3) Majors in each wing of the department are allowed to count up to two courses in the other wing to-
      wards fulfillment of their major requirements.

STATISTICS AND DATA ANALYSIS
   Majors in Anthropology and Sociology are required to take Statistics 101 (formerly Mathematics

143), a comparable course in statistics and data analysis, or prove competency in the area of statisti-
cal analysis through examination. Courses taken to fulfill this requirement will not count towards
the nine course total that all majors are expected to complete.

AREA STUDIES CONCENTRATION
   Students who wish to combine a major in Anthropology or Sociology with an Area Studies con-

centration are encouraged to do so. Courses taken to satisfy an Area Studies requirement may be
counted toward the major with prior approval of a student's departmental advisor. The only excep-
tion to this rule is the Area Studies senior seminar, which cannot ordinarily be counted toward the
Anthropology or Sociology degree.

LANGUAGE STUDY, STUDY ABROAD, AND WINTER STUDY
   Departmental advisors will help interested students integrate a major with study abroad, foreign

language study, or field research during the winter study period. The department encourages Wil-
liams students to take advantage of established foreign study programs in Egypt, Japan, India, Hong
Kong, and various European and African countries. Because some foreign study programs do not
offer courses that can be counted toward the Anthropology or Sociology degrees, however, sopho-
mores planning to study abroad in junior year must consult with the departmental advisor before
declaring a major.

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN ANTHROPOLOGY OR SOCIOLOGY
   Honors and highest honors are normally awarded for the completion of a year-long research proj-

ect that has resulted in an original thesis of high quality. Students wishing to write an honors thesis
should engage a member of the department faculty as a Thesis Advisor as soon as possible and must
submit a proposal for the thesis for department approval no later than preregistration in the spring of
the junior year. If the proposal is approved, they will be permitted to register for Anthropology and
Sociology 493-W031-494, during which they will write and defend a thesis. If their overall work in
the major continues to be of high quality and the thesis is deemed of a similar quality, they may be
awarded honors or highest honors in Anthropology or Sociology.

           ANTHROPOLOGY / SOCIOLOGY COURSES

JOINT CORE COURSES

ANSO 205(S) Ways of Knowing

An exploration of how one makes sense of the social world. Some of the key questions of the course

are: What are the philosophical and epistemological underpinnings of social inquiry? How does

one frame intellectual problems and go about collecting, sifting, and assessing field materials?

What are the uses and limits of statistical data? What is the importance of history to sociological and

anthropological research? How can one use archival and other documentary materials to enrich eth-

nographic research? What are the empirical limits to interpretation? What is the relationship be-

tween empirical data and the generation of social theory? How does the social organization of social

research affect one's inquiry? What are the typical ethical dilemmas of fieldwork and of other kinds

of social research? How do researchers' personal biographies and values shape their work? We will

approach these problems concretely rather than abstractly through a series of case studies of how

men and women in the world of affairs, ranging from detectives, epidemiologists, and corporate

lawyers, make sense of their worlds in order to act responsibly. We will also draw upon the field

experiences of departmental faculty in settings as diverse as the jungles of Guatemala, the moun-

tains of Sumbawa, Afgan refugee camps, immigrant communities in Chicago, big city police de-

partments and district attorney offices, corporate offices on Wall Street, and criminal drug courts

across America. There will also be some practical training in basic field methods, census and survey

interpretation, and archival research.

Requirements: a series of short papers and a final exam.

Prerequisite: Anthropology 101 or Sociology 101 or permission of instructor. Expected enroll-

ment: 20.

Hour: 1:10-3:50 W                                         NOLAN

ANSO 305(F) Social Theory
This course tries to recapture common ground on the sharply contested plain of "social theory." It
begins with pairs of classic anthropological and sociological studies showing how the two disci-
plines typically approach fundamental problems of human experience and address such key ques-
tions as: How do men and women in different societies and epochs construct and maintain social

                                        ­ 59 ­
Anthropology and Sociology

order? How do they allocate authority, responsibility, and blame, as well as social prestige, power,

and material wealth? What systems of beliefs and reinforcing symbols do they fashion to come to

grips with evil, misfortune, and mortality? What happens when social worlds fall apart? In consid-

ering such issues through concrete studies, we will reconstruct the intellectual and social histories

of both disciplines, examining in particular how the two disciplines abandoned common ground

and language, with sociologists gravitating toward paradigms of scientific predictability and an-

thropologists toward relativistic frameworks of interpretation. The course explores the confronta-

tions of both disciplines with the troubling puzzles of modernity. It analyzes the contemporary ap-

propriation of the "primitive," as well as the significance of remote anthropological discoveries,

often in re-enchanted form, of the same demystified, commercial, bureaucratic processes that so-

ciologists study in the metropolis. Finally, the course examines the migration of ideas from an-

thropology and sociology to disciplines as diverse as literary and art criticism, philosophy, religion,

political science, and history, and the counterflow of ideas back to anthropology and sociology. The

course emphasizes the conflict between interpretive frameworks and ways to reconcile and build

upon these intellectual differences in order to make sense of the social world.

Prerequisites: Anthropology 101 or Sociology 101 and ANSO 205 or permission of the instructor.

Expected enrollment: 20.

Hour: 1:10-3:50 W                                                                           FOIAS

ANSO 402(S) Senior Seminar (Same as Anthropology 402 and Sociology 402)

The capstone seminar is a research seminar. Its purpose is to allow students to engage skills they

have acquired to formulate an intellectual problem, gather and analyze data, and compose an origi-

nal and synthetic work of scholarship relevant to their discipline. Projects may take a variety of

forms, including library papers, fieldwork-based papers, group projects, or other alternatives, sub-

ject to the instructor's advice and consent. Students registered for the course will meet at least once

prior to the commencement of Spring classes and are expected to begin the semester with a concrete

research proposal in hand; senior majors writing honors theses join the seminar with projects al-

ready well underway. Class meetings thereafter will be devoted to the discussion and mutual cri-

tique of ongoing work; students will be required to present work in progress to the seminar at sever-

al points during the semester. A final grade will be assigned based on the quality of the research

project and on the quality of the student's contributions to and critiques of classmates' work. Stu-

dents who are not senior majors in anthropology or sociology are permitted to register for this

course only with the instructor's permission.

Requirements: major research project, class participation.

Prerequisites: Anthropology and Sociology senior majors or with permission of instructor. Ex-

pected enrollment: 23.

Students who are doing a thesis in Anthropology or Sociology are required to audit this course

and should, therefore, make certain their schedules allow them to do so.

                          ANTHROPOLOGY COURSES

ANTH 101(F,S) The Scope of Anthropology*

Is there such a thing as "human nature"? Why have human societies developed such a bewildering

range of customs to deal with problems common to people everywhere? This course addresses

these questions by introducing students to the comparative study of human social life and culture.

Topics surveyed in the course include economics, language and thought, kinship and marriage, law

and politics, and the wide variations in human belief systems, including religions. The course also

considers the ways that anthropology, a discipline that was until recently practiced almost exclu-

sively by Westerners, approaches other societies in search of insights on our own customs and val-

ues. Ethnographic descriptions of both "simple" tribal societies and complex modern ones are a

prominent part of the readings.

Format: a combination of lectures and class discussion of case studies and ethnographic films. Re-

quirements: a midterm, a final exam, a term paper, and class participation.

Enrollment limit: 30 (expected: 30). Priority given to first-year students and sophomores.

ANTH 103(S) Pyramids, Bones, and Sherds: What is Archaeology?*

Anthropology examines not only living societies, but also prehistoric cultures whose remains are

found worldwide. This course will present how archaeology examines the various aspects of hu-

man society from the physical record of prehistory. How do we study the subsistence and settlement

patterns, the political and social organization, and the economy and ideology of prehistoric soci-

eties who have left behind mute material records? The objective of anthropological archaeology is

to bring to life these prehistoric cultures through archaeological analysis. The different goals, ap-

proaches and methodologies of modern archaeology will be discussed theoretically and then ap-

plied to case studies.

Format: lectures/class presentations/discussion of case studies. Requirements: class presentations,

two papers, midterm and final exams.

No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 40 (expected: 25).

ANTH 214(F) (formerly ANSO 214) The Rise and Fall of Civilizations (Same as Environmental

Studies 224)*

Over the centuries, philosophers and historians have asked how did societies evolve from simple

hunter-gatherer bands to urban complex civilizations? Human prehistory and history have shown

the repeated cycles of the rise, expansion and collapse of early civilizations in both the Old and New

World. What do the similarities and differences in the development of these first civilizations tell us

about the nature of societal change, of civilization and the state, and of human society itself? The

course will examine these issues through an introductory survey of the earliest civilizations in Mes-

opotamia, Egypt, India, Mesoamerica and South America. Classical and modern theories on the

nature, origin, and development of the state will be reviewed in the light of the archaeological evi-

dence.

system are well known worldwide. The course will examine the trajectory and nature of ancient

Maya civilization from the combined perspectives of art history and archaeology. The evolution of

the Maya state during the Preclassic period (1000 B.C.-A.D. 250) will be evaluated by looking at

the rich archaeological evidence and at the Preclassic art styles. The Classic Maya civilization

(A.D. 250-1000) will then be presented through a detailed survey of the archaeology and art of this

period. Finally, the collapse of Classic Maya civilization and its transformation and endurance dur-

ing the Postclassic period and under Spanish rule (A.D. 1000-1600) will be critically evaluated

through a detailed review of the archaeological and iconographic evidence.

ANTH 312(S) The Evolution of Culture

The field of anthropology centers on explaining human nature and human culture. Perhaps the

greatest single issue addressed by anthropology is the mystery of human cultural evolution. Why

have human societies over the past 10,000 years changed rapidly from simple, egalitarian hunting-

and-gathering bands to vast, complex, hierarchically organized urban civilizations? The course

will be divided into two parts. The first half will explore explanations of cultural evolution through

readings from the major theorists from Spencer and Morgan to Marx, Engels, Harris, and modern

neo-marxists and post-processualists. The second half will apply these theories to actual case stud-

ies from the earliest civilizations in the New and Old World. Through critical evaluations of the

theories presented and review of the archaeological and historical evidence from ancient civiliza-

tions, the course will provide a context in which students will form their own explanations of this

major transformation in human culture.

ANTH 328T(S) (formerly ANSO 328) Emotions and the Self*+
Everyone everywhere experiences emotions, and everyone everywhere is faced with the task of
conceptualizing a self-hood and its place in the social world. This course analyzes a variety of re-
cent attempts in the social sciences to come to grips with topics that have long been avoided: the
nature of the interior experience and an epistemological framework for its cross-cultural compari-
son. Exploring the borderlands between anthropology, sociology, and psychology, we will bring
the tools of ethnographic analysis to bear on central pan-human concepts: emotions and the self. By
examining these phenomena as they occur in other cultures, we will be better placed to apprehend
and challenge the implicit (and often unconsciously held) assumptions about emotions and the self
in our own culture, both in daily life and in academic psychological theory. What are emotions? Are

they things--neuro-physiological states--or ideas--sociocultural constructions? How are they to

be described; compared? What is the self? How are selves constructed and constituted? How do

various cultures respond to categories of emotion and self, and how can we develop a sense of the

relationship between self and emotion?

ANTH 342(F) Dispute and Conflict, Settlement and Resolution: The Anthropology of Law*

How does a society define the moral life and by what means does it resolve the internal conflicts that

inevitably arise? These questions are approached through a survey of the anthropology of law in the

broad sense, as concerned not just with codified laws and formal institutions, but with all forms of

dispute settlement and conflict resolution, including mediation and arbitration. Taking an ethno-

graphic and cross-cultural perspective, we will examine the cultural construction of dispute, the

nature of evidence, and the variety of processes by which disputes can be resolved. We will further

examine the relationship between the scale of a community and its legal mechanisms, with particu-

lar attention to plural legal systems and the tension between customary and national law in modern-

izing nations. Ultimately we will try to come to grips with the question of justice: its definition and

the means by which it may be achieved.

ANTH 346(S) The Afghan Jihad and Its Legacy (Same as EXPR 346)*

Though it is largely forgotten now, the war in Afghanistan played a pivotal role in the collapse of the

Soviet Union, and the repercussions of the war continue to be felt in a variety of significant ways,

including in the ongoing challenge presented by Osama Bin Ladin, the Saudi industrialist-cum-Is-

lamic activist, who uses Afghanistan as his base of operations for attacking Western interests in the

Muslim world. This course examines the historical and cultural background to the war, the events of

the war themselves, and the emergence of the Taliban regime following the Soviet withdrawal.

Among the issues to be considered are the war and its impact on the Soviet Union, the spread of

Islamic radicalism, the relationship between ethnicity and religion, the position of women under the

Taliban, and the implications of the collapse of the Afghan nation-state for regional and internation-

al political order. In addition to reading about and discussing various aspects of the war, its causes

and its aftermath, students will also assist in the development of a DVD on the war that will incorpo-

rate extensive video footage shot by Afghan cameramen during the war.

Format: seminar/studio. Requirements: response papers, final, and collaboration in the conceptual-

ization, organization and preparation of the Afghan War DVD.

ANTH 364(S) Ritual, Politics, and Performance*

This course looks at the relationship between ritual, politics and power from a variety of disciplin-

ary perspectives and in a number of different socio-cultural contexts. Beginning with a discussion

of the ethological and psychological study of ritual, we will consider some of the ways in which

anthropologists and sociologists have examined ritual's role in society, as well as the elementary

forms of political ritual, such as rites of passage, sacrifice, and kingship. We will investigate the

extent to which rituals are similar in `traditional' and `modern' contexts. We will also examine the

role ritual plays in political resistance and the question of whether rituals of resistance are actually

subversive or constitutive of the dominant structures of authority. The final section of the class is

devoted to contemporary ethnographies in which the relationship between ritual and power is a cen-

tral element.

of classical and contemporary social thinkers, including Marx, Durkheim, Weber, Freud, Veblen,

Simmel, and Goffman. Special consideration will be given to the social and cultural problems of

capitalism, rationality and irrationality in modern institutions and organizations, the psychological

dilemmas facing the individual in modern society, and the problem of social order and conflict.

This multidisciplinary course analyzes violence and aggression within broad historical and com-
parative frameworks. The course begins with an examination of the universality of violence and
humankind's ceaseless fascination with it. It then proceeds through an examination of types and
meanings of violence. Topics include: war and warriors; industrialized violence; ethnic and racial
savagery; violence in the name of God; political violence; terror; honor and violence; sexual vio-
lence; criminal violence; and self-destructiveness. The course concludes with a look at forces of
order and peace in several historical contexts. Special attention paid throughout to representations
of violence in art, literature, and cinema. Readings include selections from Homer, Aeschylus, Ta-
citus, Suetonius, Dostoevsky, Sorel, Marx, Durkheim, Weber, Bloch, Tambiah, and Deutscher,
along with many other classical and contemporary writers.

SOC 206(S) Religion and the Social Order

Beginning with a review of classical sociological analyses of religion's role in the social order--

from Durkheim's study of primitive religions to Weber's assessment of Protestantism and the rise of

capitalism--this course considers the changing influence of religion on a wide range of social be-

haviors and institutional arrangements. The course will examine, for example, how religious plu-

ralism heightens cultural tension as multiple and conflicting claims are asserted to have primacy

over other claims, resulting in public conflicts over a range of social issues. A prominent and much

debated assessment of these conflicts is the so-called "culture wars" thesis. Proponents of the thesis

discern deep fissures in the American cultural and religious landscape while critics contend that the

divide is not nearly so polarized. Still others observe relative harmony, arguing that America re-

mains "one nation after all". In addition to exploring the various positions on this debate, the course

will examine the interplay between culture and other contemporary developments in America

religious life such as the burgeoning "seeker church" movement and New Age channeling practic-

es. The class focuses on the United States but lays a conceptual foundation for the cross-cultural

study of religion and the social order.

SOC 208(F) The Social Life of Ideas
One of the most significant cultural institutions in contemporary society is the academy-the intellectual
space populated by instructors and researchers who work in college and university settings. Although a
great deal of sociological research has been done over the years on the significance of institutions of higher
education, only recently have sociologists begun to examine one of the main activities of academics: for-
mulating and expressing ideas. Sociologists of ideas ask a variety of questions. What does it mean to be an
intellectual today? What is the best way to describe the social structure of academia? How are one's intel-
lectual choices affected by one's institutional position in this structure? How do academics give voice, in
their work, to their political, religious, ethnic, racial, and sexual identities? And what is the relationship

between the writings of intellectuals and the culture of the times? These questions will be among those

discussed in this course, which will examine both the older sociology of ideas emerged, and the work of

major figures in the field today.

ethics of criminal groups; the violence emerging out of the drug trade; the work worlds and habits of

mind of crimefighters, with a special focus on uniformed police officers, detectives, and prosecu-

tors; the symbolic representations of criminals and crimefighters in American popular culture; the

relationships between law, crime, moral narratives, and social order; the crisis of the criminal jus-

tice system in America; and the globalization of crime. Special attention to the process of the crimi-

SOC 227(S) Urban Policing

The municipal police who patrol the streets of America's cities and towns are often in the headlines, as

much these days for their misdeeds as for anything else. While journalistic portrayals of the police often

mention the famed police "subculture," rarely do they discuss the ways in which the practices of policing

are shaped by social forces and processes outside police control. In this course, we will examine work by

sociologists who have attended to such concerns and who view the police not simply as enforcers of demo-

cratically-enacted laws, but as an institution central to the reproduction of our highly stratified social order.

Such a "theoretical" interest in policing will not, however, keep us from immersing ourselves in the gritty

details of the many fine ethnographies of the American police, or from considering the policy implications

of our discussions.

Falling in love and maintaining an intimate relationship often feel like primal experiences-so visceral and

tion. But are they? In this course, we will examine the work of a number of scholars who not only insist that

the experience of love is culturally and historically variable, but who also maintain that understanding the

social roots of contemporary love and intimacy can tell us something important about the nature of our

society. Among the thinkers we will discuss in this regard are Robert Bellah, Michel Foucault, Anthony

Giddens, Niklas Luhmann, Judith Stacey, and Ann Swidler.

SOC 229(S) Work and Contemporary Capitalism
Contemporary capitalism in America and Europe is marked by a number of distinctive features,

decline of a paternalistic ethic among employers combined with diminishing support for the wel-
fare state, the declining state, the declining strength of labor unions, the commonality of two in-
come families, a widening gap between rich and poor, the increasing concentration and mobility of
capital and the growth of protest movements against it. What are the effects of these changes in our
lives-on our prosperity, heath, happiness, family relationships, religious and community involve-

SOC 265(F) Drugs and Society

From nineteenth-century opium dens to early-twentieth-century speakeasies to late-twentieth-cen-

tury crack houses, this course investigates the important impact of drugs on American society. Fo-

cusing on the social control of drug and alcohol use, particularly legal forms of social control, the

course analyzes such historical developments as the rise and fall of prohibition; the early-twentieth-

century illegalization of narcotics; the emergence of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), Narcotics

Anonymous (NA) and other self-help groups; and the recent advent of drug courts and juvenile boot

camps. The analysis will include evaluation not only of the social influence of drugs typically clas-

sified as "illicit," such as cocaine, opium, morphine, heroine, and marijuana, but also of alcohol,

tobacco, and the recent emergence and popularity of psycho-pharmaceutical drugs like prozac and

ritalin. Rooted in a sociological perspective, the course reviews different theoretical explanations

of drug and alcohol consumption and of the different strategies, legal and otherwise, that have been

employed to define and regulate drug use in American society.

MAJOR
   Three routes are offered: the emphasis of the first is on the history of art, and that of the second is

on creative work in studio. The third route through the major allows students to take courses in both
halves of the department in more or less equal numbers.

   Note: The Art History and Art Studio routes are strongly recommended for any prospective Art
major who is contemplating graduate study in Art History or Art Studio.

      Parallel courses
        Any four additional Art Studio or Art History courses. At least one elective must be taken in each
          wing of the department. At least one of the electives must be an Art History course concerned
          with a period of Western or non-Western art prior to 1800.

Art History Route: The history of art is different from other historical disciplines in that it is founded
on direct visual confrontation with objects that are both concretely present and yet documents of the
past. We concentrate on architecture, painting, sculpture--the richest visual expressions of culture.
Since works of art embody human experience, we use the work of all other disciplines to understand
them, such as social history, perceptual psychology, engineering, psychoanalysis, and archaeology.
Because of its concentration on the visual experience, the Art History major increases one's ability
to observe and to use those observations as the basis for critical thought.

                                                ­ 67 ­
Art

   ArtH 101-102 introduces students to a series of critical studies of important works selected from
the history of Western art from antiquity to the present. The critical approach of the introductory
course is maintained in all further courses, especially by assigned study of original works in the
Williams College Museum of Art, Chapin Library, and the Clark Art Institute.

   An introductory studio course, ArtS 100, in which no artistic talent or prior experience are as-
sumed, provides vital training in what is a visual as well as a verbal discipline. The requirement of a
course in non-Western art expands majors' geographic as well as cultural horizons, and the require-
ment of two courses in art from periods prior to 1800 provides a necessary concentration on earlier
moments in culture. (As the contemporary architect, Philip Johnson, said, "You cannot not know
history".) The junior course (ArtH 301) develops awareness of the theoretical implications, as well
as the possibilities and limitations of different art-historical methods. The requirement of a seminar
or graduate course in the senior year enables students to apply that knowledge of methodology to
their most specialized work in the Art History route.

Art Studio Route: The studio division of the Art major has been structured to foster the development of a
critical understanding of making art; to support creative interests and to develop students' perceptions and
imaginations as they investigate a variety of visual media. Drawing I, ArtS 100 or ArtS 103, serve as
an introduction to the basic drawing and design principles which establish the foundation for the devel-
opment of visual expression. ArtH 101-102, an introduction to the history of Western art, provides part of
the necessary background in the critical analysis of art. The 200-level ArtS courses provide opportunities to
learn the elements of some of the principal visual arts media: architecture, painting, photography, print-
making, sculpture, and video. These courses combine technical foundations in the medium with analysis
of the interrelation of visual form and content. The 300- and 400-level courses place a greater emphasis on
the application of appropriate visual skills and strategies to particular thematic concerns, and to the devel-
opment of the student's individual vision. All studio art seniors exhibit their work in the Williams College
Museum of Art as a part of the requirements for the major.

History and Practice Route: This route allows students to study in depth both the history of art and the
making of it. It offers considerable flexibility: students may propose courses of study that emphasize partic-
ular media, themes or methodological issues. To mention just three examples, students may design se-
quences of courses that focus on architecture, gender or narration in both the history of art and contempo-
rary practice. And students may take more courses in one wing of the department than the other, as long as
the minimum requirements in each wing are satisfied. The History and Practice route is especially well-
suited to students interested in arts-related careers outside of higher education, including work in art galler-
ies, art museums, and primary or secondary school education. Courses of study for History and Practice
majors must be approved by two members of the faculty, one from each wing of the department. Any
changes in a History and Practice course of study must also be approved by two advisors.

   History and Practice Faculty Advisors: Mike Glier, Ann McCallum, and Ben Benedict in studio;
E. J. Johnson and Mike Lewis in history.

COURSE NUMBERS

First Digit
The introductory courses in both Art History and Studio have 100-level numbers and are prerequisites for
most other courses in the department. The distinction between 200- and 300-level offerings is either one of
difficulty or of the sequence in which material is best taken. Also, lecture courses with no prerequisite have
a 100- or 200-level number. The 400-level seminars and tutorials are intended for advanced students, usu-
ally senior majors.

Middle Digit
Art History (ArtH)
Middle digit distinguishes courses according to geographical area, or time span covered. 0 = general; 1 =
Ancient; 2 = Medieval; 3 = fifteenth, sixteenth century; 4 = seventeenth, eighteenth century; 5 = nineteenth
century; 6 = twentieth century; 7 = Asian; 8 = African; 9 = independents, honors.

Art Studio (ArtS)
Middle digit distinguishes introductory and general courses from those specialized in different media and
arts. 0 = introductory; 1 = general; 2 = architecture; 3 = drawing; 4 = painting; 5 = photography; 6 = print-
making; 7 = sculpture; 8 = video; 9 = independents, honors.

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN ART
   Students who wish to become candidates for the degree with honors must show prior evidence of

superior performance in the major as well as research capabilities to carry out the proposed project.

Art History:
   In order for a project to be considered, the candidate (1) must have arranged for an advisor, and

(in consultation with the advisor) a second reader to supervise and evaluate the project (2) should

                                                ­ 68 ­
                                                                                                     Art

normally have had one course with the advisor. In addition, the topic must be within the advisor's
areas of competence and should normally be related to course work which the student has done pre-
viously. In the case of an interdisciplinary proposal, the second reader should normally come from
the other discipline.

   The student submits a 2-page proposal including a statement about the preparation for the proj-
ect, a description of the topic and a general bibliography. Following approval by the faculty advisor
and second reader, this proposal is reviewed by the entire Art faculty, who have the option to request
revisions and to refuse the proposal. Students should keep in mind that a thesis in Art History is not
necessary for admission to graduate study.

   It is the responsibility of the candidate to select one of the following routes and to meet all dead-
lines. Students who are not making satisfactory progress on their research and writing will not be
allowed to continue with the thesis. The completion of the requirements, however, will not guaran-
tee a degree with honors. The degree with honors will be awarded for projects demonstrating a high
degree of scholarly achievement and self-motivation. All proposals must be submitted according to
the guidelines set out below. The timetable for submission of work, including specific dates, is
available in the Art Department office.

Students may select one of the following options:
      1) Full-Year Thesis: Research and writing will be carried out during both semesters and WSP of the
         senior year (students should register for ArtH 493-W031-494). The thesis topic, advisor and se-
         cond reader must be determined by April 15 of junior year. Students who are on overseas pro-
         grams junior year are advised to make arrangements prior to their departure, but they may submit
         a final proposal two weeks before the fall semester of senior year if they have made the necessary
         arrangements. After the thesis is submitted, the candidate for honors shall present an oral defense
         before faculty and peers.

      2) Half-Year Thesis: Research and writing will be carried out during fall term and winter study or dur-
         ing winter study and spring term (Students should register for ArtH 493-W031 or W031-ArtH
         494). For students who choose to complete the mini-thesis in the fall, proposals must be submitted
         by April 15 of the junior year. For those planning to complete the mini-thesis in the spring, propos-
         als must be submitted by November 1.

   A student's project is judged by two members of the department, the advisor and second reader;
in the case of an interdisciplinary project, a member of the Art Department and a member of the
other relevant department or program function as advisor and second reader. In rare cases, a third
reader may be appointed by the department at the request of the advisor or second reader.

   All routes require that one course and one WSP, in addition to the ten required courses for the
major, be dedicated to the honors project.

Art Studio: (for the Class of 2002)
   The Art Studio division of the Art Department offers a specialization route toward departmental

honors. This route, which requires the completion of a substantial body of independently produced
visual work, consists of two courses constituting a clearly interrelated pattern of study. The first of
these must be a WSP 033 in the senior year, followed by ArtS 418T Senior Tutorial.

   In the spring of the junior year, the student should consult with a prospective faculty adviser and
declare her/his intent to pursue the degree with honors to the department chair. Potential honors
candidates should submit a written proposal and visual documentation of prior work in the field, to
the faculty adviser, on the first Monday in October, in the fall of the student's senior year. The pro-
posal should outline a concise and specific course of study in media with which the student can evi-
dence prior experience. The evidence is provided by the visual documentation, in the form of a slide
portfolio or video tape. Students should seek assistance from their advisers both on the written pro-
posal and the selection of visual documentation. The studio faculty, as a whole, will review the pro-
posals and support materials. The faculty adviser will inform the student of the faculty members'
decision prior to Winter Study registration. Students whose honors proposals are approved by the
faculty must enroll in WSP 033 and Arts 418T in the spring semester of the senior year. Members of
the studio faculty will review the work in progress, at the end of February. Only candidates who
succeed to evidence a sufficient amount of work and substantial progress will be allowed to contin-
ue to pursue the degree with honors.

   To be considered for honors a student must successfully complete all requirements for the major.
Each honors candidate will be expected to have demonstrated the ability to work independently and
the understanding of what is required to develop a body of work that investigates a thesis. The proj-
ect will culminate in a presentation agreed upon by the student, the faculty advisor, and the faculty
tutor teaching ArtS 418T. All candidates will be required to present the department with a set of no
fewer than twenty slides that document the work completed during the project. This documentation
will be accompanied by a written description of the project.

                                                ­ 69 ­
Art

   The awarding of honors will be decided by the studio faculty of the department, on the recom-
mendation of the student's advisor and the faculty member teaching ArtS 418T, based on perfor-
mance in the two related courses. Highest honors are normally awarded only to students whose per-
formance in both the honors program and other courses in the major has been exceptional.

Art Studio: (starting with the Class of 2003)

   Studio art concentrators who wish to be candidates for honors are required to take two additional
courses: an additional 200-level course and the 400-level senior tutorial, ArtS 418T.

   Honors candidates enrolled in the senior tutorial must "evidence" prior experience in the media
chosen for the honors work. This "evidence" may consist of one or more 200-level courses in the
medium, course work at the 300 level and/or a slide portfolio demonstrating the student's proficien-
cy in the media chosen for the honors project. This work is presented to the senior tutorial instructor
at the start of the spring semester.

   At the end of the spring semester, of the senior year, the honors candidate will orally defend his/
her work in the senior exhibition at WCMA. The entire studio faculty will attend the defense. Based
on the work and the oral defense, the studio faculty (as a whole) will designate honors, high honors
or no honors.

History and Practice:

   The route to honors is a combination of the Art Studio and Art History honors routes. At the be-
ginning of senior year, a candidate for honors in History and Practice makes a proposal to two facul-
ty members, one faculty advisor from each wing of the department. If both advisors agree to super-
vise the project, the candidate enrolls in independent study and works through the fall semester and
winter study. The progress of the project is assessed by both advisors at the end of winter study; if
the project is not well enough developed, the advisors may end it at that time. If the project is al-
lowed to move forward, the student enrolls either in ArtS 418T Senior Tutorial, if the project is pri-
marily a matter of making art, or in an Honors Independent Study, if it is primarily a writing project.
The final project is submitted to the two advisors, who will determine whether or not it will receive
honors.

ART HISTORY COURSES

ARTH 101(F)-102(S) Introduction to Western Art History

An historical survey of Western architecture, sculpture, and painting, concentrating on a limited

ARTH 201(F) American Landscape History (Same as Environmental Studies 201)

This is a survey course stressing the description and historical geography of regional, vernacular

American settings, with the goal of discerning a national style of spatial or landscape organization.

Among the human-altered environments to be studied are: forestlands, rangelands, croplands, out-

door recreational sites, mines and quarries; small towns, milltowns, central business districts, and

suburbs; power and utilities; housing, industry, commerce, and institutional uses such as the Ameri-

can college campus; water, road, and rail corridors as examples of circulation nets. Primary evi-

dence will be visual.

Afternoon meetings provide discussion and field or site-visit opportunities, and enable classmem-

bers to obtain a first-hand familiarity with a rural-urban gradient of representative land-uses and

occupants of the Hoosic-Hudson watershed and Taconic upland region surrounding Williamstown,

as well as experience with interviewing and field study methodologies.

Requirements: several mini-tests, four term paper installments on the documentation of an evolv-

ing landscape site or behavior, short class presentation on research, as its "landscape" or type comes

up for class or lecture consideration, and obligatory all-day field trip.

No prerequisites. Open to first-year students.

This course is conceived as an introduction to ArtH/Environmental Studies 305, 306, and 307.

Hour: 10:00-10:50 MWF      Conferences: 1:10-3:50 T, W                     SATTERTHWAITE

ARTH 202(S) War and Images: From the Stone Age to the Internet Age

This course will survey the common and divergent patterns, important issues and events, and prin-

cipal contributors (patrons, producers, and audiences) of the picturing of human warfare through

history. We begin in the stone ages and continue through the era of the ancient empires, the Middle

Ages, the Renaissance and the early modern period to the twentieth century. We will investigate

how different peoples at different times and under different social and environmental circum-

stances create bodies of images to represent war that can vary but also have similarities of form,

content, function and impact. What can we learn about other cultures and about ourselves by the

way we depict and interpret warfare through pictures?

Evaluation will be based on written assignments and class participation.

No prerequisites. No enrollment limit.

Hour: 11:00-12:15 MWF                                                      PERLMUTTER

ARTH 223(S) Early Medieval Art and Architecture
A survey of the major works of architecture, sculpture, book illumination, monumental mural deco-
ration (mosaic and fresco) and the minor arts (ivory carving, metalwork, etc.) produced from Dura
Europos to Toledo and from the Fayum to the Isle of Iona between approximately 200 and 1050.
Lectures will focus on questions of style, content, function, patronage and audience in an attempt to

shaping early medieval life. Aiming to situate these works within their larger social, political, devo-

tional, intellectual as well as art-historical contexts, the course also hopes to demonstrate the unique

power of the visual arts to provide access into an emerging European world whose values and con-

cerns were radically different from, and yet fundamental to, those of the modern West.

Requirements: midterm, final exam, three to four short papers.

ARTH 231(F) Italian Renaissance Art

An introduction to Italian painting, sculpture, and architecture from the fifteenth and sixteenth cen-

turies. Unlike other academic disciplines, art history continues to refer to this period as a renais-

sance or rebirth. Why is this the case? To what extent is this a useful definition? We will consider

these questions by paying critical attention to the ideals that have come to be associated with the

Renaissance as a period of astounding creativity and achievement in the visual arts: the importance

of classical culture, renewed attention to naturalism, and developing individuality of the artist. We

will then explore a series of thematic and contextual perspectives (including religion, domestic life,

civic ritual, political power, and artistic style) from which to view select works of art. The goal of

this course is not to present an exhaustive survey of the period, but rather to provide a broad range of

frames of reference for thinking about Renaissance art.

Format: lecture and discussion. Requirements will include a midterm, a final, and two papers.

Prerequisites: ArtH 101-102. Open to non-majors and first-years students. Enrollment limit: 40.

ARTH 232(S) The Visual Culture of Renaissance Rome

During the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, the city of Rome saw itself transformed from a shrink-

ing and neglected medieval town into a thriving center of artistic achievement. This lecture course

focuses on the historical, geographic, and ideological forces behind this period of renovation and

restoration forces that reworked the urban fabric of the city while shaping the character of the visual

arts from Filarete and Fra Angelico to Bramante, Michelangelo, and Raphael. We will examine

monuments such as Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel, then, not only as touchstones for the history of

western art, but also as images capable of reflecting, and even constructing, a uniquely Roman

sense of power, time, and historical destiny.

Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: midterm, final, and two papers. Prerequisites: ArtH

ARTH 246(S) Baroque Art: Images of Men and Women

Although still life and landscapes became popular during the seventeenth century, the human figure

remained not only the most esteemed but also the most depicted subject throughout Western Eu-

rope. This lecture course will first examine the biological view of sexual difference current at the

time (the theory of humors). With this as a basis, we will compare seventeenth-century images of

men and women to those from other periods. We will also compare differences between individual

artists, including Caravaggio, Artemesia Gentileschi, Bernini, Rubens, Rembrandt, Vermeer, Ve-

lazquez, and Poussin.

ARTH 252(S) Campuses (Same as Environmental Studies 252)

An historical study of the North-American campus, primarily its educational or institutional guise,

but also as found in some office and industrial "parks," concentrating upon aspects of site design,

such as the fit between physiography and building location. Applying such Lynchian precepts as

edge, path and node, our inquiry will be both diachronic and comparative. What happens when

campuses grow, or diminish? What happens when their surrounding change, or deteriorate: What

uses of space are located where, and to what extent is their spatial layout an hierarchical one? Why

have some campuses few imitators (even if, as in the instance of Thomas Jefferson's "academical

village," their plan has been much extolled)? Among other topics to be considered are: issues of

integration within or separation from towns, accommodations to the automobile and to field sports

as spatially consumptive uses (leading to increasingly spread-out plans); design as a reflection of

pedagogical agenda (or even monastic tradition?); successional uses of the same building or space,

especially as increasing enrollments may bring increasing specialization (of building functions);

traffic as a function of buildings; campuses pretty much created all at once and campuses more

polyglot, with generational changes in design and even purpose; "dead," or vestigial spaces, or

buildings, such as through the demise of required chapel attendance. Major attention will be given

to seminal designs and designers. Regional examples of a wide variety of campuses will be visited

during field sessions.

Requirements: term paper to be submitted in three segments and preferably considering a campus

(and its institution through one century). Biweekly attendance at ten weekly field sessions.

No prerequisites.

ARTH 264(F) American Art and Architecture, 1600 to Present (Same as American Studies

264)

American art is often looked at as a provincial version of the real thing--i.e., European art--and

found wanting. This course examines American architecture, painting, and sculpture on its own

terms, in the light of the social, ideological and economic forces that shaped it. Special attention will

be paid to such themes as the Puritan legacy and attitudes toward art; the making of art in a commer-

cial society; and the tension between the ideal and the real in American works of art.

Requirements: three 5-page papers, midterm, final, and a field trip.

developments in painting, sculpture, and photography, including the work of such artists as Georg

Baselitz, Bernd and Hilla Becher, Bernhard and Anna Blume, Rebecca Horn, Anselm Kiefer, Sig-

mar Polke, Gerhard Richter, and Rosemarie Trockel. Among the issues to be examined will be Ger-

man art and historical memory; "Neo-Expressionism"; the reaffirmation of painting as a medium;

ARTH 278(S) The Golden Road to Samarqand*

The region comprising present day Iran, Afghanistan, Central Asia, Pakistan and India has a rich

and complex history. Home to Genghis Khan and Tamerlane, Akbar the Great and Shah Jahan, it

has generated some of the most spectacular monuments (e.g. the Taj Mahal and the blue tiled

mosques of Isfahan) and refined manuscript painting ever known. We will look at these art forms

from the tenth to the seventeenth centuries, highlighting the patronage of key dynasties, including

the Timurids of Samarqand and the Mughals of India. An important issue throughout the course will

be the impact that Islam has had on the artistic traditions of this region.

Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, a short paper, a midterm

and a final.

ARTH 301(F) Methods of Art History

A survey of problems and techniques in interpretation, including case-studies in the field of modern

cial art history) as well as topics of interest to practitioners of various methods (the place of inten-

tion in interpretation, formalism). Our readings will include art-historical essays, essays on

"theory" (by literary critics as well as art historians) and essays in philosophy by such authors as

Yve-Alain Bois, T.J. Clark, Jacques Derrida, Stephen Knapp and Walter Benn Michaels, Rosalind

Krauss, Paul de Man, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, and Richard Schiff. Requirements will include read-

ings, presentations, short papers and class participation.

ARTH 321(S) Inventing Joan of Arc: The History of a Hero(ine) in Literature, Pictures,

Joan of Arc (known during her own lifetime as Jeanne "la Pucelle", or Joan "the Maid") was one of
the most dynamic and yet enigmatic personalities of the European Middle Ages. Born into a peasant
family in the French border province of Lorraine in 1412, she gained control of an army, won bril-

liant military victories, crowned a king, and was burnt at the stake as a heretic, all before her twen-

tieth birthday. Triply marginalized by gender, age, and socio-economic status, she nonetheless

managed to shake the Church- and State- establishments to their very core. But who was Joan of

Arc? Nationalist martyr? Pioneer feminist? Champion of the people? Enemy of democracy? Instru-

ment of God's will? Fanatic xenophobe? Victim of post-traumatic stress disorder? Over the centu-

ries since her death, artists - and not just politicians and scholars - have attempted to answer this

question, creating myriad literary, pictorial, and cinematic visions of la Pucelle under the influence

of an ever-changing lens of contemporary tastes and concerns. Through discussion of readings and

various kinds of visual material, this course will survey the history of Joan of Arc in a range of dif-

ferent media. Among those who have "invented" Joan of Arc and whose work will be examined in

the course are: Shakespeare, Voltaire, Schiller, Michelet, Twain, Shaw, Rubens, Ingres, Rude, Bas-

tien-Lepage, DeMille, Dreyer, Preminger, Rivette, and Besson.

ARTH 365(S) Non-Fiction and Experimental Film

This course examines the evolution--from the Lumiére brothers in 1895--of non-fiction filmmak-

ing by historical period and national school, with emphasis on the work of such masters as Flaherty,

Ivens, Grierson, and Wiseman, and on such "schools" as the National Film Board of Canada. Spe-

cial attention to the documentary mode, its relationship to still photography, the analysis of cine-

matic form, and the influence of anthropology, war, propaganda, and television upon the medium of

film as an art form. Secondary consideration of experimental, avant-garde, or independent film,

especially the work of Canadian animators like Norman McLaren.

ARTH 421(F) Chartres Cathedral: The History and Reception of a Medieval

"Masterpiece"

The Cathedral of Notre-Dame at Chartres was built over a 100-year period, from c.1134 to the

1230s. It features Early Gothic as well as High Gothic elements and the vast majority of its original

twelfth- and thirteenth-century architecture, sculpture and stained glass survives intact. This matter

of survival alone makes the Cathedral unusual, for no other medieval church preserves so many of

its component parts in such pristine condition. But Chartres is unusual for another reason as well: its

architecture, sculpture and stained glass have from the moment of their construction been consid-

ered among the most beautiful, elaborate, and intellectually sophisticated examples of their kind

ever produced. These qualities have made the Cathedral, in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries,

not only the most celebrated but also the most studied monument of the Middle Ages. The aim of

this seminar is thus twofold: first, to examine the construction history and physical component parts

of the building and its decoration, and second, to explore the history of the interpretation of this

remarkably complex structure. How has the study of the Cathedral's architecture, sculpture and

stained glass changed during the course of art history's history? How have contemporary events

and developments in other disciplines within the humanities, as well as in art history, affected what

scholars have deemed to be important and interesting about this monument? By addressing these

questions, the course hopes to provide students with an appreciation both of the possible meanings

of Chartres Cathedral to the medieval community or communities that created and used it, and of

the way in which our understanding of the past is inevitably determined by the broader methodolog-

ical and/or ideological preoccupations of those who write about it.

Requirements: class participation, several short papers, 15- to 20-page research paper.

Prerequisites: ArtH 101-102. Enrollment limit: 15. This course may be taken in lieu of ArtH 301,

ARTH 432(S) Art and Private Life in Renaissance Italy

Today, Botticelli's Birth of Venus, Michelangelo s Doni Tondo, Leonardo's Mona Lisa, and Titian's

Venus of Urbino hang on museum walls, but each of these paintings was originally commissioned

for a specifically domestic setting. Paintings such as these helped to shape the very fabric of every-

day life for their original owners and viewers. This seminar focuses on the domestic setting as a

physical, social, and historical context for the investigation of images once housed within the walls

of the Renaissance palace (including devotional art, ritual objects, painted furniture, and portrai-

ture). We will pose questions regarding the relationship between these images and the families who

lived with them, focusing especially on aspects of gender and identity. Requirements will include

class discussion and presentations, a 15- to 20-page paper, and a possible field trip to New York.

ARTH 101-102 a prerequisite, open to juniors and seniors as well as graduate students; open to first-

and second-year students only by permission. Enrollment limit: 15.

Hour: 1:10-3:50 T                                                                        SOLUM

ARTH 448(S) Art about Art: 1400-2000

This thematic seminar will focus on depictions through which artists referred to their own profes-

sion and its products. Images to be discussed include legends of the origin of art, self-portraits and

other portraits of artists, scenes of contemporary and historical artists in their studios, as well as

finished art on display. While tracking the major changes in imagery from the end of the Middle

Ages through the twentieth century (with some reference to earlier developments) we will analyze

specific images, comparing their implications with both the social conditions and the theoretical

positions then current.

Requirements: two 12-page or one 25-page paper.

ARTH 461(F) Against Sense: Marcel Duchamp's Critique of Modernist Culture

The sense of Duchamp's work against sense was to unravel the strategies of how sense is normally

produced: first in works of art, including his own, then in ways of life, in ideology and society. Thus

in his art there is a close relationship between art about art and cultural criticism. Duchamp does not

aim at what art normally does: i.e., to suggest to the spectator certain aesthetic, ideological or "cos-

mic" and "poetic" feelings. On the contrary, he wants the spectator to realize that art as well as cul-

ture are games he can change. These games depend on conventions-very much like science and

mathematics depend on axioms: hence his interest for the fourth dimension. The course will focus

on Duchamp's work in context with contemporary avantgarde art from Courbet, Seurat, Cubism to

Surrealism. First, we will try to understand early avantgarde art, and Duchamp's subtle iconoclasm

directed against it. Second, we will examine his his appreciation of linguistic fashions in which we

come to understand art as well as ideology-including the connections between the two, and their

power over our cultural identities.

Requirements: participation in class discussions, class presentation, and a research paper.

Prerequisites: ArtH 101-102. Enrollment limit: 15.

Hour: TBA                                                              M. ZIMMERMANN

ARTH 462(S) The Subject of the Representation: Contemporary Art and Film

In order to place in context the forces that revitalized representation in the art of the 1980s, this

course will examine the formal and critical framework within which artists and audience alike de-

construct and reconstruct gender and identity, rethinking the nature of the "subject". Specifically,

we will consider film and video, new electronic technologies, and some of the many theoretical

discourses which influence the production and experience of art. There will be a particular empha-

sis on films by Dreyer, Godard, Hitchcock, Ford, and elected film noir. Recent films will include

Alien, Blue Velvet, Breaking Waves, Rendez-vous d'Anna and Videodrome, among others. All films

will be viewed on videotape. Background readings will include texts by Baudrillard, Derrida,

Freud, Haraway, Kristeva, Lacan and Mulvey, in conjunction with readings from Art After Modern-

ism: Rethinking Representation. A wide range of contemporary and video artists will be discussed,

concentrating on Hill, Holzer, Kelley, Kruger, Oursler, Salle, Sherman, Simpson, Kiki Smith and

Weems. The art of the 1960s and 1970s will be discussed in relation to the art of the 1980s and

1990s, with focus on Beuys, Warhol, Hesse and Acconci. Evaluation will be based on two papers,

weekly class presentations and a final project to be determined and developed in a series of confer-

ences with the instructors. One field trip to New York City to artists' studios, galleries and museum

will be made.

Enrollment limit: 12.

ARTH 464(S) Automatism (Same as INTR 464)
This seminar will explore the place of automatism in understanding the arts of the twentieth century.
As a result of the advent of hypnotism, a psychology developed that paid particular attention to the
mind's potential "dissociation"--or fragmentation--into more or less independent parts. This
could produce separate, or "split," personalities or it could result in less complete dissociations,
such as we ordinarily experience in the form of "automatic" actions-activities we perform without
consciously attending to them. The premise of this course is that "automatic" phenomena became
key motifs of art and art theory during the twentieth century. We will focus on important writings in
the history, historiography and theory of automatism (by J.L. Austin, Stanley Cavell, Michael
Fried, Ian Hacking, William James, Morton Prince and Gertrude Stein) as well as on works of fic-
tion and pictorial art that can be seen to engage with automatism (by Joseph Conrad, Sir Arthur
Conan Doyle, P.H. Emerson, Morris Louis, and Joan Miró).

ARTH 466(S) Representing Cultural Contradiction in Contemporary Art and Criticism (Same

ARTH 470(F) American Orientalism*

"Orientalism" has become a ubiquitous term in academic discourse but relatively little has been

done to explore the manifestations of this phenomenon in the realm of the visual arts, or to establish

the distinctive character of American Orientalism. Instead, the works of nineteenth-century paint-

ers such as Gerome are often used to epitomized the visual evidence. This course will address this

reductionism critically, beginning with the American students of Gerome and proceeding chrono-

logically and comparatively. In the process, we will utilize both established and emerging art forms

(e.g., advertising) to trace the efflourescence of orientalist imagery in the context of the emerging

mass culture in America. Students will be expected to undertake a major research project.

Hour: 1:10-3:50 T                                                               H. EDWARDS

ART STUDIO COURSES

ARTS 100(F,S) Drawing I
The process of drawing develops a heightened awareness of the visual world. Your subjective expe-
riences and your objective experiences combine to form a larger perceptual understanding of the
environment in which you live. Drawing allows you an alternative use of these processes and pro-
vides a format for stating what you know about the world. Drawing is an excellent means for im-
proving your skills in observing, seeing distinctions, and creating new meanings from your percep-
tions. This is an introductory course which will investigate the properties of making an image on the
two-dimensional page. While drawing is an essential basis for much of the artmaking process, its
use is not limited to artists. Design, illustration, engineering, and science are among the many fields
which incorporate drawing.
Evaluation will be based primarily on the quality and quantity of work produced as well as some
attention to the student's progress. Lab fee.
There are three to five sections of ArtS 100 offered each semester. Although individual faculty
members teaching beginning drawing do not follow a common syllabus, they share common goals.
Syllabi for each section are available either from the secretary's office in the W. L. S. Spencer Art
Building or can be obtained on the Hector file server: Departments, Art, and then ArtS 100.
No prerequisites.
Enrollment limit: 20. Preference given to Art majors and first-year students. This course cannot be
taken on a pass/fail basis.

will address issues of globalization, convergence, intellectual property and identity. In seminar, we

will look at and discuss net art, make research-based presentations and critique student net art pro-

jects, which will be produced outside of class. Web development experience is not a prerequisite for

this course, but if you don't know how to build web sites, you'll you will have to teach yourself and

each other the necessary skills (HTML, Flash, Perl, whatever) as you go. The emphasis in this cour-

se is not on technological mastery but on understanding the medium and finding intelligent and ef-

fective solutions to artmaking problems. Collaboration will be encouraged, and students will be

expected to share knowledge and expertise.

Evaluation will be based on participation in discussion and critiques, presentations and quality of

artwork produced.

ARTS 230(F,S) Drawing II

This drawing course will continue to investigate the techniques, principles of organization, and

ideas which were introduced in the Drawing I course. Having become more familiar with the draw-

ing process, students will be encouraged, through selected problems, to expand and challenge the

conventions of markmaking. As with any discipline, familiarity with the rules allows the users to

seek alternatives and develop definitions of how the drawing process can best be suited to their own

visual vocabulary. The range of exercises could include traditional materials on paper as well as

combinations of materials more commonly associated with non-art disciplines, i.e., computers, in-

dustrial materials, literature, etc.

Evaluation will be based on evidence of each student's progress, as shown in a portfolio of drawings

made in class and as homework. Attendance and participation in class discussions are also consid-

ered as part of the course evaluation. Lab fee.

ARTS 241(F,S) Painting

In this course, we will begin to explore the options that painting with oils has to offer. The class will

be focused on developing necessary technical skills, such as the manipulation of color, value, sur-

face, and texture. We will also begin to consider issues of content and representation by looking at a

diverse range of paintings, both in the museums that we have on campus as well as in regular slide

presentations.

Evaluation will be based on fulfillment of assignment objectives, technical execution/craftsman-

ship, conceptual and physical investment of time, participation in critiques, and attendance. Lab

ARTS 255(F) Photographic Time and Space~

An introduction to the practice of photography with an emphasis on the vision that is unique to the
camera: the particular manner in which three-dimensional reality is rendered on the two dimension-
al, light-sensitive plane. The course will concentrate on the study and creation of imagery which is
dependent on the specificity of photographic vision. Students will receive instruction on the work-
ings of a 35mm camera (provided by the department), development of black and white film and
basic printing technique. Students will be asked to respond to a series of assignments, including one
digital assignment. A substantial amount of lab time, in addition to the class meetings, is necessary
to complete these assignments. Students' works are evaluated individually and in class critiques
throughout the semester.
Evaluation will be based on the level of formal and technical competence of the portfolio as well as
the conceptual strength and sophistication of the work completed. Lab fee.

ARTS 256(S) Fabricated and Manipulated Photography

Photography means "drawing with light." This is an introduction to photography as a plastic art

investigating the synthetic nature as well as the alchemy of the medium. Shooting will be precon-

ceived and staged: "making photographs" instead of "taking them." It will also provide an opportu-

nity to engage in camera-less photography and darkroom experimentation. Students will receive

instruction on the workings of a 35mm camera (provided by the department), development of black

and white film and basic printing technique. Students will be asked to respond to a series of assign-

ments, including one digital assignment. A substantial amount of lab time, in addition to the class

meetings, is necessary to complete these assignments. Students' works are evaluated individually

ARTS 311T(F) Art at the Intersection

Artists have often gained inspiration and insight from others working in different disciplines, architects

from sculptors, film makers from painters, writers from composers and the like. Now more than ever the

boundaries between disciplines are shifting and blurring. Artists such as Matthew Barney make feature

length films that are combined with sculptural installations, architects like Frank Gehry build sculptural

buildings and performers like Bill T. Jones explore new technologies and reference drawing through

dance.

This tutorial will explore ways in which the fields of performance, literature and architecture relate, interact

or intersect with the visual arts, and how within contemporary visual art itself, the arrival of new technolo-

gies enables artists to invent media beyond the traditional terminologies of sculpture and painting, photog-

raphy and video. How and why are these boundaries blurring now and what does it mean for the future of

contemporary art making?

Artists we will look at along with those mentioned above include: playwright Sameul Beckett, performers

Laurie Anderson & Stelarc, sculptor Richard Serra, installation artist James Turrell, video artists Bill Viola

and Gillian Wearing and the digital works of Jeremy Blake and Jason Salavon, amongst others. In their

work students will be encouraged to broaden their areas of research and reference and execute individual

work in a combination of media or disciplines in order to explore these possibilities. There will be equal

emphasis on aesthetic and conceptual issues. The course will include several sessions where the class will

meet as a group to view slide/video presentations and for discussions on assigned readings and for criti-

ques. In addition, pairs of students will meet weekly with the instructor to discuss student works in prog-

ress.

Evaluation will be based on attendance, quality of work produced, and a general level of engagement in

course work/group critiques.

Prerequisites: any ArtS 200-level course. Enrollment limit: 10.

ARTS 312T(S) Fictional Realities
This tutorial will investigate visual art that addresses the complexity of contemporary reality. In this
technological age, with digital image manipulations and advances in bio-technology and genetic engi-
neering, questions of what is and is not real become confusing, challenging and sometimes alarming. We
will look at how artists can attempt to examine, question and make sense of the new terrain of this twenty-
first-century world.
This will include looking at the works of artists who use new digital media, net.art and sound as well as
more traditional media. Thomas Grunfeld, Dayanita Singh, Gregory Crewdson, Brian Conly, Diana That-
er, Damian Loeb, John Klima, Ross Sinclair, Unitygain and Thomas Demand will be among those
introduced.
Students will be encouraged to explore their own perceptions of reality through the completion of a series
of assigned projects before creating their own world to communicate their vision in a complete and com-
pelling way.
Students may execute work in any, or any combination of, media in which the student has completed and
introductory course. The course will include several sessions where the class will meet as a group to view
slide/video/sound presentations and for discussions of assigned readings and work critiques. In addition,
pairs of students will meet weekly with the instructor to discuss student work in progress.

ARTS 313T(S) Art of the Public

"New genre public art [is] visual art that uses both traditional and nontraditional media to communi-

cate and interact with a broad and diversified audience about issues directly relevant to their lives

[and] is based on engagement." So writes Suzanne Lacy, a long-time practitioner of such work. En-

gagement with members of the public is the premise on which this public art tutorial is founded: the

hands-on work of the class will consist in exploring issues directly relevant to the lives of our tar-

geted audience-participants. We will develop art designed for a life outside of the gallery, art that

emphasizes a process of engagement with issues. We will investigate the places where we live, our

environs, listening, looking, reading, interviewing. Students will learn how to elicit concerns of lo-

cal citizens and, through workshops on computer visual drafting and collaborative processes,

evolve projects that will air those concerns in public settings and in public formats. Requirements:

readings, exercises with public places, journal writing on posed questions, taped interviews, drafts

of projects pursued with group, attendance at one public meeting of student's choice, final project

and presentation.

Prerequisites: any 100-level course in ArtS or ArtH, and any 200-level course in the Art Depart-

ment, and any course in Theater, Sociology, Political Science, Psychology, Women's and Gender

Studies, or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 10. Preference given to Art majors.

ARTS 315T(F) Collage

The term collage is from the French verb coller, meaning "to glue." Throughout art, film and litera-

ture of the twentieth century we regard the process of making collage an aggregate of ideas, materi-

als and textures; a work composed of both borrowed and primary material. The assembled informa-

tion produces a montage that permits meaning to slip the metaphoric conventions of a unified sur-

face and linear logic. This studio, through analog and digital processes, examines several stations in

which collage creates patterns that address social, political, and psychological conditions.

The prerequisite for this studio is two from the following ArtS 200 level studios: painting, photogra-

phy, printmaking, sculpture, or video. Familiarity with a Macintosh platform and basic skills in

Photoshop is expected. Enrollment limit: 10.

Hour: 1:10-3:50 W                                                                 EPPING

ARTS 319(F) Junior Seminar: Museum, Street, Living Room

The junior seminar addresses the interplay between artmaking practices and art theory and criti-

cism. This year the course will focus on three spaces of encounter for modern and contemporary art:

the museum, the street, and the living room. Students will engage critical materials and art historical

examples related to these spaces, raising questions about public and private spaces, art and every-

day life, and twentieth-century shifts in practices of display and looking. The course will also ad-

dress how these sites have in turn served as actual source material for artists' productions. For ex-

ample, how has the space of the museum inspired work by Mark Dion, Joseph Cornell, Ann Hamil-

ton, the Museum of Jurassic Technology, Andrea Fraser, or Fred Wilson? How does the street figure

as a space of appearance and/or as a topic of inquiry in the work of Eduard Manet, Asco, Allan Ka-

prow, Adrian Piper, or Doug Aitken? How does the living room become the subject of work by An-

drea Zittel, Louise Lawler, Pippilotti Rist, or Inigo Manglano-Ovalle, as well as the site of broadcast

radio, tv, and internet fine arts projects? Critical works may include writings that address these

spaces by Lippard, Kirshenblatt-Gimblett, Holston, Delaney, Chavoya, Baudelaire, Benjamin, De-

bord, Spiegel, Lefevbre, Corbusier, Marguiles, and others.

A substantial amount of critical reading and viewing will be required, as well as regular journal

entries, and three studio production assignments which correspond to each topic.

The course is limited to Art majors and is required of junior Studio Art majors.

ARTS 329(F) Architectural Design II

A continuation and expansion of ideas and skills learned in Architectural Design I. There will be

four to six design projects requiring drawings and models, each of which will emphasize particular

aspects of architectural theory and design. Visiting critics will discuss student work. The course is

useful for students thinking of applying to graduate school in architecture.

Evaluation will be based on quality of designs during the term. Lab fee.

Prerequisite: ArtS 220; ArtH 262 highly recommended.

ARTS 344(F) Abstraction

Abstraction and its self-interested partner, non-objective art, have been persistent and defining

ideas of the twentieth century. This course will combine tutorial and workshop formats to investi-

gate the principles of abstract design and the theories that propel them. The course is designed pri-

marily as a drawing and painting class for intermediate and advanced students, but it is also open to

students working in sculpture. The assignments will address the following topics: cubism, field

composition, organic form, patterns and working in series. Short essays written by artists will ac-

company the projects. The last four weeks of class will be dedicated to independent work. In addi-

tion to studio assignments, each student will give a 20-minute slide presentation about an artist who

works abstractly. The course will meet for 2 hours and 50 minutes twice a week.

Evaluation will be based on the quality of visual projects, the slide presentation, and active partici-

pation in small critique groups.

Prerequisites: ArtS 230 or a 200 level painting or sculpture course or permission of instructor. En-

rollment limit: 15. Preference given to majors. This course will satisfy the 300-level tutorial re-

quirement for the Studio Art major.

ARTS 364T(S) Artists' Books

This course will investigate the processes and ideas associated with the making of artists' books,

works that are fine art objects primarily using visual images and/or text. For example, individual

projects could include literary text/visual image combinations, visual diaries, three-dimensional

pop-up books, solely visual narratives, autobiographies, animated "flip" books, or sculptural

books. Limited-editioned as well as one-of-a-kind work will be encouraged. Media options include

etching, lithography, relief printing, hand painting, drawing, some photo processes and bookbind-

ing techniques (from boxes to hard binding). As a tutorial, this course is designed to meet individual

needs, stress student participation and responsibility for learning, and to examine differing points of

view. Students will meet in groups of two for discussion and critique of individual projects in the

tutorial format: i.e., students are expected to give a half hour presentation weekly regarding their

projects and selected readings, and to respond to criticism and questions by the peer student and the

instructor. Students will also meet once a week as a group for demonstrations, slide presentations,

meetings with visiting artists, and discussion of readings.

Evaluation will be based on student participation and conceptual and technical quality of the work.

There will be one required field trip during the semester. Lab fee.

representation. Readings by Wolfgang Schivelbusch on gas lighting, Lisa Cartwright on x-ray,
Mark Seltzer on the typewriter, Lynn Kirby on the train, C.W. Ceram on primitive motion picture
technologies, and various works on early wireless broadcasting, as well as visual works by inven-
tors, scientists, and visual artists, will serve as source materials for students' own production work.
Do these technologies possess their own agency? How do they affect vision, representation, and
social contexts, and how do social contexts also affect the development and emergence of these
technologies? What are the cultural dreams and fantasies that circulate around their emergence?

The primary emphasis of the senior tutorial is on strengthening the student's skill and sensitivity in

using critical analysis for the creation of visual objects and/or events. At the beginning of the term,

studio art majors, in consultation with the tutor, will determine the individual projects that will serve

as the focus of their work for the semester. During the course, students are expected to refine their

creative directions in a coherent and structured body of work which will be exhibited at the Wil-

liams College Museum of Art. Students are responsible for buying their own materials.

Prerequisites: completion of all other studio courses required for the art studio route. Open to senior

Art majors only.

that the need for most independent work can be met through those regular offerings.
Prerequisites: no student will be accepted into an independent study project unless he/she has com-
pleted two 200-level ArtS courses and one 300-level ArtS tutorial. Permission of the instructor is
still required.

GRADUATE COURSES IN ART HISTORY

Requirements for the Degree of Master of Arts in Art History

   The degree is normally awarded upon successful completion of two years of resident graduate
study. To earn the degree the student must earn a grade of at least B- in each of ten courses, at least
six of which must be graduate seminars (including ArtH 504). In connection with the preparation of
a paper for the Graduate Symposium, students will register for an eleventh course (ArtH 509), to be
graded pass/fail, in their fourth semester.

   In addition to completing the required courses, students must participate in a group study trip to
Europe during winter study period in the first year, complete a Qualifying Paper in January of the
second year, and satisfy the language requirement in the manner described below (see "Language
Courses").

   Senior art majors may enroll in graduate seminars, space permitting, with the permission of the
instructor.

the most influential concepts of the discipline, the evolving tasks it has set itself, and the methods it

has adopted for executing them. Works of art will inevitably enter into our discussions, but the main

objects of study will be texts about art, particularly texts about methods for a historical study of art.

Topics include: concepts of the discipline; style and periodization; iconography, semiotics, and de-

construction; the social functions of images and the social history of art; gender and sexuality; and

art history as representation.

Each student will be responsible for several short papers on selected readings and a longer final

paper.

pants to the study of Western prints from the Renaissance to the nineteenth century. This semester,

in conjunction with the Clark's Fall 2001 exhibition Goltzius and the Third Dimension, our empha-

sis will be on old master prints. We will review the various methods of printmaking as well as the

primary elements of print connoisseurship. Through a series of close readings of historical texts, we

will explore aspects of artistic practice, theory, and collecting. Each participant will lead discus-

sions of several reading assignments and turn in short written reports, in addition to a final term

This course will investigate the methods and paradigms of research currently practiced in the disci-

pline. It will take advantage of resident Clark Fellows and the variety of topics and approaches that

they bring to their studies. Every other week a Clark scholar will introduce her or his subject to the

seminar, by explicitly foregrounding the interpretive strategies of the research project. Other read-

ings will consist of a few prominent speculations on the nature, purposes, and problems presented

by our chosen field of study. Weekly seminars will consist of class presentations and discussions. A

sustained reflection on contemporary practice will be the subject of the final paper.

ARTH 508(S) Art and Conservation: An Inquiry Into History, Methods, and Materials (Same

as ArtH 408)

This course is taught by the professional staff of the Williamstown Art Conservation Center and

guest lecturers. It will acquaint the graduate students with examination techniques for works of art,

give them an understanding of the history of artists' materials and methods, and familiarize them

with the ethics and procedures of conservation. This course, while not providing expertise in con-

servation, should assist future curators and art historians in assessing the physical condition and

needs of museum collections in their care, including storage, handling and environment, and give

them enough knowledge to discuss problems with conservators.

Evaluation will be based, in part, on a midterm and a final exam.

Enrollment strictly limited to 12. Some understanding of science and of studio art helpful. Priority

is given to graduate students; undergraduates will be admitted if space is available but must consult

the Director of the Graduate Program before preregistering.

ARTH 521(S) Picturing God in the Middle Ages

How did Christians come to depict their God? How did they visualize the deity described in Scrip-

ture as well as such theological subtleties as the Incarnation and the Trinity? And what purposes did

pictures of God serve? Paying particular attention to the rapidly-growing body of recent scholar-

ship on these questions, the seminar will consider a variety of issues concerning the sources and

evolution of medieval Christian images of God, in both Byzantium and Western Europe, and the

problems these images often generated. Among other specific topics, the course will investigate the

impact of imperial cult and images of the dead on the earliest portraits of Christ, theological debates

about the nature of spiritual vs. corporeal vision and their relationship to image-making practice,

the function of sacred images in public ritual vs. private devotion, and the pictorial exploration of

the sexuality of Christ.

Evaluation will be based on research papers, oral presentations, and class participation.

ARTH 552(S) The Gothic Revival

The Gothic Revival was once written off as a passing fad for pointed arches and pinnacles, but we

now recognize it as one of the major cultural and social movements of the nineteenth century. Dur-

ing its years of greatest influence, it subjected every aspect of art, belief, society and labor to intense

intellectual scrutiny, using the Middle Ages as a platform from which to judge the modern world.

This seminar will look at the Gothic Revival in America and Europe as a response to the industrial

revolution and to modernity. Students will prepare a semester-long research paper. Possible topics

include archaeology and antiquarianism, ideas about the origin and development of the Gothic, its

political meaning, new building types and new materials, the relationship of the Gothic to the deco-

rative arts and the doctrine of morality in architecture.

ARTH 555(F) Whistler, Sargent and American Cosmopolitanism

"I can't," wrote Henry James in 1888, "look at the English and American worlds . . . save as a big

Anglo-Saxon total." He had noted a year earlier: "It sounds like a paradox, but it is a very simple

truth, that when today we look for `American art' we find it mainly in Paris." Aside from James

himself, among the most striking exemplars of this late-nineteenth-century unity of the French, En-

glish, and American aesthetic worlds are two painters: James McNeill Whistler and John Singer

Sargent. We will look at the careers of these two, arguably the most influential and well known

American artists of their era, in light of this internationalism. Discussion and readings will benefit

from consideration of objects in the Clark Art Institute's collection. Basis for evaluation: class par-

ticipation and two brief writing assignments; an oral presentation that will form the basis for a fully

developed term paper; and a commentary on a colleague's presentation.

ARTH 557(F) Alienation: Searching for the Self from Manet to Duchamp

This seminar will study a series of works from Manet, Eugène Carrière, Picasso, Boccioni, and Du-

champ. In these paintings and sculptures, the spectator is not "somebody" or a "painter-beholder",

but a concrete (albeit paradoxically fictive) person. The artist is focusing on identity, on "himself",

as if he were somebody else (Lacan: "Moi c'est un autre"). Manet's detachment, a seemingly unin-

terested sort of involvement, prepares for more schizophrenic forms of estrangement. We will try to

find out whether there is a systematic link between art works implying a de-/reconstructing of the

self, the concrete personality of the "author", and attempts at dissolving and inventing artistic lan-

guages. Thus, we will also focus on strategies for alienating art from the security of a dominant cul-

tural viewpoint by introducing multi- or a-perspective languages. The link between the two topics is

an interest in procedures aiming in an active way at making things appear strange (in Russian: ostra-

nenje, in German: Verfremdung). An introduction will focus on the myth of the artist in and around

symbolism between primitivism and decadence, genius and madness, in context with the discovery

of children's art and art of the insane.

Hour: 2:30-5:00 W                                                       M. ZIMMERMANN

ARTH 562(S) Pictures and Politics in the Twentieth Century

The twentieth century has been called by E.H. Gombrich the "age of images." Film, television, sat-

ellites, and now the Internet have allowed the mass distribution of images to almost every person on

the planet. How have pictures and politics--the struggle to define government policy, to seize and

maintain power, to influence events--intertwined, colluded, and collided during these revolutions

in visual technology? We will examine issues and events related to the impact, alleged and real, of

visual images on public opinion, government policy making, and the discourse of elite power hol-

ders. While we will favor the study of modern electronically produced images, we will also ex-

amine issues related to "high art" and folk culture. Of particular interest will be famous images or

icons of entertainment, news, and art which have been credited as having a powerful influence on

political opinion and actions.

countries. Issues of interest include, for example, the meanings and functions of Zen painting, ico-
nography and its evolution, different patronage systems in China and Japan, and to what extent Jap-

LANGUAGE COURSES

   Reading proficiency in two European languages is required for the M.A. degree in Art History at
Williams, and provision for attainment of this qualification is an integral part of the program of
study. Of these two, German is required, and French is recommended. Elementary and intermediate
undergraduate courses offered by the language departments are open to graduate students, and the
graduate program offers advanced, one-semester courses in French and German art-history read-
ings. A student who begins elementary language study after enrollment in the program should ex-
pect to take a sequence of courses. Details may be obtained from the graduate program office. En-
tering students with some previous language background will be asked to take a standard reading
examination for purposes of placement. A score of 500 is required for admission to the advanced
course. Students with scores below 500 will be enrolled in elementary language courses. Students
should aim to complete all language work no later than the end of the third semester.

   To satisfy the requirement in each of the two required languages, a student must: (a) score 700 or
better on the SAT II reading examination upon enrollment in the program or, (b) complete satisfac-
torily (B- or better) and punctually all assignments and tests in the advanced courses. The same
standards and expectations apply to language courses as to other courses and seminars.

   Second-year students who have successfully completed German 501-502 and have indepen-
dently developed their German language skills during the summer may, before the commencement
of their third semester of study, arrange to take a two-hour translation examination administered by
the graduate program. Students who pass the examination are exempted from German 509.

   If appropriate to his or her course of study, a student may petition to substitute another language
for French. Instruction in Spanish, Russian, Latin, and Greek is regularly offered in the undergradu-
ate curriculum, whereas independent arrangements must be made for Italian, Dutch, and other lan-
guages.

GERM 501(F)-502(S) (101-102) Elementary German
This course is for students who have had no previous study of German. It consists of the regular
undergraduate introductory course.

GERM 509(F) Readings in German Art History and Criticism
Texts are selected from characteristic works of art history and criticism and from the specialized
literature required in concurrent seminars.
Prerequisites: German 501-502 or the equivalent with a final grade of B- or above.

RLFR 511(F) Intensive Grammar and Translation
An intensive grammar course for students interested either in developing or in improving their ba-
sic reading skills in French. Emphasis will be on a general review of grammar and sentence struc-
ture as well as on developing a wide range of vocabulary centered around art history.

RLFR 512(S) Readings in French Art History and Criticism
An advanced translation course specializing in art history. Texts will be selected from fundamental
works of art history and criticism and from the specialized literature required in concurrent art semi-
nars in the Graduate Program in Art History.

RLIT 509(F,S) Italian Readings in Art History
Students read and discuss their interpretations of assigned readings in art historical texts drawn
from contemporary critical works, with occasional consideration of translation/discussion sessions
interwoven with strategic review of grammar and brief theoretical exploration of techniques for
reading comprehension. This course will be offered subject to sufficient demand.

   The Department of Asian Studies offers courses in English in the field of Asian Studies as well as
courses in Chinese and Japanese language and literature. Three distinct majors are offered: a major
in Chinese; a major in Japanese; and an interdisciplinary Asian Studies major which allows students
to choose from a wide range of courses in the anthropology, art, economy, history, languages, litera-
tures, music, politics, religion, and sociology of China, Japan, and other Asian countries. Students
with questions about the Asian Studies majors or about Asian Studies course offerings should con-
sult the chair. Please note: courses with ASST prefix carry Division II credit and courses with CHIN
and JAPN prefixes carry Division I credit.

THE MAJOR
   All students wishing to major in the Department of Asian Studies are required to take and pass a

total of eleven courses, as follows:

   1) four semesters of Chinese or Japanese language

   2) Asian Studies 201

   In addition to completing (1) and (2) above, all majors choose either an Area Studies track, lead-
ing to a degree in Asian Studies; or a Language Studies track, leading to a degree in Chinese or Japa-
nese. The requirements for each of these tracks are indicated below:

   3A) Area Studies track

   a. a three-course qualification in one of the disciplines represented within Asian Studies (anthropology/
      sociology, art history, economics, history, literature, music, political science, religion). The qualifica-
      tion, to be determined through consultation between students and their advisor, normally includes an
      introductory course, a more advanced methodological or comparative course, and a course on Asia.

   b. three approved electives, which may include further language work

   3B) Language Studies track

   a. four additional semesters of Chinese or Japanese language

   b. two approved electives with a substantial focus on the country or countries whose language the stu-
      dent is studying

STUDY ABROAD
   Students intending to major in Asian Studies are encouraged to study in Asia during one or both

semesters of their junior year. Williams sponsors study abroad programs in China and Japan. Op-
portunities to study in India, Indonesia, Korea, Thailand, and other Asian countries are also avail-
able. Prospective Asian Studies majors who are planning to study abroad should discuss their plans
with their advisor as far in advance as possible. Up to eight courses taken overseas can count toward
graduation, and up to four courses taken overseas may be counted toward the major.

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS
   Students interested in writing an honors thesis in Asian Studies, Chinese, or Japanese should sub-

mit a proposal to the department chair when they register for courses in the spring of their junior
year. The proposal should include a statement of the topic, a general description of the types of ma-
terials available for study and how the study will be carried out, and the name of the faculty member
who will serve as advisor. Admission to the honors thesis program will normally be limited to stu-
dents who have maintained at least a B+ average in their courses for the major.

   Students admitted to the program should register for ASST 493-W031-494, CHIN
493-W031-494, or JAPN 493-W031-494. They will be expected to turn in the final draft of their
thesis shortly after spring break and to discuss their results formally with their faculty graders. Their
final grades in the three courses listed above and the award of Honors, Highest Honors, or no honors
will be determined by the quality of the thesis and the student's performance in the oral defense.

THE ASIAN STUDIES ENDOWMENT
   The Linen summer grants for study abroad, the Linen visiting professorships, and several other

programmatic activities in the department are supported by an endowment for Asian Studies estab-
lished by family and friends in memory of James A. Linen III, Class of 1934, Trustee of the College
from 1948 to 1953 and from 1963 to 1982.

                     COURSES IN CHINESE (Div. I)

   The department regularly offers four levels of instruction in Modern Standard Chinese (Manda-
rin), designed to enable the student to become proficient in aural comprehension, speaking, read-
ing, and writing, as well as introductory courses in Cantonese, Taiwanese, Classical Chinese, and
Chinese linguistics. The course numbering system for Chinese is sequential. Students move from
Chinese 101-102 to 201, 202, 301, 302, 401, and 402. Independent study (Chinese 497, 498) may be
offered depending on student needs and available resources. Those students entering with previous
proficiency in Chinese should see Professor Chang concerning placement. The department also of-
fers courses on Chinese literature in translation for those students who have no knowledge of the
language but who wish to become acquainted with the major achievements in Chinese literary and
intellectual history. Students having questions concerning these courses should also see Professor
Silber. For the purpose of the distribution requirement, all courses in Chinese are considered Divi-
sion I.

CHIN 101(F)-W088-102(S) Basic Chinese*

An introduction to Mandarin, the language with the largest number of native speakers in the world,

which is the official language of mainland China and Taiwan, and one of the official languages of

Singapore. Course objectives are for the student to develop simple, practical conversational skills

and acquire a basic proficiency in reading and writing in both the traditional and the simplified

script at about the 500-character level. This course, which assumes no prior background in Chinese,

will consist of approximately 60% training in speaking and listening with the other 40% spent on

reading and writing. Classes consist of a combination of "act" classes, conducted exclusively in

Mandarin, where students use the language in various types of drills and communicative activities;

and "fact" classes, conducted in Mandarin and English, where students learn about the language

and culture. Both audiotapes and videotapes will be employed extensively.

Evaluation will be based on daily classroom performance, homework, quizzes, weekly tests, and a

final exam.

Credit granted only if both semesters and the winter study sustaining program are taken.

CHIN 131(S) Basic Cantonese*

An introduction to Standard Cantonese, a major regional language of southern China which is spo-

ken by over 50 million people in Hong Kong, Macao, Guangdong, and Guangxi as well as by many

overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia, Hawaii, and North America. Due to the pervasive influence of

Hong Kong as well as the economic transformation of Guangdong Province, the prestige of Can-

tonese within China has been rising steadily over the past two decades. Our focus in this course will

be on developing basic listening and speaking skills, though we will also study some of the special

characters which have been used for centuries to write colloquial Cantonese. Since students will

ordinarily possess prior proficiency in Mandarin, a closely related language, we should be able to

cover in one semester about as much as is covered in the first two to three semesters of Mandarin.

Evaluation will be based on classroom performance, quizzes, tests, and a final exam.

Prerequisite: Chinese 202 or permission of the instructor.

CHIN 244(S) Writer and Society in Twentieth-Century China (Same as Comparative

Literature 218)*

The tumultuous social and political changes of China in this century have been inseparable from

equally dramatic developments in literature. Writers and intellectuals grappling with their own

roles in these events have raised in their work searching questions about the role of writers and liter-

ature in building a nation and reshaping society. Through selections of twentieth-century Chinese

fiction, prose, and film, we will explore the questions that writers were asking themselves. How do

writers cast their mission? Can writing change the world? How does literature "reflect" society, and

how does it affect it? As we consider these questions, we will also be reading each work closely to

explore and develop various approaches and methods of literary and cultural analysis.

Format: primarily discussion, with some informal lecture. Evaluation will be based upon class par-

ticipation, a few short writing assignments, and a final paper.

No prerequisites. All readings and class sessions will be in English, but students with sufficient Chi-

nese ability will be encouraged to do some of the readings in Chinese.

CHIN 275(F) China's Greatest Novel (Same as Comparative Literature 275)*

China's greatest novel, The Story of the Stone (also known as The Dream of the Red Chamber) was

written in the mid-eighteenth century, when China was the largest and richest state in the world.

Achieving breadth and nuance only found in the Western tradition a century later, this novel offers

what seems to be a realistic description of a wealthy extended family--with all its generational, gen-

der, and class conflicts, power struggles, love stories, and economic and entertainment activities. Yet

the novel also challenges the relationship between truth and fiction, reality and illusion, for the stone

is magical, given life by a Buddhist and a Daoist priest. We will read the novel through the perspec-

tives of literary studies, cultural studies, and social history, drawing upon secondary sources in these

fields to understand not only the story that most Chinese know but also a substantial amount about

traditional Chinese culture and society.

Format: discussion with some informal lecture. Evaluation will be based upon classroom perfor-

mance, a few short writing assignments, and one longer one.

No prerequisites. All readings and discussions will be in English. Enrollment limit: 18.

CHIN 301(F), 302(S) Upper-Intermediate Chinese*
Although the oral skills will continue to receive attention, there is at this level increased emphasis
on reading and writing. A major goal of the course will be developing students' reading proficiency
in standard written Chinese, the grammar and vocabulary of which differ considerably from the
colloquial written Chinese which was introduced during the first two years of instruction. About

CHIN 431(F) Introduction to Chinese Linguistics (Same as Linguistics 431)*

Is Chinese--whose nouns "lack" number and whose verbs have no tense--a monosyllabic, "primitive"

language? Are the Chinese characters a system of logical symbols or "idiographs," which indicate mean-

ing directly without regard to sound? Should (and could) the characters be done away with and alphabet-

ized? Are Cantonese, Hakka, and Taiwanese dialects or languages? And what is the relationship between

Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese? These are some of the questions we will be taking up in this

one-semester introduction to the scientific study of the Chinese language. Topics to be covered include: the

phonological, syntactical, and lexical structure of Modern Standard Chinese; the Chinese writing system;

the modern Chinese dialects; the history of the Chinese language; sociolinguistic aspects of Chinese; lan-

guage and politics in the Chinese-speaking countries; and the teaching of Chinese as a foreign/second lan-

guage. Readings in English and Chinese, with class discussion conducted primarily in Mandarin.

Evaluation will be based on classroom performance, homework, two short papers, and one longer paper.

   The department regularly offers four levels of language instruction in Modern Japanese, de-
signed to enable the student to become proficient in aural comprehension, speaking, reading, and
writing. Courses in Japanese literature in translation are also offered. The course numbering system
for Japanese is sequential. Students move from Japanese 101-102 to 201, 202, 301, 302, 401, and
402. Independent Study (Japanese 497, 498) is offered for students who have completed 402 or the
equivalent. Those students entering with previous proficiency in Japanese should see Professor Ya-
mamoto concerning placement. For the purpose of the distribution requirement, all courses in Japa-
nese are considered Division I.

After more than two centuries of National Seclusion, Japan's modern era began in 1868 with the

restoration of Imperial rule. Rapid and radical changes followed in every aspect of Japanese soci-

ety. This course will explore such changes through literature, film and performance. We will trace

how the authors of literary and other artistic works perceived, integrated and at times rejected expe-

riences of the new and the foreign. All readings and discussions will be in English.

                                  Chair, Professor KAREN B. KWITTER

Professors: KWITTER, PASACHOFF*. Visiting Professor: DEMIANSKI. Observatory Supervisor/
   Instructor: MARTIN.

   Why is the sky dark at night? What are those mysterious twinkling lights that dot the nighttime
sky? What is Earth's place in the Universe? Astronomy is the science that asks and tries to answer
questions like these. We have come a long way toward understanding what makes the sky appear as
it does and how the Universe is fashioned. The Astronomy Department offers courses for anyone
who is interested in learning about the Universe, and who would like to be able to follow new
astronomical discoveries as they are made. All courses in Astronomy satisfy the Division III re-
quirement. The Astrophysics major, administered jointly with the Physics Department, and the As-
tronomy major, are described below.

   The beginning astronomy courses are offered on two levels. Astronomy 101, 102, 104, and
330-type courses are intended primarily for non-science majors, and have no prerequisite. Astrono-
my 111 is designed for students with some exposure to or interest in physics. It has a prerequisite of
one year of high school physics or permission of the instructor, and a corequisite of Mathematics
103 or equivalent background in calculus.

   Most of the astronomy courses take advantage of our observational and computational facilities:
a 24" computer-controlled telescope with sensitive electronic detectors, and our own network of
computer workstations for image processing. The Astronomy Department homepage can be ac-
cessed on the World Wide Web at http://www.williams.edu/Astronomy.

ASTROPHYSICS MAJOR
   The Astrophysics major is designed for students who want a rigorous introduction to the field,

and includes not only those who plan graduate study in astronomy, astrophysics, or a closely related
field, but also those interested in a wide variety of careers. Alumni are not only astronomers but also
computer scientists, geologists, teachers, doctors, lawyers, business school professors, and so on.
In recent years, many astrophysics majors have had a second major in fields as wide ranging as
mathematics, geosciences, economics, and art history. This major emphasizes the description of the
Universe and its constituents in terms of physical processes. Potential Astrophysics majors should
consult early with members of the Astronomy and Physics Departments to determine their most
appropriate route to and through the major. An essential ingredient in such students' undergraduate
training is experience in physics and mathematics. Therefore, the major normally will begin in the
first year a student is at Williams with Physics 131 or 141 and Mathematics 104 in the fall, and con-
tinue with Physics 142 and Mathematics 105 in the spring. Students with very good background
placing them out of Physics 142 and out of Mathematics 104 may choose to take Physics 201 and
Mathematics 105 instead. Astronomy 111 will often be taken in the fall of the sophomore year;
however, many students take it in the fall of their first year at Williams, along with physics and
math. Students who might place out of physics courses should read the section on placement under
Physics. Students who place out of Physics 131 or 141 into Physics 142 should particularly consider
taking Astronomy 111 in the fall of their first year.

   In addition to the major courses described below, other courses in geosciences, mathematics, and
computer science may also be appropriate.

      Physics 301 Introductory Quantum Physics
      Mathematics 104 Calculus II
      Mathematics 105 Multivariable Calculus

   The total number of courses required for the Astrophysics major, an interdisciplinary major, is
eleven. Students entering with Advanced Placement in physics and/or mathematics may obtain
credit toward the major for the equivalent of Physics 141 and/or Mathematics 104 and/or 105 taken
elsewhere, but at least 8 courses in astronomy, physics, and mathematics must be taken at Williams.
There are some aspects of astrophysics that are closely related to chemistry or geosciences. In rec-
ognition of this relation, certain advanced courses in those departments can be accepted for credit
toward the Astrophysics major on a two-for-one basis. It is not possible to double major in Astro-
physics and Physics.

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN ASTROPHYSICS
   The honors degree in Astrophysics will be awarded on the basis of a senior thesis presenting the

results of an original observational, experimental, or theoretical investigation carried out by the stu-
dent under the direction of a faculty member in Astronomy or Physics. There are no specific grade
requirements (other than College-wide requirements for remaining in good academic standing) for
entry into the thesis research program; however, a student wishing to do a thesis should have dem-
onstrated both ability and motivation for independent work in previous courses and in any earlier
research involvement. Students doing theses will normally choose a topic and an advisor early in
the second semester of their junior year. During the senior year, those students whose proposals
have been approved will elect two courses and a winter study project in addition to the minimum
requirements for the major. Preparation for the thesis will occupy at least one course (Astrophysics
493) and the winter study project (Astrophysics 031). At the end of the winter study period, the de-
partments will decide, in consultation with each student, whether to admit that student to honors
candidacy. Both a written thesis and an oral presentation to faculty and fellow students are required.
The degree with honors will be awarded to those who meet these requirements with distinction. The
degree with highest honors will be awarded to those who fulfill the requirements with unusually
high distinction.

   The departments will be flexible with regard to the number and timing of courses devoted to the-
sis research within the general guidelines of two courses and a winter study project over and above
the minimum major requirements and the written and oral presentations, especially in cases of stu-
dents with advanced standing and/or summer research experience. Students considering unusual
requests are urged to consult with potential advisors or the department chairs as early as possible.

ASTRONOMY MAJOR
   The Astronomy major is designed for students with an interest in learning about many aspects of

modern astronomy, but who do not choose to take the advanced physics courses of the astrophysics
major. It is also appropriate as a second major for students concentrating in another field. The As-
tronomy major emphasizes understanding the observed properties of the physical systems that
comprise the known Universe, from the Sun and solar system, to the evolution of stars and star clus-
ters, to the Milky Way Galaxy, to external galaxies and clusters of galaxies. Because some knowl-
edge of physics and calculus is necessary to understand many astronomical phenomena, the As-
tronomy major requires the first two semesters each of the physics and calculus that are also re-
quired of Physics majors and Astrophysics majors.

   There are several possible routes through the Astronomy major, depending on preparation and
interest. Students considering a major in Astronomy should consult with members of the depart-
ment early and often. A first-year student, unsure about choosing between Astronomy and Astro-
physics, may wish to take not only Astronomy 111 but also Physics 131 or 141 and Mathematics
104 (if necessary) in the fall. Students who might place out of physics courses should read the sec-
tion on placement under Physics.

   The total number of courses required for the Astronomy major is nine. Students entering with
Advanced Placement in physics and/or math may obtain credit toward the major for the equivalent
of Physics 142 and/or Mathematics 105 taken elsewhere. There are some aspects of astronomy that
are closely related to chemistry or geosciences. In recognition of this, certain advanced courses in
those departments can be accepted for credit toward the Astronomy major.

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN ASTRONOMY
   The honors degree in Astronomy will be awarded on the basis of a senior thesis presenting the

results of an original observational, experimental, or theoretical investigation carried out by the stu-
dent under the direction of a faculty member in Astronomy. There are no specific grade require-
ments (other than College-wide requirements for remaining in good academic standing) for entry
into the thesis research program; however, a student wishing to do a thesis should have demon-
strated both ability and motivation for independent work in previous courses and in any earlier re-
search involvement. Students doing theses will normally choose a topic and an advisor early in the
second semester of their junior year. During the senior year, those students whose proposals have
been approved will elect two courses and a winter study project in addition to the minimum require-
ments for the major. Preparation for the thesis will occupy at least one course (Astronomy 493) and
the winter study project (Astronomy 031). At the end of the winter study period, the department will
decide, in consultation with each student, whether to admit that student to honors candidacy. Both a
written thesis and an oral presentation to faculty and fellow students are required. The degree with
honors will be awarded to those who meet these requirements with distinction. The degree with
highest honors will be awarded to those who fulfill the requirements with unusually high distinc-
tion.

   The department will be flexible with regard to the number and timing of courses devoted to thesis
research within the general guidelines of two courses and a winter study project over and above the
minimum major requirements and the written and oral presentations, especially in cases of students
with advanced standing and/or summer research experience. Students considering unusual re-
quests are urged to consult with potential advisors or the department chair as early as possible.

                         ASTRONOMY COURSES

COURSES FOR NON-MAJORS WITH NO PREREQUISITES

ASTR 101(F) Stars: From Suns to Black Holes

What makes a star shine? For how long will the Sun keep shining? What are black holes and how

can they form? Astronomy 101, a non-major, general introduction to the part of contemporary as-

tronomy that includes how stars form and how they end their existence, will provide answers to

these questions and more. The course gives special attention to the exciting discoveries of the past

few years. Topics include modern astronomical instruments such as the Hubble Space Telescope,

the Chandra X-ray Observatory, the 10-meter Keck Telescopes, and the Very Large Telescope in

Chile, and results from them; how astronomers interpret the light received from distant celestial

objects, the Sun as a typical star (and how its future will affect ours); and our modern understanding

of how stars work and how they change with time. We will also discuss how pulsars and black holes

result from the evolution of normal, massive stars and how giant black holes are at the center of

galaxies and quasars. We will evaluate the evidence for planets around stars other than the Sun. This

course is independent of and on the same level as Astronomy 102 and 104.

Evening observing sessions include use of the 24 and other telescopes to observe stars, nebulae,

planets, and galaxies; daytime observation of the Sun will also be possible. In addition, students will

have the opportunity to learn the constellations and to find their way around the sky.

In labs, students will be able to explore concepts discussed in class; students will also have the op-

portunity to use the department's multimedia facilities to learn more about the astronomical objects

they study and observe and to explore astronomy on the World Wide Web.

Format: lectures, three hours a week; observing sessions; and 4 labs per semester. Evaluation will

be based on two hour tests, a final exam, an observing portfolio, and laboratory reports.

No prerequisites. Non-major course.

ASTR 102(S) The Solar System--Our Planetary Home

What makes Earth different from all the other planets? Did Mars ever have running water? What is

Pluto? Will asteroids or comets collide with the Earth? What is a solar eclipse like? Astronomy 102,

a non-major, general introduction to the part of contemporary astronomy that comprises the study

of the solar system, will provide answers to these questions and more. We will cover the historical

development of humanity's understanding of the solar system, examining contributions by Aris-

totle, Ptolemy, Copernicus, Galileo, Newton, and others. The course gives special attention to ex-

citing discoveries of the past few years by space probes and by the Hubble Space Telescope. This

course is independent of, and on the same level as Astronomy 101 and 104.

ASTR 334(S) Black Holes and the Life Stories of Stars

This course deals with the evolution of stars in a nonmathematical fashion. Recent astronomical

observations with the most powerful telescopes, including the Hubble Space Telescope and Chan-

dra X-ray Observatory, revealed that the Universe contains many more black holes than previously

expected. Starting with a general description of stars and their evolution and the physical processes

taking place in their centers this course will discuss final outcomes of stellar evolution--white

dwarfs, neutron stars and black holes. We will discuss how neutron stars were discovered and later

lead to very important discovery of gravitational waves and extra-solar planets. Detailed discussion

of the bizarre properties of black holes will concentrate on relativistic effects, methods of observa-

tion and finally observational proofs of their existence. Hypothetical but very interesting possibili-

ties of time travel and quantum effects connected with black holes will be covered. Format: lecture/

discussion, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on two hour exams, a paper and a final

exam.

No prerequisites. Courses in the 330-sequence are meant as general-education courses for students

of all majors. Enrollment limit: 40. Not open to first-year students and sophomores. Non-major

course. Closed to Astronomy, Astrophysics, and Physics majors.

ASTR 211(F) Observation and Data Reduction Techniques in Astronomy

Astronomical observations have undergone a tremendous transformation as a result of the digital

computer revolution. Images and spectra that routinely required photographic exposures of many

hours are now possible in minutes, if not seconds, with modern electronic detectors. Along with this

colossal growth in the rate at which data can be acquired comes a concomitant increase in the com-

plexity of the effort required to extract useful information from that data. This course will introduce

techniques of obtaining and analyzing astronomical data. Regardless of the telescope or detector,

however, observing still requires knowledge of the sky; we will begin by learning about celestial

coordinates, basic spherical trigonometry, and time. The course will then move on to discussion of

CCD detectors, signal statistics, and the data reduction process, making use of data we obtain with

our 24" telescope and CCD, as well as data from telescopes at the National Optical Astronomy Ob-

servatories. Students will analyze images and spectra on department workstations using data reduc-

tion techniques standard among astronomers.

Evaluation will be based on problem sets, an hour test and a final project.

Prerequisites: Astronomy 111 (or Astronomy 101 and either 102 or 104 with permission) and Math-

   Biochemistry and molecular biology are dynamic fields which lie at the forefront of science.
They have provided important insights and advances in the elucidation of the relationship between
the structure and function of proteins, the molecules and cells of the immune system, enzyme struc-
ture and action, membrane assembly and structure, DNA and RNA structure, the nature of the ge-
netic code, and the molecular basis of gene regulation. Recombinant DNA and other biotechnolo-
gies have provided new and powerful tools which have exciting applications. Current applications
range from the diagnosis and treatment of disease to enzyme chemistry, developmental biology,
and the engineering of new crop plants.

   The Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Program is designed to provide students with an op-
portunity to explore living systems in molecular terms. Biochemistry and molecular biology are at
the interface between the chemical and biological methods of looking at nature, therefore, the pro-
gram draws heavily from these disciplines. While chemistry is concerned with the relationship be-
tween molecular structure and reactions, and biology focuses on cells and organisms, biochemistry
and molecular biology probe the details of the structures and interactions of molecules in living
systems in order to provide the foundation for a better understanding of biological molecules both
individually and as members of more complex structures.

PROGRAM
   While aspects of biochemistry and molecular biology can be very diverse, a common set of

chemical and biological principles underlie the more advanced topics. With this in mind, the pro-
gram has been structured to provide the necessary background in chemistry and biology and the
opportunity to study the many facets of the modern areas of the biochemical sciences. Students in-
terested in the Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Program should plan their course selection
carefully. Since it is expected that Biochemistry 321 and 322 would be taken in the junior year, stu-
dents are advised to take the prerequisites for those courses in both chemistry and biology during
their first two years at Williams. While the program is open to all students, it is expected that it will
appeal primarily to majors in biology and chemistry because of the number of courses required in
those fields. In addition to taking the required courses, students planning to complete the Biochem-
istry and Molecular Biology Program are strongly encouraged to elect courses in mathematics and
physics.

Biochemistry and Molecular Biology

THE FOLLOWING INTERDEPARTMENTAL SEQUENCE COURSES SERVE AS THE

CORE OF THE BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY PROGRAM
   Biochemistry 321 and 322 provide a comprehensive introduction to biochemistry. These courses taken

in conjunction with Biology 202 Genetics and Biology 306 Advanced Molecular Genetics provide a thor-
ough background in essentially all of the areas of modern biochemistry and molecular biology.

BIMO 321(F) Biochemistry I--Structure and Function of Biological Molecules (Same as

Biology 321 and Chemistry 321)

This course introduces the basic concepts of biochemistry with an emphasis on the structure and

function of biological macromolecules. Specifically, the structure of proteins and nucleic acids are

examined in detail in order to determine how their chemical properties and their biological behavior

result from those structures. Other topics covered include enzyme kinetics, mechanism and ca-

talysis and regulation; the molecular organization of biomembranes and membrane transport; and

the principles of recombinant DNA technologies. In addition, the principles and applications of the

methods used to characterize macromolecules in solution and the interactions between macromole-

cules are discussed.

The laboratory provides an opportunity to study the structure of macromolecules and to learn the

fundamental experimental techniques of biochemistry including electrophoresis and chromatogra-

phy.

Format: lectures, three hours a week; laboratory, four hours a week. Evaluation is based on three

hour exams, a final exam, problem sets and performance in the laboratories including lab reports.

Prerequisites: Chemistry 202 and Biology 101. No enrollment limit (expected: 25).

BIMO 322(S) Biochemistry II--Metabolism (Same as Biology 322 and Chemistry 322)

This lecture course provides an in-depth presentation of the complex metabolic reactions which are

central to life. Emphasis is placed on the biological flow of energy including alternative modes of

energy generation (aerobic, anaerobic, photosynthetic); the regulation and integration of the meta-

bolic pathways including compartmentalization and the transport of metabolites; and biochemical

reaction mechanisms including the structures and mechanisms of coenzymes. This comprehensive

study also includes the biosynthesis of small molecules (carbohydrates, lipids, amino acids, and

nucleotides).

Laboratory experiments introduce the principles and procedures used to study enzymatic reactions,

bioenergetics, and metabolic pathways.

Format: lectures, three hours a week; laboratory, four hours a week. Evaluation is based on quizzes,

an hour exam, a final exam, and performance in the laboratories including lab reports.

Prerequisites: Chemistry 202 and Biology 101. Enrollment limit: 40 (expected: 36). Preference giv-

en to junior and senior Biology and Chemistry majors and BIMO concentrators.

   Since the Chemistry Department counts two biology courses and the Biology Department counts
two chemistry courses toward the majors (each of which can be completed with only eight other
courses), a student majoring in either chemistry or biology would have to take only three additional
courses to complete the program.

aPlease note that the Chemistry Department is changing its curriculum beginning in the
2001-2002 year and many course numbers will be changing. Specific questions should be directed
to the Chair of Chemistry.

   The Biology curriculum has been designed to provide students a broad base for understanding
principles governing life processes at all levels, from biochemistry and cell biology to physiology
to environmental biology and behavior. Courses emphasize fundamentals common to all subdisci-
plines including the coupling of structure to function, the transfer of energy in living systems, com-
munication, and the molding of diversity by the evolutionary process. In upper-level courses and in
independent and honors research, students have the opportunity to investigate areas at the frontiers
of modern biology.

   Although the Biology major is specifically designed to provide a balanced curriculum in the
broader context of the liberal arts, it is also excellent preparation for graduate studies in medicine
and the life sciences.

MAJOR REQUIREMENTS
   In order to make the major accessible to students with diverse interests, required courses are kept

to a minimum. The Biology major is satisfied by nine courses, as follows:

   Biology 101 The Cell
   Biology 102 The Organism
   Biology 202 Genetics
   Any two 300-level courses, one of which must have a laboratory associated with it.
   Any one 400-level course.
   Any other three courses or any other two courses and Chemistry 201-202.

NOTE: Independent study courses and AMS 311 (Same as Biology 231) do not fulfill the 300-level
course requirement. Both WIOX 215, Biology: Ecology of Flowering Plants, and WIOX 216, Biol-
ogy: Evolution, in the Williams Oxford Program qualify for major credit.

Distribution Requirement
   In order to ensure that majors broaden their knowledge of biology, one of the elective courses for

the major must include a course covering biological processes at levels of organization above the
cell. Courses that satisfy this distribution requirement are indicated in the individual course descrip-
tion.

COURSE SELECTION AND PLACEMENT
   It is preferable for students who plan to major in biology, or think they may be interested in doing

so, to take Biology 101, 102 during their first year at Williams. It is also possible to begin the Biolo-
gy major during the sophomore year, although students should understand that it may require taking
several semesters with two or more biology courses.

   Students interested in biology, whether or not they intend to major in it, are encouraged to take
Biology 101, 102. It is also possible, with permission of the department, to take Biology 203 Ecolo-
gy, Biology 204 Animal Behavior, and Biology 220 Field Botany without prerequisite. Other biolo-
gy courses designed specifically for students who do not intend to take additional upper-level
courses in biology include Biology 132 Human Biology and Social Issues, Biology 134 The Trop-
ics: Biology and Social Issues, and Biology 133 Biology of Exercise and Nutrition. All of these
courses satisfy the Division III distribution requirement; in addition, Biology 134 satisfies the
Peoples and Cultures distribution requirement.

   Beginning students should normally enroll in Biology 101 and 102. Students with unusually
strong backgrounds in biology, such as those with outstanding performance on the College Board
Biology Advanced Placement Test, may be permitted to elect a sophomore-level course in lieu of
Biology 101 and/or Biology 102 upon successful completion of a departmental qualifying exam.

   Students interested in attending graduate school in biology are advised to take organic chemistry
(Chemistry 201-202).

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN BIOLOGY
   In order to be recommended for the degree with honors, a Biology major is normally expected to

have completed the equivalent of two semesters and a winter study (031) of independent research
culminating in a thesis which demonstrates outstanding achievement of an original and innovative
nature. Although the presentation of a thesis, and associated oral presentation in the fall and poster
defense in the spring, are required for consideration for a degree with honors, their completion
should not be interpreted as a guarantee of a degree with honors. The principal considerations in
admitting a student to the program of independent honors research will be mastery of fundamental
material and skills, ability to pursue independent study successfully, and demonstrated interest and
motivation. Students interested in participating in the honors program should consult with the de-
partment prior to spring break; approval must be received before spring registration in the junior
year.

   The minimum course requirements for a degree with honors in Biology are Biology 101, Biology
102, Biology 202, two 300-level biology courses (one of which must have a laboratory associated
with it), one 400-level biology course, Biology 493, Biology 494, WSP 031, and any other two
courses in biology (or any other one course and Chemistry 201-202).

   In addition to the normal honors route, which includes two semesters (Biology 493-494) and a
winter study of research (WSP 031) during senior year, students have the option, subject to the ap-
proval of their thesis advisor, to begin the honors research during winter study junior year or during
the second semester junior year. Students beginning honors in winter study of junior year would
take Biology 494 in the spring of their junior year followed by Biology 493 in the fall of their senior
year; students beginning honors during the second semester of junior year would take Biology 494
that semester, followed by Biology 493 in the fall of senior year and winter study research in the
winter of the senior year.

BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
   Students interested in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (BIMO) should consult the general

statement under Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. Biology majors not enrolled in the BIMO
Program can take Chemistry/Biology/Biochemistry 321 and 322 if they have required prerequi-
sites.

NEUROSCIENCE
   Students interested in Neuroscience should consult the general statement under Neuroscience.

BIOL 132(S) Human Biology and Social Issues

From reading the headlines in newspapers and magazines one gets the impression that human soci-

ety is on the verge of a wondrous transformation to be brought about by the application of new bio-

logical knowledge. Can science really provide us with a future that is free of disease and social

problems? Is biology the important underlying dictator of who we are and how we live our lives? Or

are we more than the sum of our biological parts?

In lectures, we'll examine recent scientific advances and/or setbacks in understanding and manipu-

lating human reproduction, development, inheritance, and health. In particular, research in the

areas of the Human Genome Project, gene therapy, cloning and cancer will be explored. In addition,

in discussion sections we will address the implications of this current research for individuals and

for society as a whole.

Format: lectures/discussions, approximately four hours per week. Evaluation will be based on hour

exams, a final exam, and participation on a discussion panel.

No prerequisites. Closed to Biology and Chemistry majors; does not satisfy premedical require-

ment in biology; does not count for Biology major credit. Enrollment limit: 80 (expected: 50). Pref-

erence given to seniors, first-years, sophomores, and juniors in that order.

BIOL 133(F) Biology of Exercise and Nutrition

This class, intended for the non-scientist, focuses on the impact of exercise and nutrition on the hu-

man body. We will discuss topics such as how different types of training influence exercise perfor-

mance; the changes that occur in the cardiovascular system during an exercise routine; the inherent

limits of the body to perform aerobic and anaerobic tasks; and long-term health consequences of a

lifetime of activity or inactivity. We will also examine how nutrition and metabolism affect body

composition. For example, we will rigorously and scientifically scrutinize the use of "fad" diets as a

means to lose weight.

Format: Course work will consist of lectures and hands-on experiences with equipment used in ex-

ercise physiology, all during regular lecture hours. Evaluation will be based on exams.

No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 200 (expected: 150). Preference given to seniors, juniors, soph-

omores, and first-years in that order. Does not count for major credit in Biology.

BIOL 134(F) The Tropics: Biology and Social Issues (Same as Environmental Studies 134)*
Intended for the non-scientist, this course explores the biological dimensions of social issues in
tropical societies, and focuses specifically on the peoples and cultures of tropical regions in Africa,
Asia, Latin America, Oceanea, and the Caribbean. Tropical issues have become prominent on a
global scale, and many social issues in the tropics are inextricably bound to human ecology, evolu-
tion, and physiology. The course begins with a survey of the tropical environment of humans, in-
cluding major climatic and habitat features. The place of the tropics in human evolution is then cov-
ered, with treatments of recent advances in paleontology and molecular biology and their implica-
tions for human cultural diversity. The next section focuses on human population biology, and em-
phasizes demography and the role of disease. The final part of the course covers the place of human

societies in local and global ecosystems including the challenges of tropical food production, the

importance of organic diversity, and the interaction of humans with their supporting ecological en-

vironment.

Format: lectures, three hours a week. Evaluation will be based on a midterm, a short paper, and a

final exam.

No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 100 (expected: 80). Preference given to seniors, juniors, sopho-

mores, and first-years in that order. Does not count for major credit in Biology.

BIOL 202(F) Genetics

Genetics, classically defined as the study of heredity, has evolved into a discipline whose limits are

continually expanded by innovative molecular technologies. This course covers the experimental

basis for our current understanding of the inheritance, structures, and functions of genes. It

introduces approaches used by contemporary geneticists and molecular biologists to explore ques-

tions about aspects of biology ranging from embryonic development to aging. The laboratory part

of the course provides an experimental introduction to modern genetic analysis. Laboratory experi-

ments include linkage analysis, bacterial transformation with plasmids, DNA restriction mapping,

and computer-based cloning.

Format: lectures/laboratory, six hours a week. Evaluation will be based on hour exams, a final

exam, laboratory reports, and problem sets.

BIOL 203(F) Ecology (Same as Environmental Studies 203)

This course combines lectures with field and indoor laboratory exercises to explore factors that de-

termine the distribution and abundance of plants and animals in natural systems. The course begins

with an overall view of global patterns and then builds from the population to the ecosystem level.

An emphasis is given to basic ecological principles and relates them to current environmental is-

sues. Selected topics include population dynamics (competition, predation, coevolution); commu-

nity interactions (succession, food chains and diversity) and ecosystem function (biogeochemical

cycles, energy flow).

Format: lecture/laboratory, six hours a week. Evaluation will be based on lab reports, hour exams,

and a final exam.

BIOL 204(S) Animal Behavior
Making sense of what we see while watching animals closely is both an enthralling pastime and a
discipline that draws on many aspects of biology. Explanations can be found on many levels: evolu-
tionary theory tells us why certain patterns have come to exist, molecular biology can help us under-
stand how those patterns are implemented, neuroscience gives insights as to how the world appears
to the behaving animal, endocrinology provides information on how suites of behaviors are regu-
lated. The first part of the course focuses upon how descriptive studies provide the basis for formu-
lating questions about behavior as well as the statistical methods used to evaluate the answers to
these questions. We then consider the behavior of individuals, both as it is mediated by biological
mechanisms and as it appears from an evolutionary perspective. The second half of the course is
primarily concerned with the behaviors of groups of animals from a wide variety of vertebrate and
invertebrate species. We will concentrate upon the stimuli, responses, and internal mechanisms that
maintain social systems as well as the selection pressures that drive animals toward a particular so-
cial system.
Format: lectures/laboratory, six hours a week. Evaluation will be based upon examinations, lab re-
ports, and a research paper.

BIOL 301(F) Developmental Biology

Developmental biology has undergone rapid growth in recent years and is becoming a central orga-

nizing discipline that links cells and molecular biology, evolution, anatomy and medicine. We are

now beginning to have a molecular understanding of fascinating questions such as how cells decide

their fate, how patterns are created, how male and females are distinguished, and how organisms

came to be different. We have also discovered how the misregulation of important development

regulatory genes can lead to a variety of known cancers and degenerative diseases in humans. In

this course we will examine these and related topics combining a rich classical literature with mod-

ern genetic and molecular analyses.

BIOL 303(F) Sensory Biology

How are important conditions or changes in the environment received and transduced by organ-

isms? We will examine the molecular and cellular bases of the transduction and encoding of physi-

cal phenomena such as light, sound, and chemicals in a variety of organisms, including plants and

invertebrates. We will focus on questions such as: What properties of the physical world are sensed

(and which ones are ignored)? What mechanisms are used to convert physical or chemical energy

into a changed biological state within a cell? What are the consequences of this changed state? How

are differences in the attributes of one modality in the physical world represented by differences in

molecular and cellular processes? Among the examples we will consider are: a comparison of visu-

al structures and pigments in bacteria, plants, arthropods, molluscs, and primates; sound transduc-

tion and its musical consequences; and the olfactory system of mammals - which is able to produce

a large variety of receptors specific to an individual's experience.

BIOL 411(F) Plasticity in the Nervous System

The ability to respond to environmental stimuli and to adapt to change is fundamental to all aspects

of higher cognitive function. Processes as diverse as learning and memory, the development of al-

ternative neuronal pathways during recovery from trauma, the acquisition of pharmacological tol-

erance and the recognition of olfactory cues in maternal/newborn bonding all depend upon such

neuronal plasticity. This course will consider a variety of short-term and long-term plastic phenom-

ena in the nervous system, focusing on the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms. Specific

topics may include plasticity of synaptic function (e.g., LTP in the hippocampus and its possible

relevance to memory, cellular correlates of habituation and sensitization in Aplysia), plasticity dur-

ing development (neurite outgrowth, plasticity of neuronal phenotype, the acquisition of excitabil-

ity) and plasticity under various pathological conditions (kindling and epilepsy, drug addiction, re-

sponse to injury). The class will emphasize reading and criticism of articles in the primary litera-

ture.

Format: discussions, three hours a week. Evaluation will be based on class participation and several

short papers.

Prerequisites: Biology 202 and Biology 205 or Biology 212. Enrollment limit: 2 sections of 12 each

BIOL 412(S) Biochemical Regulatory Mechanisms

All biological systems are subject to regulation; in recent years, we have come to understand a great

deal about a wide range of regulatory systems. This course, which will explore the biochemical

mechanisms by which regulatory molecules control cellular processes, is designed to provide a

synthetic view of regulatory events in the living cell. Topics will include the cell cycle; cell signal-

ing; mechanisms of action of regulatory molecules; and the molecular mechanisms of cancer, with

the aim of describing cancer as a derangement of normal regulatory events that control cell growth,

division, and differentiation. Class discussions will focus on readings in the original literature.

BIOL 413(F) Molecular Basis of Biological Clocks

Circadian rhythms have been described in all organisms studied, including humans, a wide range of

other eukaryotes and several prokaryotes. With periods of about 24 hours, these rhythms regulate

biochemical, cellular, physiological and behavioral activities. Circadian rhythms are generated by

cellular clocks--genetically determined internal pacemakers that maintain their oscillations in the

absence of environmental cues but may be reset by periodicities in the environment, especially the

light-dark cycle. Only recently have we begun to understand how circadian rhythms are generated

and controlled at the cellular level. This course will explore the basic biochemical features of bio-

logical clocks with the aim of understanding their crucial role in regulating key biological parame-

ters, such as enzyme levels, levels of hormones and other regulatory molecules, and activity and

sleep cycles. Class discussions will focus on readings in the original literature.

MAJOR
   Through a variety of individual courses and sequential programs, the department provides an

opportunity for students to explore the nature and significance of chemistry, an area of important
achievement in our quest for knowledge about ourselves and the world around us. The student of
chemistry is able to become aware of the special viewpoint of chemists, the general nature of chemi-
cal investigation, some of its important results, how these results are expressed, and something of
their significance within the fields of science and in the area of human endeavor as a whole.

   A major in chemistry can be achieved in several ways, preferably beginning in the student's first
year at Williams, but also beginning in the sophomore year. Building on a foundation in general
chemistry, organic chemistry, and physical chemistry, a student elects additional advanced courses
to complete a major that is consistent with his or her background in other sciences, interests, and
goals. A student's program might emphasize biochemistry, organic chemistry, physical chemistry,
or inorganic chemistry, with additional courses available in analytical chemistry, environmental
science, and materials science. Students considering a major in chemistry should consult with a
member of the department as early as possible in order to plan a program which best suits their inter-
ests and abilities and which makes full use of their previous preparation.

   Usually the requirements for the major are fulfilled by completing "Required Courses" and the
appropriate number of "Elective Courses." Starting at the 300 level, at least three of the courses
taken must have a laboratory component. In addition, the department has a number of "Independent
Research Courses" which, while they do not count toward completion of the major, provide a
unique opportunity to pursue an independent research project under the direction of a faculty mem-
ber.

   The Chemistry Department curriculum and major requirements will change beginning in the fall
of the 2001-2002 academic year. First year students or sophomores who plan to begin a chemistry
major, or who simply want to take introductory chemistry courses, should consult the section below
entitled "New Curriculum" to make course selections. Students who have already begun a chemis-
try major, or who are completing introductory courses, are subject to somewhat different require-
ments and should consult the table on page 117 entitled "Former Curriculum" to make course selec-
tions. Questions about meeting major requirements in either curriculum structure should be made
directly to the Department Chair.

aStudents begin the major in the first year with either Chemistry 151 or 153 (based upon placement
 test results and consultation with the chair). Students with outstanding performance on the College
 Board Chemistry Advanced Placement Test or the International Baccalaureate Exam, and having
 consulted with the chair, may begin the major with Chemistry 155 and will place out of Chemistry
 256. The first year is completed with Chemistry 156. In the second year at the introductory level,
 students take either Chemistry 251 or 255 and Chemistry 256.
bStudents wishing to pursue a research-based version of the laboratory program in Chemistry 251
 may elect 255 after consultation with the chair.
cChemistry 256 is the fourth course in the Department's Introductory-level sequence. This course is
 a prerequisite (or co-requisite) for all Quantitative and Advanced-level electives.
dTo complete the major in Chemistry, students must elect any one of Chemistry 361, 364, 366, or
 367. The course elected, in consultation with the chair or major advisor, will depend on the stu-
 dent's future plans.
eChemistry 361 and 366 are strongly recommended for anyone considering graduate school in
 chemistry.
fThe Chemistry major requires either nine semester chemistry courses or eight semester chemistry
 courses plus two approved courses from among the following: Biology 101, 102; Computer Sci-
 ence 134; Mathematics 103, 104, 105; Physics 131, 132; or any courses in these departments for
 which the approved courses are prerequisites. No more than two advanced-level organic courses
 may be counted toward completion of the major.

   Completion of any one of the advanced-level elective courses will satisfy the College require-
ment that a student complete a major seminar.

   For the purpose of assisting students in selecting a program consistent with their interests, the
following groupings of electives and faculty advisors are suggested. However, a case can be made
for selecting courses from the different groups.

   Biochemistry: Chemistry 321, Chemistry 322, Chemistry 324, Chemistry 341, Chemistry 342, Chemis-
   try 344, Chemistry 367, Chemistry 426, Chemistry 436T, Chemistry 464T (Students interested in bio-
   chemistry should consult with Mr. Kaplan, Mr. Chihade, or Mr. Lovett.)

   Organic Chemistry: Chemistry 324, Chemistry 341, Chemistry 342, Chemistry 344, Chemistry 441T
   (Students interested in organic chemistry should consult with Mr. Chihade, Mr. Markgraf, Mr. Richard-
   son, or Mr. Smith.)

   Physical and Inorganic Chemistry: Chemistry 332, Chemistry 335, Chemistry 361, Chemistry 364,
   Chemistry 366, Chemistry 368, Chemistry 436T, Chemistry 464T (Students interested in physical
   chemistry should consult with Mr. Chang, Ms. Koehler, Mr. Peacock-López, or Mr. Thoman. Students
   interested in inorganic chemistry should consult with Ms. Park or Mr. Schofield. Students interested in
   materials science should consult with Ms. Park.)

   The Chemistry major provides excellent preparation for graduate study in chemistry, bio-
chemistry, chemical engineering, environmental science, medicine, and the medical sciences.

Chemistry

The major can also be useful to those whose later professional or business careers may be re-
lated to chemical materials or processes. While any accepted route through the major would
permit a student to proceed to graduate study in chemistry, three electives should be considered
a minimum, and the particular importance of Chemistry 321, 335, 361, 364, and 366 as prepara-
tion for advanced study should be noted. In addition, at least a semester of research and courses
in computer science are strongly recommended.

   Students with principal interests outside of the sciences may extend a secondary school founda-
tion in chemistry by electing a basic two-semester introductory course of a general nature or they
may elect semester courses designed for non-majors. All courses in chemistry satisfy the distribu-
tion requirement.

   The department is accredited by the American Chemical Society (A.C.S.), a professional body of
academic, industrial, and research chemists. The A.C.S. suggests the following courses for some-
one considering graduate study or work in chemistry or a related area. Students completing these
courses are designated Certified A.C.S. Majors: 151 (153 or 155), 156, 251 (255), 256, 335, 361,
364, 366, 493-494; and at least two courses from 321, 322, 342, 344, 368, 426.

BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
   Students interested in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology should consult the general statement

under Biochemistry and Molecular Biology in the Courses of Instruction.

MATERIALS SCIENCE
   Students interested in Materials Science are encouraged to elect courses from the Materials Sci-

ence cluster offered jointly with the Physics Department, and should consult the information on
page 229 describing this option.

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN CHEMISTRY
   The degree with honors in Chemistry provides students with an opportunity to undertake an inde-

pendent research project under the supervision of a faculty member, and to report on the nature of
the work in two short oral presentations and in a written thesis.

   Chemistry majors who are candidates for the degree with honors take the following in addition to
a major listed above:

   Chemistry 493-W31-494 Senior Research and Thesis

   The principal considerations in admitting a student to a program of independent research are
mastery of fundamental materials and skills, ability to pursue independent study successfully,
and demonstrated student interest and motivation. In addition, to enroll in these courses lead-
ing to a degree with honors, a student must have a B- average in all chemistry courses or the
permission of the chair. At the end of the first semester, the department reviews the student's
progress and determines whether the student is a candidate for a degree with honors. The desig-
nation of a degree with honors in Chemistry or a degree with highest honors in Chemistry is
based primarily on a departmental evaluation of the accomplishments in these courses and on
the quality of the thesis. Completion of the research project in a satisfactory manner and prepa-
ration of a well-written thesis usually results in a degree with honors. In cases where a student
has demonstrated unusual commitment and initiative resulting in an outstanding thesis based
on original experimental results, combined with a strong record in all of his or her chemistry
courses, the department may elect to award a degree with highest honors in Chemistry.

EXCHANGE AND TRANSFER STUDENTS
   Students from other institutions wishing to register for courses in chemistry involving college-

level prerequisites should do so in person with a member of the Chemistry Department. Registra-
tion should take place by appointment during the spring semester prior to the academic year in
which courses are to be taken. Students are requested to have with them transcripts of the relevant
previous college work.

eThe Chemistry major requires either nine semester chemistry courses or eight semester chemistry
 courses plus two approved courses from among the following: Biology 101, 102; Computer Sci-
 ence 134; Mathematics 103, 104, 105; Physics 131, 132; or any courses in these departments for
 which the approved courses are prerequisites. No more than two advanced-level organic courses
 may be counted toward completion of the major.

   Completion of any one of the advanced-level elective courses will satisfy the College require-
ment that a student complete a major seminar.

   For the purpose of assisting students in selecting a program consistent with their interests, the
following groupings of electives and faculty advisors are suggested. However, a case can be made
for selecting courses from the different groups.

   Biochemistry: Chemistry 303, Chemistry 308, Chemistry 310, Chemistry 311, Chemistry 314T,
   Chemistry 321, Chemistry 322, Chemistry 406 (Students interested in biochemistry should con-
   sult with Mr. Kaplan, Mr. Chihade, or Mr. Lovett.)

   Organic Chemistry: Chemistry 303, Chemistry 310, Chemistry 311, Chemistry 312T, Chemistry
   313 (Students interested in organic chemistry should consult with Mr. Chihade, Mr. Markgraf,
   Mr. Richardson, or Mr. Smith.)

   Physical and Inorganic Chemistry: Chemistry 304, Chemistry 305, Chemistry 313, Chemistry
   314T, Chemistry 316T, Chemistry 318, Chemistry 401 (Students interested in physical chemis-
   try should consult with Mr. Chang, Ms. Koehler, Mr. Peacock-López, or Mr. Thoman. Students
   interested in inorganic chemistry should consult with Ms. Park or Mr. Schofield. Students inter-
   ested in materials science should consult with Ms. Park.)

   The Chemistry major provides excellent preparation for graduate study in chemistry, biochemis-
try, chemical engineering, environmental science, medicine, and the medical sciences. The major
can also be useful to those whose later professional or business careers may be related to chemical
materials or processes. While any accepted route through the major would permit a student to pro-
ceed to graduate study in chemistry, three electives should be considered a minimum, and the par-
ticular importance of Chemistry 301, 302, 304, 305, and 321 as preparation for advanced study
should be noted. In addition, at least a semester of research and courses in computer science are
strongly recommended.

   Students with principal interests outside of the sciences may extend a secondary school founda-
tion in chemistry by electing a basic two-semester introductory course of a general nature or they
may elect semester courses designed for nonmajors. All courses in chemistry satisfy the distribu-
tion requirement.

   The department is accredited by the American Chemical Society (A.C.S.), a professional body of
academic, industrial, and research chemists. The A.C.S. suggests the following courses for some-
one considering graduate study or work in chemistry or a related area. Students completing these
courses are designated Certified A.C.S. Majors: 101, 102 (103-104), 201-202, 301, 302, 304, 305,
493-494; and at least two courses from 303, 311, 321, 322, 401, 406.

BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
   Students interested in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology should consult the general statement

under Biochemistry and Molecular Biology in the Courses of Instruction.

MATERIALS SCIENCE
   Students interested in Materials Science are encouraged to elect courses from the Materials Sci-

ence cluster offered jointly with the Physics Department, and should consult the information on
page 229 describing this option.

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN CHEMISTRY
   The degree with honors in Chemistry provides students with an opportunity to undertake an inde-

pendent research project under the supervision of a faculty member, and to report on the nature of
the work in two short oral presentations and in a written thesis.

   Chemistry majors who are candidates for the degree with honors take the following in addition to
a major listed above:

   Chemistry 493-W31-494 Senior Research and Thesis.
   The principal considerations in admitting a student to a program of independent research are
mastery of fundamental materials and skills, ability to pursue independent study successfully, and
demonstrated student interest and motivation. In addition, to enroll in these courses leading to a
degree with honors, a student must have a B- average in all chemistry courses or the permission of

                                                ­ 118 ­
                                              Chemistry

the chair. At the end of the first semester, the department reviews the student's progress and deter-
mines whether the student is a candidate for a degree with honors. The designation of a degree with
honors in Chemistry or a degree with highest honors in Chemistry is based primarily on a depart-
mental evaluation of the accomplishments in these courses and on the quality of the thesis. Comple-
tion of the research project in a satisfactory manner and preparation of a well-written thesis usually
results in a degree with honors. In cases where a student has demonstrated unusual commitment and
initiative resulting in an outstanding thesis based on original experimental results, combined with a
strong record in all of his or her chemistry courses, the department may elect to award a degree with
highest honors in Chemistry.

EXCHANGE AND TRANSFER STUDENTS
   Students from other institutions wishing to register for courses in chemistry involving college-

level prerequisites should do so in person with a member of the Chemistry Department staff. Regis-
tration should take place by appointment during the spring semester prior to the academic year in
which courses are to be taken. Students are requested to have with them transcripts of the relevant
previous college work.

COURSES FOR NON-MAJORS WITH NO PREREQUISITES

CHEM 113(F) Chemistry and Crime: From Sherlock Holmes to Modern Forensic Science
In this course, designed for students who do not plan to major in the natural sciences, we use a case-
oriented approach to explore selected topics of forensic science. These include: (1) the scientific
and technological foundation for the examination of physical, chemical, and biological items of
evidence, and (2) the scope of expert qualifications and testimony, the legal status of scientific tech-
niques, and the admissibility of the results in evidence. The analysis of trace evidence, including
glass, soil, gunpowder residues and bullet fragments, and inorganic and heavy metal poisons are
discussed through an understanding of the basic concepts of chemistry and analytical chemistry.
Forensic toxicology and pharmacology are applied to the analysis of alcohol, poisons, and drugs
based upon the principles of organic chemistry and biochemistry. The characterization of blood and
other body fluids necessitate an understanding of serology and molecular genetics. The cases which
stimulate the exploration of these areas include: the John and Robert Kennedy assassinations, the
Jeffrey MacDonald case (Fatal Vision), the Wayne Williams case, the deaths of celebrities Marilyn
Monroe, John Belushi, and Janis Joplin, the authenticity of the Shroud of Turin, the Lindberg baby
kidnapping, the Tylenol poisonings, and the identity of Anastasia.
An interactive laboratory program provides an appreciation of scientific experimentation in gener-
al and the work of a crime lab in particular. It includes an analysis of evidence collected at various
crime scenes and provides an opportunity to learn forensic techniques such as chromatography (for
ink, drug, and fire accelerant analysis), spectroscopy (for alcohol and drug analysis), and electro-
phoresis (for DNA fingerprinting).
This course is designed for the non-science major who does not intend to pursue a career in the natu-
ral sciences.
Format: lectures, three hours a week; laboratory, four hours a week. Evaluation is based on problem
sets, and/or quizzes, hour tests, a final exam, and laboratory performance.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 45 (expected: 45).

Hour: 11:00-11:50 MWF  Labs: 1-5 M, T, W      L. KAPLAN

CHEM 115(S) AIDS: The Disease and Search for a Cure
Since the discovery of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) in 1983, modern techniques of
molecular biology have revealed much about its structure and life cycle. The intensity of the scien-
tific investigation directed at HIV-1 is unprecedented in history. We now know more about this vi-
rus than perhaps any other known pathogen. However, the early optimism concerning the prospects
for an effective AIDS vaccine has now waned and HIV strains that are resistant to drug therapies are
common. We are now nearly two decades into the AIDS pandemic and the World Health Organiza-
tion estimates that there are now 59 million HIV-infected persons worldwide.
We examine the molecular biology of the HIV virus, the molecular targets of anti-HIV drugs, and
the prospects for a cure. We discuss the origin, epidemiology and modes of transmission of HIV-1
and HIV-2, and look at how HIV-1 interacts with the human immune system. We also discuss both
old and new methods of vaccine development and the prospects for making an effective AIDS vac-
cine.
This course is designed for the non-science major who does not intend to pursue a career in the natu-
ral sciences.

CHEM 301, 302, and 306 Physical Chemistry

The following three courses provide a thorough introduction to physical chemistry. Students who
wish to explore the physical aspects of chemistry in greater depth than provided by 306 are urged to
consider 301, 302. This pattern of course elections is particularly appropriate for those students
who have taken Chemistry 103-104/108.
The focus of thermodynamics in 301 makes this course of special interest to students considering
careers in biochemistry, biology, geology, engineering, and physics. First-year students, sopho-
mores, and other students not meeting the formal prerequisites listed below, but who possess the
basic skills provided by those courses, may register for 301 with the instructor's approval.

CHEM 301(F) Physical Chemistry: Thermodynamics

The thermodynamic laws provide us with our most powerful and general scientific principles for

predicting the direction of spontaneous change in physical, chemical, and biological systems. This

course develops the concepts of energy, entropy, free energy, temperature (and absolute zero), heat,

work, and chemical potential within the framework of classical thermodynamics. The principles

developed are applied to a variety of problems: chemical reactions, phase changes, energy technol-

ogy, and environmental science.

Laboratory experiments provide quantitative and practical demonstrations of the theory of real and

ideal systems studied in class.

Format: lectures, three hours a week; laboratory, four hours a week. Evaluation is based on problem

CHEM 302(S) Physical Chemistry: Structure and Dynamics
This course integrates a number of physical chemistry topics. An introduction to quantum mechan-
ics provides students with the basis for understanding molecular structure. Statistical mechanics is
then used to demonstrate the formal and quantitative link between the properties of single mole-
cules and the thermodynamic and kinetic behavior of macroscopic collections of molecules. Rate
laws, enzyme kinetics, and transport properties are discussed. Applications of these principles are
chosen from a variety of areas, including polymer chemistry, biochemistry, photochemistry, and
solid and liquid state chemistry. Quantitative laboratory experiments and consultation with the
scientific literature provide the background necessary for carrying out an independent theoretical
or experimental project.

CHEM 310(S) Enzyme Kinetics and Reaction Mechanisms
Enzymes are complex biological molecules capable of catalyzing chemical reactions with very
high efficiency, stereo-selectivity and specificity. The study of enzymatically-catalyzed reactions
gives insight into the study of organic reaction mechanisms in general, and into the topic of catalysis
especially. This course explores the methods and frameworks for determining mechanisms of enzy-
matic reactions. These methods are based on a firm foundation of chemical kinetics and organic
reaction mechanisms. The first portion of the course is devoted to enzyme kinetics and catalysis
including discussions of transition state theory, structure-reactivity relationships, Michaelis-Men-
ten parameters, pH-dependence of catalysis, and methods for measuring rate constants. As the
course progresses, the concepts of mechanism and its elucidation is applied to specific enzymatic

                                            ­ 121 ­

CHEM 312T(S) Heterocyclic Chemistry

The organic chemistry of heterocyclic compounds containing N, O, and/or S atoms is presented.

The principal topics include the preparation, physical properties, and reactivity of five- and six-

membered ring systems. Total syntheses of biologically-active natural products containing hetero-

cyclic units are discussed.

The instructor sets the topic for the weekly meetings. All students are responsible for the readings

and problem sets, which are based on research journals, monographs, and advanced-level text-

books. Two students give forty-five-minute oral presentations; the other students are responsible

for queries, amplification, and problem sets.

Format: tutorial. Evaluation is based on quality of presentations, class participation, problem sets,

and a term paper on the total synthesis of a complex natural product. There are no written exams.

CHEM 314T(F) A Theoretical Approach to Biological Phenomena

This course focuses on the application of physicochemical theoretical methods to biophysical and

biochemical systems. The basis of the classical theoretical models, as well as new theoretical ap-

proaches to biological phenomena are discussed. The predictions of these theoretical models are

compared to the results obtained by experiment. The topics include a thermodynamic approach to

biochemical reactions and bioenergetics; receptor-mediated endocytosis; nonequilibrium kinetics

of concentrated enzyme solutions; analysis of the differences between direct transfer and diffusion-

al transfer of metabolites; and mathematical immunology, with an emphasis on the complement

system.

After an initial meeting of all students, groups of two students meet with the instructor weekly for

fifty minutes where one student gives an oral presentation. Both students are responsible for read-

ings and written solutions to assigned problems based on advanced-level textbooks, review ar-

ticles, and research journals. The last week is devoted to the presentation of final projects.

Format: tutorial. Evaluation is based on the quality of presentations, class participation, written es-

says, solutions to problems, and an oral final exam.

Prerequisites: Chemistry 301 or 306 and a basic knowledge of applied mathematics as provided by

CHEM 318(F) Materials Science: The Chemistry and Physics of Materials (Same as Physics
318)
Materials Science is a broad study of the physical properties of substances, such as hardness, elas-
ticity, electrical conductivity, and optical properties. This course investigates the relationship be-
tween microscopic structure and macroscopic properties of polymers (plastics, elastomers, liquid
crystals), electronic materials (semiconductors, conducting polymers, and superconductors) and
solids (metals, magnets, ceramics, minerals, and glasses). We approach these topics from both
physical and chemical perspectives, reflecting the interdisciplinary nature of the field. For instance,

we explore how the underlying structure of materials arises from quantum mechanics and how tem-

perature determines collective response properties such as elasticity or conductivity. This course

also studies the design of new materials and their synthesis at the molecular level.

Format: lectures, three hours a week. Evaluation is based on weekly problem sets, reviews of re-

search articles, one hour exam, and a final exam.

Prerequisites: one year of introductory Chemistry (101,102 or 103-104), one year of introductory

Physics (131,132 or 141,142), and one 200-level course in either Chemistry or Physics; or permis-

sion of instructors. No enrollment limit (expected: 20).

CHEM 321(F) Biochemistry I--Structure and Function of Biological Molecules (Same as

Biology 321 and Biochemistry and Molecular Biology 321)

This course introduces the basic concepts of biochemistry with an emphasis on the structure and

function of biological macromolecules. Specifically, the structure of proteins and nucleic acids are

examined in detail in order to determine how their chemical properties and their biological behavior

result from those structures. Other topics covered include enzyme kinetics, mechanism and ca-

talysis and regulation; the molecular organization of biomembranes and membrane transport; and

the principles of recombinant DNA technologies. In addition, the principles and applications of the

methods used to characterize macromolecules in solution and the interactions between macromole-

cules are discussed.

The laboratory provides an opportunity to study the structure of macromolecules and to learn the

fundamental experimental techniques of biochemistry including electrophoresis and chromatogra-

phy.

Format: lectures, three hours a week; laboratory, four hours a week. Evaluation is based on three

hour exams, a final exam, problem sets and performance in the laboratories including lab reports.

This lecture course provides an in-depth presentation of the complex metabolic reactions which are

central to life. Emphasis is placed on the biological flow of energy including alternative modes of

energy generation (aerobic, anaerobic, photosynthetic); the regulation and integration of the meta-

bolic pathways including compartmentalization and the transport of metabolites; and biochemical

reaction mechanisms including the structures and mechanisms of coenzymes. This comprehensive

study also includes the biosynthesis of small molecules (carbohydrates, lipids, amino acids, and

nucleotides).

Laboratory experiments introduce the principles and procedures used to study enzymatic reactions,

bioenergetics, and metabolic pathways.

Format: lectures, three hours a week; laboratory, four hours a week. Evaluation is based on quizzes,

an hour exam, a final exam, and performance in the laboratories including lab reports.

CHEM 401(F) Quantum Chemistry and Molecular Spectroscopy

This course provides an introduction to the basic principles of quantum mechanics and their ap-

plication to problems of chemical interest such as chemical bonding, chemical reactivity, and mo-

lecular spectroscopy. Emphasis is placed upon developing an understanding of the quantum me-

chanical basis for classical chemical concepts and introducing students to current research applica-

tions. The laboratory provides an opportunity to utilize quantum mechanics in the interpretation of

optical and magnetic resonance spectroscopy measured on the modern instruments available in the

department. Several seminar sessions give the student direct experience with computational tech-

niques in modern quantum chemistry. Computer experience is desirable.

   The course offerings in Classics enable students to explore the ancient Greek, Roman, and Gre-
co-Roman worlds from various perspectives: art, archaeology, philosophy, religion, and especially
literature and history. Courses are of two types: language (Greek and Latin) and translation (Classi-
cal Civilization). The 100-level language courses are intensive introductions to Greek and Latin
grammar; the 200-level language courses combine comprehensive grammar review with readings
from Greek or Latin texts of pivotal historical periods; the 400-level language courses explore in
depth selected authors or topics and the methods of analysis appropriate to each of them. Courses in
which texts are read in translation provide both introductory surveys and opportunities for more
specialized study of the ancient Greco-Roman world from earliest historical times through late an-
tiquity.

MAJOR
   Majors and prospective majors are encouraged to consult with the department's faculty to ensure

a well-balanced and comprehensive selection of Classics courses appropriate to their individual in-
terests. A course or courses in ancient history are strongly recommended. Majors may also benefit
from advice on courses offered in other departments which would complement their particular in-
terests in Classics. A reading knowledge of French, German, and Italian is useful for any study in
Classics and is required in at least two of these modern languages by graduate programs in classics,
ancient history, classical art and archaeology, and medieval studies.

   The department offers two routes to the major: Classics and Classical Civilization.

   Classics: (1) Six courses in Greek and/or Latin, with at least two 400-level courses in one lan-
guage; (2) Three additional courses, elected from the offerings in Greek, Latin, or Classical Civili-
zation or from approved courses in other departments.

   Classical Civilization: (1) Either Classics 101 or 102, and either Classics 222 or 223; (2) Three
additional courses from the offerings in Classical Civilization or from approved courses in other
departments. (3) Three courses in Greek or Latin with at least one at the 400 level, or four courses in
one language at any level. (4) A senior independent study is normally required to complete the Clas-
sical Civilization major. Several of the courses elected, including the independent study, should re-
late to each other in such a way as to reflect a concentration on a particular genre, period, or problem
of Greek and Roman civilization, including topics in ancient art and archaeology, religion in the
Greco-Roman world, and ancient philosophy.

   In addition to the courses in Classical Civilization, appropriate courses from other departments
or from approved study abroad programs may be elected for the major. Examples of such courses,
which may vary from year to year, are ArtH 412 (Monsters and Narrative: Greek Architectural
Sculpture), Political Science/Philosophy 231 (Ancient Political Thought), and appropriate courses
at the Intercollegiate Center for Classical Studies in Rome or at another approved overseas pro-
gram.

   Senior Colloquium: In lieu of a semester-long major seminar, majors will participate in the Se-
nior Colloquium, a student-faculty discussion group that meets twice each semester during the se-
nior year. The meetings focus on critical readings in Classics, often in conjunction with a guest lec-
turer's visit.

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN CLASSICS
   Students who wish to be considered for the degree with honors will normally present a thesis or

pursue appropriate independent study in the fall and winter study of their senior year. This thesis or
independent study offers students an opportunity to work in depth on a topic of their choosing and to
apply and develop the techniques and critical methods with which they have become acquainted
during their regular course work. It may also include relevant work with members of other depart-
ments. In order to write a thesis, students normally must have a minimum GPA of 3.3 in their major
courses and must submit a thesis proposal before the end of the spring semester of their junior year
that earns departmental approval. To be awarded the degree with honors in Classics, the student is
required to have taken a minimum of ten semester courses in the department (not including the the-
sis or independent study) and to have demonstrated original or superior ability in studies in the field
both through course work and through the thesis or equivalent independent study.

COURSE NUMBERING SYSTEM
   Language Courses: The numbering of these courses through the 200 level reflects the prerequi-

sites involved; the only prerequisite for any 400-level course is Greek 202 or Latin 202, or equiva-
lent language preparation. The numbering of the 400-level courses partially reflects the order in
which they are offered over a two-year period for Greek and a three-year period for Latin. It also
indicates a good order in which to take the 400-level courses but not an essential order, and individ-
ual students may enter the sequence at any point. While not every student will take every course, the
rotation of 400-level courses is arranged to permit exposure, in a three- to four-year period, to most
of the important periods and genres of classical studies.

   Classical Civilization Courses: The numbering of these courses often suggests a recommended
but rarely necessary sequence of study within a given area of classical studies. Most of the transla-
tion courses do not assume prior experience in Classics or a cross-listed field.

                    CLASSICAL CIVILIZATION

CLAS 101 Greek Literature (Same as Comparative Literature 107) (Not offered 2001-2002)
(See full description online:

http://www.williams.edu/Registrar/catalog/depts/clas/clas101.html)

CLAS 102(F) Roman Literature (Same as Comparative Literature 108)

Modern fascination with the ancient Romans may be due in no small measure to modern assump-

tions about the enduring influence of their civilization on our own. The very real continuities be-

tween our distant cultures are certainly due in large part to the enormous impact of Roman on Euro-

pean literature. Yet continuity is counterbalanced by significant cultural differences that are often

overlooked in representations of ancient Rome in today's literature, film, and television. We will

read a variety of Roman literary works in translation --epic, satire, lyric poetry, oratory, philoso-

phy, historiography, and drama--with an aim to both appreciating them as literature and gaining a

deeper understanding of Roman culture and society. Since a number of Roman authors were also

important figures in Roman political life, we are in an unusually good position to analyze how Ro-

man literature delineates and deploys cultural ideals, power structures, class hierarchies, political

ideology, religious beliefs, categories of sex, gender and difference, and the relationship between

the individual and the state. Readings from Plautus, Terence, Lucretius, Cicero, Caesar, Catullus,

Vergil, Horace, Ovid, Seneca, Tacitus, Suetonius, and Apuleius will be supplemented by critical

essays and by movies (e.g., A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum, Gladiator).

Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on classroom participation, one or two short

essays, and midterm and final exams.

No prerequisities. Enrollment limit: 35 (expected: 35). Open to first-year students.

Hour: 1:10-2:25 MR                                                                    PANOUSSI

CLAS 103(S) Greek and Roman Drama: Renewal and Transformation (Same as

Comparative Literature 109 and Theatre 311)

The reading list for this course includes many of the major tragedies of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and
Euripides, at least two comedies of Aristophanes, and probably an example or two of New Comedy
(Menander, Plautus, or Terence). But it includes also a number of contemporary plays based on an-
cient myth or ancient models (Anouilh's Eurydice and Antigone; Cocteau's Orphee, Sartre's The
Flies, Williams' Orpheus Descending, Eliot's Family Reunion, etc.) as well as Homer's Odyssey
and a few other readings, both ancient and modern, from outside drama. Though we shall read the
ancient plays closely, our specific focus will be less on drama per se than on themes of transforma-
tion and renewal as they occur in myth, cult, drama, and other literature of all periods. In keeping
with this theme, students will be encouraged not only to develop critical and analytic sophistication
in dealing with these various materials but also to create their own transformations of ancient myth

                                      ­ 125 ­
Classics

and ancient models, in whatever medium they choose.

Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on contributions to class discussion, a 5-10

page paper, a creative project, and a mid-term and final exam. Students taking the course as Theater

311 will be expected to undertake an additional project, to be determined in consultation with the

instructor. In the past, students have frequently chosen to prepare some sort of dramatic perfor-

mance for the class (e.g., of one of the works we have read, or an original work by the students them-

selves, etc.).

No prerequisites. Open to first-year students. Enrollment limit: 25 (expected: 15-20). Priority given

to first- and second-year students and to Theatre students.

CLAS 223(S) (formerly 218) Roman History (Same as History 223)

The study of Roman history involves questions central to the development of Western institutions,

religion, and modes of thought. Scholars have looked to Rome both for actual antecedents of Euro-

pean cultural development and for paradigmatic scenes illustrating what they felt were cultural uni-

versals. Yet Roman history also encompasses the most far-reaching experience of diverse cultures,

beliefs, and practices known in the Western tradition until perhaps contemporary times. A close

analysis of Roman history on its own terms shows the complex and fascinating results of an ambi-

tious, self-confident nation's encounter both with unexpected events and crises at home, and with

other peoples. As this course addresses the history of Rome from its mythologized beginnings

through the reign of the emperor Constantine, it will place special emphasis on the impressive Ro-

man ability to turn the unexpected into a rich source of cultural development, as well as the complex

tendency later to interpret such ad hoc responses as predestined and inevitable. The Romans also

provide a vivid portrait of the relationship between power and self-confidence on the one hand, and

violence and ultimate disregard for dissent and difference on the other. Readings for this course will

concentrate on a wide variety of original sources, and there will be a strong emphasis on the prob-

lems of historical interpretation.

Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on weekly brief in-class response papers, one

8- to 10-page paper, a midterm, and a final exam.

Enrollment limit: 40 (expected: 40). Open to all.

This full-year, intensive course presents the fundamentals of Greek grammar, syntax, and vocabu-

lary and introduces students, in the second semester, to works of the classical period (usually by

Xenophon and Euripides).

This course is designed for students who are beginning Greek or have studied less than two years of

Greek in secondary school. Credit is granted for the first semester only if the second semester is

taken as well. Students with some previous experience in Greek may want to enroll in CLGR 102

only. (Consult the department.)

Format: recitation/discussion. Evaluation will be based on frequent quizzes, tests, and a final exam.

CLGR 201(F) Intermediate Greek I

Reading of selections from Hesiod and from Plato, combined with grammar review. The primary

goal of this course is to develop fluency in reading Greek. We will also read the texts closely to

explore important continuities and changes in Greek culture between the archaic and classical per-

iods. The emphasis will vary from year to year, but possible subjects to be explored include: the

education and socialization of the community's children and young adults; religion and cult practic-

es; the performative aspects of epic (and choral) poetry and of prose genres like oratory and the

philosophical dialogue; traditional oral poetry and storytelling and the growth of literacy; the

construction of woman, of man; the development of the classical polis.

Format: recitation/discussion. Evaluation will be based on classroom participation, quizzes, tests,

and a final exam.

CLGR 202(S) Intermediate Greek II

Like Greek 201, this course pairs archaic poetry with classical prose, and it continues to develop

some of the themes and methods introduced the previous semester. We will read selections from

Homer (either the Iliad or the Odyssey) and Herodotus (his account, composed later in the fifth cen-

tury, of the wars between Greeks and Persia fought near the beginning of that century). We will

continue to review grammar and to develop fluency in reading Greek but will put greater emphasis

than in Greek 201 on analysis and interpretation of the texts.

Format: recitation/discussion. Evaluation will be based on preparation for each class, classroom

participation, quizzes, a midterm and a final exam. Several oral presentations and short essays may

CLGR 402(S) Homer: The Iliad
From the early archaic era through the classical and beyond, Homer's Iliad and Odyssey simulta-
neously influenced and reflected Greek conceptions of community, leadership, war, heroism, fami-
ly, loyalty, the gods, justice, and much more. And nearly all of subsequent Greek literature, both
poetry and prose, developed in varying degrees of dialogue with these early epic texts. In this course
we will explore Homeric values, narrative style, language, and effect by reading extensive selec-
tions from the Iliad in Greek, and the entire epic in translation.
Format: recitation/discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, oral reports, a paper
or papers, perhaps a midterm, and a final exam.
Prerequisite: Greek 202 or permission of the instructor. CLGR 402 is offered alternately as a course

CLGR 403(F) Greek Lyric Poetry

From the archaic period until well into the fifth century, lyric poetry was probably the single most

important type of poetic expression in the Greek world. This rich and diverse poetry addressed a

broad range of issues, from problems posed by traditional aristocratic ideals to questions about gen-

der roles. While engaging in close reading of individual poems, we will pursue some of the issues

that lyric poetry raises for the cultural and intellectual history of Greece in one of its most dynamic

periods of social and political change. Readings in Greek, including the poetry of Archilochus, Tyr-

taeus, Solon, Sappho, Ibycus, Anacreon, and Simonides, will be supplemented by modern critical

discussions and interpretive essays. The course will also consider issues raised by translation and

Greek metrical forms.

Format: recitation/discussion. Evaluation will be based on reports and short essays that will be pre-

pared on a regular basis throughout the semester, classroom performance, and a final exam.

Prerequisite: Greek 202 or permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 12 (expected: 5-10).

CLLA 101(F)-102(S) Introduction to Latin

This is a full-year course on the fundamentals of the Latin language. The first semester and part of

the second emphasize learning basic grammar; the rest of the second semester is devoted to reading

selections from Latin poetry (including Vergil's Aeneid and some Medieval Latin poetry, e.g., the

Carmina Burana) and from Latin prose (e.g., Pliny's Letters and/or the Vulgate Bible). This course

is designed for the student with no previous preparation in Latin or who has had only a little Latin

and wishes a refresher. Credit is granted for the first semester only if the second semester is taken as

well. Students with some previous experience in Latin may want to enroll in CLLA 102 only: consult

the department.

Format: recitation/discussion. Evaluation will be based on frequent quizzes, tests, classroom exer-

cises, and a final exam.

Enrollment limit: 18 (expected: 10-12).

CLLA 201(F) Intermediate Latin I: The Late Republic

Reading of selections from Latin prose and poetry, normally from a speech or letters by Cicero and

from the poetry of Catullus. This course includes a comprehensive review of Latin grammar and

aims primarily at developing fluency in reading Latin. At the same time it acquaints students with

one of the most turbulent and important periods in Roman history and attends to the development of

their interpretative and analytic skills.

Format: recitation/discussion. Evaluation will be based on classroom performance, quizzes, a mid-

term, and a final exam. Occasional oral presentations or short essays may be required as well.

CLLA 202(S) Intermediate Latin II: The Early Empire

Like Latin 201, this course pairs poetry and prose and aims to develop students' fluency in reading
Latin while acquainting them with a vitally important period in Roman history. More than Latin
202, however, this course attends to the development of students' analytic and interpretive skills.
We will read selections from Ovid's Metamorphoses and from such early imperial prose as Livy's
account of the early republic or Petronius' Satyricon.
Format: recitation/discussion. Evaluation will be based on preparation for each class, classroom
performance, quizzes, a midterm and a final exam. Several oral presentations and short essays may
be required as well.

CLLA 402(F) Literature of the Republic

What can the remains of early Latin tell us about the Romans and their neighbors in Italy before the

heady days of the late Republic and the Augustan age? What Latin(s) and other languages did the

Romans of the early- and middle-Republic speak, or regularly hear being spoken? Why did a Latin

literature emerge quite suddenly in the mid-third century, like Minerva springing fully armed from

Jove's head? Why was so much early Latin literature written by people whose native language was

not Latin? How did the Latin language and its literature change between the early and late Republic,

and how do these changes provide evidence for a complex "multicultural" society and for momen-

tous changes in that society during the same period? These are some of the questions we will ad-

dress as we read a variety of texts: early Latin inscriptions, fragments from literary giants like Li-

vius Andronicus, Naevius, Ennius, Lucilius, and Cato, and selections from the comedies of Plautus

and Terence, including a complete comedy by one of these playwrights. For purposes of compari-

son, we will occasionally read short selections from later Latin poetry and prose.

Format: recitation/discussion. Evaluation will be based on quality of preparation for each class,

several oral presentations and/or short essays, and midterm and final exams.

Prerequisite: Latin 202 or permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 12 (expected: 8).

CLLA 407(S) The Rhetoric of Cruelty

In no other period did the tensions and ambiguities inherent in Roman society manifest themselves

more acutely than in the first and early second century C.E., Rome's "Silver Age." It was frequently

a violent and cruel period in which absolute power could be exercised with a malignancy rarely

plied since. Yet this age also produced a literature often marked by profound humanity and by an

inventiveness comparable to that of the "Golden Age" a century before. The goal of this course is to

gain some insight into the paradoxes of this period. Reading selections in Latin and sometimes En-

glish from authors like Pliny the Younger, Seneca, Petronius, Lucan, Persius, Juvenal, Martial, Sta-

tius, and Tacitus, we will examine the social and political conditions of writing in this period, and

we will consider the degree to which these authors were aware of, and indeed played with, the hier-

archies created by literary canons and reflected in epithets like "golden" and "silver."

Format: recitation/discussion. Evaluation will be based on preparation for each class, classroom

performance, a midterm, several short essays and/or a final paper, and a final exam. Oral presenta-

tions may be required as well.

   Students motivated by a desire to study literature in the broadest terms, as well as those interested
in particular examples of literary comparison, will find an intellectual home in the Program in Com-
parative Literature. The Program in Comparative Literature gives students the opportunity to de-
velop their critical faculties through the analysis of literature in its international and multicultural
context. By crossing national, linguistic, historical, and disciplinary boundaries, students of Com-
parative Literature learn to read texts for the ways they make meaning, the assumptions that under-
lie that meaning, and the aesthetic elements evinced in the making. Students of Comparative Litera-
ture are encouraged to examine the widest possible range of literary communication, including the
metamorphosis of genres, forms, and themes.

   Whereas specific literature programs allow the student to trace the development of one literature
in a particular culture over a period of time, Comparative Literature juxtaposes the writings of dif-
ferent cultures and epochs in a variety of ways. The rubrics of the Program's core courses--Literary
Genres, Literary Movements, Literature and Theory, and Cultural Studies--introduce the student
to a variety of critical methods. Because interpretive methods from other disciplines play a crucial
role in investigating literature's larger context, the Program offers courses intended for students in
all divisions of the college and of all interests. These include courses that introduce students to the
comparative study of world literature and courses designed to enhance any foreign language major
in the Williams curriculum. In addition, starting with the class of 2002, the English Department will
allow students to count one course with a COMP prefix as an elective within the English major.

   The Program supports two distinct majors in Comparative Literature and Literary Studies. The
major in Comparative Literature requires advanced work in at least one language other than English
and is strongly recommended for students contemplating graduate study in the discipline. Both ma-
jors provide a strong basis for any career demanding analytical, interpretive, and evaluative skills
and allow the student, within a framework of general requirements, to create a program of study
primarily shaped by the student's own interests.

MAJORS

Comparative Literature
   The Comparative Literature major combines a focused study of a single national-language litera-

ture with a wide-ranging exploration of literary forms across national, linguistic, and historical boun-
daries. Each student declaring the major must select a single foreign language as his or her specialty,
although the serious study of literature in foreign languages other than the student's specialty is
strongly encouraged. The languages currently available are French, German, Ancient Greek, Latin,
Russian, and Spanish. Each student will also be paired with a faculty advisor with whom the student
will meet each semester to discuss how best to fulfill the requirements for the major.

Eleven courses are required for the major:
Comparative Literature 111 The Nature of Narrative (Literary Genres)

Any three of the following core courses:
   Comparative Literature 152 Adultery and the Fallen Woman (Cultural Studies)
   Comparative Literature 224/English 204 The Feature Film (Literary Genres)
   Comparative Literature 231 Romanticism (Literary Movements)
   Comparative Literature 232 European Modernism (Literary Movements)
   Comparative Literature 240/English 230 Introduction to Literary Theory (Literature and Theory)
   Comparative Literature 252 Modern Women Writers and the City (Cultural Studies)
   Comparative Literature 257/English 207 Arthurian Literature (Cultural Studies)
   Comparative Literature 321 The Cultures of Poetry (Literary Genres)
   Comparative Literature 328/English 388 Mysteries (Literary Genres)
   Comparative Literature 340 Literature and Psychoanalysis (Literature and Theory)
   Comparative Literature 343/English 373 Modern Critical Theory (Literature and Theory)

Three literature courses in the student's specialty language, in which texts are read in the origi-
nal. At least one of the three must be above the 200-level.

Three courses in which most of the course work concerns literature other than that of the stu-
dent's specialty language or literary theory. These courses may be selected from Comparative
Literature offerings or from other departments and must be approved by the student's major
advisor. Only one may be in English or American literature. Among the offerings of other de-

Comparative Literature 402 Senior Seminar (variable topics)

   Students who are considering a major in Comparative Literature should aim to acquire inter-
mediate-level proficiency in their specialty language by the end of the sophomore year. They
should also complete core course requirements by the end of their junior year. Students pursuing the
Comparative Literature major are strongly encouraged to study abroad during their junior year and
may receive major credit for up to 4 courses taken during study abroad. At least three courses to-
wards the major must be at the 300 level or above. Students are expected to take the version of 402
offered in their senior year, even if they have previously taken 402.

Literary Studies
   The Literary Studies major allows for a wide-ranging exploration of literary forms across nation-

al, linguistic, and historical boundaries. Unlike the major in Comparative Literature, the Literary
Studies major does not require the student to choose a specialty language, although the serious
study of literature in one or more foreign languages is strongly encouraged. Each student will be
paired with a faculty advisor, with whom the student will meet each semester to discuss how best to
fulfill the requirements for the major.

Eleven courses are required for the major:
Comparative Literature 111 The Nature of Narrative (Literary Genres)

Any four of the following core courses:
   Comparative Literature 152 Adultery and the Fallen Woman (Cultural Studies)
   Comparative Literature 224/English 204 The Feature Film (Literary Genres)
   Comparative Literature 231 Romanticism (Literary Movements)
   Comparative Literature 232 European Modernism (Literary Movements)

   Comparative Literature 340 Literature and Psychoanalysis (Literature and Theory)
   Comparative Literature 343/English 373 Modern Critical Theory (Literature and Theory)

Five courses devoted to literature or literary theory that cover at least three different national/
cultural traditions. The courses may be selected from Comparative Literature offerings or from
other departments and must be approved by the student's major advisor. Of the courses taken
outside of the Program in Comparative Literature, no more than two may have the same course
prefix. Students are strongly encouraged to include courses in a foreign language among these
five. Among the offerings of other departments that are possible, the following employ readings
in English translation and are especially appropriate to the major:

   Anthropology 280
   English 126, 135, 202, 218, 219, 220, 221, 327, 339, 341, 345, 346, 361, 371, 393

courses towards the major must be at the 300 level or above. Students are expected to take the ver-
sion of 402 offered in their senior year, even if they have previously taken 402.

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN COMPARATIVE LITERATURE OR LITERARY STUDIES

   To achieve honors in Comparative Literature or Literary Studies, a student must prepare a thesis,
usually 50-75 pages long, during the senior year (COMP 493-W031-494 or LIT 493-W031-494).
The topic of the thesis must be comparative and/or theoretical in approach. Those majoring in Com-
parative Literature must include a significant amount of material in the literature of the student's
specialty language. Students must apply to the Program's advisory committee for permission to
pursue an honors thesis before the beginning of the senior year.

COMP 232(S) (formerly LIT 203) European Modernism

This seminar will explore literary and cultural modernism as an international phenomenon from

1860 to the 1970s. In the context of the profound social, political, and historical transformations of

Western culture in this period, we will examine the works of literary, cinematic, and theoretical cre-

ators who have shaped our `modernity'--namely, the consciousness we have of ourselves, of the

worlds we inhabit, and of the temporal rhythms that determined the cadence of late nineteenth- and

twentieth-century life. Readings will include Baudelaire, Rimbaud, Dostoevsky, Ibsen, Freud, Pro-

ust, Kafka, Apollinaire, Marinetti, Rilke, Pirandello, Breton, Mann, Woolf, Joyce, Beckett, Celan,

and Calvino, among others. Theoretical essays by Benjamin, Bataille, and Barthes will be consid-

ered as well. We will investigate the imaginative and aesthetic response of modernism to urban

alienation and technological innovation, its resistance to the hegemony of bourgeois rationality, its

displacement of religion and other forms of traditional spirituality, its attempt to empower the fe-

male voice, its reaction to the horror and despair of world war, its fragmenting of the self, its fore-

grounding of multiple perspectives of perception and narration, its rejection of the past and embrac-

ing of the present, and its metamorphosis into postmodernism. All readings in English.

Format: seminar. Requirements: active class participation, one class presentation, two hour-exams,

COMP 252(S) Modern Women Writers and the City

Ambivalence has always been a vital part of literary responses to city life. Whether they praise the

city or blame it, women writers react to the urban environment in a significantly different way from

men. While male writers have often emphasized alienation and strangeness, women writers have

celebrated the mobility and public life of the city as liberating. We will look at issues of women's

work, class politics, sexual freedom or restriction, rituals of consumption, the conservation of

memory by architecture, and community-building in cities like London, New York, Berlin, Paris.

We will examine novels and short stories about the modern city by writers as diverse as Virginia

Woolf, Gertrude Stein, Anzia Yezierska, Ann Petry, Jean Rhys, Marguerite Duras, Margaret

Drabble, Ntozake Shange, Verena Stefan, Jhumpa Lahiri, and Edwige Danticat. We will consider

theoretical approaches to urban spaces by feminists (Beatriz Colomina, Judith Wilson), architectur-

al historians (Christine Boyer), and anthropologists and sociologists (Janet Abu-Lughod, David

Sibley, Michael Sorkin). Several contemporary films will be discussed. All readings in English.

Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: two short papers and one final paper.

COMP 321(F) The Cultures of Poetry

To study poetry in a comparative light is to travel within cultures and languages in unique ways that

engage the universal and the particular, the personal and the political, the traditional and the ground-

breaking. This course provides the opportunity to read poetry from a wide range of traditions, eras,

and styles. We will also look beyond the cultures that gave rise to the poets to the culture of the poets

themselves--their self-presentation and reception. Questions of identity, beauty, history, place, tech-

nique, and creativity will go hand in hand with explorations of individual themes in each poet's work.

Our comparative focus will also help us formulate useful questions about the puzzling nature of read-

ing poetry in translation. Selections from music and theory, as well as an exploration of the issues

surrounding translation, will lend support to our investigations, as will class poetry readings and other

gatherings in the spirit of the great nineteenth-century salons and twentieth-century literary happe-

nings. Poets include Rumi, Omar Khayyam (Persia), Saint John of the Cross, Lorca (Spain), Pushkin,

Akhmatova, Mayakovsky (Russia), Szymborska (Poland), Adonis (Lebanon), Sappho, Cavafy

(Greece), Carson (Canada), Neruda (Chile), Sor Juana de la Cruz (Mexico), Rimbaud (France), Seng-

hor (Senegal), and T.S. Eliot. Conducted in English.

   Computers play an enormously important role in our society. General-purpose computers are
used widely in business and industry and are found in an increasing number of homes. Special-pur-
pose computers are found in everything from automobile engines to microwave ovens. Under-
standing and exploiting the great potential of computers is the goal of research in computer science.
Among the many fascinating research projects in progress in computer science today are investiga-
tions of: ways to focus more computational power on a problem through the simultaneous use of
many processors in parallel; revolutionary computer languages designed to simplify the process of
constructing complex programs for computers; the use of computer-generated graphic images in
the arts and as a tool for visualization in the natural sciences; and the use of digital methods in global
communications. The Computer Science Department at Williams seeks to provide students with an
understanding of the principles underlying computer science that will enable them to understand
and participate in these exciting developments.

   The department recognizes that students' interests in computer science will vary widely. The de-
partment attempts to meet these varying interests through: (1) its major; (2) a selection of courses
intended primarily for those who are interested in a brief introduction to computer science or who
seek to develop some specific expertise in computing for application in some other discipline; and
(3) recommendations for possible sequences of courses for the non-major who wants a more exten-
sive introduction to computer science. These offerings are discussed in detail below.

MAJOR

   The goal of the major is to provide an understanding of algorithmic problem-solving as well as
the conceptual organization of computers and complex programs running on them. Emphasis is
placed on the fundamental principles of computer science, building upon the mathematical and
theoretical ideas underlying these principles. The introductory and core courses build a broad and
solid base for understanding computer science. The more advanced courses allow students to sam-
ple a variety of specialized areas of computer science including graphics, artificial intelligence,
computer networks, software engineering, compiler design, and operating systems. Independent
study and honors work provide opportunities for students to study and conduct research on topics of
special interest.

   The major in Computer Science equips students to take advantage of a wide variety of career op-
portunities. Thus the major can be used as a preparation for a career in computing, for graduate
school, or simply to provide an in-depth study of computer science for the student whose future ca-
reer will only tangentially be related to computer science.

MAJOR REQUIREMENTS
Required Courses in Computer Science
A minimum of 8 courses is required in Computer Science, including the following:
Introductory Courses

   Computer Science 134 Introduction to Computer Science
   Computer Science 136 Data Structures and Advanced Programming

Core Courses             Computer Organization
                         Algorithm Design and Analysis
   Computer Science 237  Principles of Programming Languages
   Computer Science 256  Theory of Computation
   Computer Science 334
   Computer Science 361

                         ­ 135 ­
Computer Science

Electives
   Two or more electives (bringing the total number of Computer Science courses to at least 8) chosen
   from 300- or 400-level courses in Computer Science. At least one of these must be a course designated
   as a PROJECT COURSE. Computer Science courses with 9 as the middle digit (reading, research, and
   thesis courses) will normally not be used to satisfy the elective requirements. Students may petition the
   department to waive this restriction with good reasons.

Required Courses in Mathematics
   Mathematics 211 Linear Algebra
   Mathematics 251 Discrete Mathematics

   Students who take Computer Science 105, 108 or 109 may use that course as one of the two elec-
tives required for the major in Computer Science. Those who count Computer Science 109 toward
the major must select an elective different from Computer Science 371 (Computer Graphics) for
their project course. Similarly, students who count Computer Science 108 as an elective cannot se-
lect Computer Science 373 as their second elective. Note also that Computer Science 108 and 109
are not open to students who have already successfully completed a Computer Science course num-
ber 134 or above; Computer Science 105 is not open to those who have already successfully com-
pleted a Computer Science course numbered 136 or above.

   To be eligible for admission to the major, a student must normally have completed Computer
Science 136 as well as Mathematics 251 by the end of the sophomore year. Mathematics 211 must
be completed by the end of the junior year. Students are urged to have completed two of the four
core courses (Computer Science 237, 256, 334, and 361) by the end of the sophomore year and must
normally have completed at least three out of the four core courses by the end of the junior year.

   Satisfactory participation is required in the Computer Science Colloquium by all senior majors.
With the advance permission of the department, two appropriate mathematics courses numbered
240 or above may be substituted for one Computer Science elective. Other variations in the required
courses, adapting the requirements to the special needs and interests of the individual student, may
be arranged in consultation with the department.

   Potential majors are strongly encouraged to pick up the latest copy of the Informal Guide to
Courses in Computer Science, which can be obtained from the departmental office or on the World
Wide Web at http://www.cs.williams.edu. This document contains much more information on the
major, including suggested patterns of course selection and advice on courses relevant to different
student goals.

LABORATORY FACILITIES
   The Computer Science Department maintains two departmental computer laboratories for stu-

dents taking Computer Science courses. The Macintosh laboratory (used in Computer Science 105,
108, 109, 134, 136, and 237) consists of an electronic classroom containing Macintosh G4 comput-
ers. This laboratory also contains projection facilities enabling the instructor to display the comput-
er screen during lectures and demonstrations.

   The Unix laboratory (used in courses numbered 136 and above) consists of a network of worksta-
tions that are available exclusively to students taking advanced Computer Science courses. These
workstations also support student and faculty research in computer science.

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE
   The degree with honors in Computer Science is awarded to a student who has demonstrated out-

standing intellectual achievement in a program of study which extends beyond the requirements of
the regular major. The principal considerations in recommending a student for the degree with hon-
ors will be: mastery of core material, ability to pursue independent study of computer science, origi-
nality in methods of investigation, and creativity in research. Honors study is highly recommended
for those students with strong academic records in computer science who wish to attend graduate
school, pursue high-level industrial positions in computing, or who would simply like to experience
research in computer science.

   Prospective honors students are urged to consult with their departmental advisor at the time of
registration in the spring of the sophomore or at the beginning of the junior year to arrange a pro-
gram of study that could lead to the degree with honors. Such a program normally consists of Com-
puter Science 493 and 494 and a WSP of independent research under the guidance of a Computer
Science faculty member, culminating in a thesis which is judged acceptable by the department. The
program produces a significant piece of written work. The written work often includes a major com-
puter program, depending on the nature of the honors work. All honors candidates are required to
give an oral presentation of their work in the Computer Science Colloquium in early spring semes-
ter.

   Students considering honors work should obtain permission from the department before regis-
tering in the fall of the senior year. Formal admission to candidacy occurs at the beginning of the

spring semester of the senior year and is based on promising performance in the fall semester and
winter study units of honors work. Recommendations for the degree with honors will be made for
outstanding performance in the three honors courses. Highest honors will be recommended for stu-
dents who have displayed exceptional ability, achievement, or originality.

INTRODUCTORY COURSES
   The department offers four introductory courses--Computer Science 105: Understanding the

Web: Technologies and Techniques, Computer Science 108: Artificial Intelligence: Image and
Reality, Computer Science 109: The Art and Science of Computer Graphics, and Computer Science
134: Introduction to Computer Science.

   Students planning to major in Computer Science will usually begin their studies within the de-
partment by taking Computer Science 134. Computer Science 134 provides an introduction to com-
puter science and programming. No programming experience is required in order to take this
course. Students with significant programming experience should consider electing Computer Sci-
ence 136 (see "Advanced Placement" below). The combination of Computer Science 134 and
Computer Science 136 serves as a prerequisite to most upper-level courses in the department.

   Those students interested in learning more about important new ideas and developments in Com-
puter Science, but who are not necessarily interested in developing extensive programming skills,
should consider Computer Science 105: Understanding the Web: Technologies and Techniques,
Computer Science 108: Artificial Intelligence: Image and Reality, or Computer Science 109: The
Art and Science of Computer Graphics. Computer Science 108 discusses the techniques used to
construct computer systems that exhibit intelligent behavior from learning to planning and prob-
lem-solving. Computer Science 109 introduces students to the techniques of computer graphics
used for the creation of artistic images.

   Non-majors primarily interested in developing programming skills for use in other disciplines
are directed to Computer Science 134. Alternately, those expecting to construct programs that pro-
duce graphic images may wish to consider the combination of Computer Science 109 followed by
Computer Science 134.

   Those students intending to take several Computer Science courses are urged to begin satisfying
their mathematics requirements early. Note in particular that Mathematics 251 covers material
complementing that in the introductory courses (Computer Science 134 and 136) and is a prerequi-
site for many advanced courses. As a result it should be taken in the first year a student is at Williams
or in the fall of the sophomore year if possible.

ADVANCED PLACEMENT
   Students with an extensive background in computer science are urged to take the Advanced

Placement AB Examination in Computer Science. A score of 4 or better on the AB exam is normally
required for advanced placement in Computer Science 136. Students scoring 3 or lower on that
exam or who have taken the Advanced Placement A Examination in Computer Science should con-
sider enrolling in Computer Science 134.

   Students who wish to be placed in Computer Science 136 but who have not taken the Advanced
Placement Examination should consult with the department. Such students should have had a good
course in computer science using a structured language such as C++ or Java, and should have cov-
ered such topics as recursion, arrays, records, files, and have some exposure to object-orientation.

PLANS OF STUDY FOR NON-MAJORS
   The faculty in Computer Science believes that students can substantially enrich their academic

experience by completing a coherent plan of study in one or more disciplines outside of their ma-
jors. With this in mind, we have attempted to provide students majoring in other departments with
options in our department's curriculum ranging from two-course sequences to collections of
courses equivalent to what would constitute a minor at institutions that recognize such a concentra-
tion. Students interested in designing such a plan of study in any department should discuss their
plans in detail with a member of the faculty. We welcome such inquiries from students. To assist stu-
dents making such plans, however, we include some suggestions below.

   Students seeking to develop an extensive knowledge of computer science without majoring in
the department are encouraged to use the major requirements as a guide. In particular, the four core
courses required of majors are intended to provide a broad knowledge of topics underlying all of
computer science. Students seeking a concentration in Computer Science are urged to complete at
least two of these courses followed by one of our upper-level electives. Such a program would typi-
cally require the completion of a total of five computer science courses and one course in mathemat-
ics (MATH 251).

   There are several sequences of courses appropriate for those primarily interested in developing
skills in programming for use in other areas. For general programming, Computer Science 134 fol-
lowed by Computer Science 136 and 237 will provide students with a strong background in algo-

                                                ­ 137 ­
Computer Science

rithm and data structure design together with an understanding of issues of correctness and efficien-
cy. Computer Science 323 provides valuable exposure to the techniques and tools needed for the
development and maintenance of large software systems. The sequence of courses Computer Sci-
ence 109 and 134 would provide sufficient competence in computer graphics for many students
interested in applying such knowledge either in the arts or sciences. For students requiring more
expertise in the techniques of computer graphics, Computer Science 136 and 371 could be added to
form a four-course sequence.

   There are, of course, many other alternatives. We encourage interested students to consult with the
department chair or other members of the department's faculty.

GENERAL REMARKS
Divisional Requirements

   All Computer Science courses listed may be used to satisfy the Division III distribution require-
ment.

Alternate Year Courses
   Computer Science 108, 109, 323, 336, 337T, 338T, 371, 373, 432, and 434 are each normally

offered every other year. All other Computer Science courses are normally offered every year.

Course Numbering
   The increase from 100, through 200 and 300, to 400 indicates in most instances an increasing

level of maturity in the subject that is expected of students. Within a series, numeric order does not
indicate the relative level of difficulty of courses. Rather, the middle digit of the course number
(particularly in upper-level courses) generally indicates the area of computer science covered by
the course.

Course Descriptions
   Brief descriptions of the courses in Computer Science can be found below. More detailed in-

formation on the offerings in the department is available in the Informal Guide to Courses in Com-
puter Science.

Courses Open on a Pass-Fail Basis
   Students taking a computer science course on a pass-fail basis must meet all the requirements set

for students taking the course on a graded basis.
   With the permission of the department, any course offered by the department may be taken on a

pass-fail basis. Courses graded with the pass-fail option may not be used to satisfy any of the major
or honors requirements. However, with the permission of the department, courses taken in the de-
partment beyond those requirements may be taken on a pass-fail basis.

COURSES INTENDED PRIMARILY FOR NON-MAJORS

CSCI 105(F,S) Understanding the Web: Technologies and Techniques

This course will enable students to understand the technology that underlies the World Wide Web

and provide them with the skills needed to effectively use this new medium. The course introduces

techniques for creating hypermedia documents on the web. Students will learn the basics of HTML,

the formatting language used to author World Wide Web documents, and a subset of Java, a lan-

guage that can be used to add interactive elements to web pages.

The technology that makes the Web possible is developing as rapidly as its use is growing. New

facilities are introduced frequently. Web "standards" are evolving in several directions simulta-

neously as vendors introduce competing proposals. Accordingly, rather than simply learning how

to use the Web as it is today, we will also examine the fundamental technologies that make the Web

possible. These include digital encoding techniques, computer network organization, communica-

tion protocols and encryption systems. This material will leave students prepared to understand fu-

ture possibilities for, and obstacles to, the development of the Internet.

Evaluation will be based on homework, laboratory work and exams.

Prerequisites: Mathematics 100 or 101 (or demonstrating proficiency in the Quantitative Studies

diagnostic test--see catalog under Mathematics).

This course is not open to students who have successfully completed a Computer Science course

numbered 136 or above. Enrollment limit: 60.

CSCI 109(S) The Art and Science of Computer Graphics

We watch as a dead planet comes to blazing-fiery life, we negotiate a perilous asteroid field to bring

our starship home safely. Extraordinary events such as these, from motion pictures or from the local

video arcade, are becoming commonplace experiences of modern life. What these events share in

common is that they are both fruits of the rapidly-evolving technology of three-dimensional com-

puter-generated imagery.

This course provides an opportunity to develop an understanding of the theoretical and practical

concepts underlying computer graphics. The course will emphasize hands-on laboratory experi-

ence, with student work focused around completing a series of projects. From the first week, stu-

dents will begin making color, shaded, perspective views of three-dimensional models of their own

devising. As the course progresses, concepts of both computer programming and graphics will be

presented that will facilitate expansion of the range and complexity of the images. Lectures, aug-

mented by guided viewings of state-of-the-art computer-generated images and animations, will be

used to deepen understanding of what has been learned in the laboratory.

Format: lecture/lab, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on progress in the quality of

project work.

For the highly successful student, this course may serve as an alternate to Mathematics 211 as a

prerequisite for the upper division Computer Graphics course, Computer Science 371.

No prerequisites. This course assumes no previous experience with computers beyond that required

to operate a simple word-processing program. This course is not open to students who have success-

fully completed a Computer Science course numbered 134 or above. Enrollment limit: 36.

COURSES INTENDED FOR BOTH NON-MAJORS AND MAJORS

CSCI 134(F,S) Introduction to Computer Science

More than the processor inside, it is the software running on a computer that determines the ma-

chine's behavior and usefulness. In this course, students will learn principles of design, imple-

mentation, and testing of object-oriented programs. Using the Java programming language, we will

cover fundamental concepts including classes, objects, message sending, control structures, arrays,

files, and event-driven programming, as well as providing an introduction to concurrency. Through

the study of these topics, students will learn both to construct programs of their own and to under-

stand the capabilities and limitations of existing software. No previous programming experience is

required or assumed. Students with prior experience with object-oriented programming should dis-

cuss appropriate course placement with members of the department.

Evaluation will be based on assigned programs and exams.

Prerequisites: Mathematics 100 or 101 (or demonstrating proficiency in the Quantitative Studies

diagnostic test--see catalog under Mathematics). Enrollment limit: 60 (30 per section); expected:

CSCI 136(F,S) Data Structures and Advanced Programming

This course builds the programming skills acquired in Computer Science 134, placing special em-

phasis on the software design techniques of modularization and data abstraction. Students are

introduced to some of the most important and frequently used data structures: lists, stacks, queues,

trees, hash tables, graphs, and files. Other topics covered include analysis of algorithm complexity

and program verification. The object-oriented language Java is used to support modularization and

abstraction. Programming assignments focus on the design and implementation of algorithms and

data structures. The combination of Computer Science 134 and 136 provides a strong background

in programming.

Evaluation will be based on programming assignments and exams.

Prerequisite: Computer Science 134 or equivalent. (Mathematics 251 is recommended, but not re-

quired as a prerequisite or corequisite for the course.) Enrollment is limited to 36.

CSCI 256(S) Algorithm Design and Analysis

Given a list of descriptions of all of the buildings in Manhattan, how could you effectively produce a

description of the Manhattan skyline as seen from a boat on the East River? Or, suppose that for all

of the towns in the U.S., you have information on all of the roads that connect them. How would you

determine the shortest route between any two of the towns? The most obvious ways of solving these

problems turn out to be very inefficient. This course is concerned with investigating methods of

designing efficient and reliable algorithms to solve these and other computational problems. By

carefully analyzing the underlying structure of the problem to be solved it is often possible to dra-

matically decrease the resources (amount of time and/or space) needed to find a solution. Through

this analysis we can also give proof that an algorithm will perform correctly and determine its run-

ning time and space requirements.

We will present several algorithm design strategies that build on data structures and programming

techniques introduced in Computer Science 136. These include: induction, divide-and-conquer,

dynamic programming, and greedy algorithms. Particular topics to be considered will include

shortest path and other network problems; problems in computational geometry; searching, sorting

and order statistics and some advanced data structures such as balanced binary search trees, heaps,

and union-find structures. In addition, an introduction to complexity theory and the complexity

classes P and NP will be provided. As time permits, additional topics such as probabilistic and par-

allel algorithms will be studied.

Evaluation will be based primarily on problem assignments, programs, and exams.

                                 CONTRACT MAJOR

                               Contract Major Advisor: PETER D. GRUDIN

   Students with the talent and energy for working independently and with the strong support of two
faculty advisors may undertake a Contract Major: a coherent study of an interdisciplinary subject
not covered by a regularly offered major. Such a major must be in an area suitable to the talents of
the faculty in residence and cannot consist of minor modifications to an existing major. A Contract
Major also must conform to the structure and have the coherence of a departmental or program ma-
jor--i.e., it must embody a disciplined cumulative study that moves from an elementary to an ad-
vanced level and culminates in a synthesis similar to a senior major course. Hence a Contract Major
usually consists of a program of existing courses, sometimes supplemented by courses of indepen-
dent study and the senior course.

   The process of constructing a proposal for a Contract Major is both interesting and demanding.
As part of that process, students should consider carefully the advantage of working within existing
majors or programs, taking note of the considerable intellectual pleasures involved in sharing simi-
lar educational experiences with other students working within the same field. Students might also
consider whether their interests could be met by completing a regular major and coordinate pro-
gram, or a double major, or simply by working outside a major field in courses of special interest.
Because the Contract Major represents an exceptional opportunity provided for students whose in-
terests cannot be met through existing departmental and interdepartmental majors and programs, it
cannot be pursued in conjunction with another major.

   Students who wish to explore or propose a Contract Major should consult with the Contract Ma-
jor advisor and with potential faculty sponsors as early as possible in the fall semester of the sopho-
more year, and then--during the sophomore year--follow these procedures:

   1) The student must initiate discussion with at least two members of the faculty from differing
departments who expect to be in residence during the student's senior year and who are willing to
endorse the Contract Major and undertake a central role in supervising its implementation, criti-
cism, evaluation, and ultimate validation. Since in essence faculty sponsors substitute for the stu-
dent's major department, they are expected to play an important role in the Contract Major.

   The student must develop, in conjunction with the faculty sponsors, a written proposal (forms
and guidelines are available in the Dean's Office) which should contain:

      a) a description of the proposed major area of study and an explanation of the reasons for proposing
           the Contract Major. A sound and persuasive rationale for the major is crucial for obtaining ap-
           proval from the Committee on Educational Policy (C.E.P.).

      b) a list of all courses in the proposed major and an explanation for each course choice. A minimum
           of nine semester courses, one of which must be designated the senior major course (and taken
           during the senior year), must be completed for a Contract Major. Normal rules governing course
           grades and grade point average apply for entry into and continuation in a Contract Major.

      c) a list of other courses taken or anticipated to meet College distribution requirements, including
           grades received in courses already completed.

   2) By mid-January, the student must meet with the Contract Major Advisor to discuss and further
develop the proposal.

   3) By the first day of spring semester classes, the student must submit a complete draft of the
proposal to the Contract Major Advisor for feedback.

   4) By the end of the fourth week of the spring semester, the student must submit the final proposal
to the Contract Major Advisor. By this date also, the faculty sponsors must submit their endorse-
ment forms to the Contract Major Advisor. If the student is essentially proposing to transform an
existing coordinate program (e.g. African-American Studies, area studies programs, Environmen-
tal Studies, Women's and Gender Studies, etc.), into a Contract Major, the chair of that program
should also submit to the Contract Major Advisor a statement attesting to the validity of the propos-
al by the end of the fourth week of the spring semester.

   5) The Contract Major Advisor then conveys the proposal, a copy of the student's most recent
academic progress report, the faculty sponsors' endorsement forms, and recommendations regard-
ing the feasibility and substance of the proposal, for approval by the Committee on Educational

Policy. The C.E.P., after consultation with departments and programs substantially affected by a
proposal, will vote on each proposal individually and will report the decision to the Contract Major
Advisor, who will notify students and sponsors before the spring registration deadline. If the time
needed for C.E.P. review demands it, the Contract Major Advisor may postpone notification to stu-
dents and permit them to register late without penalty. In making its decisions, the C.E.P. considers
the student's academic record, the coherence and feasibility of the plan of study, and the degree of
support expressed by the faculty sponsors and, if appropriate, program chairs.

   Subsequent changes in a Contract Major must be requested in writing by the student and ap-
proved by the faculty sponsors as well as by the Contract Major Advisor. Where there has been sub-
stantial alteration of the original program, the Contract Major Advisor will forward the student's
written request to the C.E.P. for reconsideration.

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN THE CONTRACT MAJOR
   The route to the degree with honors in the Contract Major will normally be a senior thesis requir-

ing two semesters and a winter study of work. In special circumstances a student may propose to
substitute a one-semester course or a winter study course for one of his or her thesis courses and
write a mini-thesis. The Contract Major with honors shall comprise a minimum of eleven semester
courses or ten semester courses plus one winter study. One semester of independent study undertak-
en for the thesis may be allowed to fulfill the requirement for a senior major course.

   The faculty sponsors shall determine by the end of winter study whether the student is to be ad-
mitted to honors candidacy. If not admitted to honors candidacy, the student may elect not to contin-
ue further independent study. If admitted to honors candidacy, the student shall submit a written
thesis or minithesis to three faculty readers, at least one of whom shall be a faculty sponsor and at
least one of whom shall not be a faculty sponsor. The outside reader or readers shall be selected by
the Contract Major Advisor in consultation with the faculty sponsors. There will be a one-hour oral
exam by the readers, and they shall make a final decision regarding honors.

                                        Coordinator, JANE CANOVA

   The Critical Languages Program enables students to study important foreign languages not
taught in regular courses at Williams. The languages offered are Arabic, Hebrew, Hindi, Korean,
and Swahili. Each may be studied for one year at the elementary level.

   All courses adhere to the guidelines of the National Association of Self-Instructional Language
Programs (NASILP). Students work independently with standard language textbooks and individ-
ual cassette tapes for roughly ten hours per week and attend two one-hour group review sessions per
week with native-speaking tutors. Language faculty from other institutions will conduct the mid-
term and final exams and determine the final grades.

   To be eligible for a Critical Languages course, the student must:

  z demonstrate proven capability for independent work and previous success in foreign language
      study;

  z explain how study of the language will integrate with his or her major or other academic inter-
      ests;

  z present a letter of recommendation from a Williams faculty member;

  z in some cases take a pretest for placement;

  z have attained sophomore standing or higher;

  z have at least a 3.00 Grade Point Average.

   Interested students should obtain an application form for the desired course in early April. Forms
are available at the Center for Foreign Languages, Literatures, and Cultures in Weston Hall. Stu-
dents must meet with the program coordinator and hand in the completed application forms no later
than one week before preregistration. The application must be approved before registering for the
course.

   Students should note that Critical Languages courses are hyphenated, meaning no credit is given
for the first semester until the second semester is successfully completed. Students must normally
begin a course in the fall semester. It cannot be taken Pass/Fail.

   A Critical Languages course will be scheduled only if and when at least two students are accepted
into the course. Students planning to register for the course must attend an organizational meeting
the first week of each semester.

MAJOR
For students who have already taken Economics 101, your course sequence should be Econom-
ics 101, any Economics course numbered 201 to 240 prior to taking Economics 251 or 251M,
252, and a statistical methods course (either 253 or 255, or Mathematics and Statistics 243 and
346) which should be taken before 401, plus any three economics electives of which at least
two must be selected from advanced electives numbered 350 to 394, and Economics 401.

(Please note that students who have taken Economics 101 cannot take Economics 110 or 120,
and note that students cannot take Economics 110 or 120 without having passed the quantita-
tive studies exam or the equivalent.)

Students who are beginning their sequence with Economics 110 or Economics 120 should fol-
low the following sequence:

Economics 110 Principles of Microeconomics
Economics 120 Principles of Macroeconomics

   (Economics 110 and 120 may be taken separately and in any order)
Economics 251 Price and Allocation Theory

   or Economics 251M Price and Allocation Theory (In the spring semester, this section of the
   Price and Allocation Theory course will employ a somewhat more mathematical exposition
   of microtheory.)
Economics 252 Macroeconomics
One statistical methods course, Economics 253 or 255, or Mathematics and Statistics 243 and
   346. (The statistical methods course should be taken before 401.)
Three Economics electives, of which at least two must be selected from advanced electives
   numbered 350 to 394
Economics 401 Senior Seminar

   To complete the major, economics students must receive a passing grade on the oral examination
given in the course of Economics 401. A student who fails the oral examination must re-take the
exam and receive a passing grade.

   The primary objectives of the major are to develop an understanding of economic aspects of con-
temporary life and to equip the student to analyze economic issues of social policy. The introducto-
ry courses stress use of the basic elements of economic analysis for understanding and resolving
such issues. The two required intermediate theory courses then provide a more thorough grounding
in economics as a discipline by examining the strengths and weaknesses of the price system in allo-
cating economics resources and by examining the aggregate processes which determine employ-
ment, inflation, and growth. A course in statistical methods (253 or 255, or alternatively, Math 243
plus Math 346) equips the major to understand and apply the basic tools of quantitative empirical
analysis. Majors must take three electives, in at least two of which they apply parts of the theory

learned in the required intermediate theory courses. In the senior seminar, the student studies a se-
ries of current theoretical or policy problems, applying analysis and research methods.

   The normal requirement that nine economics courses be taken at Williams will usually be waived
only on the basis of transferred credit deemed acceptable by the department. Credit is granted based
on grades consistent with college policy on various examinations:

   z Students who receive a 5 on the Microeconomics AP or Macroeconomics AP exam, or a 5 on each,
      may place out of Economics 110 or 120, or both, respectively, but major credit will be given for only
      one course.

   z The Department will grant major credit for both Economics 110 and 120 to a student who receives a
      6 or 7 on the higher-level Economics IB examination, and that student can place into any 200-level
      course or intermediate-level micro or macro course.

   z For A levels credit, the Department will grant major credit for both Economics 110 and 120 to a
      student who receives a grade of A or B.

   Prospective majors please note that instructors in all sections of Economics 251, 252, and 253
feel free to use elementary calculus in assigned readings, lectures, problem sets, and examinations;
therefore, Economics 110 and 120 and Mathematics 103 or its equivalent are required as prerequi-
sites for these courses except for 251 which only requires Economics 110 and Mathematics 103 as a
prerequisite. By elementary calculus is meant differentiation of single variable polynomial func-
tions and conditions for a maximum or minimum; it does not include integration or multivariable
calculus. Instructors in advanced electives (courses numbered 350-394) may also use elementary
calculus in assigned readings, lectures, problem sets, and examinations. Students interested in
graduate study in economics should consider studying more advanced mathematics; see your advi-
sor for specific suggestions. Students are also reminded that some courses now have specific math-
ematics requirements; see course descriptions.

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN ECONOMICS
   We encourage all majors who have at least a 3.5 GPA in economics courses to consider honors.

To be admitted to candidacy for honors in economics a student must complete a substantial piece of
independent research. Two routes to honors are open: the Specialization Route and the Thesis
Route.

    1) Specialization Route, consisting of these three units:
        a. Development of a thesis proposal in the second module of Economics 401;
        b. An honors winter study project (W030) in January of the senior year;
        c. Economics 404 Honors Seminar.

   Students who have notified the department of their interest in writing an honors thesis will use the
second module of Economics 401 to develop a thesis proposal. Such proposals frequently build on
research papers completed for advanced electives, but this is not a requirement. If the proposal is
accepted, the student will be admitted to W030. The department provides a memorandum to majors
with more details every spring and fall.

   2) Thesis Route (Economics 493-W031-494):
   A few students each year will be accepted for year-long thesis research on a subject closely re-
lated to the scholarly interests of a faculty member. A student who hopes to do such independent and
advanced research in close association with a faculty member should begin to work out a mutually
satisfactory topic early in the second semester of his or her junior year. Application to the depart-
ment must be made before the end of the junior year by submitting a detailed proposal for work
under the supervision of the faculty member. The WSP of the senior year is also spent on the thesis.
   The College Bulletin states that students who wish to receive honors must take at least one course
in addition to the minimum number required for the major. Students who pursue a year-long thesis
and therefore take both Economics 493 and 494 may substitute Economics 493 for an upper-level
elective if they wish to. Students who pursue the Specialization Route to Honors may not substitute
Economics 404 for an upper- (or lower-) level elective requirement.

AFRICAN-AMERICAN STUDIES AND AREA STUDIES
   A major in economics who concentrates in African-American or Area Studies may substitute the

non-economics courses in the concentration for one lower-level elective in the Economics major,
but not for an advanced elective (350-394).

Note on Course Numbers: Courses between 201 and 240 are lower-level electives and are open to
first-year students who have taken 101. Courses between 260 and 349 are intermediate electives
which do not build on specific prior experience, but do require some maturity, so they have any two
economics courses or permission of the instructor as prerequisites. Courses 350 and above are ad-

vanced electives primarily designed for Economics and Political Economy majors and have theory
prerequisites.

ECON 110(F,S) Principles of Microeconomics

This course is an introduction to the study of the forces of supply and demand that determine prices

and the allocation of resources in markets for goods and services, markets for labor, and markets for

natural resources. The focus is on how and why markets work, why they may fail to work, and the

policy implications of both their successes and failures. The course focuses on developing the basic

tools of microeconomic analysis and then applying those tools to topics of popular or policy interest

such as minimum wage legislation, pollution control, competition policy, international trade

policy, discrimination, tax policy, and the role of government in a market economy. This course is

required of majors and highly recommended for those non-majors interested in Environmental

Studies, Women's and Gender Studies and Political Economy. The department recommends that

students follow this course with Principles of Macroeconomics or with a lower-level elective that

has Economics 110 as its prerequisite. Students may alternatively proceed directly to Intermediate

Microeconomics after taking this introductory course.

Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: problem sets, quizzes, short essays, midterm, final

exam.

An introduction to the study of the aggregate national economy. Develops the basic theories of ma-

croeconomics and applies them to topics of current interest. Explores issues such as: the causes of

inflation, unemployment, recessions, and depressions; the role of government fiscal and monetary

policy in stabilizing the economy; the determinants of long-run economic growth; the long- and

short-run effects of taxes, budget deficits, and other government policies on the national economy;

and the workings of exchange rates and international trade. Economics 110 and 120 may be taken in

either order.

ECON 204(F) Economic Development in Poor Countries (Same as Environmental Studies

234)*

This is an introduction to the economies and development problems of the poorer countries in Afri-

ca, Asia, and Latin America. We shall discover both the roots and the extent of these problems, and

explore possible solutions. The course begins by investigating how different socio-historical envi-

ronments have shaped various third world economies. Then, keeping this in context, it attempts to

get an idea of the best feasible policies to tackle a whole range of critical development issues. These

issues include poverty and its alleviation, the population explosion, employment and migration pat-

terns, raising education and health standards, and making agriculture and industry more efficient.

Finally, we will consider some broader international issues--like patterns of trade, foreign aid, and

the international debt crisis.

Each student will be expected to study these issues for an individual country or region, attempting to

get an idea of the socio-economic context from reading examples of relevant third world literature.

Format: lecture. Requirements: exams.

Prerequisite: Economics 110. Enrollment limit: 40 (expected: 35).

ECON 205(S) Public Finance

This course examines the role of the government in a market economy. Three broad issues are con-

sidered: when is government intervention in the economy appropriate? What is the most effective

form of intervention? What effects do government policies have on individual incentives? The

course will cover issues in both taxation and spending. Specific programs will be considered such

as Social Security, Medicare, education, and public assistance for the poor. We will also discuss

rationales and strategies for reforming the U.S. tax system.

Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements will include two short policy memos, a midterm and a

final.

ECON 207(S) China's Economic Transformation Since 1980*

Over the past twenty years, China has undergone an unprecedented economic turnaround. Since

opening the economy, average incomes in China have quadrupled and over 250 million people have

been lifted out of poverty. In this course, we will study the transformation of China's economy from

several perspectives. First, we will study the wildly successful transition of China from a commune-

based economy to ``market socialism.'' Within this study, we will discuss the ways that institutions

and organizational structures in China have led to and have been changed by the economy in transi-

tion. We will then discuss the effects of trade on China's economy, and conclude by exploring the

effect of China's rapid economic expansion on the environment. Throughout the course, we will

consider ways China's economy will continue to change over the next ten to twenty years.

Requirements: at least one research paper and exam(s).

ECON 208(F,S) Modern Corporate Industry

This course examines the role of the corporation in the American economy. Questions considered

include the following: Are our markets competitive? How do firms compete with each other and

why? What do we lose when monopoly exists? How does market structure affect advertising and

technological progress? Why regulate corporate behavior in the areas of advertising, product safe-

ty, pollution, and occupational safety? Do we regulate effectively? What is the appropriate role of

business in public policymaking?

ECON 209(F) Labor Economics

This course covers basic labor markets and the determination of wages in the U.S. The determina-

tion of wages and employment levels through demand and supply of labor in competitive and non-

competitive markets is the basis for analyzing the wide range of outcomes we observe in the U.S.

Differences in earnings and employment are analyzed through a variety of mechanisms such as la-

bor force participation, the role of unions, human capital accumulation and occupational choices.

Topics with important public policy implications such as discrimination and affirmative action,

minimum wages, and immigration will also be presented. Theoretical models will be presented and

critiqued with empirical evidence from U.S. labor markets.

ECON 211(F) Women in Development (Same as Women's and Gender Studies)

The processes of economic development in poor countries have affected women differently than

men. This is because of their different cultural and economic roles, and their substantial exclusion

from resources and decision-making. Understanding these processes requires economic tools

while also casting light on some of their shortcomings. We will look at accounts by feminist econo-

mists of the significance of unpaid `caring' labor, and bargaining processes within the household.

We will also consider issues such as women's access to credit, the informal sector, and women's

relation to the current global HIV/AIDS pandemic. Students will also be expected to read literature

by Third World writers to improve their sense of the texture of people's lives in poor countries.

Format: lectures and discussion. Requirements include weekly reaction papers and final exam.

ECON 213(F) The Economics of Natural Resource Use (Same as Environmental Studies 213)

Markets for natural resources continue to make news--whether the issue is oil drilling in the Arctic

National Wildlife Refuge or management of tropical rainforests. Economic theory helps predict

how individuals and firms will respond to incentives in their use of natural resources. Sometimes

market incentives lead to outcomes that are socially desirable; sometimes they do not. This class

will focus on three specific questions: What forces are generated by markets for different types of

resources? When do markets work well, and when do they work poorly? How do different kinds of

public actions affect market outcomes? We will consider both renewable and non-renewable re-

sources, including land, water, fisheries, minerals, and forests. Along the way, we will also address

different types of management problems--including issues relating to multiple uses and open ac-

cess. The class will draw on relatively simple tools, beginning with supply and demand analysis,

but extending to some more complicated dynamic models. We will make use of spreadsheet soft-

ware to work out numerical examples of some models. These numerical examples will serve as a

basis for discussing real-world problems and experiences, including both international and domes-

tic examples. We will particularly consider some of the resource management issues facing devel-

oping countries.

ECON 215(F) The World Economy

This course is an introduction to international trade and finance with an emphasis on issues of cur-

theories of the pattern of trade; the effects of tariffs and other trade barriers on national welfare and

income distribution; the balance of payments, the determination of foreign exchange rates, and al-

ternative exchange rate regimes. Students seeking greater depth in the coverage of the subject mat-

ECON 220(S) American Economic History*

Economic history teaches that events of the distant past continue to shape our lives today. This

course will examine several important questions in American economic history from colonial times

to the present. For example, what factors account for the tremendous growth and development of

the United States? Do we know enough about the causes of the Great Depression to prevent another

one? Did the New Deal save American capitalism or undermine it? Other topics will include the

legacy of slavery in the American South, the changing economic role of women, the economic im-

pact of immigration and trade, and the changing distribution of income and wealth over time.

Course requirements include class participation, a research paper, and two exams.

ECON 233(S) Transition Economies in Eastern Europe
The first objective in this course is to apply economic principles to the experiences of transition
economies. Ten years of transition from centrally planned to market economies offer us many op-
portunities to apply economic theory to real world situations. Transition countries pursued different
economic policies with differing results. We will learn how to join economic data with analytical
tools to improve our understanding of why some countries have been more successful than others.
The second objective is to study the lesson which the transition provided for the field of economics.
Many of the initial policy prescriptions in transition were based on the view that a free market is
enough to achieve rapid growth and stable economy. These prescriptions grossly failed and econo-
mists realized the importance of institutions which support a market economy. We will explore

which institutions are necessary for an effective capitalist society, and how to build them. The

course combines topics from international macroeconomics and institutional microeconomics. We

will analyze macroeconomic aggregates such as output, inflation, money, interest rates, govern-

ment deficit, investment, employment, exchange rates, trade balance, capital flows and stock mar-

ket returns. At the macroeconomic level we will examine the rationale and mechanisms of privati-

zation, corporate governance and securities regulation.

ECON 235(S) Urban Centers and Urban Systems

Cities, systems of cities, and the interactions between cities are the outcome of human decisions and

reflect their social structure and desire for interaction. The form of these urban areas is determined

by the choices made by the people who reside in, work in, and travel between cities. Economic

forces influence and constrain these choices, and economic models of decision-making can help us

to explain and predict the patterns that result. These models help us to comprehend the structure of

urban areas. This course will introduce the ideas and some of the analytic tools that assist in under-

standing the economic foundations of urban centers and urban systems. Topics addressed in the

course will include the determinants of land use, location of firms, choice of transportation mode,

flows of capital investment into real estate, housing prices and housing availability and regulation

of housing markets, movement of population from one city to another, and public policies designed

to deal with urban problems.

ECON 240T(S) Colonialism and Underdevelopment in South Asia*

How did colonialism shape the evolution of the economies of South Asia? There is much controver-

sy on this issue, beginning with whether the colonial economy really represented a radical break

from the past. With this as our starting point, we will discuss major themes in this literature inclu-

ding the theory of "drain" (of economic surplus from the colonies),"deindustrialization" due to

competition from cheap British manufactured goods, the impact of colonial legal institutions and

land tenure arrangements, and colonial policies with respect to education, infrastructure, trade, and

financial markets. The course will conclude with an assessment of the extent to which the econo-

mies of India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh still reflect their colonial past, and the consequences there-

of.

The course is going to focus on current economic problems in U.S. higher education with the ambi-

tious intention of resolving--or at least illuminating--some of them in creative ways, using eco-

nomic theory and careful analysis to do it. An understanding of the economics of colleges and uni-

versities and higher education that's emerged only recently makes that a non-unreasonable aim.

Topics include questions of access, choice and diversity of American higher education; economic

and non-economic returns to higher education investments; and differences between private insti-

tutional goals and that of society.

ECON 358(F) International Economics

Over the past decade and since World War II, the growth of world trade has significantly outpaced

growth of real GDP to create an increasingly global marketplace. For a group of rapidly growing

East Asian economies, the expansion of trade and the rise in the share of manufactured products in

exports has been even more spectacular. This course will cover the theory and empirical analyses of

the causes and consequences of international trade. Special attention will be focused on the rela-

tions between technology, trade, and economic growth. Topics covered will include trade and wel-

fare, comparative advantage and its sources, the role of increasing returns and product differenti-

ation, trade and economic growth, trade policy with and without market power, and foreign direct

investment.

ECON 359(F) The Economics of Higher Education

This seminar explores the economics and financing of colleges and universities, with a particular

focus on contemporary policy issues. A structured sequence of readings and case studies serve as

the backbone of the course. Course materials will apply economic theory to selected policy issues,

including tuition and financial aid, the individual and societal returns of higher education, and aca-

demic labor markets. The course will also introduce students to the financial structure and manage-

ment of colleges, including funding sources, budget processes, and policies and issues regarding

the finance of higher education.

Grading will be based on several written case studies, a student research project, a final exam, and

class discussion/participation.

Prerequisite: Economics 251, Economics 253 or 255 (or Statistics 101--formerly Mathematics

143). While significant background in economic theory and econometrics is preferred, non-eco-

nomics majors are encouraged to contact the instructor to discuss their interest in the course. Such

ECON 360(F,S) International Monetary Economics

This course studies the macroeconomic behavior of economies that trade both goods and assets

with other economies: international financial transactions, especially the buying and selling of for-

eign money, the role of central banks and private speculators in determining exchange rates and

interest rates, and the effects of international transactions on the overall performance of an open

economy. Additional topics may include the "asset market approach" to exchange rate determina-

tion, the nature and purpose of certain international institutions, and important current events.

Format: lecture. Requirements: two hour tests and a choice between a 10-page paper or a compre-

hensive final.

ECON 361T(S) Questioning the Philosophical and Psychological Foundations of
Economics
This tutorial will focus on issues in which the standard economic model generates recommenda-
tions that are at odds with either the current political consensus or the behavior of most individuals.

                                         ­ 151 ­
Economics

The answer may involve using a more sophisticated economic analysis or challenging the standard

premises of economics, such as rationality and consequentialism. Examples of policies that might

be discussed include: sale of one's own kidney; allowing (informed?) workers to work in danger-

ously polluted environments, selling the outcome of a lawsuit. Students will also be free to formu-

late their own problems. Course requirements: Students will alternate writing papers every other

week. The papers are expected to be delivered by Monday and the fellow students will write de-

tailed comments.

Format: tutorial.

Prerequisites: two semesters of economics, and an upper level theory class in either economics, phi-

losophy or psychology, or the consent of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 10.

ECON 362(S) Global Competitive Strategies+

This course examines the ways in which a country's factor endowments, domestic market charac-

teristics, and government policies promote or impede the global expansion of its industries and cor-

porations. First, actual trade and investment decisions of multinational corporations are analyzed

and compared to the predictions of international trade theory. Second, competitive strategies of in-

digenous and foreign rivals in U.S., Pacific rim, and European markets are explored. Third, the effi-

cacy of government policies in promoting the competitiveness of industries in global markets is

discussed. Case studies of firms, industries, and countries will be utilized.

ECON 385(S) Game Theory and Information

Game theory purports to provide a unifying framework with which to analyze and predict the emer-

gence and evolution of social behavior and organization in any of a wide variety of contexts in

which human (or plant or animal) agents interact. Economic applications include the analysis of

firms' strategic behavior in concentrated markets, the emergence of trust and cooperation out of

anarchy, financial bubbles or panics, and any of a number of other situations where individually

rational behavior may or may not lead to socially desirable outcomes. Asymmetric information

economics and mechanism-design extend game theory by exploring how the design of the rules of a

game and the control of information affect equilibrium outcomes and therefore how people might

choose to set up the rules to govern their interactions. Questions addressed include the design of

compensation and incentive contracts; voting models and political-economic equilibria; why insur-

ance contracts specify deductibles and why so many people are uninsured in our society; how firms

choose their financial structure and why some firms are credit-rationed, etc.

ECON 503(S) Public Finance (Same as Economics 378)

Public finance is the branch of economics concerned with government expenditure and taxation,

focusing primarily on microeconomic aspects of these activities. It provides tools for understand-

ing the effects of government policies, as well as a useful conceptual framework for analyzing nor-

mative questions such as "what is a good policy?" This seminar will present the basic principles for

public finance, and apply them to topics of particular importance in developing countries. The

course will begin by considering the efficiency of market economics, and rationales for government

intervention in the market, such as public goods, externalities, information-based market failures,

and equity. Applications include environmental policy, education, health care, aid to the poor, and

social security. We then move on to the economics of taxation, considering what kinds of taxes are

used in developing countries, the economic and distributional effects of taxation, questions of ad-

ministration and evasion, and options for reform such as the value added tax. Time permitting, we

may also address topics such as pubic enterprises, political economy, and decentralization.

particular interest, usually related to one of the three seminars. The approach and results of the study
are reported in a major paper. Research studies are analytical rather than descriptive and in nearly all
cases include quantitative analyses. Often the topic is a specific policy problem in a Fellow's own
country.

COURSES AND COURSE-NUMBERING
   The course offerings in English enable students, whether majors or non-majors, to explore litera-

ture in a variety of ways, and to satisfy their interests in particular authors, literary periods, and
genres. They emphasize interpretive skills, systematic and critical thinking, and careful attention to
the generic, cultural, and historical contexts of literature written in English.

100-LEVEL COURSES
   At the introductory level, the department offers a range of writing-intensive 100-level courses

which focus on interpretive skills--techniques of reading--as well as skills in writing and argu-
mentation. The department also offers English 150, Expository Writing, a course focusing on rudi-
mentary writing skills. All 100-level courses are designed primarily for first-year students, al-
though they are open to interested sophomores, juniors, and seniors. A 100-level course other than
150 is required for admission to most upper-level English courses, except in the case of students
who have placed out of the introductory courses by receiving a score of 5 on the Advanced Place-
ment examination in English Literature.

200-LEVEL COURSES
   Most 200-level courses are designed primarily for qualified first-year students, sophomores, and

junior and senior non-majors, but they are open to junior and senior majors and count as major
courses. Several 200-level courses have no prerequisites; see individual descriptions for details.
200-level Gateway courses are designed for first- and second-year students who are considering
becoming English Majors, or who are interested in pursuing upper-level course work in the depart-
ment. Beginning with the Class of 2003, completion of a Gateway course will be a requirement for
the major.

ADVISING
   The English Department does not assign majors to specific departmental advisors, since we feel

that doing so would prove unnecessarily constraining. Instead, we encourage students, both majors
and non-majors, to seek advice from departmental faculty with whom they are studying or have
studied. Majors who would like to have a regular departmental advisor to help plan a particular pro-
gram of study from among the diverse offerings of the department are encouraged to ask a faculty
member they know to serve in that capacity. Such arrangements can also be set up with the help of
the department chair. Majors considering graduate work should consult with the department's
Graduate Advisor about appropriate course choices.

   Non-majors who wish to discuss English Department offerings are invited to see any faculty
member or the department chair.

MAJOR
   Majors are urged to select a balance of intermediate and advanced courses, and to choose classes

from both the American and British traditions. Each student can fashion his or her own sequence of
study within a basic pattern that insures coherence and variety. This pattern comprises at least nine
courses.

   They are also urged to elect collateral courses in subjects such as art, music, history, comparative
literature, philosophy, religion, theatre, and foreign languages with a view to supporting and broad-
ening their studies in literature. In particular, the study of classical and modern languages, as well as
of foreign literatures, is strongly recommended.

Requirements
   The nine courses required for the major must include the following for the classes of 2002 and

2003:

   1) Any 100-level English class except English 150. Students exempted by the department from
100-level courses will substitute an elective course.

   2) At least two courses dealing primarily with literature written before 1700 (identified in paren-
theses at the end of the course description).

   3) At least two courses dealing primarily with literature written between 1700 and 1900 (identi-
fied in parentheses at the end of the course description).

   4) At least one course dealing primarily with literature written after 1900 (identified in paren-
theses at the end of the course description).

   5) At least one "criticism" course (identified in parentheses at the end of course description). A
course fulfilling the criticism requirement entails a sustained and explicit reflection on problems of
critical method, whether by engaging a range of critical approaches and their implications or by
exploring a particular method, theorist, or critic in depth. Please note that when a criticism course
also deals with literature satisfying a historical distribution requirement (pre-1700, 1700-1900,
etc.), the course may be used to satisfy either the criticism or the chronological requirement, but not
both.

   6) Beginning with the Class of 2003: At least one 200-level Gateway course (listed at the end of
the 200-level course descriptions). Gateway courses are designed for first- and second-year stu-
dents contemplating the major or intending to pursue more advanced work in the department; these
courses focus on analytical writing skills while introducing students to critical methods and histori-

                                                ­ 157 ­

cal approaches that will prove fruitful as they pursue the major. (This requirement does not apply to
the Class of 2002.)

   The English Department encourages majors to consider courses offered in the Comparative Lit-
erature Program. Starting with the Class of 2002, the English Department will allow students to
count one course with a COMP prefix as an elective in the English major. This course must be an
elective; it may not be used to satisfy the department's historical distribution, criticism, or gateway
requirements.

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN ENGLISH
   The English Department offers three different routes toward honors: a creative writing thesis, a

critical thesis, and a critical specialization. The requirements of each are described below. Candi-
dates for the program should normally have at least a 3.5 average in courses taken in English, but
admission will not depend solely on course grades. Formal application to pursue honors must be
made to the director of honors by April of the junior year. For the Class of 2002, the Director of
Honors is Professor Alison A. Case.

   All routes require honors students to take a minimum of TEN regular-semester courses (rather
than the nine otherwise required for the major), and to devote their senior year winter study course
to their honors projects. More specifically:

   Students doing a creative writing thesis must, by graduation, take at least nine regular-semester
courses, and, in addition, take English 497 (Honors Independent Study, fall) and English 031 (Hon-
ors Thesis, winter study) during senior year.

   Students writing a critical thesis must, by graduation, take at least eight regular-semester
courses, and, in addition, take English 497 and English 498 (Honors Independent Study, fall and
spring) and English 031 (Senior Thesis, winter study) during senior year.

   Students pursuing a critical specialization must, by graduation, take at least eight regular-semes-
ter courses, and in addition, take English 497 and English 498 (Honors Independent Study, fall and
spring) and English 030 (Honors Colloquium: Specialization Route, winter study) during senior
year.

   A student who is highly-qualified to pursue honors, but who, for compelling reasons, is unable to
pursue a year-long project, may petition the department for permission to pursue a critical thesis or
critical specialization over one semester and the winter study term. Since the norm for these projects
is a full year, such permission will be granted only in exceptional circumstances. If granted, the
standards for admission and for evaluating the final project would be identical to those that apply to
year-long honors projects.

   All students who wish to apply to the honors program are required to consult with a prospective
faculty advisor, as well as with the director of honors, before April of the junior year. In early-April,
candidates submit a 1-page preliminary proposal that provides as specific a description as possible
of the proposed project. The director of honors reviews proposals with the faculty advisor, and then
makes a recommendation to the whole department. Students whose proposals are accepted receive
provisional admission to the program at this time. Students not admitted to the honors program are
advised, when appropriate, about other possible ways of pursuing their interests (e.g., independent
studies, regular departmental courses).

   Admitted students must consult with their advisors before the end of the spring semester of junior
year to discuss reading or work pertinent to writing the formal honors prospectus. This prospectus,
due in early August before the fall semester of senior year, is a decisive factor in final admission to
the program. Two copies of the formal prospectus must be submitted--one to the director of honors,
and the other to the student's advisor. After reviewing the prospectuses and consulting with advi-
sors, the department's honors committee determines final admission to the program. Applicants are
notified during the first week of the fall term.

   While grades for the fall and winter study terms are deferred until both the honors project and
review process are completed, students must do the equivalent of at least B+ work to continue in the
program. Should the student's work in the fall semester not meet this minimal standard, the course
will convert to a standard independent study (English 397), and the student will register for a regular
winter study project. A student engaged in a year-long project must likewise perform satisfactorily
in winter study (English 030 or 031) to enroll in English 498 in the spring semester. When such is
not the case, the winter study course will be converted to an independent study "99."

   Students are required to submit to their advisor, on the due dates specified below, three final co-
pies of their written work. While letter grades for honors courses are assigned by the faculty advisor,
the recommendation about honors is made by two other faculty members, who serve as readers of
the student's work. These readers, after consulting with the faculty advisor, report their recommen-
dation to the whole department, which awards either Highest Honors, Honors, or no honors. Hon-
ors of any kind are contingent upon satisfactory completion of courses in the major during the
spring semester of the senior year. Highest honors are normally awarded only to students whose

performance in both the honors program and regular courses in the major has been exceptional. All
students who are awarded honors participate in a series of informal presentations at the end of the
spring term in senior year.

Creative Writing Thesis
   The creative writing thesis involves the completion of a significant body of fiction or poetry dur-

ing the fall semester and winter study of the senior year. (With permission of the honors committee,
the thesis may be undertaken during the winter study period and the spring semester of the senior
year.) Since a student will most likely include in the thesis writing done in earlier semesters, a cre-
ative writing thesis usually involves only the fall semester and the winter study period, rather than
the full year allotted to complete the critical essay.

   Requirements for admission include outstanding work in an introductory and an advanced work-
shop, a recommendation from one of the creative writing teachers (who will then act as thesis advi-
sor), a brief preliminary proposal, and the approval of the departmental honors committee. The for-
mal prospectus consists of a 1-page description of the project, including its relation to work com-
pleted and in-progress. Students must also submit a writing sample. A creative writing thesis begun
in the fall is due on the last day of winter study. The methods of evaluation are identical to those for
critical projects (but their page limits do not apply).

Critical Thesis
   The critical thesis involves writing a substantial scholarly and/or critical essay during both se-

mesters as well as the winter study period of the senior year. The formal prospectus, a 2- to 3-page
description of the thesis project, should present a coherent proposal indicating the range of the the-
sis, the questions to be investigated, the methods to be used, and the arguments likely to be consid-
ered, along with a brief bibliography.

   Significant progress on the thesis, including a substantial amount of writing (to be determined by
student and advisor), is required by the end of the fall semester. A first draft of the thesis must be
completed by the end of the winter study period. The spring semester is to be devoted to revising and
refining the work and to shaping its several chapters into a unified argument. Ideally, the length of
the honors essay will be about 15,000 words (roughly 45 pages). In no case should the thesis be
longer than 25,000 words, including notes. The finished thesis is due on the second Friday follow-
ing spring break.

Critical Specialization
   The critical specialization route is intended to provide students with an opportunity for making a

series of forays into an area of interest that is both broad in scope and related to work undertaken in
at least two courses. At least one of these courses must be in the English Department, and both need
to have been taken by the end of fall term in senior year. The critical specialization must be united by
a common area of interest, such as a given literary form or historical period, a topic that cuts across
several periods, an issue in literary theory, a topic that connects literary and cultural issues, a com-
parative literature or interdisciplinary topic. Students are encouraged to propose specialization top-
ics of their own devising. The following examples are meant only to suggest the kinds of topics
appropriate to a critical specialization: lyric traditions, postmodern narrative, magic realism, Dante
and modern literature, Freud and literature, the poet as citizen, new historicist approaches to litera-
ture, feminist film criticism.

   In addition to reading primary works, the student is expected to read secondary sources, which
describe or define issues critical to the area of specialization. The formal prospectus, a 2- to 3-page
description of the project, should specify the area and range of the study, the issues likely to be ex-
plored, and the methods to be used for their investigation. This prospectus should also describe the
relation between previous course work and the proposed specialization, and include a brief bibliog-
raphy of secondary works. The pursuit of the specialization route requires the following: (1) writing
a set of three essays, each about ten pages long (a page being approximately 250 words), which
together advance a flexibly-related set of arguments. The first two essays are due by the end of the
fall semester, and the third by the end of winter study; (2) developing an extended annotated bibli-
ography (about four to five pages long) of selected secondary sources, explaining their importance
to the area of specialization (due mid-February); (3) meeting with the three faculty evaluators (one
of whom is the advisor) during the last two weeks in February to discuss the trio of essays and the
annotated bibliography; (4) writing a fourth essay of ten to twelve pages, the purpose of which is to
consider matters that arose during the faculty-student discussion and to reflect on the evolution and
outcome of the intellectual journey undertaken by the student. This final essay is due on the second
Friday after spring break.

   The same three faculty members are involved throughout the assessment process, and the stan-
dards and methods of evaluation are the same as for other kinds of honors projects, with the follow-
ing exception: For the specialization route, the evaluation will also include the student's perfor-
mance in the discussion with the three faculty readers, and that discussion will include not only the
student's writing but also secondary sources.

COURSES

100-LEVEL COURSES (except English 150)

Through small class discussions (limited in size to 19 students per section) and frequent writing
assignments, 100-level English courses ask students to develop their skills as readers and as analyti-
cal writers. Each course assigns 15-20 pages of writing in various forms. These courses are prereq-
uisites for taking most other English courses. Students who receive a 5 on the AP English Literature
exam may take upper-level courses without first taking a 100-level.

ENGL 105(F) Poetry and Magic+

Ancient Celtic texts--Irish and Welsh--associate the poet (meaning any creator of fiction) with

powerful magic--with shape-shifting, access to the other-world, and visions of transcendent au-

thority and truth. Plato, in his famous condemnation of poetry in The Republic, also associates

poetry with magic, but with magic as a con game or sleight-of-hand trick. This course will use Plato

and Celtic texts to establish a theoretical framework for reading and interpreting the representation

of poetry and magic in a variety of literary works and films from the Middle Ages to the twentieth

century. The goal of the course, in addition to its particular subject matter, is to develop effective

reading and writing strategies for works of different genres and time periods. Reading will include

Chaucer's Friar's Tale (where the poet-figure is an evil magician); David Mamet's film House of

Games (where the master of illusion is a con artist); Marlowe's Doctor Faustus (where the poet-fig-

ure sells his soul to the devil for magical power); Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream and

The Tempest (where fairies and magic represent the positive powers of imagination); the "magical"

transformations of gender and identity in As You Like It and the documentary film Paris Is Burning

(about the world of gay male balls in Harlem); and short poems by Coleridge, Keats, Tennyson, and

Yeats. The class will be run as a discussion.

Requirements: weekly writing assignments, both formal and informal, including use of a class list-

server and required electronic journal postings. Students will do about 20 pages of writing and will

be evaluated on writing and class participation.

No prerequisite. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference to first-year students.

Hour: 8:30-9:45 MWF                                                                       KNOPP

ENGL 111(F) Television Culture (Same as American Studies 111)+

This course will introduce a set of critical tools for analyzing television culture. We will begin from

the assumption that television is a major shaping force for culture, politics, and society, and thus

deserves our notice and our considered engagement. It offers the student a chance to examine, in a

critical context, his or her own relation (deep love? intense loathing? sheer boredom?) to TV in all

its forms: the soap, the sitcom, the made-for-TV movie, the documentary, 24-hour music and news

channels, the infomercial, and so on. Special attention will be paid to the way in which television's

modes of address and technologies of representation constitute and transform race, gender, and

class identities in the U.S. Students will be required to do assignments "in the field," which will

involve viewing broadcasts and researching current writing (journalistic and scholarly) about tele-

vision; we will use this writing as a model for our own forays into the growing field of television

criticism.

Requirements: access to cable television; active participation in discussion; several short papers;

and regular participation in a web-based forum.

No prerequisite. Enrollment limit: 19 per section (expected: 19 per section). Preference to first-

year students. Two sections.

ENGL 113(F) "Literary" Reading+~
What determines a text's "meaning"? What makes a text "literary"? Is it something fundamental to
the text itself? Is it the circumstances in which we encounter it? Or is it the preoccupations and inter-
ests we ourselves bring to it--in other words, the way we read it? This course will focus on key skills
and issues involved in critical reading of literary texts. It will be organized around a series of such
fundamental questions as: What characterizes "interpretation"? What do literary texts expect of us?
What pleasures and parameters are established by the way(s) we read? Where does meaning come
from: author, reader, text? How does the form or genre of a work influence our interpretation of it?

How is our understanding of a text shaped by the contexts in which we encounter it, or by the literary

traditions in which it was written? We will address these questions by reading and interpreting liter-

ary texts (mainly short fiction and poetry) and pertinent critical and theoretical essays. Our read-

ings, and our written work, will invite increased self-consciousness about literary form, the func-

tions of criticism, and the process of reading and interpreting. The course is intended both to devel-

op students' skills in reading, writing about, and discussing literary texts, and to complicate their

understanding of the potential pleasures and profits of critical interpretation.

Requirements: four formal papers ranging from 3-7 pages, several short informal writing assign-

ments, group presentations, and active participation in discussion.

No prerequisite. Enrollment limit: 19 per section (expected: 19 per section). Preference to first-

year students. Three sections.

111)+
(See under Comparative Literature for full description.)

Note: English 120 may be used as the prerequisite for other English courses.

ENGL 126(F) Stupidity and Intelligence+

Stupidity fascinates authors, and they do not merely despise it--they feel it and make us feel it.

Why? Around the same time that psychologists began measuring and ranking intelligence--and

stupidity, under various names, of course occupied the space below (average) intelligence--liter-

ary authors were finding types of stupidity within intelligence. What is stupidity? Why can't it stay

sequestered from intelligence? Is there such a thing as literary stupidity? (Can one be specifically a

bad reader not only of books but of life?) What are the problems of intelligence? We shall be reading

stories, novellas, novels, and plays by Flaubert, Conrad, Melville, Poe, Henry James, Kafka,

Borges, and others, and we shall be viewing such films as Mr. Death and Forrest Gump.

Requirements: active class participation, and five papers totaling 15-20 pages.

ENGL 134(F) New American Fiction+

An exploration and examination of the very recent (last ten to twenty years) development of Ameri-

can fiction. A discussion class in which we will examine short stories and/or novels by such writers

as Jamaica Kincaid, Tobias Wolff, Annie Proulx, Lorrie Moore, Rick Moody, Sandra Cisneros, and

Tim O'Brien.

Evaluation will be based on class participation, four short papers, and a final paper.

ENGL 135(F) African-American Literary Lives (Same as American Studies 135)+*

Given the central importance of the autobiography to the development of African-American litera-

ture, this course aims to explore the ways in which this form has come to influence the writing of

African-American fiction in the twentieth century. Beginning with James Weldon Johnson's Auto-

biography of an Ex-Coloured Man, arguably the first "modern"African-American novel and a

work that explicitly crosses both generic and racial categories, the course will explore figurations of

blackness, passing, African identity, assimilation and segregation through the subsequent fictional/

autobiographical writings of Richard Wright, Ralph Ellison, Nella Larsen, James Baldwin, Toni

Morrison, Octavia Butler and Gayl Jones.

Requirements: 20 pages of writing, in the form of short papers.

No prerequisites. Enrollment limit:19 per section (expected: 19 per section). Preference to first-

year students. Two sections.

Hour: 1:10-2:25 MR, 2:35-3:50 MR                                                   CHAKKALAKAL

ENGL 140(S) Writing the Environment+
Covering both the English and American traditions, we will study the abiding preoccupation of au-
thors with nature and the environment. The location of nature as a site of knowledge, experience,
and self-examination, as well as the sense of its endangerment, will be of primary concern. The
class will emphasize the inheritance of nature poetry in the twentieth century. Among the authors to
be read are Spenser, Wordsworth, Keats, Emerson, Thoreau, Yeats, Hardy, Frost, Moore, Bishop,
Ammons, and Heaney.
Requirements: class participation, four 3- to 5-page papers, and e-mail responses.

ENGL 141(S) Modernity and Madness (Same as Comparative Literature 112)+

The literature of what might be called "the long twentieth century" (roughly 1880 to the present)

often bears marked resemblance in preoccupations and structures to what otherwise qualifies as

"insanity." Is there something about "this modern world" that drives us mad? Or has the advent of

"the modern"--new knowledges, "the death of God," high-speed travel, technological warfare,

cultural mixing, gender-bending, "information overload," and so forth--rendered different, per-

haps "truer" viewpoints possible? A wide variety of poems, short fiction, and plays will be covered.

Authors may include Gogol, T. S. Eliot, Joyce, Woolf, Beckett, Duras, Robbe-Grillet, Plath, Kus-

hner, Creeley, and Parks. Central emphasis will be placed on the development of analytic and ex-

pressive skills.

Requirements: active participation, several short writing and group assignments, and four 3- to

of exploration.

ENGL 142(S) Radio, Radio+~

Radio, Radio is a seminar devoted to making and interpreting non-fiction audio. Using unobtrusive

recording technology and sophisticated editing software, we will learn to do field recording, inter-

views, and post-production editing. We will use this process to ask fundamental questions about the

media, the functions of stories, and our relation to the world. How do we identify worthwhile sto-

ries? How do we understand their representativeness? What are the possible relations between

storytellers and their subjects? When does an editor's manipulation become unethical or untrue?

We will aim to vest our answers to these questions in the form and content of our audio work. We

will also spend considerable time critiquing student work. Critical readings in media theory, radio

history, and cultural history will be assigned. Note that while this course is writing-intensive, the

kinds of writing assigned will include both traditional critical exercises and the composition of your

audio essays.

Requirements: Enrolled students must attend three specially arranged evening labs in audio ac-

quisition and editing. Assignments will include several short written exercises analyzing particular

readings and audio assignments; an editing assignment using found footage; and the production of

two short (4-6 minute) audio essays. Students will occasionally be required to work in teams.

No prerequisite. Enrollment limit: 16 (expected: 16). Preference to first-year students, and then to

sophomores, English majors, and junior/senior non-majors.

ENGL 150(F) Expository Writing+

This is a course in basic problems of expository writing. It is not designed for students interested in

writing prose fiction or in simply polishing their style. Its goal is to teach students how to write a

clear, well-argued, intelligible paper. Readings will be taken from a writing handbook and a collec-

tion of essays.

A substantial amount of writing will be assigned. Regular class meetings will be supplemented by

individual conferences.

No prerequisites. Since only students who take the diagnostic examination administered during

First Days are eligible for admission, students should not preregister. Enrollment limit:12 (ex-

pected: 12).

ENGL 204(F) The Feature Film (Same as Comparative Literature 224)

An introduction to film narrative. The major emphasis will be on the formal properties of film as a

medium for telling stories, but attention will also be given to theoretical accounts of the nature of

cinema and of the viewer's relation to it, to genre, and to significant developments in the history of

cinema. Students will view films by such directors as Keaton, Eisenstein, Welles, Renoir, Kurosa-

wa, Hitchcock, and Scorsese. Critical readings will be assigned. Note: This is a lecture course, sup-

plemented by occasional required discussion sections. Students who dislike large classes are ad-

vised to find another course.

Requirements: two short written exercises; one six-page paper; midterm and final exams.

No prerequisite. Enrollment limit: 80 (expected: 80). Enrollment preference as follows: (1) English

ENGL 205(F) The Art of Poetry+

This course is not a historical survey (though it moves, roughly, chronologically); neither is it a

study of forms (though we will discuss certain formal issues). It is a course in the art of reading. We

will read both individual poems and a whole book of poems. We will consider the work of accom-

plished masters (Donne, Milton, Blake, Dickinson) and more contemporary figures (Lawrence,

O'Hara, Berryman).

Requirements: several short papers and occasional writing exercises. Students will also be ex-

pected to submit, at the start of each class, one written question in response to the work we plan to

discuss.

Prerequisite: a 100-level English course, except 150.

Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference given to first year students (and then sophomores)

who have placed out of 100-level courses with a 5 on the AP literature exam.

ENGL 209(F) American Literature: Origins to 1865 (Same as American Studies 209)
American literature from "Origins to 1865," especially as taught in New England, once meant a
single tradition, beginning with Puritan writers and culminating with Emerson and Whitman. We
shall certainly pay close attention to this tradition: towards the start of the course, we will read such
Puritan writers as the poets Anne Bradstreet and Edward Taylor, and the theologian Jonathan Ed-
wards; towards the end, we will read the canonical authors of the American Renaissance (Poe, Em-
erson, Thoreau, Hawthorne, Melville, Whitman, Dickinson). But we will complicate the assump-
tion of a single tradition by reading some pre-1620 works translated into English (e.g., Columbus,
Native-American trickster tales), some writing from the South (e.g., Jefferson), and African-Amer-
ican writing (e.g., Harriet Jacobs, Frederick Douglass).
Requirements: one 4- to 5-page paper, one 6- to 8-page paper, a final exam, and class participation.

ENGL 210(S) American Literature: 1865-Present (Same as American Studies 210)

This course is designed to provide an introduction to American literature from the post-Civil War

period to the present. Beginning with Mark Twain, we will read a series of influential American

texts--both fiction and poetry. We will situate these works not only within the literary movements

of the time (e.g., realism, modernism, and postmodernism), but also within other important histori-

cal and cultural occurrences (e.g., immigration and migration, civil rights, commodity culture).

Throughout, the emphasis will be on the diverse, sometimes conflicting traditions that make up the

American literary canon. Readings may include works by such authors as Henry James, Chopin,

Chesnutt, Stevens, Hughes, Hurston, Faulkner, Ellison, Ginsburg, Pynchon, Morrison, and Cisner-

os.

ENGL 211(F) British Literature: Middle Ages Through the Renaissance

A survey of the major figures and movements of English literature through the first part of the sev-

enteenth century: Beowulf, Chaucer, Marlowe, Spenser, Shakespeare, Donne, and others. The goal

of the course is a critical and historical understanding of the English literary tradition, with practice

in close reading and critical writing. Combination lecture and discussion.

Requirements: frequent electronic journal postings; one or two 5- to 7-page papers; and a scheduled

final exam. Students will do about 20 pages of writing and will be evaluated on writing, class partic-

ENGL 212(S) British Literature: Restoration Through the Nineteenth Century

A survey of the major figures and movements of English literature from the mid-seventeenth century

through the nineteenth century. The movements include Neo-classicism, Romanticism, and Victo-

rianism, and the authors, such notable figures as Milton, Pope, Swift, Johnson, Austen, Word-

sworth, Shelley, Byron, Keats, Tennyson, Arnold, and the Brownings.

ENGL 218(S) Introduction to U.S. Latina and Latino Literature (Same as American Studies
218)*
This course will introduce the student to a diverse body of work by Latino and Latina writers in the
United States. Latino and Latina literatures share a history of conflict, resistance, and cultural mes-
tizaje, or mixture, and this course will examine the ways in which a select group of authors acknowl-
edge that history and attempt to shape it to their own personal, literary and political ends. For some
understanding of context, we will turn to the facts and pressures of immigration, exile, assimilation,
bilingualism, and political and economic oppression, as those factors variously affect the means
and modes of the particular literary productions we're concerned with. At the same time, the course
will emphasize the invented nature of Latino/a literary and cultural "traditions," and it will investi-
gate the place of those inventions in the larger framework of Latino and Latina political projects

ENGL 219(S) Literature by Women (Same as Women's and Gender Studies 219)

This course will consider literary works by women in English as occasions where women acknowl-

edge and confront both each other and a literary culture which has traditionally defined feminine

identity and excluded female voices. Among the issues we will explore are: Are there significant

intertextualities amongst women writers, enough that we might argue for women's literary "tradi-

tions," either in terms of form or content? What are the unique difficulties women face as creators,

as opposed to just subjects, of literature? Can writing serve as a form of resistance, and if so, how?

How is femininity articulated alongside and/or intertwined with other identities and identifications,

such as race, ethnicity, class, and sexuality? While including a wide range of women, the course

may study in greater depth such writers as Charlotte Brontë, Emily Dickinson, Kate Chopin, Virgin-

ia Woolf, Adrienne Rich, Sylvia Plath, Toni Morrison, Jeannette Winterson, Audre Lorde, and

Maxine Hong Kingston.

ENGL 220(F,S) Introduction to African-American Writing (Same as American Studies

This course will examine texts by some of the most influential African-American writers, analyzing

the common themes and narrative strategies that constitute what may be defined as an African-

American literary tradition. Authors to be considered include: W. E. B. DuBois, Langston Hughes,

Zora Neale Hurston, Richard Wright, Ralph Ellison, Toni Morrison, and Ishmael Reed.

Requirements: a series of quizzes, three short papers, and possibly a final exam.

ENGL 221(F) Asian American Literature and Culture (Same as American Studies 221)*

This discussion-oriented survey course focuses on betrayal as a prominent motif in Asian American

texts (fiction, poetry, drama, and video documentary). Certain stereotypes of Asian Americans rely

on the figures of the spy and the turncoat, which confirm popular perceptions of Asian Americans as

perpetual aliens. At the same time, the model minority myth declares Asian Americans to be the

most assimilable of racial minorities. In this course, we will ask why and how Asian American writ-

ers and filmmakers have foregrounded acts of betrayal in their work in relation to the following

larger topics: assimilation, feminism, nationalism, translation, generational conflict, labor ex-

ploitation, and immigration. Finally, we will consider how accusations of race betrayal have united

and divided Asian American communities and readerships. Possible authors and filmmakers in-

clude: Carlos Bulosan, Meena Alexander, Maxine Hong Kingston, David Henry Hwang, Chang-

rae Lee, Bharati Mukherjee, Lois-Ann Yamanaka, Sui Sin Far, Fae Ng, Lawson Inada, Kimiko

Hahn, Loni Ding, and Renee Tajima-Pena.

ENGL 222(F) Studies in the Lyric+

This discussion course is designed to introduce students considering the major to the study of lyric

poetry by raising three fundamental questions: How does one read a lyric? How does one talk about

a lyric? How does one write about a lyric? In the first half of the course, we will read groups of

poems from a range of historical periods in order to examine the various elements that make a poem

a poem (tone, image, rhetorical persuasion, lyric audience, versification, form). In the second half

of the semester we will focus on two writers, John Donne and John Keats, to see how an individual

poet uses and adapts lyric conventions to develop a distinctive style and vision. Students will also

have an opportunity to analyze lyric criticism, and to put it to use in their final essay.

Requirements: active classroom participation, frequent short writing assignments, and a final

7-page paper.

Prerequisite: a 100-level English course, except 150. Enrollment limit:19 (expected: 19). (Criti-

ENGL 223(F) Voyages of Discovery (Same as Comparative Literature 211)+

Homer's Odyssey, Coleridge's Rime of the Ancient Mariner, and Equiano's The Interesting Narra-

tive of the Life of Olaudah Equiano, the African, all share a narrative structure: in each, an individual

leaves home for "new" worlds, landscapes that test the adventurer's capacity to suffer, survive, and

sometimes, conquer. This course will look at a series of narratives of discovery, including literary

works (The Odyssey, Defoe's Robinson Crusoe, Walcott's Omeros), non-fiction texts (Harriot's A

Brief and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia, The Interesting Narrative of the Life of

Olaudah Equiano, the African, and other travel and captivity narratives), and a contemporary film.

Our discussions will examine the founding assumptions of these narratives: how does each repres-

ent "home," the "individual," the "new" world and its inhabitants, the value and aim of the journey?

We will also speculate about the relation of these narratives to broader cultural projects like nation-

building and colonial expansion and conquest. The course will simultaneously focus on developing

students' critical skills.

Requirements: four or five short formal essays, including at least one revision; short informal writ-

ing assignments; and one group oral presentation.

ENGL 225(S) Romanticism and Modernism+

The literature of Europe in the nineteenth- and twentieth-centuries was dominated by two large-

scale aesthetic movements: Romanticism, arising near the beginning of the nineteenth century, and

Modernism, arising near the beginning of the twentieth. Both of these movements were "revolu-

tionary," insisting on their departure from the past, and this similarity is part of the many continui-

ties between the two. Through a study of poetry, prose, and narrative, this discussion course will

investigate the nature of these two movements: their interest in common language, their use of sym-

bolism, the relationship between democracy and art, and their formulations of the purposes of art.

The larger aim is to sharpen students' ability to think critically about literary history and the rela-

tionships between individual writers and the broader energies of culture; considerable attention will

be paid to writing and argument. Writers likely to be studied include Mary and Percy Shelley, Ten-

nyson, Baudelaire, Yeats, Dickinson, T. S. Eliot, Woolf, and Joyce.

Requirements: four or five writing assignments.

ENGL 228(F) Augustan and Modernist Satire+

Why did the genre of satire flourish to such an extent in Britain in the eighteenth century, and again

experience a resurgence in the early twentieth century? By reading satire from both periods in con-

junction, including works by Dryden, Swift, Pope, Rochester, Congreve, T. S. Eliot, Pound, Lewis,

Huxley, and Orwell, this course will explore the strategies of satire as a mode of cultural criticism.

The issue of whether satire is an inherently conservative or progressive genre will be raised, along

with questions of literary form and its deformation. Students will read some literary criticism in

conjunction with the primary texts.

Requirements: class participation, four papers of varying length (3-4 pages early on, and up to 6-8

pages), and e-mail responses.

ENGL 230(S) Introduction to Literary Theory (Same as Comparative Literature 240)+

This course will introduce students to some of the most significant and compelling trends in modern

criticism--such as gender theory, deconstruction, new historicism, and psychoanalytic criticism--

in an applied, hands-on way. The course will consider a few primary texts from different eras--a

Shakespearean play, a nineteenth-century novel, a contemporary film, for example--each in terms

of a variety of theoretical approaches. Can King Lear be read as a feminist text? a site of class

struggle? a staging of the relationship between language and the unconscious? The course aims

both to make familiar some of the critical methods students are likely to encounter in the field of

literary studies these days, and to show how such methods can transform our understanding of a

text, opening surprising possibilities even in familiar works. In the process, the course will also

raise broader questions about the imperatives and usefulness of literary theory, even about what it

means to be engaged in the discipline of literary analysis.

Requirements: 15-20 pages of writing in the form of short papers, and participation in a web-based

ENGL 232(S) Wonder (Same as Comparative Literature 212)+

We tend to imagine "wonder" as a naive, wide-eyed response, something quite distinct from the

cold and sophisticated act of critical analysis. In this discussion course, we will consider wonder as

an analyzable concept, but one that raises provocative questions about the nature and limits of our

own, distinctly modern forms of critical engagement. The course examines three historical incarna-

tions of "wonder," each involving complex relations among the aesthetic, philosophical, and liter-

ary domains: the Renaissance tradition on wonder and the marvelous; the eighteenth-century anal-

ysis of the sublime; and the mid-twentieth-century critique of Enlightenment thought. We will con-

sider writers such as Shakespeare, Wordsworth, Borges, and Nicholson Baker (all wonderful);

painters such as Leonardo, Vermeer, and Courbet; some recent films, including Titanic; and critical

or philosophical writers, including Aristotle, Edmund Burke, and Walter Benjamin.

Requirements: four or five short essays, including at least one revision, and active participation in

discussion.

the Middle Ages. Biblical precedent gave these phenomena the status of divine revelation, from

Joseph's interpretations of dreams in the Old Testament to John's vision of last things in the con-

cluding book of the New Testament, the Apocalypse. Dreams arising from physical or psychologi-

cal human causes had little meaning or interest for medieval dream theorists. However, there was

enormous anxiety and debate about how to tell the difference between "true" and "false" dreams.

This debate, in turn, inspired an enormous amount of literature, both religious and secular, serious

and playful, that made "dream vision" one of the leading genres of the Middle Ages. The author of

Sir Gawain and the Green Knight wrote Pearl (thought by some to be a greater masterpiece than the

well-known romance). Chaucer wrote four: Book of the Duchess, House of Fame, Parliament of

Fowls, and Legend of Good Women. The third great poet of the fourteenth century, William Lang-

land, wrote Piers Plowman. We will read these and earlier examples of the genre that set the patterns

for them: Macrobius' Commentary on the Dream of Scipio, Boethius, The Consolation of Philoso-

phy, and Guillaume de Lorris and Jean de Meun, The Romance of the Rose. The goal of the course is

to introduce students to a major medieval literary tradition, and to develop skills in close reading

and effective critical writing. Combination lecture and discussion.

ENGL 316(S) The Art of Courtship

During Elizabeth I's reign, love poetry and dramatic comedy acquired a remarkable popularity and

brilliance, unparalleled in English literary history. What is the "art"--the language, form, and rhet-

oric--of Elizabethan courtship? What kind of society generated this literary obsession, and con-

versely, what kind of culture and sexual relationships did the literature of courtship and seduction

produce? This course explores the links between literary conventions and social conventions, sexu-

al politics and court politics. It studies gems of English Renaissance literature (Shakespeare's

Twelfth Night and Much Ado About Nothing, love poetry by Shakespeare, Spenser, Sidney, and

Donne, Castiglione's The Courtier) along with court rhetoric, political negotiations, the first poem

written and published by an Englishwoman, the first English autobiography, social debates over

poetry, the theater, sexuality, clandestine marriage, women's lawful liberty, and the preservation or

destruction of the social order. There will be short lectures, student presentations, and lots of discus-

sion.

Requirements: weekly journal entries, one 5-page paper, and a final research paper of 10-12 pages.

ENGL 319T(S) Shakespeare in Love (Same as Theatre 319T)+

What made Shakespeare's dramas of love phenomenal popular successes as well as enduring works

of art? After viewing Shakespeare in Love, students in this tutorial course will read, analyze, and

discuss in depth three Shakespearean tragedies and two Shakespearean comedies: Romeo and Ju-

liet, A Midsummer Night's Dream, As You Like It, Othello, and Antony and Cleopatra. We will ex-

amine the ways in which attitudes toward love evolve as Shakespeare's poetic style and dramatic

technique mature, and the genre shifts between tragedy and comedy.

Students will meet with the instructor in pairs for an hour each week. They will alternate between

writing 5- to 7-page papers and commentaries on their partner's papers. Emphasis will be on ana-

lyzing and generating interpretations of Shakespearean drama, constructing critical arguments, for-

mulating cogent written critiques, and carrying on an oral debate about a variety of interpretations.

ENGL 323T(S) A Novel Education+

All novels are conscious of their readers; eighteenth-century novels are obsessed with them. In the

century when the genre first flourished, readers are the ultimate objects of novelists' plots. We are

addressed, teased, pleaded with, embarrassed, flattered, made fun of, praised, chided, solicited,

warned, reminded, rebuked, asked for sympathy, and--always--closely watched. Eighteenth-cen-

tury novelists--and their narrators--aggressively educate their readers, not only teaching us how

to interpret the novel itself, but also demanding that we self-consciously question the powers of

mind and habits of heart we bring to the process of interpreting a book, ourselves, and our world.

In this tutorial course, we will explore the narrative and rhetorical strategies two of the century's

greatest novelists use in creating, shaping, and finally educating their readers. We will focus princi-

pally on Henry Fielding's Tom Jones (1749) and Laurence Sterne's Tristram Shandy

(1760-67)--long, brilliantly intricate novels that go about their work in very different ways, but that

are equally committed to the project of giving their readers a novel education. We'll consider--

much more briefly--Fielding's Joseph Andrews, Sterne's A Sentimental Journey, and Bunyan's

Pilgrim's Progress. We will also read criticism by such "reader response" theorists as Stanley Fish

and Wolfgang Iser, and--in the individualized setting of a tutorial--students will be asked to devel-

op and articulate their own theories of reading by critically examining the ways in which texts affect

and educate them.

Requirements: Students will meet with the instructor in pairs for an hour each week; they will write

a 5- to 7-page paper every other week (five in all), and comment on their partners' papers in alter-

nate weeks. Emphasis will be placed on developing skills not only in reading and interpretation, but

also in constructing critical arguments and responding to them in written and oral critiques.

ENGL 327(S) British Literature and the Colonial Subject

What is the relation between the "subject" of British colonialism and the nation's dominant literary

culture? During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, England's colonial interests in Africa, In-

dia, the South Pacific and the West Indies, and its involvement in the slave trade, generated a wealth

of writing: travel and slave narratives, official and company documents, anthropological and philo-

sophical accounts of "race," and polemics for and against empire and the slave trade. During the

same period, British literary culture was increasingly viewed as a sign of its power and prestige

among nations. This course has two related aims: (1) We will read documentary and fictional ac-

counts of British colonial rule, primarily from the mid-eighteenth- through the early-nineteenth

centuries, assessing how these accounts portray and/or challenge the perspectives of British imperi-

al power, and how they attempt to render the colonialized subject. (2) Against these narratives, we

will read more canonical literature of the period, asking to what extent its formal characteristics and

thematic concerns reflect or respond to the discourses of colonialism. What are the connections be-

tween the lyric "I" as it emerges in late eighteenth-century poetry and the imperial "I/eye"? Be-

tween the rural or common subjects of Romantic poetry and the subjects of colonial rule? Between

the land- and sea-scapes of colonial voyage narratives and those of the loco-descriptive poem? Our

texts will include travel and slave narratives (e.g., John Stedman's Narrative, of a Five Year's Ex-

pedition, Against the Revolted Negroes of Surinam, Equiano's The Interesting Narrative of the Life

of Olaudah Equiano, the African), debates on "race" and the slave trade (including polemics and

philosophical arguments by Thomas Clarkson, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and Quobha Cugoano),

"novelizations" of slave revolts by John Thelwall and Maria Edgeworth, poetry and prose by Samu-

el Johnson, William Blake, William Wordsworth, and Coleridge, and some modern theory.

Requirements: three 5- to 8-page formal essays, and frequent short writing assignments.

ENGL 331(F) Romantic Poetry
An intensive study of the important poetry of the Romantic period (roughly 1785-1830), one of the
great watersheds in the history of poetry in English. Poets likely to be studied include Wordsworth,
Blake, Coleridge, Smith, Robinson, Byron, Shelley, Hemans, and Keats. We will also pay some
attention to the historical developments of the period, especially the consequences of the French
Revolution and the subsequent rise of Napoleon.

ENGL 333(F) Nineteenth-Century British Novel

A study of major works from what is often considered the Golden Age of the novel. A central focus

of the course will be on the evolution of the realist novel, and the aesthetic and social implications of

realism as a method, but we will also look at alternative strains in fiction of the period, such as the

Gothic and "sensation" novels. Probable texts will include Austen's Persuasion, Brontë's Wuther-

ing Heights, Dickens's Bleak House, Trollope's The Warden, Braddon's Lady Audley's Secret,

Eliot's Middlemarch, and Forster's A Room With a View.

ENGL 337(S) Victorian Culture

Victorian writers and intellectuals were profoundly conscious of themselves as living in a distinc-

tive age. Materially, the combination of the Industrial Revolution and colonial holdings created vast

wealth--with its accompanying conspicuous consumption and nouveau-riche "vulgarity"--side

by side with a depth and scale of poverty and human suffering never seen before. Socially and intel-

lectually, many saw it as an "age of transition": as John Stuart Mill put it, "Mankind have outgrown

old superstitions and old doctrines, and have not yet acquired new ones." Responses ranged from

nostalgic depression (Matthew Arnold sadly "Wandering between two worlds, one dead/The other

powerless to be born") to exuberant optimism (Elizabeth Barrett Browning celebrating "this live,

throbbing age/That brawls, cheats, maddens, calculates, aspires/And spends more passion, more

heroic heat/Betwixt the mirrors of its drawing rooms/Than Roland with his knights at Ronce-

valles"), but nearly all took extremely seriously their roles as critics and conceptual architects of a

new world.

This course will examine Victorian literary culture in its broader social context, looking at the ways

writers engaged with constructions of class, nationality, gender, and the role of the artist and intel-

lectual within society, and tracing the shift from High Victorian earnestness to the Late Victorian

"aesthetic" reaction against it. Primary attention will be on poetry and non-fiction prose, together

with a few short novels and plays, by such writers as Arnold, Robert and Elizabeth Barrett Brown-

ing, Thomas Carlyle, Charles Darwin, Elizabeth Gaskell, Harriet Martineau, Mill, Walter Pater,

Christina and Dante Gabriel Rossetti, John Ruskin, and Oscar Wilde. This course will be taught by a

mixture of lecture and discussion, punctuated by an occasional slide show.

ENGL 338(S) Literature of the American Renaissance (Same as American Studies 338)

This course centers on American writing from the quarter century before the Civil War. In the first

half of the next century, a consensus emerged about who ought to be celebrated as the great writers

of the earlier period, and the idea of the "American Renaissance" was born. But such judgments are

never final, and we need to be concerned with how they are made. Some of the writers we shall take

up are the Transcendentalists and their allies (Emerson, Thoreau, Whitman); some had visions con-

siderably darker than those of the Transcendentalists (Poe, Hawthorne, Melville, Dickinson); some

registered the impact of slavery on contemporary notions of America and the American self (Ja-

cobs, Stowe). We shall consider all these authors, and the experiments in literary form that their

visions entailed.

ENGL 339(S) Postcoloniality and Empire in U. S. Literature and Culture (Same as American
Studies 339)*
The editors of the influential 1989 anthology, The Empire Writes Back: Theory and Practice in
Post-Colonial Literatures, notoriously claimed that the "first post-colonial society to develop a `na-

tional' literature was the USA." Despite the originary status here assigned to the U.S., the U.S. is
persistently imagined as a nation or as a former British colony but not as an empire. Indeed, the

stability of America's self-conception as a nation depends upon the eschewal of its imperial history

and impulses. This discussion course provides an overview of the literary and cultural legacies of a

specific period of U.S. imperialism. It is designed to focus primarily on the continuing impact of the

late nineteenth-century and early twentieth-century transoceanic wars (against Hawaii, Cuba,

Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Phillippines) that established the U.S. as a global power. Yet we will

also address both the possibilities and limitations of applying models of colonialization to the histo-

ries and literatures of U.S. racial minorities. Possible authors and filmmakers include: Amy Kaplan,

Marlon Fuentes, Gayatri Spivak, Homi Bhabha, Ronald Takaki, Jessica Hagedorn, Angel Shaw,

Oscar Campomanes, Carmelita Tropicana, Inderpal Grewal, Le Ly Hayslip, Coco Fusco, Gloria

Anzaldúa, and Haunani-Kay Trask.

ENGL 341(S) American Genders, American Sexualities (Same as Women's and Gender

Studies 341)

This course investigates how sexual identities, desires, and acts are represented and reproduced in

American literary and popular culture. Focusing on two culturally rich periods--roughly

1880-1940 (when the terms "homosexual" and "heterosexual" came to connote discrete sexual

identities), and on the last twenty years--we will explore what it means to read and theorize "queer-

ly." Among the questions we will ask: What counts as "sex" or "sexual identity" in a text? Are there

definably lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or queer writing styles or cultural practices? What

does sexuality have to do with gender? How are sexual subjectivities intertwined with race, ethnici-

ty, class, and other identities and identifications? And why has "queerness" proven to be such a

powerful and sometimes powerfully contested concept? We will also explore what impact particu-

lar historical events, such as the rise of sexology, the Harlem Renaissance, the AIDS pandemic, and

the emergence of a transgender movement have had on queer cultural production. Readings may

include works by the following authors: Butler, Sedgwick, Foucault, Freud, James, Lorde, Stein,

Hughes, Cather, Larsen, Almaguer, Diaz, Pratt, Feinberg, and Fitzgerald, as well as screenings of

contemporary videos and films.

Requirements: active class participation, several short writing assignments, two 5-page papers, and

Art Spiegelman, the course will explore the changing images of the Jew as depicted in fiction from

1917 to the present.

ENGL 345(F) The Black Arts (Same as American Studies 345)*

During the period from 1965-1976, many writers attempted to develop a literary art based on new

emerging conceptions of "blackness." This course will examine what they understood a "black aes-

thetic" to be, and how this understanding affected their writing. With a careful eye to their political

and cultural contexts, this course will consider poetry, drama, essays, and fiction by such writers as

Amiri Baraka, Sonia Sanchez, Nikki Giovanni, Ishmael Reed, and Toni Cade Bambara.

ENGL 346(F) U.S. Women of Color: Public and Private Cultures (Same as American Studies

This course will explore cultural production and consumption by "women of color" in the U.S.,

with a focus on the way various groups have negotiated the presumed gap between private experi-

ence and public or political form. Historical, social, and cultural connections and disjunctions be-

tween African-American, Arab-American, Asian-American, Native-American, Latina, and other

women will be examined, especially in the context of feminism and cultural nationalism; and we

will explore the varied ways in which family, labor, and leisure practices can place women of color

social and cultural exigencies felt by writers of the time. Broader tenets of modernist ideology, such

as impersonality and the use of myth, will be considered in light of mass cultural developments,

including the invention of the tabloid and the phonograph. Recent ideas about class allegiances

among the modernists will be explored, particularly as they relate to modernism's fascination with

popular culture and advertising. Students will read literary criticism in conjunction with the prima-

ry texts.

ENGL 365(S) Studies in Dramatic Literature: British and Irish Drama Since 1956 (Same as

A comparative study of recent major developments in British and Irish theater. We will consider

how the work of British playwrights responds to the country's post-Imperial decline in the period

since the Suez Crisis, and to the broader epistemological and theatrical challenges of constructing

history and cultural identity in the wake of postmodernism. Readings will include plays by John

Osborne, Harold Pinter, Samuel Beckett, David Hare, and Tom Stoppard. Our consideration of par-

allel concerns with history, identity, and representation in work from the Irish Republic--a nation

which has emerged from cultural insularity and poverty into burgeoning economic prosperity and

exuberant cultural self-assertion in recent decades--will include readings of plays by John B.

ENGL 366(F) Modern British Fiction

This course explores the range of fiction being produced within the British tradition in the first half

of the twentieth century, and includes novels by Ford (The Good Soldier), Conrad (Heart of Dark-

ness and The Secret Agent), Kipling (Kim), Joyce (Ulysses), Woolf (To the Lighthouse), and Forster

(A Passage to India). The relationship of these works to three issues central to modern life in Britain

(and Ireland) will be brought out over the course of the semester: the rise of mass culture; the emer-

gence of female suffrage and feminism; and the demands of empire and imperialism. At the same

time, the course will cover some of the important formal developments that shaped the novels of

this period, including experiments in narrative point-of-view, stream-of-consciousness, and the

ENGL 368(F) Language, Performance, and Culture (Same as Comparative Literature 368)

What is a word? How does it function, or appear to function? Can we ever truly communicate or

understand what is said? Do we produce, or perform, language--or does language shape us? This

discussion-oriented course provides an introduction to thinking about meaning and verbal expres-

sion through fairly complex language-related theory, read against lighter dramatic works and other

cultural materials. Theory covered will include readings by Saussure, Wittgenstein, Austin, Hei-

degger, Derrida, Butler, Haraway, and others. Materials examined will include plays by Chekhov,

Wilde, Beckett, Mamet, Churchill, and others, as well as Dr. Seuss' Green Eggs and Ham, clips

from Marx Brothers films, and simple computer-based talking robots whose linguistic program-

ming students will analyze and reformat (no computer knowledge necessary).

Requirements: active participation, several short writing and group assignments, one 5- to 7-page

paper, one 10- to 12-page paper, a short presentation, and a take-home final exam. Students will be

evaluated on the basis of effort, engagement, and depth of exploration.

ENGL 373(F) Modern Critical Theory (Same as Comparative Literature 343)

This course will explore the complex and provocative work of a variety of contemporary theorists

in terms of a few fairly simple questions: What are we up to when we read literary texts? What

norms or conventions inform even our most casual interpretive act, and where do they come from?

What forms of pleasure and what assertions of power are entailed in reading and writing, and how

do our literary pursuits bear on questions of sexual and political desire? Although we will range

beyond these authors, this semester we will focus especially on the work of Jacques Derrida, Jac-

ques Lacan, and feminist theorists. In order to keep our own activities as readers at the forefront, we

will enter into the critical fray by way of a variety of specific literary texts and films, including nov-

els by Virginia Woolf and Margaret Duras, poems by Sylvia Plath and Louise Erdrich, films by

Werner Herzog and Billy Wilder.

Requirements: two papers--one shorter, one longer.

ENGL 378(S) Nature/Writing (Same as Environmental Studies 378)

What do we mean by "nature"? How do we understand the relationships between "nature" and "cul-

ture"? In this course we will examine how various American writers have attempted to render con-

ceptions of "nature" in literary form. We will compare treatments of various kinds of natural envi-

ronments and trace the philosophical and stylistic traditions within the nature writing genre. The

authors to be considered include Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, William Faulkner,

Annie Dillard, Barry Lopez, Ursula LeGuin, and Wendell Berry.

ENGL 383T(F) Tutorial in Memoir+

A tutorial workshop designed to explore the problems and possibilities that arise in the composition

of memoir. Students will do two kinds of writing: critical analysis of published memoir (writers will

include Vladimir Nabokov, Jamaica Kincaid, and Tobias Wolff), and memoir of their own. In keep-

ing with the tutorial format, students will meet in pairs with the instructor once each week; during

these meetings, students will present a short paper or piece of memoir, or join the instructor in re-

sponding to one such paper or work of memoir.

Evaluation will be based on class participation, short writing assignments, and forty final pages of

original memoir.

Prerequisite: English 206, 283, 286, or 379, or permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 10

(expected: 10). If the course is overenrolled, enrollment decisions will be based on writing samples.

ENGL 390(S) Four Directors (Same as Comparative Literature 390)

Artistically-made film not only "re-presents" life, but suggests new "ways of seeing" it in general.

This lecture/discussion course provides in-depth exploration of the work of four groundbreaking

film directors whose works manifest wildly divergent visions. We will study Howard Hawks'

"screwball" comedy romances (for instance, His Girl Friday); Alfred Hitchcock's dark dramas of

crime, horror, and the psyche (for instance, Vertigo); Jean-Luc Godard's irreverent, cooly stylish

constructions (for instance, Breathless); and Ingmar Bergman's lyrical avant-garde masterpieces

(for instance, Persona). Background readings in general film structure and theory will also be in-

cluded.

Requirements: Several short writing and group assignments, four 4- to 5-page papers, a short in-

class presentation, and a final exam. Student performance will be evaluated on the basis of effort,

engagement, and depth of exploration.

ENGL 393(F) Good Girls, Bad Girls*

This course is a mapping of contemporary diasporic Indian women's fiction. Beginning with the

moment of partition, this course will explore the ways in which Indian women in the diaspora have

produced a literary voice--or, more accurately phrased, the range of voices they have produced--

that engages a wide spectrum of issues. Writing against the backdrop of India as a cultural, political,

and social reality (an all pressing reality, in many cases), writers from Bapsi Sidhwa to Shani Moot-

oo have undertaken the project of articulating the experience of women--and frequently the dias-

poric community at large--struggling to make a home for themselves in the metropolis. The diffi-

culties of adaptation and accommodation, as these works show, emerge not only from outside but

from within the very community they claim as theirs. Issues such as domestic violence, abuse, the

repression of female desires, the silencing of female voice, the resilience and power of tradition, the

expectation of family, the pressure to conform to accepted notions of "Indian-ness" (a category of

experience frequently challenged by these women), are all questions taken up by these authors.

And, in a range of literary genres and styles--from the humorous realism of Meera Syal to the fan-

tastic postmodern "realism" of writers such as Mootoo, Divrakaruni, and Sunetra Gupta, from the

"traditional (serious) fiction" to literature of the more popular variety. By working through these

different novels, this course attempts to understand the particular ways in which diaspora has im-

pacted Indian women's lives in Anglophone societies such as England and the U.S., and to think

about the kinds of opportunities diaspora has afforded these authors.

Readings will include: Bapsi Sidhwa, Cracking India; Ruth Prawar Jhabvala, Shards of Memory;

Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni, The Mistress of Spices; Meena Alexander, The Shock of Arrival; Ka-

mala Das, My Story: The Compelling Autobiography of . . .; Meera Syal, Anita and Me; Ginu Kama-

ni, Junglee Girl; Sunetra Gupta, A Sin of Colours; Shauna Baldwin Singh, What the Body Remem-

bers; Jhumpa Lahiri, The Interpreter of Maladies; Kirin Narayan, Love Stars and All That; Manju

Kapur, Difficult Daughters; Mira Kamdar, Motiba's Tattoos; Shani Mootoo, Cereus Blooms at

Night; and Marina Tamar Budhos, The Professor of Light.

say.

MAJOR SEMINARS

   Major Seminars are small discussion classes oriented around a long final paper and focusing in
depth on a particular set of literary or representational issues. Because they entail the kind of sus-
tained, independent work required for a longer paper, Major Seminars are particularly suitable to
students contemplating Honors or graduate work in English. But they should also be attractive to
any student looking for intensive intellectual engagement in the context of a small discussion class.

   Preference for admission to Major Seminars will go to junior and senior English majors who
have not taken such a course before. Thereafter, preference will be given to non-majors for whom a
seminar would fulfill a requirement of a College program or department.

ENGL 311(S) Studies in Shakespeare: Shakespeare and the Theorists (Same as Theatre 315)

Shakespeare studies has in recent years involved a remarkable confluence of critical methods,

something like a cross-section of the discipline of literary criticism today: Feminist theory, Marx-

ism and Cultural Materialism, New-Historicism, Post-Structuralist and Psychoanalytic theory. We

will focus on a few plays in depth--As You Like It, King Lear, and Antony and Cleopatra--engag-

ing them "in their own right" (we'll have reason to wonder what that means) and in relation to a

range of critical and theoretical writings from Samuel Johnson to Luce Irigaray.

Requirements: one short essay, a 15-page term paper (with individual conferences preparatory to

that paper), and active participation in class discussions.

Prerequisite: a 100-level English course, except 150. Major Seminar. Enrollment limited to 15 (ex-

pected: 15). Preference to majors in English and Theatre. (Pre-1700 or Criticism)

ENGL 330(F) The Brontës: The Making of Myths

This course will explore the evolving mythic power and enduring imaginative force of the art the

Brontës created. Readings will begin with the famous fantasy kingdoms the Brontë children--

Charlotte, Emily, Branwell, and Anne--produced while living in an isolated parsonage on the

Yorkshire moors in mid-nineteenth-century England. We will then turn to three novels by Charlotte

(Jane Eyre, Villette, and Shirley), Emily's poetry and her novel, Wuthering Heights, and selected

writings by Anne and Branwell. In addition, each student will read and report on one of the many

competing biographies of the Brontës. Subjects for discussion will include the Brontës' own myth-

making; the aesthetic transformation of their childhood experiences into fiction and poetry; and the

myths generated by contending nineteenth- and twentieth-century biographical and critical ac-

counts of the Brontës.

Requirements: active participation, two panel presentations, one short paper, and a 15-page term

paper.

Prerequisite: a 100-level English course, except 150. Major Seminar. Enrollment limited to 15 (ex-

pected: 15). Preference to English majors and concentrators in Women's and Gender Studies.

ENGL 348(F) Faulkner and His Influence

William Faulkner was a great writer in two ways. First, he was the most interesting formal innovator

of all the novelists of American modernism (as in The Sound and the Fury and As I Lay Dying).

Second, he was a strange and provocative theorist of race (as in Go Down, Moses and Absalom,

Absalom!). We shall consider both these dimensions of Faulkner, and what they have to do with

each other. Then we shall take up novelists in the Faulkner tradition. One of these will be Toni Mor-

rison; others will be from the Southern tradition (I will choose among such writers as Robert Penn

Warren, Eudora Welty, Flannery O'Connor, and Bobbie Ann Mason). This course will be con-

ducted entirely as a seminar.

Requirements: one 5- to 8-page paper and one 15-page paper. Students will also report on Faulkner

criticism.

ENGL 375(F) Issues in Literary History

Literary texts preserve human voice--they are "timeless"--but they are also historical objects

themselves, rooted in time. Our reading and experience of literature is everywhere and always "his-

torical," a look through time. In this course we will look closely at the ways in which time matters

for readers and writers. What does historical "context" mean, and how much attention should we

pay to it? What sort of historical objects do literary texts make? In what ways are writers and their

works part of an ongoing historical narrative? We will read a broad spectrum of literary works and

critical essays. The literary works will be primarily poetry, from various periods, with special focus

on Shakespeare and Dickinson. Critical texts will include formal literary histories and critical es-

says from several periods, past and present.

Requirements: significant in-class participation and work, one brief paper, and a 15- to 20-page

essay on a topic of the student's own devising.

ENGL 388(S) Mysteries (Same as Comparative Literature 328)
The bizarre, the inexplicable, the transcendent, the uncanny--mystery manifests itself in many dif-

ferent forms. The private detective, for example, engages in "an adventure in search of a hidden

                                              ­ 176 ­

truth," in Raymond Chandler's words. He knows the crime can be solved. Yet much contemporary

art seems to withhold the comfort of such certainty. The hidden remains hidden, and mystery looks

like an end in itself, an aesthetic principle. This seminar will examine the idea of mystery from a

variety of perspectives and through several different artistic forms: fiction by Edgar Allan Poe, Vla-

dimir Nabokov, Henry James, Jorge Luis Borges, Franz Kafka, Flannery O'Connor, and Raymond

Chandler; poetry by Robert Frost, Edwin Arlington Robinson, Robert Browning, and W. S. Mer-

win; paintings by Edward Hopper and Rene Magritte; and films by Howard Hawks (The Big Sleep)

and Michelangelo Antonioni (Blow-Up).

Requirements: class participation, a short paper, and a 15- to 20-page paper.

CONCENTRATION IN ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
   The Environmental Studies Program, within the liberal arts mission of Williams College, pro-

vides students with an opportunity to explore how humans interact with the environment, including
physical, biological, philosophical, and social elements. The program is designed so that students
will grow to realize the complexity of issues and perspectives and to appreciate that many environ-
mental issues lack distinct, sharp-edged boundaries. Our goal is to aid students in becoming well-
informed, environmentally-literate citizens of the planet who have the capacity to become active
participants in their communities ranging in scale from the local to the global. To this end, the pro-
gram is designed to develop abilities to think in interdisciplinary ways and to use holistic-synthetic
approaches in solving problems while incorporating the knowledge and experiences they have
gained from majoring in other departments at the College.

   The concentration in Environmental Studies allows students to focus some of their elective
courses in an integrated, interdisciplinary study of the environment--that is, the natural world, both
in itself and as it has been modified by human activity. The purpose of the program is to provide the
tools and ideas needed to engage constructively with the environmental and social issues brought
about by changes in population, economic activity, and values. Environmental controversies typi-
cally call upon citizens and organizations to grasp complex, uncertain science, contending human
values, and ethical choices--in short, to deal with matters for which the liberal arts are a necessary
but not sufficient preparation. Environmental Studies accordingly includes courses in natural
sciences, social sciences, humanities, and the arts, in order to equip students with the broad educa-
tional background needed to analyze complex environmental matters and to fashion pragmatic, fea-
sible solutions.

   The program is administered by the Center for Environmental Studies (CES), located in Kellogg
House. Founded in 1967, CES is one of the oldest environmental studies programs at a liberal arts
college. In addition to the academic program, CES is the focus of a varied set of activities in which
students lead and participate, often with other members of the Williams community. The Matt Cole
Memorial Library at Kellogg House holds a substantial collection of books, periodicals, unpub-
lished documents, maps, and electronic media. Kellogg House also houses a new Geographic Infor-
mation System laboratory as well as study and meeting facilities available to students and student
groups. The Center administers the Hopkins Memorial Forest, a 2430-acre natural area northwest
of campus, where field-study sites, a laboratory, and passive-recreation opportunities may be found
in all seasons. CES also operates an environmental analysis laboratory at the Science Center.

   The Environmental Studies Program has three overlapping components:
    In order to earn the concentration in Environmental Studies, students must complete a set of seven

      courses.
    All students are strongly encouraged to meet the Four Places goal. (See below.)
    Students are encouraged to pursue honors in Environmental Studies by planning a senior thesis.

Concentration Requirements
Seven courses are required: four are core courses to be taken by all students earning the concentra-
tion; three are distribution courses to be selected from the lists below.

   Core courses
   101 Humans in the Landscape
   203 Ecology
   302 Environmental Planning and Design Workshop
   402 Senior Seminar

   The core courses are intended to be taken in sequence, although there is some flexibility allowed.
Environmental Studies (ENVI) 101 is a broad introduction to the field, emphasizing the humanities
and social sciences. ENVI 203 is a course in ecology, offered in Biology, that provides a unified
conceptual approach to the behavior of living things in the natural world. ENVI 302 (Environmen-
tal Planning) puts teams of students to work on planning projects of immediate importance in the
Berkshires. ENVI 402, the senior seminar, is an opportunity for concentrators majoring in a wide
variety of disciplines to draw together their educational experiences and provide a personal ac-
counting of how they understand the interdisciplinary character of environmental studies and its
connections to their future lives and careers. The core course structure affords students freedom to
explore and to specialize in diverse fields of study, while sustaining a focus on environmental ques-
tions throughout their time at Williams.

   An interdisciplinary course emphasizing field science, ENVI 102 (Introduction to Environmen-
tal Science), is strongly recommended for all students interested in the concentration. Note that en-
rollments in ENVI 102 are limited. In order to assure enrollment, students should consult with one
of the instructors during autumn semester. ENVI 102 must be taken before the junior year.

Variations from the requirements of the concentration must be approved in writing by the director of
the program. Students are urged to consult with program faculty and the director as soon as they
develop an interest in the concentration.

   In addition to courses fulfilling the concentration requirements, the following electives and re-
lated electives are offered:

   Environmental Studies 397, 398 Independent Study of Environmental Problems
   Environmental Studies 493-W031-494 Senior Research and Thesis

   Winter study courses play an important role in the program, offering opportunities to experiment
in fields unfamiliar to the student, and for interdisciplinary topics to be developed by faculty work-
ing alone and in teams. Students are urged to review each year's winter study offerings bearing in
mind their interests in the environment.

Rationale for Course Numbering
   The numbering sequence of the four required courses reflects the order in which they should be

taken, although Environmental Studies 302 may be taken in the senior or sophomore year if a stu-
dent is away junior year. Cross-listed courses are assigned the same number as the departmental
number whenever possible.

Four Places--A Goal
   The human place in natural landscapes is intrinsically geographic, and learning about humans in

particular places is an essential part of environmental studies. By the time each student in Environ-
mental Studies graduates, she or he should have developed intellectual insight into and personal
experience of four places: "Home"; "Here"--the Berkshires; "There"--an alien place; and "The
World"--a global perspective. For practical purposes, There is a place where the geography is un-
usual in the student's experience (e.g., developing country, inner city, arctic), so are the socioeco-
nomic circumstances (for example, per capita income might be a small fraction of a year's tuition at
Williams), and the working language is not standard English. Although this goal is not a require-
ment for the concentration, it is a significant aspect of the program, and CES resources are aimed in
part at enabling all students to meet this goal. For example, students are encouraged to pursue sum-
mer internships in their "Home" communities, or to do semester or winter study courses at locations
outside the temperate zones ("There"); field courses in natural science or history courses emphasiz-
ing New England can deepen familiarity with "Here." Students concentrating in Environmental
Studies should plan winter study courses and summer work or study experiences with the Four
Places goal in mind, particularly the experiences "There" and at "Home." Courses not in the list of
electives for the concentration may be considered as substitutes, on a case-by-case basis, if they also
meet the Four Places goal in a way not otherwise available in the program. Students should see the
program director for further information.

Honors in Environmental Studies
   A student earns honors in Environmental Studies by successfully completing a rigorous, original

independent research project under the supervision of two or more members of the faculty, includ-
ing at least one member of the CES faculty. The research project should be reported and defended
both in a thesis and orally. A student may undertake an honors thesis and submit it to both his or her
major department and Environmental Studies; petitions for a joint honors project should be ap-
proved by the department chair and the director of the program no later than the beginning of the
student's senior year. Students who pursue honors in Environmental Studies alone should enroll in
Environmental Studies 493-W031-494, Senior Research and Thesis, in addition to completing the
requirements for the concentration.

   Because most research requires sustained field, laboratory, or library work that is difficult to
combine with conventional coursework, students are strongly encouraged to spend the summer be-
fore senior year doing honors research. Funds to support student research are available from re-
stricted endowments of the Center, and an open competition is held each spring, to allocate the lim-
ited resources. Some departments also provide limited support for summer thesis research. Stu-
dents and their faculty sponsors should plan the thesis with the possibility of summer research in
mind.

   A faculty recommendation for honors in Environmental Studies will be made on the basis of the
academic rigor, interdisciplinary synthesis, independence, and originality demonstrated by the stu-
dent and in the completed thesis. In contemplating an honors thesis, students should take into ac-
count their mastery of the basic materials and skills (often in more than one academic discipline),
their ability to work independently, and their commitment and desire to pursue a sometimes ardu-
ous but typically rewarding process that combines intellectual achievement with tests of character
and fortitude.

ENVI 101(F) Humans in the Landscape
A survey of basic topics, aimed at putting environmental questions into the contexts of natural and
social science and the arts and humanities. By the end of the term, the student should be able to
recognize and to interpret the natural, economic, and industrial bases of daily life; investigate that
which seems interesting or problematic in his or her environment, at levels ranging from local to
global; and be able to make judgments about which aspects of that environment are worth addition-
al time, effort, or commitment. These skills, particularly the last, are necessary but not sufficient for
developing a stance toward environmental quality as an element of civilized life.
Principal means of evaluation will be two quizzes (testing detailed recall), written exercises (testing
ability to grasp and make use of ideas important to the course), and a final exam; attentive participa-

ENVI 102(S) Introduction to Environmental Science

Environmental Science is an interdisciplinary approach to the study of environmental issues. This

course stresses the scientific methods used by biologists, chemists and geologists to analyze and

measure changes in the environment. Current environmental problems affecting the Williamstown

area are used as a basis for exploring issues of global importance, including air pollution, endan-

gered species, solid-waste disposal, water quality and the effects of land-use changes on environ-

mental quality.

This course meets four times a week, including three one-hour morning sessions and a three-hour

afternoon period. Morning sessions are divided between lectures and discussion, and we spend af-

ternoons in the field or laboratory.

Format: lecture/discussion/lab. Evaluation will be based on reports of field and laboratory projects,

participation in discussion, and an independent research project.

Preference given to first-year students. This course is designed for students who have a strong inter-

est in environmental science. Enrollment limit: 36 (expected: 25).

Satisfies one semester of Division III requirement.

ENVI 230(S) International and Environmental Justice Issues

Environmental justice is a worldwide social movement arising from the unequal distribution of the

environmental consequences and benefits of public policies and natural resource use in global so-

ciety. In this course, we will look beyond the traditional focus on industrial pollution, waste sites

and the US "not in my backyard" movement to the wider issues of who decides how our natural

environment is used, who benefits and who is placed at risk. Local autonomy and democratic pro-

cess are central issues, as we look at environmental equity in the international setting. We will ex-

amine a range of cases, from our own backyard to the rain forests of Mexico and beyond, to see how

processes at different scales interact to produce the geography of difference and how environmental

questions intersect with social justice. These issues include sustainable development, eco-tourism,

bio-prospecting, intellectual property, transgenic crops in the developing world and more. Students

will be introduced to current methods of engaged research, combining local ethnographic ap-

proaches with methods such as landscape ecology and regional analysis, to address crucial social

and environmental issues of our time.

Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: midterm, short written essays, and final project.

ENVI 302(S) Environmental Planning and Analysis Workshop

This course will challenge students to incorporate disparate perspectives and methodologies as

they participate in the analysis of environmental problems. While the course serves as an introduc-

tion to the theories and practices of environmental planning, it also draws upon the student's past

curricular and extracurricular experiences in working on a contemporary project. The course com-

mences with case studies that exemplify various methodologies of environmental analysis and then

proceeds to hands-on participation in an environmental design project. The approach will be to as-

semble diverse teams of students who together will undertake an interdisciplinary process in ex-

ploring alternative outcomes to a specific environmental problem.

Format: discussion/project lab. Requirements: midterm exam, short written exercises, workshop

presentations, and a final group project.

Prerequisites: Environmental Studies 101 and Biology/Environmental Studies 203, or permission

of instructors. No enrollment limit (expected: 25). Open only to juniors and seniors. Required

course for students wishing to complete the Environmental Studies Program.

ENVI 307(F) Environmental Law (Same as Political Science 317)

In the past twenty years, environmental law has emerged as an important aspect of how we govern

the use of public and private property. This course introduces students to the study of law from the

perspective of a litigator and legislator, and takes up both the common law of nuisance, which is the

foundation for environmental governance in the Anglo-American tradition, and an array of statuto-

ry law, which has profound implications for our ideas about property and how we put those ideas

into practice. In our society, and increasingly around the world, these ideas are central to civil order

and to our efforts to maintain a balance between our individual wishes and our commitment to our

communities.

Format: lecture/discussion.

Prerequisites: Political Science 110 and Environmental Studies 101. Environmental Studies 308

(Same as Political Science 308) is strongly recommended; this is the companion course to Environ-

mental Studies/Political Science 308 (Environmental Policy). Students are not required to register

for both courses, but they are team-taught and coordinated, so that the benefit of taking them both is

intended to be greater than the sum of parts. The courses may be taken in either order. No enrollment

limit (expected: 20).

ENVI 308(S) Environmental Policy (Same as Political Science 308)

Over the past generation, environmental policy has emerged as a new and important aspect of the

governance of the natural world and private property in the U.S. This course introduces students to

the study of public policy and its politics from the perspective of the constellation of professionals,

managers, and activists involved in the implementation and formulation of policy. We will take up

the organizational forms and politics that underlie governing in the post-industrial political econo-

my, and survey the array of policies that has transformed that governance for natural resources,

property, and ecosystem services. Environmental policy is a response to the complexities of the

contemporary economy, and its technical and social challenges strain long-accepted notions of

democratic representation and rationality. These challenges, in turn, raise far-reaching issues in so-

cieties in which responsible action by individuals and organized collectivities lies at the center of

the civil order.

Format: seminar.

Individuals or groups of students may undertake a study of a particular environmental problem. The
project may involve either pure or applied research, policy analysis, laboratory or field studies, or
may be a creative writing or photography project dealing with the environment. A variety of nearby
sites are available for the study of natural systems. Ongoing projects in the College-owned Hopkins
Forest include ecological studies, animal behavior, and acid rain effects on soils, plants, and ani-
mals. Students may also choose to work on local, national, or international policy or planning is-
sues, and opportunities to work with town and regional planning officials are available. Projects are
unrestricted as to disciplinary focus. Students should consult with faculty well before the start of the
semester in which they plan to carry out their project.
Prerequisite: approval by the director of the Center.

ENVI 402(F) The Environment, the Individual, and Society

It is generally recognized that our contemporary society is the product of cultural evolution over

historical time. This course will explore through readings and class discussion the relationships

among the individual, society, and the natural environment. Questions about past, present, and pos-

sible future value systems as they influence individual and social interactions with the natural envi-

ronment will be raised. Students will be asked to become explicitly aware of their own values and

will have an opportunity to justify them in a major synthesis paper.

Format: seminar. The principal means of evaluation will be class participation and a major paper.

Prerequisite: Environmental Studies 302. No enrollment limit (expected: 16).

                    FIRST-YEAR RESIDENTIAL SEMINAR

   The First-Year Residential Seminar is part of a program designed to help students explore new
ways of integrating their social and intellectual lives. Students who elect this seminar live together
in the same residential unit. They take the seminar together during the fall semester, and enrollment
in the seminar is restricted to students in the program. The seminar explores topics and issues that
can be expected to promote lively discussions both in and out of class. It may be team-taught and
may contain interdisciplinary subject matter.

   All entering first-year students have the opportunity to express interest in participating in this
program; if more students are interested than there are spaces available (usually 18-24), selection is
done randomly. Participants must commit themselves to taking FRS 101 or 102.

FRS 101(F) "Literary" Reading+~
What determines a text's "meaning"? What makes a text "literary"? Is it something fundamental to
the text itself? Is it the circumstances in which we encounter it? Or is it the preoccupations and inter-
ests we ourselves bring to it--in other words, the way we read it? This course will focus on key skills

                        ­ 185 ­
First-Year Residential Seminars, Geosciences

and issues involved in critical reading of literary texts. It will be organized around a series of such

fundamental questions as: What characterizes "interpretation"? What do literary texts expect of us?

What pleasures and parameters are established by the way(s) we read? Where does meaning come

from: author, reader, text? How does the form or genre of a work influence our interpretation of it?

How is our understanding of a text shaped by the contexts in which we encounter it, or by the literary

traditions in which it was written? We will address these questions by reading and interpreting liter-

ary texts (mainly short fiction and poetry) and pertinent critical and theoretical essays. Our read-

ings, and our written work, will invite increased self-consciousness about literary form, the func-

tions of criticism, and the process of reading and interpreting. The course is intended both to devel-

op students' skills in reading, writing about, and discussing literary texts, and to complicate their

understanding of the potential pleasures and profits of critical interpretation.

Requirements: four formal papers ranging from 3-7 pages, several short informal writing assign-

ments, group presentations, and active participation in discussion.

No prerequisite. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Enrollment limited to FRS students.

FRS 102(F) The Mao Cult*

The Great Helmsman of the People's Republic of China, Chairman Mao Zedong, is one of the most

controversial figures in history. Did he save China or almost destroy it? Should he be revered as a

hero or defiled as a demon? In China of the 1990s, an entire cult has sprung up around Mao Ze-

dong--perhaps not as all-encompassing as the Mao Worship of the 1960s and early 70s, but still an

intriguing and important phenomenon. This course will look at the personal and public history of

the Chairman and the cults he continues to inspire. We will also explore personality cults in compar-

ative perspective and look at Mao Zedong's impact in other parts of the world (such as on the Shin-

ing Path guerrillas of Peru).

Evaluation will be based on class participation and three papers.

Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Enrollment limited to FRS students.

MAJOR
   The Geosciences major is designed (1) to provide an understanding of the physical and biologi-

cal evolution of our planet and its interacting global systems, (2) to help us learn to live in harmony
with our environment, and (3) to appreciate our place within the vastness of earth history. Forces
within the earth are responsible for the development of mountain ranges and ocean basins. Waves,
running water, and glaciers have shaped the surface of the earth, providing the landscapes we see
today. Fossils encased in sedimentary rocks supply evidence for the evolution of life and help to re-
cord the history of the earth.

   Students who graduate with a major in Geosciences from Williams can enter several different
fields of geoscience or can use their background in other careers. Students who have continued in
the geosciences are involved today, especially after graduate training, in environmental fields rang-
ing from hydrology to earthquake prediction, in the petroleum and mining industries, federal and
state geological surveys, geological consulting firms, and teaching and research in universities, col-
leges, and secondary schools. Graduates who have entered business or law have also found many
applications for their geoscience background. Other graduates now in fields as diverse as art and
medicine pursue their interest in the out-of-doors with a deeper appreciation for the natural world
around them.

   The Geosciences major sequence includes, after any 100-level course, five designated advanced
courses, two elective courses, and either Geosciences 212 (Invertebrate Paleobiology) or Geosci-
ences 303 (Igneous and Metamorphic Petrology).

   Elective courses may be clustered to provide concentrations in selected fields. Suggested group-
ings are listed below as guidelines for course selections, but other groups are possible according to
the interests of the students. Departmental advisors are given for the different fields of Geosciences.

   I Environmental Geoscience. For students interested in surface processes and the application
of geology to environmental problems such as land use planning, resource planning, environmental
impact analysis, and environmental law. Such students should also consider enrolling in the coordi-
nate program of the Center for Environmental Studies.

   104 Oceanography and/or
   206 Geological Sources of Energy or
   208 Water and the Environment
   214 Remote Sensing and Geographic Information Systems
   (Students interested in Environmental Geosciences should consult with Professor Dethier.)

   II Oceanography, Stratigraphy and Sedimentation. For students interested in the study of modern
and ancient sedimentary environments and the marine organisms that inhabited them.

   101 Biodiversity in Geologic Time
   104 Oceanography
   206 Geological Sources of Energy
   212 Invertebrate Paleobiology
   (Students interested in Oceanography, Stratigraphy, and Sedimentation should consult with Professors
   M. Johnson or Cox.)

   III The Solid Earth. For students interested in plate tectonics, the processes active within the
earth, the origin and deformation of rocks and minerals, and mineral exploration.

   102 An Unfinished Planet
   105 Geology Outdoors
   303 Igneous and Metamorphic Petrology
   (Students interested in The Solid Earth should consult with Professors Wobus or Karabinos.)

   With the consent of the department, certain courses at the 200 level or higher in Biology, Chemis-
try, Mathematics, or Physics may be substituted for elective courses in the major. Credit may be
granted in the Geosciences major for American Maritime Studies 211/Geosciences 210 (Oceano-
graphic Processes) or American Maritime Studies 311/Biology 231 (Marine Ecology) taken at
Mystic Seaport.

   Students considering graduate work in geosciences should also take courses in the allied sciences
and mathematics in addition to the requirements of the Geosciences major. The selection of outside
courses will depend on the field in which a student intends to specialize. Most geoscience graduate
schools require a year of Chemistry and Mathematics through 105. For those going into Environ-
mental Geoscience, courses in computer science or statistics are recommended. For those consider-
ing Oceanography, Stratigraphy, and Sedimentation, Biology 102 and Biology 203 are suggested.
For students entering Solid-Earth fields, Physics 131 and 132 are recommended.

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN GEOSCIENCES
   In order to be recommended for the degree with honors, a student is expected to have completed

at least two semesters and a winter study project (031) of independent research culminating in a
thesis which demonstrates outstanding achievement of an original and innovative nature. The prin-
cipal considerations in admitting a student to a program of independent research are mastery of fun-
damental material and skills, ability to pursue independent study successfully, and demonstrated
student interest and motivation.

   Further advice on the major can be obtained from the department chair.

GEOS 101(F) Biodiversity in Geologic Time (Same as Environmental Studies 105)
Is planet Earth now undergoing the most severe mass extinction of species ever to have occurred
during its 4.5-billion-year history? By some calculations, the expanding population of a single spe-
cies is responsible for the demise of 74 species per day. This provocative question is addressed by
way of the rock and fossil record as it relates to changes in biodiversity through deep geologic time
before the appearance of Homo sapiens only 250,000 years ago. Long before human interaction,
nature conducted its own experiments on the complex relationship between evolving life and
changes in the physical world. This course examines ways in which wandering continents, shifting
ocean basins, the rise and fall of mountains, the wax and wane of ice sheets, fluctuating sea level,

Geosciences

and even crashing asteroids all shaped major changes in global biodiversity. Particular attention is

drawn to the half dozen most extensive mass extinctions and what factors may have triggered them.

Equal consideration is given to how the development of new ecosystems forever altered the physi-

cal world. How and when did the earliest microbes oxygenate the atmosphere? Do the earliest mul-

ticellular animals from the late Precambrian portray an architectural experiment doomed to failure?

What factors contributed to the explosive rise in biodiversity at the start of the Cambrian Period?

What explanation is there for the sudden appearance of vertebrates? How and when did plants colo-

nize the land? What caused the demise of the dinosaurs? Is the present dominance of mammals an

accident of nature? The answers to these and other questions are elusive, but our wise stewardship

of the planet and its present biodiversity may depend on our understanding of the past. Concepts of

plate tectonics and island biogeography are applied to many aspects of the puzzle.

Format: lectures, three hours per week; one two-hour laboratory per week (some involving field

work); plus one all-day field trip to the Helderberg Plateau and Catskill Mountains of New York,

and a half-day trip to the Geology Museum at Amherst College. Evaluation will be based on weekly

quizzes and lab work, a midterm exam, and a final exam.

Enrollment limit: 35 (expected:20).

Hour: 10:00-10:50 MWF        Labs: 1-3 M, T                                         M. JOHNSON

GEOS 102(S) An Unfinished Planet

The Earth is a work-in-progress, an evolving planet whose vital signs--as expressed by earth-

quakes, volcanic eruptions, and shifting plates--are still strong. In a geological time frame, nothing

on earth is permanent: ocean basins open and close, mountains rise and fall, continental masses ac-

crete and separate. There is a message here for all who live, for an infinitesimally brief time, on the

moving surface of the globe. This course uses the plate tectonics model--one of the fundamental

scientific accomplishments of this century--to interpret the processes and products of a changing

Earth. The emphasis will be on mountain systems (on land and beneath the oceans) as expressions

of plate interactions. Specific topics include the rocks and structures of modern and ancient moun-

tain belts, the patterns of global seismicity and volcanism, the nature of the Earth's interior, the

changing configurations of continents and ocean basins through time, and, in some detail, the

formation of the Appalachian Mountain system and the geological assembly of New England.

Readings will be from a physical geology textbook and primary source supplement, selected writ-

ings of John McPhee, and references about the geology of the Northeast.

Format: lectures, three hours a week; labs (several involving field work), two hours a week; one

required all-day field trip during the last week of the semester to the Connecticut Valley, and the

highlands of western Massachusetts. Evaluation will be based on two hour-tests, weekly lab work,

and a scheduled final exam.

GEOS 103(F) Environmental Geology and the Earth's Surface (Same as Environmental

Studies 103)

Limitations imposed by the physical environment have become increasingly important as popula-

tion expands. Geologic materials such as soil, sediment, and bedrock, and geologic processes in-

volving earthquakes, volcanic activity, and running water often pose constraints on land use. This

course examines the nature of geologic materials, the physical processes that continuously change

the surface of the earth, and how these processes affect human activity. Topics include volcanic and

earthquake hazards, surface-water erosion and flooding, landslides, groundwater, solid waste dis-

posal, resource issues, global climate change, and the importance of geologic information to land-

use planning. Laboratories emphasize field and classroom studies of surface processes and discus-

sion of their application to planning.

Format: lectures/discussions, three hours per week; one two-hour laboratory a week; local field

trips. Evaluation will be based on two hour exams, weekly labs, and a final exam.

GEOS 104(S) Oceanography (Same as Environmental Studies 104)
This course will present an integrated introduction to the oceans. Topics covered will include
formation and history of the ocean basins; ocean chemistry; oceans through time; currents, tides,
and waves; oceans and climate; coastal processes and ecology; productivity in the oceans; and re-
sources and pollution. Coastal oceanography will be investigated on an all-day field trip to the New
England coast.

GEOS 105(F) Geology Outdoors+

An introduction to geology through student field projects. The mountains, lakes, rivers, and valleys

of the Williamstown area provide unusual opportunities for learning geology in the field. Student

projects will include the study of streams as active agents of erosion and deposition, the effects of

glaciation on the New England landscape, and the history of mountain building in the Appala-

chians. Following several group projects introducing the techniques of field geology, students will

pursue independent projects on subjects of particular interest to them. This course departs from the

standard science course format of three lectures and a required lab each week. Instead, emphasis is

placed on learning through active participation in field projects and presentation of results through

high-quality writing. The class will meet two afternoons each week from 1:00 to 3:45 p.m. There

will be two all-day field trips.

This course is designed for students who have a serious interest in geology or other natural and envi-

ronmental sciences, the outdoors, and writing.

Format: discussion/laboratory. Evaluation will be based on participation in field work and discus-

sions, five papers based on field projects, and an oral presentation of independent project results.

Open only to first-year students; Enrollment limit:12 (expected 12). No previous knowledge of

geology is required.

Hour: 1:00-4:00 TF                                                            KARABINOS

GEOS 201(F) Geomorphology (Same as Environmental Studies 205)

This course is designed for geosciences majors and for environmental studies students interested in

surficial geologic processes and their importance in shaping the physical environment. The course

emphasizes the nature and rates of constructional, weathering, and erosional processes and the in-

fluence of climatic, tectonic, and volcanic forces on landform evolution. Labs focus on field mea-

surements of hydrologic and geomorphic processes in the Williamstown area as well as on the anal-

ysis of topographic maps and stereo air photos.

Format: lectures/discussions, three hours a week; laboratory, three hours a week; student projects;

weekend field trip to the White Mountains. Evaluation will be based on two hour exams, a project,

and lab work.

GEOS 202(S) Mineralogy and Geochemistry

This course progresses from hand-specimen morphology and crystallography through element dis-

tribution and crystal chemistry to the phase relations, compositional variation, and mineral associa-

tions within major rock-forming mineral systems.

Laboratory work includes the determination of crystal symmetry; mineral separation; the prin-

ciples and applications of optical emission spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction and x-ray fluorescence

analysis; the use of the petrographic microscope; and the identification of important minerals in

hand specimen and thin section.

Format: lectures, three hours a week; laboratory, three hours a week; independent study of minerals

in hand specimen; one afternoon field trip.

GEOS 206(S) Geological Sources of Energy (Same as Environmental Studies 206)

The severe economic effects of interruptions in oil supply highlight the dependence of most coun-

tries on low-cost supplies of energy. What sources of energy will supply the world economy in the

twenty-first century and which countries will control these supplies? This course is an introduction

to geological and related sources of energy. Topics covered include: solar energy; the availability

and environmental consequences of hydroelectric, wind, and tidal power; biomass energy; energy

from nuclear reactions; and geothermal power.

Format: lectures, three hours a week; one hour discussion section, problem sets, and field trips.

Evaluation will be based on an hour exam, an 8- to 10-page paper, class participation, and a final

exam.

GEOS 214(S) Remote Sensing and Geographic Information Systems (Same as Environmental

Studies 214)

Remote sensing involves the collection and processing of data from satellite and airborne sensors to

yield environmental information about the earth's surface and lower atmosphere. Remote sensing

enhances regional mapping of rock types and faults and analysis of vegetation cover and land-use

changes over time. A Geographic Information System (GIS) links satellite-based environmental

measurements with spatial data such as topography, transportation networks, and political bound-

aries, allowing display and quantitative analysis at the same scale using the same geographic refer-

ence. This course covers the principles and practice of remote-data capture and geographic rectifi-

cation using a Global Positioning System (GPS), as well as the concepts of Remote Sensing, includ-

ing linear and non-linear image enhancements, convolution filtering, principle components analy-

sis, and classification Principles of GIS include display and classification, spatial buffers, and log-

ical overlays. Weekly labs focus on practical applications of these techniques to data from Hopkins

Memorial Forest, the Berkshire region, and other areas of North America.

Format: lectures, three hours per week; weekly lab.

Prerequisite: at least one introductory course in Biology, Environmental Studies, or Geosciences.

Enrollment limit:16 (expected 16). Preference to sophomores and juniors.

GEOS 241(F) Test-Tube Earth

Geochemistry embraces all aspects of the study of the Earth. In this course, we will look at the

formation of our home planet, in the age before geologic time began. We will investigate the reasons

why it is chemically zoned, with a molten core, hot rocky mantle, chilled outer crust, watery ocean,

and turbulent gaseous atmosphere. We will look at specific aspects of the Earth's chemical systems,

including the chemical clocks that give us the ages of rocks; the nature of weathering, and the

formation of soils; chemical thermometers and barometers that provide information about tempera-

tures and pressures within the Earth; and isotopic data from fossils and ice that provide a record of

ocean temperatures and climate in the geologic past. We will also examine processes operating in

the earth system at the present time, including the formation and destruction of stratospheric ozone,

the origin and remediation of acid mine drainage, and other environmental issues.

Format: lectures, three hours per week. One all-day field trip. Evaluation will be based on a research

project, one hour exam, and a final exam.

GEOS 301(F) Structural Geology

The structure of the Earth's crust is constantly changing and the rocks making up the crust must

deform to accommodate these changes. Rock deformation occurs over many scales ranging from

individual mineral grains to mountain belts. This course deals with the geometric description of

structures, stress and strain analysis, deformation mechanisms in rocks, and the large-scale forces

responsible for crustal deformation. The laboratories cover geologic maps, rock structures and fab-

rics in hand samples and thin sections, and basic field techniques.

GEOS 302(S) Sedimentation+

The composition and architecture of sediments and sedimentary rocks preserve information about

the rocks that were eroded to form them, the fluids and forces that transported them, the mecha-

nisms by which they were deposited, and the process by which they were lithified. This course will

provide an introduction to the principles of sedimentology, including petrology, fluid mechanics,

bedform analysis, and facies architecture.

Format: lectures /discussion, three hours per week; one three-hour laboratory each week; one all-

day field trip. Evaluation will be based on laboratory work, one hour exam, weekly writing assign-

ments, and a final exam.

GEOS 303(F) Igneous and Metamorphic Petrology

The origin of metamorphic, plutonic, and volcanic rocks are examined in the light of field evidence

and experimental work. Rock texture and composition are used to interpret the environment of

formation of individual rock types, and important assemblages are related, where possible, to theo-

ries of global tectonics.

Laboratory work emphasizes the study of individual rock units and rock suites in hand specimens

and by petrographic and x-ray techniques.

GEOS 304T(S) Paleoecology

Ecology embraces the study of living plant and animal associations and their response to highly

varied physical conditions found in a wide variety of ecosystems. The goal of paleoecology is to

trace the evolutionary history of ancient ecosystems through geologic time. Each discipline offers a

fascinating perspective on the other. Topics of discussion include: the role of biological and physi-

cal controls in the structure of communities; interpretation of fossil assemblages; meaning of bio-

diversity through a range of local to global scales; ecological succession in recent and ancient com-

munities; and the role of mass extinctions in long-term community evolution. Ecosystems conside-

red include marine-shelf benthos, reefs, rocky shores, rain forests, grasslands, and deep-sea hydro-

thermal vents. Readings are selected from current and recent journal articles in biology and geolo-

gy. Following an initial group meeting, students will meet in pairs for tutorials. In addition, two lab

sessions and a final group meeting are required. Participants in this course are eligible (but not obli-

gated) to take part in a field trip to Baja California over Spring Break for the study of modern and

ancient rocky-shore communities. Evaluation will be based on five written essays, five oral presen-

tations, weekly participation in discussions, and participation in two scheduled lab sessions.

GEOS 401(F) Stratigraphy
Study of the composition, sequence, and correlation of layered sedimentary rocks is traditionally
applied to geologic mapping and the reconstruction of ancient environments. Through the use of
various time scales, stratigraphy is the unifier of historical geology while also at the heart of con-
ceptual debates over the uniformism or episodicity of geological processes. During the first half of
the course, emphasis will be placed on the various methods of correlation based on physical means
and the use of fossils. The second half of the course will focus on plate migrations and the relation-
ships between climate and depositional environments as a model for the broad scale interpretation
of sedimentary sequences. This part of the course will be conducted as a seminar, with students re-
sponsible for topics on the paleogeographic linkage of climate-sensitive facies and natural re-
sources. As a final project, students working individually or in pairs will present a detailed analysis
of North-American stratigraphic relationships during a specific interval of Cambrian to Cretaceous
time. In sequence, these class reports will provide highlights of the geologic history of the North-

GEOS 404T(S) Geology of the Appalachians

The Appalachians are the eroded remnants of a mountain range that once rivaled the Alps and, per-

haps, the Himalayas in elevation. They formed hundreds of millions of years ago in three distinct

collisions with other continents. The Appalachians record a rich geologic history of continental rift-

ing, formation and closing of ocean basins, continental collision, and mountain building. We will

read papers that describe the history of the Appalachians beginning with the Late Precambrian

opening of the Iapetus ocean, through the Paleozoic orogenies that formed the Appalachians, and

ending with the formation of the Atlantic. The history of the Appalachians remains controversial, in

part, because of diverse perspectives that geologists bring to their work and interpretations, such as

different specialties, guiding paradigms, and field areas. The readings are designed to illuminate the

roots of the important controversies as well as the geologic history of this well studied mountain

belt. This course will follow the tutorial format. After an initial group meeting, students will meet in

pairs for one hour each week with the instructor. Each student will orally present a written paper

every other week for criticism during the tutorial session.

Evaluation will be based on the five papers and each student's effectiveness as a critic.

Prerequisites: one upper level Geosciences course. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10).

                                  Chair, Professor GAIL M. NEWMAN

Professors: DRUXES, B. KIEFFER, G. NEWMAN. Part-time Lecturer: E. KIEFFER§.
   Teaching Associates: ARNOLD, KUNST.

LANGUAGE STUDY
   The department provides language instruction to enable the student to acquire all four linguistic

skills: understanding, speaking, reading, and writing. German 101-W-102 stresses basic communi-
cative competence and covers German grammar in full. German 103 combines a review of gram-
mar with extensive practice in reading and conversation. German 104 aims to develop facility in
speaking, writing, and reading. German 107 emphasizes accuracy and idiomatic expression in
speaking and writing. German 108 combines advanced language study with the examination of top-
ics in German-speaking cultures. Students who have studied German in secondary school should
take the placement test given during First Days in September to determine which course to take.

STUDY ABROAD
   The department strongly encourages students wanting to attain fluency in German to spend a se-

mester or year studying in Germany, Austria, or Switzerland, either independently or in one of sev-
eral approved foreign study programs. German 104 or the equivalent is the minimum requirement
for junior-year abroad programs sponsored by American institutions. Students who wish to enroll
directly in a German-speaking university should complete at least 107 or the equivalent. In any
case, all students considering study-abroad are advised to discuss their language preparation with a
member of the department.

LITERATURE IN TRANSLATION
   The department regularly offers courses on German literature in translation for students who

have little or no knowledge of German, but who wish to become acquainted with the major achieve-
ments in German literary and intellectual history.

ADVANCED STUDIES
   The department offers a variety of advanced courses for students who wish to investigate Ger-

man literature, thought, and culture in the original. German 108 is given each year and is recom-
mended as preparation for upper-level courses.

THE CERTIFICATE IN GERMAN
   To enhance a student's educational and professional profiles, the department offers the Certifi-

cate in German. It requires seven courses--two fewer than the major--and is especially appropriate
for students who begin study of the language at Williams.

   Students who enter Williams with previous training in German may substitute more advanced
courses for the 100-level courses; they can also be exempted from up to two of the required courses.

   Students must receive a minimum grade of B in each course taken in the sequence. In addition,
they must score of at least 650 (out of a possible 800) on the ETS (Educational Testing Service)
Proficiency Test.

   Appropriate elective courses can usually be found among the offerings of German, Art History,
History, Music, Philosophy, Political Science, and Theatre.

Required Courses
   German 101
   German 102
   German 103
   German 104
   German 107

Electives
  zat least one course (in German or English) on German cultural history (literature, art, drama, music)
  zat least one course (in German or English) on German intellectual, political, or social history

MAJORS
   The department supports two distinct majors: German Studies and German Literature.

German Studies
   German Studies offers students an interdisciplinary approach to German intellectual and cultural

history by combining courses in German language and literature with courses in History, Philoso-
phy, Music, and other appropriate fields.

   The German Studies major consists of ten courses. Students selecting the major must normally
complete German 104 or the equivalent no later than the end of the sophomore year.

Required Courses
   German 103
   German 104
   German 107
   German 108

   Two of the four sequence courses 201, 202, 203, and 204

   Four other courses drawn from German offerings above 108 and offerings in other departments
chosen in consultation with the chair of the German Department. The electives must include
courses from at least two departments other than German.

Examples of appropriate courses in other departments are:
   ArtH 267 Art in Germany: 1960 to the Present
   Comparative Literature 203 European Modernism: Modernity and Its Discontents
   History 238 Germany in the Twentieth Century
   Music 120 Beethoven
   Philosophy 201 Continental Philosophy: From Hegel to Poststructuralism
   German Studies majors may receive major credit for as many as four courses taken during study

abroad.

   Majors with advanced interests are encouraged to propose independent-study courses (GERM
497 or GERM 498).

German Literature
   The German Literature major consists of nine courses. Students selecting this major should usu-

ally have completed German 104 or the equivalent by the end of the sophomore year.

Required Courses
   German 108

   Two of the four sequence courses 201, 202, 203, and 204

Electives
   Six other courses. At least four must focus on topics in German literary history. Two may be ei-

ther language courses above 103 or relevant courses offered in other departments such as Compara-
tive Literature and Philosophy.

   German Literature majors may receive major credit for up to four courses taken during study
abroad.

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN GERMAN

   Students earn honors by completing a senior thesis (German 493-W031-494) of honors quality.
   Students interested in honors should consult with the department chair no later than April 15 of
their junior year. The usual qualifications for pursuing honors are: (1) an overall GPA of 3.33 or
better, (2) a departmental GPA of 3.67 or better, (3) a strong interest in a specific topic for which an
appropriate faculty advisor will be available in the senior year.

GERM 108(S) Topics in German Language and Culture: Vienna

Once the center of a vast empire, Austria has tended to be overlooked since the demise of that em-

pire. In fact, though, its trajectory can usefully serve as a guide to the complex developments in

Europe before, during, and after the Second World War. Contemporary Austria is indeed a laborato-

ry of post-Cold War Europe: Its population is remarkably multicultural, in spite of resistances; its

language is rich and dynamic, yet increasingly dominated by its more powerful neighbor to the

north; its political attitudes encompass extreme nationalism, pan-Europeanism, and much in be-

tween. Austria's capital, Vienna, will form the lens through which we examine the origins and

quirks of this fascinating, sometimes paradoxical, culture. The course will employ a variety of writ-

ten, video, audio and cyber-materials to explore some of the issues facing contemporary Austria,

and to continue the development of advanced reading, writing, and speaking skills begun in Ger-

man 107. Conducted in German.

Requirements: active class participation, several 1-2 page writing assignments, final project.

Prerequisite: German 107 or the equivalent. Expected enrollment: 8.

institutions like the department store and the cinema (Hessel, Benjamin), expressionist poetry

(Trakl, Lasker-Schüler), generational conflict via Kafka's alienated sons, Jews in Germany (Klem-

perer), the patriotic fervor of World War One and its aftermath (Toller, Jünger), Dadaism (Schwit-

ters), the Weimar Republic, inflation and the big crash (Fallada), Nazi ideology and propaganda

tactics (Riefenstahl, Speer). Wherever possible, we will read journalism, diary entries or letters that

give us insight into daily life during this highly fractured period of tumultuous political and social

changes. Readings in German.

GENERAL STATEMENT OF GOALS
   Although the History Department aspires to pursue a variety of goals, our core objectives remain

the cultivation in our students of a critical understanding and awareness of the past and the develop-

                              ­ 195 ­
History

ment of our students' intellectual, analytical, and rhetorical abilities. In pursuit of the first objective,
through its curricular offerings the department seeks both to expose students to the richness, diver-
sity, and complexities of human history over long periods of time and in different geographic re-
gions and to provide students with the opportunity to explore aspects of the past in depth. At the
same time, the department endeavors to develop students' ability to think historically and to foster
in them an appreciation of the contested nature and the value of historical knowledge by confront-
ing them with the variety of ways in which historians have approached and interpreted the past,
engaging them in issues that provoke historical debate, and familiarizing them with the nature and
uses of historical evidence. By engaging students in the critical study of the past, finally, the depart-
ment seeks to develop their ability to formulate historically informed opinions and their analytical
and rhetorical skills generally. While members of the department attempt to accomplish these mul-
tiple objectives individually through their particular courses and their other contacts with students,
the department seeks to do so collectively through the structure of the History curriculum and the
requirements of the History major.

COURSE NUMBERS
   The course numbering system used by the History Department reflects the different types and

objectives of courses offered at each level. The different course levels are distinguished less by de-
gree of difficulty than by the purposes that the courses at each level are intended to serve and the
background knowledge they presume.

First-Year Seminars (102-199): These writing-intensive seminars introduce students to the rich-
ness of historical approaches to the past and to the contested subjects on which historians focus.
They emphasize the acquisition of skills needed in the advanced study of history and are ideal for
students contemplating a major in History. Each seminar is limited in enrollment to nineteen stu-
dents. For these reasons, preference will be given to first-year students and then to sophomores.
Because first-year seminars serve as an introduction to the study of history, only one may count
towards the History major; it can also be used to meet the department's group and concentration
requirements.

Introductory Survey Courses (202-299): These courses are open to all students and are intended to
provide a basic understanding of the history of peoples, countries, and geographic regions over rel-
atively long time-spans. Most of all, they will provide students with the background necessary for
more advanced study in history at the 300 and 400 level. They are offered in either small or large
formats, depending on the individual course.

Junior Seminars (301): Junior seminars offer a series of "reflections on history," are required for the
degree in History, and are normally restricted to junior History majors. Each seminar focuses in
depth on questions of methodology, historiography, and/or epistemology and is intended to
introduce students to various ways of thinking about and "doing" history, both in the present and in
the past. Each year several junior seminars will be offered; prospective majors must select two ju-
nior seminars at the end of their sophomore year and will then be assigned to one of their two
choices. If students are studying away from Williams during their junior year, they must enroll in a
junior seminar during their senior year.

Advanced Electives (302-399): These advanced, topical courses are more specialized in focus than are the
introductory survey courses (202-299) and are intended to follow such courses. Enrollment is often limi-
ted. Because these courses may presume some background knowledge, the instructor may recommend
that students enroll in an appropriate introductory course before registering for an advanced elective.

Advanced Seminars (402-479): These are advanced courses normally limited in enrollment to fif-
teen students. Each seminar will investigate a topic in depth and will require students to engage in
research that leads to a substantial piece of historical writing. All History majors are required to
complete either an advanced seminar (402-479) or a tutorial (480-492). Instructors may recom-
mend prior coursework in the area of the seminar. Priority will be given to senior History majors,
followed by junior History majors.

Tutorials (480-492): These are advanced reading and writing courses that offer an in-depth analysis
of a topic in tutorial format. Tutorials are limited in enrollment to ten students and priority will be
given to senior History majors. All History majors are required to complete either an advanced
seminar (402-479) or a tutorial (480-492). Instructors may recommend prior coursework in the area
of the tutorial. The writing of five or six essays and the oral presentation of five or six critiques of
another student's essays are central to tutorials.

Within each of these levels, courses are further divided by geographical area:

Africa and the Middle East  102-111 202-211 302-311 402-411

Asia 112-121 212-221 312-321 412-421

Transnational/Comparative   192-199 292-299 392-396 472-479

ADVISING

   Both majors and non-majors are encouraged to talk at any time with Professor Wagner, the de-
partment chair, Mrs. Swift, the department administrative assistant, or any other member of the de-
partment about the History major.

   All majors will be assigned a faculty advisor. All majors must meet with their advisor, or the de-
partment chair, during the first week of classes during the fall semester and at the time of the spring
semester registration period in order to have their courses and plans for the History major approved.
Students who are interested in the senior honors program or graduate school should contact Profes-
sor Wong. Prospective study abroad students should contact Mrs. Swift.

ADVANCED PLACEMENT

   Beginning with the class of 2002, students will be granted one semester course credit toward the
course requirement in the History major if they receive a score of 4 or 5 on one or more of the Ad-
vanced Placement examinations in history. Even if two or more Advanced Placement examinations
are taken, and the student receives a 4 or 5 on more than one of them, only one semester course credit
will be applied toward the course requirement in the History major. Moreover, such credit may not
be used to satisfy the group requirements or concentration requirements.

THE MAJOR
   The major consists of at least nine semester courses as follows:

Required Courses in the Major

   One Junior Seminar (History 301)
   At least one Advanced Seminar (History 402-479) or Tutorial (History 480-492)
Elective Courses

   Seven (or more) additional semester courses in History, at least one of these to be chosen from
each of the following three groups:

Group A: History of the United States

Group B: European History (including Russian History)

   Group C: History of Asia, Africa and the Middle East, and/or Latin-American and the Carib-
bean

   In addition, students must take at least one course dealing with the premodern period (designated
Group D in the catalog); this may be one of the courses used to fulfill the group requirement (Groups
A-C).

   A single course can meet the requirement for no more than one of Groups A through C. Only one
First-year seminar (102-199) may be used to meet the group requirements.

Concentration in the Major

   All students are required to adopt a concentration within the History major. The concentration
should be selected in consultation with a faculty advisor at spring registration during the sophomore
year. A list of concentrations is appended below and a list of the courses that fall within each con-
centration is available from the History Department office and can also be found on the depart-
ment's website. Students must choose to concentrate in one of these eighteen broad areas unless
they petition the department's Curriculum Committee to substitute a concentration of their own de-
sign. A concentration will consist of at least three courses linked by common themes, geography, or
time period; only one of those courses can be a 100-level seminar while at least one must be a 300-
or 400-level course. Courses in the concentration may be used to fulfill the group requirements. In
selecting courses to meet their concentration requirement, students should be aware that not every
course is offered every year. Courses taken abroad may be included in the concentration with the
approval of the chair.

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN HISTORY
   The History Department offers a thesis route to the degree with honors in History. This involves a

ten-course major as well as an independent WSP. Students wishing to undertake independent re-
search or considering graduate study are encouraged to participate in the thesis program and honors
seminar.

   Application to enter the honors program should be made by spring registration in the junior year
and should be based on a solid record of work of honors caliber, normally defined as maintaining at
least a B+ average in courses taken for the major. Students who intend to write an honors thesis must
submit a proposal to the History Department at this time. Students who will be away during the
spring semester of their junior year should make arrangements to apply before leaving. Normally, it
is the responsibility of the individual student to procure the agreement of a member of the depart-
ment to act as his or her thesis advisor, and the student must therefore consult with a member of the
department about a thesis topic and a possible thesis advisor prior to submitting a proposal to the
department. A student who is uncertain of which member of the department might be an appropriate
advisor, or who otherwise is unable to find an advisor, should contact the chair of the honors com-
mittee. An honors thesis proposal must be signed by a member of the History Department. Normal-
ly, the thesis topic should be related to course work which the student has previously done. Students
should be aware, however, that while the department will try to accommodate all students who qual-
ify to pursue honors, particular topics may be deemed unfeasible and students may have to revise
their topics accordingly. Final admission to the honors thesis program will depend on the depart-
ment's assessment of the qualifications of the student and the feasibility of the project.

   Once the student has been notified of admission to the honors thesis program, he or she should
register for History 493, Senior Honors Thesis Research Seminar, in the fall semester, for History
031 during winter study, and for History 494, Senior Honors Thesis Writing Seminar, in the spring.
In addition to doing the research for and writing a thesis of approximately 75-100 pages, students
will attend special presentations under the History Department's Class of 1960 Scholars Program.

   During the fall, students should work regularly on their research and consult frequently with their
advisors. Throughout the semester, honors candidates will also present written progress reports for
group discussion to the seminar (History 493). Performance in the seminar will be evaluated on the
basis of class participation and completed written work and will determine if a student will continue
in the thesis program. For students proceeding to History 031 and History 494, performance in the
fall semester will figure into the thesis grade calculated at the end of the year.

   Students who are deemed to be making satisfactory progress on their research and writing at this
point will be allowed to continue with the thesis. They will devote the entire winter study period to
thesis work. They should conclude their research during winter study and complete at least one
chapter of their thesis for submission to their advisor before the end of winter study. At the end of
winter study, the honors committee will formally consult with advisors and make recommendations
to the department concerning which students should be allowed to proceed with the thesis. During
the early weeks of the second semester, students will present a draft chapter of their thesis to the
honors seminar.

   Completed theses will be due in mid-April, after which each student will prepare and present a
short oral presentation of his or her thesis for delivery at the departmental Honors Colloquium.

Another student who has read the thesis will then offer a critique of it, after which the two faculty
readers of the thesis will offer their own comments and questions. Finally, there will be a general
discussion of the thesis by students and other members of the department.

LANGUAGE

   Study of a foreign language is basic to the understanding of other cultures. Particularly those stu-
dents who might wish to do graduate work in History are encouraged to enroll in language courses
at Williams.

COURSES

FIRST-YEAR SEMINARS (102-199)
   These writing-intensive seminars introduce students to the richness of historical approaches to

the past and to the contested subjects on which historians focus. They emphasize the acquisition of
skills needed in the advanced study of history and are ideal for students contemplating a major in
History. Each seminar is limited in enrollment to nineteen students. For these reasons, preference
will be given to first-year students and then to sophomores. Because first-year seminars serve as an
introduction to the study of history, only one may count towards the History major; it can also be
used to meet the department's group and concentration requirements.

HIST 127(F) (formerly 105) The Expansion of Europe

This course investigates the expansion of European power and influence over much of the rest of

the world from the late Middle Ages to the mid-nineteenth century--the early period of European

Imperialism. Specific topics will vary, but include the development and initial expansion of medi-

eval and Renaissance Europe, the discovery and conquest of the New World, the struggle with Is-

lam for command of the seas, the establishment of European influence in the East and Far East, the

slave trade, the invasion of North America, and the initial steps toward hegemony in the Middle

East and Africa. Students will investigate the ways in which individual personality, religiosity,

greed, critical first contacts, and cultural misunderstandings and prejudices combined with impor-

tant aspects of the Military, Scientific, and early Industrial Revolutions to establish European hege-

mony on a world-wide scale during this early period of European Imperialism.

Format: discussion. Evaluation will be based on five short written exercises and one research paper.

Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference to first-year students.

HIST 140(S) Fin-de Siecle Russia: Cultural Splendor, Imperial Decay+
Imperial Russia on the eve of the First World War presents a complex picture of political conflict,
social and economic change, and cultural ferment and innovation. Newly emergent liberal and so-
cialist political parties sought to enlist mass support to transform or overthrow the tsarist regime,
which in turn endeavored to preserve itself through reform, repression, and the refashioning of its
image. Rapid urbanization and industrialization, and the spread of education and literacy, gave rise
to social conflict and dislocation, demands for social reform, and the redefinition of individual
identities and beliefs. These political, social, cultural, and economic developments provided a fer-
tile context for the burst of literary creativity and the emergence of modernist literary and artistic

                       ­ 199 ­

movements that occurred in fin-de-siecle Russia. Intended for first and second-year students, this

course seeks to familiarize students with the ways historians study and attempt to understand the

past through an exploration of the interrelationships between political conflict, social and economic

change, and literary and artistic creativity in imperial Russia between the 1880s and the October

Revolution of 1917.

HIST 157(S) The Great Depression: Culture, Society, and Politics in the 1930s

The economic collapse and devastation of the 1930s known as the "Great Depression" set social,

cultural, and political changes in motion that transformed the character of American life, with con-

sequences that reverberate in our own time. This course focuses on the ways contemporaries en-

countered and participated in those changes, as well as on the ways that historians interpret the

Great Depression. Through the use of a variety of sources--memoirs, government documents,

films, music, oral histories, letters, fiction, photography--we will explore the breadth of responses

to the Depression, shaped as they were by region, class, race, ethnicity, and gender.

Format: discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, three short essays, and a final

paper based on primary research.

HIST 164(S) (formerly 104) Slavery in the American South*

No area of American social history has been more active and exciting in recent years than the study

of slavery. This seminar will introduce students to the most important aspects of the South's slave

system. We will begin by reading a number of key books in the field, and then we will turn to the

College library's extensive holdings of microfilm records dealing with both agricultural and indus-

trial slavery. In consultation with the instructor, each student will select the records of a slave-

manned plantation or industrial site for careful and detailed study. The most important piece of

work in the seminar will be a research paper that each student will prepare using the manuscript

source materials.

Evaluation will be based on class attendance and participation, several short preliminary essays,

and the final research paper.

Enrollment limited. Preference to first-year students.

HIST 166(S) Inventing American Culture

When European settlers committed themselves to staying in North America, they gradually created
a culture that came to be called "American." A hybrid of deliberately revived European archaisms,
selective transfers of contemporary culture, and conscious and inadvertent innovations, this culture
encompassed political organization, economic practices, family life, and religious expression. His-
torians have long debated whether this gumbo brought about an inevitable movement for American
national independence, how the different aspects of social life influenced each other, and whether
the very self-conscious "Americanism" of the era of the early republic was itself innovative and
liberating or ultimately profoundly conservative of racial and gender privilege.
We shall enter these debates by discussing such topics as the invention of a (limited) democratic
polity, the escape of religion from state control, the construction of a new national self-identity in
politics and the arts, and the renovation of ideologies of gender and race as the "era of the common
man" came to fruition. We will also investigate the process by which English culture came to domi-
nate the culture called "American." Students will read primary documents and selections from his-
torians' arguments and choose one aspect of American cultural nationalism on which to focus for a
final essay. The purpose of this course is to introduce students to a multi-factored investigation of
culture, to the kinds of resources that historians use, and to the standard practices of writing an ana-

Since the only way to learn to write effectively, with an efficient use of time, is to practice (and prac-

tice and practice), there will be short written exercises (interpretive essays or reports on research

processes--due once a week (which will count for 30% of the term grade). Students will be ex-

pected to contribute substantially to class discussion (30% of final grade) with an attitude of helping

each other learn. The final interpretive essay (40% of final grade) will be broken down into stages to

give students training in designing a research project, organizing appropriate source materials,

constructing a logical argument, and polishing a persuasive piece of writing.

HIST 203(F) Sub-Saharan Africa Since 1800*

This survey of sub-Saharan African history takes up the continuing saga of African political, social

and economic developments from the aftermath of the trans-Atlantic slave trade to the present. It is

divided into three sections. The first section of the course focuses on the consequences of the slave

trade on African societies and on the Africans' interaction with European merchants, explorers, and

missionaries in the decades preceding colonial conquest. The human consequences of the trade lin-

gered long after the abolition of the slave trade across the Atlantic ocean. Many African societies

were strengthened, often at the expense of their neighbors; other societies were weakened, thus set-

ting the stage for colonial conquest. During the second half of the nineteenth century, however,

competition among Europeans for control of raw materials for their nascent industries led to coloni-

zation, and in some cases, to white settlement in Africa.

The second section of the course investigates the process of colonial conquest and the dynamics of

colonial rule in Africa. It looks especially at the ways in which colonialism affected various groups

of Africans, and at the ways, both subtle and overt, in which Africans resisted or collaborated with

colonial rule in order to achieve their goals. The colonial period, brief in time, yet profoundly signif-

icant in its impact, was ushered out partly by the rising tide of African nationalism.

The last section of the course, then, examines the rise of new nation-states, their colonial legacies,

post-colonial economies, and systems of justice, education, and governance.

Format: discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, one exam, and two papers.

No enrollment limit (expected: 30). Open to all.

its subsequent evolution to the contemporary political and economic phenomenon we know today.

Tracing premodern legacies that have helped shape China, the course covers the decline and fall of

the Qing dynasty through the creation of Communist China and the unfolding of the post-Mao era.

The class uses primary and secondary sources (including literature and films) to examine the ori-

gins and impact of major social and ideological trends such as foreign imperialism, nationalism,

racism/culturalism, feminism, communism, Maoism, and capitalism in China. The course consid-

ers the relationship between political thought and practice and how these "-isms" affected the daily

HIST 223(S) (formerly 218) Roman History (Same as Classics 223)
The study of Roman history involves questions central to the development of Western institutions,
religion, and modes of thought. Scholars have looked to Rome both for actual antecedents of Euro-
pean cultural development and for paradigmatic scenes illustrating what they felt were cultural uni-
versals. Yet Roman history also encompasses the most far-reaching experience of diverse cultures,
beliefs, and practices known in the Western tradition until perhaps contemporary times. A close
analysis of Roman history on its own terms shows the complex and fascinating results of an ambi-
tious, self-confident nation's encounter both with unexpected events and crises at home, and with
other peoples. As this course addresses the history of Rome from its mythologized beginnings

through the reign of the emperor Constantine, it will place special emphasis on the impressive Ro-

man ability to turn the unexpected into a rich source of cultural development, as well as the complex

tendency later to interpret such ad hoc responses as predestined and inevitable. The Romans also

provide a vivid portrait of the relationship between power and self-confidence on the one hand, and

violence and ultimate disregard for dissent and difference on the other. Readings for this course will

concentrate on a wide variety of original sources, and there will be a strong emphasis on the prob-

lems of historical interpretation.

HIST 225(S) Church, State, and Society in the Middle Ages (AD 200-1500) (Same as

Religion 216)

This course explores the development of European and Mediterranean civilizations during the

thousand-year period known as the "Middle Ages." At the beginning of this period, the Romans

ruled a massive empire that stretched from Britain to north Africa and from Spain to Iraq. A millen-

nium later, this classical and pagan world had broken apart into three successor civilizations: medi-

eval Europe, the Byzantine Empire, and the Islamic world. This course investigates how this mo-

mentous transformation occurred. We will examine such topics as relations between Romans and

"barbarians," the spread of Christianity and Islam, the development of kingdoms and empires, feu-

dalism and the crusades, saints and religious reformers, art and architecture, cities and trade, the

persecution of Jews and heretics, as well as the Italian Renaissance.

ent. Beginning with an examination of the "dual revolutions" of the late eighteenth and early nine-
teenth centuries (the French and the Industrial revolutions), we will then consider Europe's "long
nineteenth century" of industrialization, nation-state building, class formation, and imperial expan-
sion up to 1914, during which time European ideas and institutions reached the height of their pow-
er and left their imprint upon the whole world. In the second half of the course, we will turn to the
history of Europe's "second Thirty Years War" in the first half of the twentieth century, and how two
devastating world wars, economic depression, and the rise of fascism transformed both European
societies and governments in themselves, while diminishing Europe's global position and leaving it
no longer the full master of its own fate. Finally, we will turn to Europe in the post-European age,
from 1945 to the present, a period marked by Cold War revisions, decolonization, deepening de-
mocracy, economic, social and cultural metamorphis, and the emergence of the European Union.
Rather than provide a comprehensive, chronological survey, the course will focus on a number of
key political and social movements, or "isms," forged in Europe during these two tumultuous cen-
turies, including liberalism, feminism, nationalism, imperialism, fascism, socialism, and commu-
nism.
Readings will include selected primary sources, contemporary historical scholarship, novels and
memoirs.

HIST 235(S) Britain Since 1848

This course will survey British history from 1848 to the present day, charting how Great Britain--

the most powerful nation and empire of the nineteenth-century world--evolved into "Little En-

gland"--a small country on the margins of Europe--in little over 100 years. The first half of the

course will investigate Victorian Britain and its remarkable political stability; some of the later

challenges mounted to the liberal parliamentary system by workers and feminists; British industrial

expansion and its profoundly transformative effects on urban life and social structure; the ideology

of "Victorianism" and its implications for gender roles and family life; and finally, the expansion of

the British Empire and its impact on domestic life. The second half of this course will chart Britain's

troubled development in the twentieth century, from "the strange death of liberal England" before

1914, to the outbreak and trauma of World War I, the anxious interwar period punctuated by the

Great Depression and Appeasement, and the experience of yet another "total war" against the Ger-

mans between 1939 and 1945. We will examine how the British struggled to invent a new post-im-

perial identity for themselves after 1945, when they confronted not only their nation's economic

decline but decolonization, the loss of their Great Power status, an increasing dependence on the

United States, and a conflicted relationship with the rest of Europe which continues to this day. The

instructor will deliver several introductory lectures, but the bulk of the course will be devoted to

class discussion of the readings, which, in addition to secondary sources, will include contempo-

rary political documents, social surveys, reportage, novels and films.

Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, several short papers and

a final exam.

HIST 240(S) (formerly 232) Muscovy and the Russian Empire

Between the fourteenth and the seventeenth centuries the princes and political elite of Muscovy

created a vast multi-national empire in Eastern Europe and Asia. Over the next 150 years their im-

perial heirs transformed and extended this empire, to the point that on the eve of the Crimean War

(1853-1855) many believed it to be the most powerful state in Europe. But defeat in the war exposed

the weakness of the imperial regime and helped to provoke a process of state-led reform that failed

to avert, and may well have contributed to, the collapse of the regime in the February Revolution of

1917. Using a combination of primary and secondary sources, this course will explore the character

of the Muscovite and the Russian empires and the forces, processes, and personalities that shaped

their formation, expansion, and, in the latter case, decline.

Format: discussion with some lectures. Evaluation will be based on class participation, a map quiz,

several short essays based on class readings, and a final self-scheduled exam.

HIST 253(S) (formerly 244) The United States From Appomattox to AOL, 1865-Present

This course will survey the history of the United States from the time the nation struggled to heal

from the wounds of fratricidal war, to the closing of the frontier, to the struggle to come to terms

with is place in the world community, and finally, to the modern period as the United States contin-

ues to wrestle with and define its global mission. Against this larger backdrop we will explore the

history of the women and men who struggled daily with the circumstances unique to their color and

class, while trying to create better lives for themselves. Reading assignments are designed to

introduce students to the study of American history--both to what historians have written, as well

as to the practice of history itself.

Progressives, this survey will examine the course of twentieth-century American politics, aiming to
understand the elaboration of liberal reform during the period, as well as conservative resistance to
and eventual triumph over it. We will focus in particular on the transformations of the Democratic

HIST 281(F) (formerly 261) African-American History Through Emancipation*

This course introduces students to the events, figures, and institutions that have shaped African-

American history. Beginning with the struggles to dominate the African coast and the emergence of

the modern slave trade, the course traces the experiences of Africans in North America through the

fall of the Western slave societies. While our goal is to see American history from the perspective of

people of African descent in the United States, we will also compare their experiences with those of

African descent in the Caribbean, South America, and other parts of North America. The final ob-

jective is to increase students' familiarity with the historiography and intellectual debates in "Afro-

Am."

Evaluation will be based on class participation, two short papers, and a final exam.

political, and economic meaning of freedom for men and women of African descent as well as ex-

plore the political nature and development of African-American historiography. The course will

give particular attention to such topics as the rise of Jim Crow, migration, urbanization, the Civil

Rights Movement, as well as the legacy of the post-Civil Rights Movement era.

HIST 286(F) Latino/a History From 1846 to the Present*

This course examines the formation of Latino/a communities in the United States from 1846 to the

present. These communities were formed through conquest, immigration, and migration. In ex-

amining the causes of migration, we will consider economic and political conditions in the coun-

tries of origin, U.S. foreign policies, and the connections between the United States and the coun-

tries of origin. We will explore the ways in which migration processes are mediated through labor

recruitment, immigration and refugee policies, and social networks. We will analyze how Latinos

and Latinas have been incorporated into the economies of the regions of the United States where

they settled. Focusing on the historical experiences of Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, Cubans, and Do-

minicans, this course will also address more recent immigration from Central and South American

countries.

JUNIOR SEMINARS (301)

   Junior Seminars offer a series of "reflections" on history, are required for the degree in History,
and are normally restricted to junior History majors. Each seminar focuses in depth on questions of
methodology, historiography, and/or epistemology and is intended to introduce students to various
ways of thinking about and "doing" history, both in the present and in the past. Each year several
junior seminars will be offered; prospective majors must select two junior seminars at the end of the
sophomore year and will then be assigned to one of their two choices. If students are studying away
from Williams during their junior year, they must enroll in a junior seminar during their senior year.

HIST 301B(F) Autobiography as History: An American Character?

Historians have long debated whether it makes sense to speak of distinctive national charac-

ters--tendencies to think and behave in particular ways that are endemic to specific nations or peo-

ples. In the United States, with its high degree of racial and ethnic diversity, such notions seem espe-

cially problematic. Through a reading of selected autobiographies supplemented by other materi-

als, we will seek to test the validity of various conceptions of "American" national character by

looking at how individuals in different eras and circumstances have attempted to understand and

interpret their own life experiences. Readings will include autobiographies by William Bradford,

Benjamin Franklin, Frederick Douglass, Mary Chestnut, Jan Addams, Martin Luther King, Mi-

chael Herr, Richard Rodriguez, Maxine Hong Kingston, and others.

Format: discussion. Evaluation will be based on a series of 3- to 5-page written assignments and a

longer essay due at the end of the semester.

HIST 301C(S) Historical Materialism: The Theory and Evolution of Marxist History

This course is intended to give each student a command of Karl Marx's theory of history. The litera-

ture includes classical materialism, communist propaganda, Marxist economics, and Marxist and

neo-Marxist histories. Central to our examination is an in-depth look at Marx's economic theory

and his political philosophy (which culminated in the dictatorship of the proletariat). Marx used

history to provide a context for his political and intellectual work, and to bridge the distance be-

tween the two; however, Marxism has been used to analyze social relations well beyond the world

and moment that its author envisioned. We will end by exploring the applicability of Marxist histor-

ical philosophy to contemporary human affairs.

Evaluation will be based on class participation, two papers and a final exam.

Restricted to junior History majors.

HIST 301E(S) Approaches to Medieval History

The purpose of this course is to explore the nature, practice, and limitations of History. We will ac-

complish this by examining how scholars have tried to understand the Middle Ages, that thousand-

year period of European history between the end of the Roman empire and the advent of the Renais-

sance. During the semester we will read both classic works of medieval history as well as recent

approaches that challenge long-standing interpretations. Overall, our objective will be not to cover

every aspect of the Middle Ages, but rather to consider the topics, evidence, methodologies, and

assumptions historians use to recreate the history of the distant past.

Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on weekly 1- to 2-page papers, two longer papers, and

class participation.

HIST 301F(F) Gender and History

Historians have increasingly recognized the importance of gender as both a lens and a subject of
historical analysis. This class explores historical methods, historiographies, and theories that place
gender at the center of historical inquiry. Through a focus on gender and history, this class examines
different ways in which that focus has both generated new areas of historical inquiry and challenged
traditional historical narratives. Topics include the intersection of feminist theories with histories of
gender, issues of place, space, and material culture, oral history and autobiographical narratives;
methodological borrowings from disciplines other than history; the analytical category of "experi-
ence," and intersections among class, sexuality, race, ethnicity and gender. We will discuss as well
topics not generally recognized as gendered, including militarism, the environment, technology,
imperialism, and nationalism.

will examine the many forms of black oppression and, also, the various forms of resistance to

Apartheid. Some of the themes we will explore include industrialization and the formation of the

black working classes, the constructions of race, ethnicities and sexualities, land alienation and ru-

ral struggles, township poverty and violence, Black education, and the Black Consciousness Move-

ment.

HIST 310(F) The Formative Period of Islam: The Creation of a Religious Tradition

This course provides an in-depth exploration of the early, formative period of Islam from the pre-Is-

lamic context of the revelation of the Qur'an through the establishment of a religious "orthodoxy",

roughly from 600-1111. This period witnessed the establishment of an Islamic empire, the forma-

tion of Islamic institutions of law, theology, conceptions of history, and political theory. It was the

crucial period when many of the divergent approaches to problems of religious and political author-

ity emerged. For this reason, this period has had a seminal impact on the subsequent religious, polit-

ical and social developments in the Islamic world, and continues to be hotly contested to this day.

Through a close reading of primary texts, we will investigate these developments, focusing on the

debates surrounding different interpretations of the texts.

HIST 315(F) The "Christian Century" of Japan (1549-1639)*

The "Christian Century," if such a conceit can be applied to a period of Japanese history distin-

guished by tumultuous events that had little to do with Christianity, may be read in various ways: as

a catechism; as a political treatise dealing with clashes between systems of authority; as a commer-

cial contract or, rather, as the script of a symbiosis that bound together the interests of Jesuit mis-

sionaries, Portuguese merchants, and Japanese magnates; as a manual of cultural misunderstand-

ings and accommodations; as a debate on values, pursued at an uneven but on the whole fairly high

intellectual level; and finally as a Jesuit drama composed by its own actors, who struggle for the

greater glory of God against demonic forces, defy tyrants, win many souls for Christ, and in the end

are crowned with the ultimate triumph of martyrdom. This course seeks to explore some of those

dimensions of Japanese and intercultural history.

HIST 316(S) Urban Culture in Early Modern Japan*

After an initial discussion of the foundations of the samurai regime of the Tokugawa era, the ideolo-

gies that it fostered, and the society that it governed, we shall examine the problems and pleasures of

life in the period's big cities, in particular the shogun's capital, Edo. Topics to be treated will include

urban space and governance; the townsmen's accommodations and clashes with authority; and

popular culture, including a look at the "notorious places," that is, the bawdy theater districts and

the ersatz salons of the prostitute quarters.

HIST 326(S) War in European History
From the ancient world to the twentieth century, war has always played an important part in Euro-
pean history. Europeans have not only constantly been at war with other Europeans, but also with
neighboring cultures and, indeed, most peoples around the globe. This course will introduce stu-
dents to the history of European warfare from its origins in the classical and medieval periods to its
maturation in the early modern period (1450-1815), and its disastrous culmination in the nationalist
struggles of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Has there been a distinctively "European Way
of War" from the beginning? How do we explain failure and success in European wars? What exact-
ly happened at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels of war? And what caused changes in the
organization and waging of European war from one period to the next?
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, one short research pa-
per, and midterm and final exams.

HIST 339(S) Reconstructing Post-War Germany

This course examines some of the immense challenges of reconstruction faced by Germany in the

aftermath of World War II and during the decades that followed. In 1945, with most European gov-

ernments in some state of collapse or disarray and with civilian populations devastated by the ef-

fects of modern warfare, dislocation, Nazi occupation and persecution, it looked by no means cer-

tain that either Germany or Europe would recover from self-inflicted wounds. In Germany, the

problems of reconstruction were initially tackled less by the Germans themselves, and more by the

Allied powers (America, Britain, France and the Soviet Union) who now occupied the country. We

will consider the Allied occupations of Germany as case studies in the rebuilding of a fractured so-

ciety and discredited political system from the ground up, both in their Western capitalist and Soviet

communist variants. The problems of reconstruction continued long past the end of the Allied oc-

cupations and the division of Germany into East and West; each of the Germanies had to face the

larger, less tangible task of reconstructing viable national identities, which could both unify and

inspire their citizens, while somehow or other accounting for the traumas and crimes of the recent

past. We will follow some of the debates and controversies that have attended this process of cultur-

al reconstruction in both Germanies since the sixties and that still reverberate today.

Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation and three papers.

HIST 354(S) (formerly 321) Gender and Community in Early America*

This course is a study of the lives of men and women in the territory that became the United States,

from the early-seventeenth century to the Civil War. Experiences of kinship, work, religion, and

sexuality will be studied in the context of culturally and geographically varied communities, which

constructed different codes of behavior and followed different paths through the complexities of

economic and political modernization. Among the topics investigated will be gender systems

among the Native Americans east of the Mississippi and the consequences of European incursions;

the difference that evangelical religion made among communities of British Americans; the com-

plex construction of community life and gender systems among African Americans; the evolution

of ideologies of masculinity when brainwork replaced physical labor as the norm for the middling

classes; the critique of a developing consensus about gender that was offered by utopian reform

groups; and Westward migration of Euro-Americans and the Civil War as episodes in the history of

gender. This course involves extensive reading and discussion of primary and secondary sources.

Evaluation will be based on a short interpretive essay (15% of grade), a midterm exam (25% of

grade) and then, either a research paper or a final exam (40% of grade), as well as on the quality of

contrabutions to class discussion (20% of grade).

HIST 357(S) The Rise of American Conservatism

In our time it may be hard to imagine the American political landscape without conservatism, and

yet like its counterpart--liberalism--conservatism is a creature of history. In the forms that we rec-

ognize today, conservatism had its origins in reactions to the New Deal and went through momen-

tous transformations in the late 1960s and 1970s. And while the Reagan presidency was indeed ex-

perienced as political "revolution," it remains unclear what legacy of conservatism the principles of

his administration established. This course will chart that trajectory, seeking to understand what

issues conservatives have embraced in different periods; what issues have created conflict among

conservative ranks; and how they have mobilized political power at different historical junctures.

Evaluation will be based on class participation, one short book review, a take-home midterm, and a

final interpretive essay, based in part on primary research.

HIST 359(F) From Cold War to New World Order
A mere three years after the end of World War II, the United States government identified that it was
in a "struggle for power, or `cold war'" with the Soviet Union--a struggle "from which we cannot
withdraw short of eventual national suicide." The Cold War developed with remarkable rapidity,
and we will focus our initial efforts in this course to understanding how and why the United States
established all the structures of the national security state by 1950, examining as well the counter-
parts to these structures in the Soviet Union. From this foundation we will then explore the myriad
ways that the Cold War shaped domestic and international politics in the succeeding decades, par-
ticularly in the Third World, and the forces that led to the Cold War's end. When the Berlin Wall

                    ­ 211 ­
History

came tumbling down in 1989, expectations ran high on both sides of the "iron curtain" that democ-

racy and a free market might well flourish in the former Eastern bloc and eventually in the Soviet

Union. But while there has been some successes on these fronts, the end of the Cold War has also

produced a profound reshuffling of international politics. This instability has forced many reassess-

ments of the Cold War era, with which we will conclude this course.

Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class participation, weekly response papers, one ana-

lytical essay, and a final exam.

HIST 361(S) Metropolis: The History of New York City

"Hitherto it had gone by the original Indian name Manna-hatta, or as some still have it, `The Man-

hattoes;' but this was now decried as savage and heathenish. At length, when the council was almost

in despair, a burgher, remarkable for the size and squareness of his head, proposed that they should

call it New-Amsterdam. The proposition took every body by surprise; it was so striking, so appo-

site, so ingenious. The name was adopted by acclamation, and New-Amsterdam the metropolis was

thenceforth called," explained Washington Irving in 1808. In less tongue-in-cheek style, this course

examines the evolution of New York City from 1607 to the present. The readings focus on the city's

social and physical histories, and the class discussions compare New York's development to pat-

terns in other cities. There is an optional tour of New York City during the semester.

Evaluation will be based on class participation and several essays.

HIST 363(S) The Pre-Civil War Slave Narrative as a Genre (Same as English 394)

This lecture and discussion course seeks to examine the genre of slave narrative from its genesis in

the 1740's to 1865. A wide variety of narratives will be read: canonical and non-canonical, English

and North American, book-length to a few pages, and narratives written by men and women. Gen-

eral issues to be explored in this course include the historical, social, legal and literary develop-

ments that shaped the slave narrative during its "century" of existence. More specifically, we will

discuss both contemporary and modern criticism of individual narratives in addition to examining

the themes found within the narratives themselves. Some of the narratives that may be included are

those of Stephen Smith, Cato, Joseph Mountain, Eleanor Eldridge, Mary Prince, Frederick Doug-

lass, Sojourner Truth, Sally Williams, William and Ellen Craft, Olaudah Equiano, Aaron, Mahom-

mah G. Baquaqua, Venture Smith, Henry Black, Mrs. Chloe Spear, William Wells Brown, Abduhl

HIST 364(F) (formerly 311) History of the Old South*

During the course of the semester, we shall investigate two broad, interrelated topics: slavery in the

antebellum South, and the impact of slavery on Southern civilization. Our approach will be primari-

ly topical. In the first half of the course, we shall look at subjects like the foreign and domestic slave

trade, patterns of work and treatment, the nature of the master-slave relationship, resistance and

rebellion, and slave cultural, social, and family life. The second half of the course will concentrate

on the influence of the institution of slavery on the mind, social structure, and economy of the Old

South, and slavery's impact on Southern politics and the decision for secession in 1860-61.

Format: primarily discussion. Requirements: a midterm, a final exam, and a paper of moderate

The politics surrounding the environment today are a super-heated source of conflict, at the same

time that most opinion polls show that Americans widely embrace many environmental protec-

tions. While environmental concerns have long been a part of local politics in America, this course

will largely explore the emergence and prominence of environmental issues in national politics,

from the first organized conservation efforts in the late-nineteenth century to the present-day con-

cerns with the global environment. Throughout the course we will investigate both how changes in

the environment have shaped American politics and how political decisions have altered the Amer-

ican--an even world-wide--environment.

Evaluation will be based on class participation, weekly critical writing, an analytical essay, and a

final exam.

HIST 372(S) (formerly 313) The Rise of American Business

An examination of the complex process that saw business enterprise move from a marginal position

in the largely agrarian society of the early colonial period to become, by the twentieth century, one

of the principal forces shaping American culture. Subjects to be considered: the business and politi-

cal activities of colonial merchants, early-American attempts at industrialization, the business ca-

reers of John D. Rockefeller and Andrew Carnegie, and the growth, since 1900, of multidivisional

corporations like DuPont and General Motors. Readings will include historical studies, biography,

autobiography, and fiction.

Format: discussion. Students will write a series of short analytical papers and will have the choice of

either writing a longer, final essay or taking a final exam.

themes including the development of sexual identities and the construction of sexual subjectivity;
the role of sexual practices and ideologies in creating and maintaining social hierarchies of class,
race, and gender; and the interplay between politics and sexuality. Topics include colonial Ameri-
can attitudes toward sexuality; Victorian sexual ideology; the shifting boundary between "normal-

HIST 380(F) (formerly 227) Comparative American Immigration History*

The United States is often described as a "nation of nations," but there has always been an underly-

ing tension between the image of American pluralism and the desire for homogeneity. This lecture/

discussion course will examine the history of immigration to the United States from three primary

regions: Europe, Asia, and Latin America, as well as the Caribbean. Special attention will be paid to

conditions in the sending countries and the historical ties of those counties to the U.S., immigrant

labor recruitment, anti-immigration sentiments in the U.S., and the development of American im-

migration policy. Readings will include immigrant memoirs, novels, and modern interpretations of

the immigration experience.

Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on two short essays (5 pages), a personal or

family immigration history (15 pages), a final exam, and class participation.

Enrollment limit:40 (expected: 30). Open to all.

how Asians have come to populate the American landscape in terms of immigration and adjustment
patterns, Asian-American identity and politics, and the Asian presence in American popular cul-
ture. Readings will include oral histories, novels, and contemporary historical and sociological

HIST 386(F) Latinas in the Global Economy: Work, Migration, and Households (Same as

Women's and Gender Studies 386)*

This course examines the impact of the global economy on Latinas from 1945 to the present. Using

the garment industry as an example of a labor intensive industry that has gone global, we will ask a

series of questions regarding the impact on Latinas in their countries of origin and in urban areas in

the United States. What impact has the global economy and economic development had on Latinas'

work and their households in their countries of origin? How have economic changes and govern-

ment policies fostered Latinas' migrations? How have Latinas been incorporated into the changing

U.S. economy? How have Latinas confronted the challenges created by a globalizing economy?

Broadly comparative, this course includes Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, and Dominican women,

as well as other Latinas.

Evaluation will be based on class participation, two short essays, and a final paper that will be pre-

sented to the class.

Considering "community" as a contested terrain, we will begin with an exploration of what we

mean by "community." Can the term encompass both the unity and the diversity within Latino/a

communities? Focusing on Puerto Ricans and Mexican-Americans, topics will include the

construction of ethnic communities, the struggle for civil rights, labor movements, and the social

movements of the late 1960s and the 1970s. In addition to the unity these efforts represented as Lati-

nos and Latinas confronted the challenges presented by the larger society, we will also address the

dynamics of race, ethnicity, class, gender, and sexuality within these communities and movements.

HIST 402(F) African Political Thought (Same as AMES 402)*
This course examines the ideas of major figures in the progressive tradition of African political
thought. This emancipatory tradition emerged in societies shaped by racial, cultural, and economic
exploitation, forcing both African men and women to address questions of identity and political
action. Most members of this tradition also considered the ways in which uneven power relations
within African communities shaped the personal and political landscapes. The Africans we will ex-
amine in this course drew on resources as varied as Pan-Africanism, Nationalism, Classical Liber-

wan and Hong Kong--areas whose importance in the modern geopolitical world is critical, but

whose individuality is too often overlooked. The course will focus on these islands' relationship

with Mainland China, as well as on their indigenous histories. Hong Kong's transformation from a

rocky outpost to a colonial haven to a Chinese municipality; Taiwan's passage from undisturbed

island to colonial pawn to reactionary haven to independent (?) nation will all be explored in this

course. We will also study the factors that led Mainland China to become so integrally involved in

these island outposts.

HIST 415(S) European Intrusions Into Asia, 1498-1641*

On 20 May 1498 a Portuguese fleet under the command of Vasco da Gama reached Calicut on the

southwest coast of India, initiating what is sometimes called the age of European expansion in Asia

and laying the foundation for Portugal's emergence as a world power. By 1572, when Luis de

Camões published his epic poem "The Lusiads," Vasco da Gama had established himself as one of

the principal heroes of the national myth. The quingentenary of his voyage was celebrated in Portu-

gal with festive commemorations and academic conferences in which guests from the entire world

participated. Intrepidity and persistence, ingeniousness and pertinacity remain common themes in

discussions of the Portuguese explorers. Evidently, scholars are still reluctant to abandon the old

paradigm of defiance of the elements and discovery of the unknown, even if some of the Asian civi-

lizations "discovered" by the Portuguese were more ancient than their own and anything but un-

known to each other. They occupied social spheres tied together, from one end of Asia to another, by

well-developed commercial networks. To be sure, the Portuguese penetrated this world by a novel

route. At issue, however, is not so much exploration and discovery but the confluence and conflict

of cultures, commercial interests, and imperial ambitions.

To be explored in this seminar are the mythmaking of empire as well as the actual stages of Euro-

pean expansion into Asia. The tentative terminal date, 1641, was chosen because it is the year when

the Portuguese (two years after being expelled from Japan, the farthest point in the arc of their reach

from Europe) lost their base at Malacca to the Dutch. This event signalled the decline of one Euro-

pean colonial power and the ascendancy of another in maritime Asia.

Students will write a position paper as a final project.

Enrollment limited.

street of cultural and social influence. This course will explore the idea of empire as a process of

cultural exchange, attending chiefly to the complex relationship between culture and imperialism

that obtained in the European metropolis itself. Focusing chiefly (but not exclusively) on the exam-

ples provided by the British and French empires in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, we

will ask what impact imperial possession and ongoing European encounters with colonized and

non-Western societies had on the development of metropolitan culture in a number of diverse areas,

including popular leisure and entertainment, tourism, museums and exhibitions, orientalism and

exoticism in art and literature, the construction of "imperial" capital cities, the disciplines of an-

thropology, ethnology, and the growth of putatively scientific ideologies of race, class and gender.

Readings will include works by Edward Said, Hannah Arendt, J.A. Hobson, Bernard Cohn, Gauri

Viswanathan, E.M. Forster, and Joseph Conrad.

HIST 453(S) (formerly 361) Salem Witchcraft

In 1692, Salem, Massachusetts became the center of an unusually large concentration of accusa-

tions of witchcraft, a common occurrence in contemporary Europe but rare in the British-American

colonies. For 300 years scholars, novelists, and (now) film-makers have used this event as a win-

dow into religious, economic, and political change in early modern Euro-American culture; recent-

ly, gender and sexuality have been placed at the center of the analysis. We survey the vast literature

(including published primary sources) on American cases of witchcraft, look at the politics of

witchcraft in Europe for comparative purposes, and give a close critical reading of Arthur Miller's

play The Crucible and the recent film version. Students will write weekly responses to the assigned

reading and construct a research paper on some aspect of the historical problems we raise.

Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on this written work (the weekly responses will count for

HIST 466(F) (formerly 364) Imagining Urban America, Three Case Studies: Boston, Chicago,

and L.A. (Same as American Studies 364)

This course will explore the social, economic, and cultural lives of three cities, each of which at its

zenith seemed to contemporaries to represent definitive aspects of "American" development. We

will begin with Boston--the country's first "big" city and the nominal capital of Puritan New En-

gland--in the colonial and early national periods. From there we will move to Chicago, the trans-

portation and commercial hub of the emerging national economy in the nineteenth century. Finally

we will turn to Los Angeles, "The City of Dreams" and the center of the popular entertainment in-

dustry in the twentieth century. In each case, drawing on a variety of sources, we will examine the

city's origins, the factors that promoted its growth, and the distinctive society it engendered. Then

we will consider some of the city's cultural expressions--expressions that seem to characterize not

only changing the nature of urban life, but the particular meanings each city gave to the nation's

experience at the time. What made these cities seem simultaneously, as they did, so alluring and so

threatening to the fabric of national community and identity?

lyzing selected primary texts. There will be no hour test or final exam.

HIST 467(F) Black Urban Life and Culture*

This course will examine the historical trajectory of the black urban experience in the United States

tics and culture. We will investigate these themes through primary documents, secondary works,

and visual imagery.

HIST 471(S) Comparative Latino/a Migrations*

While the popularity of the terms "Hispanic" and "Latino/a" has grown, these umbrella terms can

mask widely divergent migration histories. In this course, we will develop the theoretical perspec-

tives needed to untangle a complicated web of differences and similarities in migration histories.

We will then use these migration histories to begin a comparative analysis of the experiences of

different Latino/a groups in the United States. For example, how do we explain differences in socio-

economic status or political perspectives? Finally, we will ask what, if any, meaningful basis there is

for talking about "Latinos and Latinas." Our discussions will also address the methods used in stud-

ying Latino and Latina history, specifically oral histories, government documents, newspapers, and

interdisciplinary approaches.

Evaluation will be based on class participation, class presentations, a short historiographical essay,

an annotated bibliography, and a research paper based in part on primary sources.

Few discoveries have so fundamentally transformed the natural world and the organization of hu-

and economics today, not to mention in our daily lives. This course will investigate the history be-

hind this pre-occupation with oil production, focusing on several themes. First, we will explore how

the exploration for oil, as well as the technologies required for refining and transporting it, have

altered the natural environment. Second, we will examine the economic nature of oil exploration

and in particular the boom-bust cycles that mark oil production. With this latter theme, we will in-

vestigate both how domestic politics have revolved around oil in the United States, as well as how

international politics have been shaped by the problems of oil production.

Evaluation will be based on class participation, weekly critical writing, and a major research paper

(20-30 pages) based on primary documents.

Enrollment limited.

HIST 475(S) (formerly 356) Modern Warfare and Military Leadership

Since the late-eighteenth century, the history of the West has been marked by a number of enor-

mously destructive and decisive wars fought by nation-states on a continental and global scale. This

era witnessed dramatic changes in the size, armaments, organization, and lethal nature of military

forces at sea, on land, and, more recently, in the air, culminating in highly mechanized warfare, and

its ultimate weapon, the atomic bomb. This course will study that warfare, paying special attention

to the role military leadership played in its development. We will concentrate our attention on the

Napoleonic Wars, the American Civil War, World War I, and World War II, and such leaders as Na-

poleon, Lee and Grant, Haig and Ludendorff, Churchill, Hitler, Stalin, Marshall, Eisenhower, and

MacArthur. Do these great leaders provide the key to our understanding of modern warfare? Or are

certain "timeless" principles, factors, and behaviors that consistently transcend local historical con-

texts more important?

Format: seminar. Requirements: a substantial (no upper limit on length) research paper on a topic of

the student's choice growing out of some aspect of the course. Participants will, in teams of two or

three, lead class discussion at least once as well as give class reports on the course readings. There

will be several required films, and the class will also play some computerized historical wargames.

Enrollment limit: 15 (expected: 15). Preference to History majors.

writing of five of six essays and the oral presentation of five or six critiques of another student's
essays are central to tutorials.

HIST 480T(S) (formerly 370T) Western Political Thought in Transition+

While modern Western political thinking traces its roots to classical Greek antiquity, it was cre-

atively transformed during the turbulent centuries stretching from late antiquity to the eighteenth

century. This tutorial will focus on that crucial period of transition, which eventuated in the emer-

gence of recognizably "modern" constitutionalist notions of consent, individual rights, and parlia-

mentary representation. Readings will involve both primary texts and secondary sources and will

concentrate on the contributions of such authors as Eusebius of Caesarea, Augustine, Aquinas,

John of Paris, Marsiglio of Padua, John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau.

Format: tutorial. Each student will write and present orally an essay of approximately 7 pages every

other week on an assigned topic focusing on the readings for that week. Students not presenting an

essay will be responsible for offering a critique of the work of their colleague. Students will be eva-

luated on their written work and/or their analyses of their colleague's work.

Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Open to all.

HIST 487T(F) (formerly 374T) The Second World War: Origins, Course, Outcomes, and

Meaning+

1991 marked the fiftieth anniversaries of the Nazi invasion of Russia and the Japanese attack on

Pearl Harbor. Though war had come to Europe as early as 1939, when Germany invaded Poland,

after 1941 the war became a truly global conflict of unprecedented extent, ferocity, and destructive-

ness. As late as 1943 it still appeared that the Axis powers might win the war. But, by the end of

1945, the bombed-out ruins of Germany and Japan were occupied by the Allies, who were prepar-

ing to put the surviving Axis leaders and generals on trial for war crimes.

This tutorial will concentrate on a number of important questions and issues which arise from a

study of World War II. What were the origins of this central event of the twentieth century? How and

why did the war begin? Why did the war take the course it did? What were the most crucial or deci-

sive episodes or events? How did the Allies win? Why did the Axis lose? Could the outcome have

been different?

Many of the topics examined will also have to deal with important questions of human responsibil-

ity and with the moral or ethical dimensions of the war. Why did France, Britain, and the Soviet

Union not stop Hitler earlier? Who was to blame for the fall of France and the Pearl Harbor fiasco?

Why did the Allies adopt a policy of extensive firebombing of civilian targets? How could the Holo-

caust have happened? Could it have been stopped? Did the Atomic bomb have to be dropped? Were

the war crime trials justified?

By the end of the tutorial, students will have become thoroughly familiar with the general course the

war followed as well as acquiring in-depth knowledge of the most decisive and important aspects of

the conflict. Students will have also grappled with the task of systematically assessing what com-

binations of material and human factors can best explain the outcomes of the major turning points of

the war. Students will also have dealt with the problem of assessing the moral and ethical responsi-

bility of those persons, organizations, and institutions involved in the war.

Format: tutorial. Each student will write and present orally an essay of approximately seven double-

spaced pages every other week on a topic assigned by the instructor. Students not presenting an

essay have the responsibility of critiquing the work of their colleague. The tutorial will culminate in

a final written exercise.

THE THESIS AND INDEPENDENT STUDY (493-499)

HIST 493(F) Senior Thesis Research/Writing Seminar

This seminar is a colloquium for the writers of honors theses. Although each student's major work

for the fall will be the writing of a thesis in consultation with an individual advisor, students will

gather for occasional meetings in order to present and critique each other's proposals and drafts and

to discuss common problems in research and the design of a long analytical essay. Evaluation will

be based on class participation and completed written work, and will determine if a student will

continue in the thesis program. For students proceeding to W031 and HIST 494, performance in the

fall semester will figure into the thesis grade calculated at the end of the year. The quality of a stu-

dent's performance in the colloquium segment of History 493, as well as his or her performance in

all aspects of the May colloquium at which these are presented and critiqued, will be figured into the

overall grade the student is given for History 493-494 and the departmental decision to award Hon-

ors or Highest Honors at Commencement.

Professor: D. BEAVER**. Advisory Committee: Professors: D. BEAVER**, V. HILL.

   A major in the History of Science is not offered, but the occasional Contract Major in it or a re-
lated interdisciplinary field is possible. Courses in the History of Science are designed primarily to
complement and strengthen work in other major fields. Although any of the courses may be taken
separately, studying related courses in other departments will enhance their value, because by na-
ture, History of Science is interdisciplinary.

   The following will serve as examples: the 101 course is an introduction to science and technolo-
gy studies, and concentrates on key aspects of contemporary science and technology relevant to
many issues of living in a technological society. Scientific Revolutions (HSCI 224) deals with the
emergence of modern science in the 1600s and 1700s, and with subsequent revolutions in scientific
thought; as such it complements courses related to modern European history. Technology and Cul-
ture (HSCI 305), an introduction to the history of technology, offers materials which support work
in a wide variety of fields: environmental studies, political science, history, philosophy, and the
sciences. History of Science 240 traces the influential role of science and invention in the shaping of
American culture, and complements offerings in American Studies and American History. HSCI
320, an historical overview of the ideas, practice, and organization of medicine, provides context
for related coursework in History, Philosophy, and the Premed Program.

HSCI 101(S) Science, Technology, and Human Values (Same as Science and Technology

Studies 101)

A study of the natures and roles of science and technology in today's society, and of the problems

which technical advances pose for human values. An introduction to science-technology studies.

Topics include: scientific creativity, the Two Cultures, the norms and values of science, the Manhat-

tan Project and Big Science, the ethics and social responsibility of science, appropriate technology,

technology assessment, and various problems which spring from dependencies engendered by liv-

ing in a technological society, e.g., computers and privacy, automation and dehumanization,

biomedical engineering.

Format: discussion. Requirements: two or three short exercises, two papers (3-5 pages and 5-10

pages), and a final exam.

Enrollment limit: 25.

Satisfies one semester of Division II requirement.

and fact?

This course investigates four major changes of world view, associated with Copernicus (1543);

Newton (1687); Darwin (1859); and Planck (1900) and Einstein (1905). It also treats briefly the

emergence of modern cosmogony, geology, and chemistry as additional reorganizations of belief

about our origins, our past, and our material structure.

We first acquire a basic familiarity with the scientific use and meaning of the new paradigms, as

they emerged in historical context. We then ask how those ideas fit together to form a new frame-

work, and ask what their trans-scientific legacy has been, that is, how they have affected ideas and

values in other sciences, other fields or thought, and in society.

Knowledge of high-school algebra is presupposed.

Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on five problem sets, two short papers (3-5

pages), and two hour exams.

Though it is largely forgotten now, the war in Afghanistan played a pivotal role in the collapse of the
Soviet Union, and the repercussions of the war continue to be felt in a variety of significant ways,
including in the ongoing challenge presented by Osama Bin Ladin, the Saudi industrialist-cum-Is-
lamic activist, who uses Afghanistan as his base of operations for attacking Western interests in the
Muslim world. This course examines the historical and cultural background to the war, the events of
the war themselves, and the emergence of the Taliban regime following the Soviet withdrawal.
Among the issues to be considered are the war and its impact on the Soviet Union, the spread of
Islamic radicalism, the relationship between ethnicity and religion, the position of women under the

Taliban, and the implications of the collapse of the Afghan nation-state for regional and internation-

al political order. In addition to reading about and discussing various aspects of the war, its causes

and its aftermath, students will also assist in the development of a DVD on the war that will incorpo-

Suppose the Williams Record crack investigative reporters discovered that Michelangelo's Mona

Lisa has been destroyed, and the painting in the Louvre is actually a nineteenth-century forgery.

Should that change your aesthetic appreciation of the work? Ted Turner colorized Casablanca and

other classic black and white films. Did he destroy the artistic integrity of the films? Which is better:
a damaged Rembrandt, or one restored using twentieth-century materials? Suppose someone writes
his name on a ready-made object (such as a urinal) and displays it in a museum. Is it art? These and

more questions will be examined by working with philosophical literature, works of art, legal cases

(and perhaps an X-ray machine). This course will be taught in conjunction with an exhibition at the
Williams College Museum of Art: "But is it Real?" The students in this course will be responsible
for preparing the exhibition publications. Students will be required to attend an accompanying lec-

ture series sponsored by the course and WCMA.

INTR 262(S) Liberal Arts & the Modern World

An examination of liberal-arts education in an epoch of information explosion and increasingly bureaucra-

tized expertise. The course begins by reconstructing the age-old debate on the nature and purpose of educa-

tion. Should education of the young be directed principally at cultivating habits of mind, "character", and

civic virtues that make for good citizens and effective actors in the world of affairs? Or should education

concentrate on preparing men and women for the pursuit of specific skills or of increasingly specialized,

scientific knowledge? Readings here include selected writings of Isocrates, Plato, Cicero, Quintilian, Au-

gustine, Aquinas, Ignatius, Erasmus, Bacon, Newman, Arnold, Huxley, McCosh, Hopkins, Eliot, Dewey,

Mead, and Snow, among others. The course traces the historical emergence of American liberal-arts col-

leges, institutional embodiments of the humanistic tradition, and the later growth of major American re-

search universities, institutional seats and symbols of refined expertise. ANd the course analyzes the con-

temporary clash of ideas about the undergraduate curriculum, a debate that echoes ancient disputes. The

course will host several Williams alumni/ae who will reflect on liberal-arts education and their experiences

both in the world of affairs and in intellectual arenas.

politics of making some stories "official" and others forbidden or subversive? These are some of the

questions that this interdisciplinary course will address through a critical reading of myths, legends,

narratives and stories from ancient Greek sources, the Hebrew Bible, the Christian New Testament,

and a broad selection of traditional societies across time and space. Among the types of story to be

considered: origins stories and other charter myths, trickster myths, hero myths, theological myths,

apocalyptic myths, and various myths of transformation (e.g., myths of resurrection). While attend-

ing to the points of contact between myths of different societies that make comparison of them pos-

sible, we will also examine how in structure and function the myths we study are embedded in their

own unique society or culture.

INTR 342(S) Science and Religious Experience (Same as Physics 342 and Religion 342)

The natural world seems very different than it did when the world's major religions developed. How

should our developing understanding of the physical world affect our religious experience? Are the

implications of science in conflict with religious concepts? Are science and religious experience

entirely separate domains of understanding? Is there useful dialogue between them and perhaps

even the possibility of integration?

We will draw our scientific examples from our current understanding of quantum indeterminism

and non-locality, from cosmology, and from evolutionary biology. Following William James, we

will interpret religious experience as personal affirmation of the meaning of existence, whether or

not guided by religious institutions. We will explore the relationship of science to religious experi-

ence within the framework of conflict, separation, dialogue and integration developed by Ian Bar-

bour.

per.

ing some background in science, religion, psychology or philosophy. Enrollment limit: 30.

   Williams offers a variety of courses specifically directed to students interested in Jewish Studies. In
addition, many other courses incorporate topics relevant to the study of Judaism. Students are encouraged
to integrate courses from diverse disciplines with a focus in Jewish history, religion, literature, language,
and thought. Thus, rather than emphasizing a particular method of inquiry, Jewish Studies courses bring
together students from different departments who share interest in a common topic. As a result, Jewish

subjects are analyzed from a multitude of perspectives (religious, philosophical, political, historical, psy-
chological, literary, etc.). Williams offers two types of courses related to Jewish Studies: Courses directly
focusing on Jewish topics and courses partially devoted to some aspect of Judaism. In order to receive a
solid foundation in Jewish Studies, students are strongly encouraged to take at least three courses: REL 203
or REL 209, one "text" course (CLAS/REL 201, 207, 208, CRHE 201-202, ENGL 344, and one
"thought" course (REL 206, REL 284, REL 290). The Jewish Studies cluster also sponsors an on-going
series of dinner/colloquia throughout each semester on topics of general interest to faculty and students
participating in the cluster.

   Each year, in addition to the regular course offerings listed above, Williams sponsors the Croghan Bi-

centennial Visiting Professor in Religion who offers one course in Judaism and/or Christianity. This year's
Croghan Professor is Helmut Koester, Professor of New Testament Studies at the Harvard Divinity School.
Past Croghan Professors have taught courses on the Mishnah (Shaye Cohen), the historical Jesus (John
Dominic Crossan), and Ancient Mediterranean Religions (Ross Kraemer).

Overseas Studies
   Studying in Israel is highly recommended for students interested in Jewish Studies. Many students have

spent a semester or year at Hebrew University. In Winter Study 2002, there will be a travel course to the
Middle East, Classics/Religion 025 Israel and Jordan: Intercultural Interchange, Ancient and Modern.

Funding
   The Bronfman Fund for Judaic Studies was established in 1980 by Edgar M. Bronfman '50, Samuel

Bronfman II '75, and Matthew Bronfman '80. The Bronfman Fund provides opportunities for the Wil-
liams community to learn about Jewish history and culture, both within the College's formal curriculum
and through the planning of major events on Jewish themes.

   The Morris Wiener and Stephen R. Wiener '56 Fund for Jewish Studies was established in 1997
through the estate of Stephen R. Wiener '56. The Wiener gifts have provided an endowment to support a
faculty position in modern Jewish thought, and are used to underwrite an annual lecture, forum or event
relevant to contemporary Jewish life.

   Courses in Leadership Studies explore the phenomena of leadership in a wide range of historical,
cultural, organizational and intellectual domains. The field of Leadership Studies recognizes that
leading and following are basic elements of interpersonal relationships and social organization en-
countered in all groups. While courses in this cluster may provide practical insights into leadership,
their principle purpose is to challenge students to appreciate the complex social, psychological, eth-
ical, and aesthetic issues facing leaders of many kinds.

   Leadership Studies is neither a major nor a concentration, although contract majors may be de-
veloped by students interested in incorporating Leadership Studies into their major area of study.
There is a recommended curriculum that may be completed as follows: completion of two "Cluster
Course" listed below, two Leadership Studies electives, also listed below, and the capstone course,
Topics in Leadership. A Leadership Studies Winter Study course may be substituted for either clus-
ter courses or electives. Interested students should speak with the cluster chair to discuss their inter-
est.

INTR 402(S) Topics in Leadership

A coordinated set of independent studies on leadership. Students should consult with the chair of

the Leadership Studies cluster and propose an independent study on a topic of his or her choosing.

Suitable topics might grow out of earlier Leadership Studies courses. The chair will arrange an ap-

propriate independent study supervisor among the faculty involved in the cluster. Individual stu-

dents and their faculty advisors will meet during the semester with other students enrolled in the

course and their faculty advisors for discussions of the various independent projects.

Requirements: extensive independent project and presentation of project to other students and fac-

ulty involved in the course.

Prerequisites: two Leadership Studies cluster courses and permission of the instructor.

Hour: TBA                                                             G. GOETHALS

                              LINGUISTICS (Div. I)

                              Coordinator: CORNELIUS C. KUBLER

   Courses in linguistics enable students to explore language from a variety of perspectives: the in-
ternal workings of language as a system of communication, the role of language in society, the his-
tory of language groups and specific languages, and the applicability of scientific knowledge about
language to various human endeavors.

   Linguistics offers neither a major nor a concentration, but its courses complement study in sever-
al other disciplines: Anthropology, Psychology, Sociology, English, Comparative Literature and all
the foreign languages. Anthropology majors can receive major credit for Linguistics 101. Majors in
German Studies may receive major credit for a linguistics course with the special permission of the
department chair.

   Knowledge of foreign languages is helpful but not required for Linguistics 101.

LING 101(F) Introduction to Linguistics (Same as Anthropology 107)

This course is designed to provide an introduction to the scientific study of language, particularly its

theoretical debates, methodology, and relationship to other disciplines. With this aim in mind, we

will examine the analytic methods and major findings of various subfields of linguistics, including

phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, language change, and language acquisition.

Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: participation in discussions, weekly homework, a mid-

term exam, a collaborative project, and a final exam.

No prerequisites.

Hour: 2:35-3:50 MR                                                                       AUSTIN

LING 212T(S) Language Acquisition and the Question of What's Innate
The acquisition of language is perhaps the most daunting intellectual task that a child faces, yet it is
largely accomplished by age four, an age at which most children still can't tie their shoes or tell time.

How are young children able to acquire native competence in language so quickly and effortlessly?

Why are adults' attempts to learn foreign languages often doomed to failure, despite their greater

cognitive abilities? These questions will provide a forum for exploring current debates raging be-

tween nativists and empiricists regarding the very nature of the human mind. The two opposing

camps have philosophical roots in the rationalist/empiricist debate of the eighteenth century (and

even further back), and their positions are often represented in modern terms as differing on the

importance that they ascribe to nature (innate constraints) versus nurture (the role of experience) in

language development. In our meetings, we will analyze readings from linguists, philosophers and

cognitive psychologists such as Chomsky, Fodor and Bates supporting each position, as well as em-

pirical evidence which bears on these questions in the form of data from first and second language

acquisition in children and adults, including the acquisition of sign language.

Students will work in pairs, and will be expected to write a position paper of 5-7 pages every two

weeks, as well as to critique each other's papers. The papers will be based on the course readings

and on exercises in which students will examine data from child and adult language learners.

Hour: TBA                                                                        AUSTIN

MAJOR
   The major in Mathematics is designed to meet two goals: to introduce some of the central ideas in

a variety of areas of mathematics and statistics, and to develop problem-solving ability by teaching
students to combine creative thinking with rigorous reasoning.

   Students are urged to consult with the department faculty on choosing courses appropriate to an
individualized program of study.

REQUIREMENTS (nine courses plus colloquium)

Calculus (two courses)
   Mathematics 104 Calculus II
   Mathematics 105 Multivariable Calculus
   Except in unusual circumstances, students planning to major in mathematics should complete
   the calculus sequence (Mathematics 103, 104, 105) before the end of the sophomore year, at
   the latest.

Applied/Discrete Mathematics/Statistics (one course)
   Mathematics 209 (formerly MATH 210) Differential Equations and Vector Calculus or

   a more advanced elective in discrete or applied mathematics or statistics, with prior departmental
   approval: Mathematics 305, 306, 315, 346, 354, 361, 433, 452, or any Statistics course 300 or
   above or an appropriate course from another department as listed in the notes below.
   Notes: Mathematics 251 is required in Computer Science, and Mathematics 209 (formerly
   MATH 210) is recommended in other sciences, but double majors should understand that no
   course may count toward both majors.

Core Courses (three courses)
   Mathematics 211 Linear Algebra
   Mathematics 301 Real Analysis or Mathematics 305 Applied Real Analysis
   Mathematics 312 Abstract Algebra or Mathematics 315 Groups and Characters

Completion (three courses plus colloquium)
The Senior Major Course is any 400-level course taken in the senior year. In exceptional circum-
stances, with the prior permission of the department, a student may be allowed to satisfy the Senior
Major Course requirement in the junior year, provided that the student has completed three 300-lev-
el mathematics courses before enrolling in the Senior Major Course (if it is a statistics seminar, one
of the 300-level courses may be replaced by Statistics 201).

Two electives from courses numbered 300 and above or Statistics 201.

Weekly participation as a senior in the Mathematics Colloquium, in which all senior majors present
talks on mathematical or statistical topics of their choice.

NOTES
   In some cases, an appropriate course from another department may be substituted for one of the

electives, with prior permission of the Mathematics and Statistics Department. In any case, at least
eight courses must be taken in mathematics and statistics at Williams. These can, with prior permis-
sion, include courses taken away. Students with transfer credit should contact the department about
special arrangements.

APPLIED MATHEMATICS OR OTHER SCIENCES
   Students interested in applied mathematics or other sciences, including economics, should

consider Mathematics 209 (formerly MATH 210), 210, 251, 305, 306, 315, 323, 342, 354, 361,
433, or Statistics 201, 231, 346, 442, and additional appropriate courses from outside Mathemat-
ics and Statistics, including possibilities such as Chemistry 301, Computer Science 256, Com-
puter Science 361, Economics 255, Physics 201, Physics 202, Physics 210 or more advanced
physics courses.

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
   Students interested in careers in business or finance should consider Mathematics 170, as well as

courses in statistics and related areas such as Statistics 101, 201, 231, 331, 344, 346, 442, 443. Since
these courses address different needs, students should consult with the instructors to determine
which seem to be most appropriate for individuals.

ENGINEERING
   Students interested in engineering should consider the courses for applied mathematics immedi-

ately above, with Mathematics 209 (formerly MATH 210) and 305 especially recommended. Wil-
liams has exchange and joint programs with good engineering schools. Interested students should
consult the section on engineering near the beginning of the Bulletin and the Williams pre-engineer-
ing advisor for further information.

GRADUATE SCHOOL IN MATHEMATICS
   Students interested in continuing their study of mathematics in graduate school should take

Mathematics 301 and 312. Mathematics 302 and 324 are strongly recommended. Many of the
400-level courses would be useful, particularly ones that involve algebra and analysis. Honors
theses are encouraged. Reading knowledge of a foreign language (French, German, or Russian) is
helpful.

STATISTICS AND ACTUARIAL SCIENCE
   Students interested in statistics or actuarial science should consider Mathematics 341, Statis-

tics 201, 231, 331, 346, 442 and Economics 255. Additionally, students should consider taking
some number of the actuarial exams given by the Society of Actuaries, which can constitute part
of an honors program in actuarial studies (see section on honors below).

TEACHING
   Students interested in teaching mathematics at the elementary or secondary school level

should consider Mathematics 285, 313, 325, 381, Statistics 201 and practice as a tutor or teach-
ing assistant. Winter study courses that provide a teaching practicum are also highly recom-
mended.

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN MATHEMATICS
   The degree with honors in Mathematics is awarded to the student who has demonstrated out-

standing intellectual achievement in a program of study which extends beyond the require-
ments of the major. The principal considerations for recommending a student for the degree
with honors will be: Mastery of core material and skills, breadth and, particularly, depth of
knowledge beyond the core material, ability to pursue independent study of mathematics or
statistics, originality in methods of investigation, and, where appropriate, creativity in re-
search.

   An honors program normally consists of two semesters and a WSP (031) of independent re-
search, culminating in a thesis and a presentation. Under certain circumstances, the honors work
can consist of coordinated study involving a regular course and one semester plus a WSP (030) of
independent study, culminating in a "minithesis" and a presentation. At least one semester should
be in addition to the major requirements.

   An honors program in actuarial studies requires significant achievement on four appropriate ex-
aminations of the Society of Actuaries and giving a second colloquium talk. Written work is a pos-
sible component.

   Highest honors will be reserved for the rare student who has displayed exceptional ability,
achievement or originality. Such a student usually will have written a thesis, or pursued actuarial
honors and written a minithesis. An outstanding student who writes a minithesis, or pursues actu-
arial honors and writes a paper, might also be considered.

                                                ­ 231 ­
Mathematics and Statistics

   Prospective honors students are urged to consult with their departmental advisor at the time of
registration in the spring of the sophomore or at the beginning of the junior year to arrange a pro-
gram of study that could lead to the degree with honors. By the time of registration during spring of
the junior year, the student must have requested a faculty member to be honors advisor and must
have obtained the department's approval of formal admission to the honors program. Such approval
depends on both the record and the promise of the applicant. It is conditional on continuing prog-
ress.

   The recommendation for honors is usually announced at the end of the spring term. Participation
in the honors program does not guarantee a recommendation for honors. The decision is based not
only on successful completion of the honors program but also on the merit of the student's overall
record in mathematics. If the student completes the program during the fall or winter study, the deci-
sion may be announced at the beginning of the spring term, conditional on continuing merit.

ADVANCED PLACEMENT
   The Mathematics and Statistics Department attempts to place each student who elects a

mathematics course in that course best suited to the student's preparation and goals. The sug-
gested placement in an appropriate calculus course is determined by the results of the Ad-
vanced Placement Examination (AB or BC) if the student took one, and any additional avail-
able information. A student who receives a 3, 4, or 5 on the BC examination or a 4 or 5 on the AB
examination is ordinarily placed in Mathematics 105. A student who receives a 1 or 2 on the BC
examination or a 2 or 3 on the AB examination is ordinarily placed in Mathematics 104. Stu-
dents who have had calculus in high school, whether or not they took the Advanced Placement
Examination, are barred from Mathematics 103 unless they obtain permission from the instruc-
tor. Students who take an Advanced Placement Exam in statistics should consult the depart-
ment for placement. In any event, students registering for mathematics and statistics courses
are urged to consult with members of the department concerning appropriate courses and place-
ment. In general, students are encouraged to enroll in the most advanced course for which they
are qualified: it is much easier to drop back than to jump forward. The department reserves the
right to refuse registration in any course for which the student is determined to be over-pre-
pared.

GENERAL REMARKS
Divisional Requirements

   All courses may be used to satisfy this requirement.

Alternate Year Courses
   Core courses Mathematics 301, 305, 312, and 315 are normally offered every year. Other

300-level courses may be offered in alternate years. Senior seminars (400-level courses) are nor-
mally offered every two to four years. Students should check with the department before planning
far into the future.

Course Admission
   Courses are normally open to all students meeting the prerequisites. Students with questions

about the level at which courses are conducted are invited to consult members of the department.

Course Descriptions
   Descriptions of the courses in Computer Science are under that heading. More detailed informa-

tion on all of the offerings in the department is available in the Informal Guide to Mathematics
Courses at Williams that can be obtained at the departmental office.

Courses Open on a Pass/Fail Basis
   Students taking a mathematics course on a pass/fail basis must meet all the requirements set for

students taking the course on a graded basis.
   With the permission of the department, any course offered by the department may be taken on a

pass/fail basis. Permission will not be given to mathematics majors to meet any of the requirements
of the major or honors degree on this basis. However, with the permission of the department,
courses taken in the department beyond those requirements may be taken on a pass/fail basis.

Graduate School Requirements
   An increasing number of graduate and professional schools require mathematics and statistics as

a prerequisite to admission or to attaining their degree. Students interested in graduate or profes-
sional training in business, medicine, economics, or psychology are advised to find out the require-
ments in those fields early in their college careers.

Note: Statistics course listings follow the Mathematics course listings.

MATH 100(F) Quantitative Studies

This course is intended for all students--(first-year students and upperclass students)--who want

to strengthen their basic arithmetic and algebraic skills, and to understand the central concepts of

elementary mathematics. Topics will include: signed numbers, fractions, decimals, percentages,

exponents, logarithms, scientific notation, polynomials, algebraic fractions, linear and quadratic

equations, and graphing. Concepts will be stressed in classroom lectures and discussions; tech-

niques will be developed through daily assignments.

Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on performance on quizzes and exams.

Prerequisite: permission of the instructor.

Depending on his or her performance on the diagnostic test administered at the beginning of the

academic year, a student may be required to take Mathematics 100 or Mathematics 101 as a prereq-

uisite for Biology 101, Chemistry 151, Computer Science 134, Economics 110 or 120, Mathemat-

ics 103, Statistics 201, or Physics 131, 141. However, a student need not be planning to take one of

these additional courses in order to take Mathematics 100 or 101. No enrollment limit (expected: 6).

Hour: 12:00-12:50 MWF                                                             MORGAN

MATH 101(F) Pre-Calculus

The elementary functions--algebraic, logarithmic, and trigonometric--from both a graphical and

analytic point of view.

Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on performance on quizzes and exams.

Prerequisite: permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 15 (expected: 15).

Hour: 11:00-11:50 MWF, 12:00-12:50 MWF                                            CHKHENKELI

MATH 103(F,S) Calculus I

Calculus permits the computation of velocities and other instantaneous rates of change by a limiting

process called differentiation. The same process also solves "max-min" problems: how to maxi-

mize profit or minimize pollution. A second limiting process, called integration, permits the com-

putation of areas and accumulations of income or medicines. The Fundamental Theorem of Calcu-

lus provides a useful and surprising link between the two processes. Subtopics include trigonome-

try, exponential growth, and logarithms. This is an introductory course for students who have not

seen calculus before. Students who have previously taken a calculus course may not enroll in

MATH 103 without the permission of the instructor.

Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on homework, quizzes, and/or exams.

Prerequisite: Mathematics 101 (or demonstrated proficiency on a diagnostic test; see Mathematics

101). No enrollment limit (expected: fall, 60; spring 50).

Hour: 10:00-10:50 MWF, 11:00-11:50 MWF                                    First Semester: MORGAN

MATH 104(F,S) Calculus II

Mastery of calculus requires understanding how integration computes areas and business profit and

acquiring a stock of techniques. Further methods solve equations involving derivatives ("differen-

tial equations") for population growth or pollution levels. Exponential and logarithmic functions

and trigonometric and inverse functions play an important role. This course is the right starting

point for students who have seen derivatives, but not necessarily integrals, before. Students who

have received the equivalent of advanced placement of AB 4 or BC 3 may not enroll in Mathematics

104 without the permission of the instructor. Students who have higher advanced placement must

enroll in Mathematics 105 or above.

Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on homework, quizzes, and/or exams.

Prerequisite: Mathematics 103 or equivalent. No enrollment limit (expected:fall, 70; spring, 50).

MATH 105(F,S) Multivariable Calculus
Applications of calculus in mathematics, science, economics, psychology, the social sciences, in-
volve several variables. This course extends calculus to several variables: vectors, partial deriva-
tives, multiple integrals. There is also a unit on infinite series, sometimes with applications to differ-
ential equations. This course is the right starting point for students who have seen differentiation
and integration before. Students with the equivalent of advanced placement of AB 4, BC 3 or above
should enroll in Mathematics 105.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on homework, quizzes, and/or exams. Prerequi-

MATH 143(F) Elementary Statistics and Data Analysis (See Statistics 101)

MATH 170(F,S) Mathematics of Finance

This course investigates the mathematics underlying various problems that arise in personal, con-

sumer, and business finance. Topics include simple and compound interest, periodic loans (such as

home mortgages and auto loans), present value, future value, bank discounting and rediscounting,

amortization, sinking funds, corporate and municipal bonds, perpetual annuities, taxes (including

itemization), life annuities, depreciation, inflation, and the basic mechanics of life insurance. Stu-

dents are required to carry out several spreadsheet projects; instruction on the use of these systems

is provided as needed. Although the course does not prepare students for the examinations of the

Society of Actuaries, it is basically actuarial in approach, not a course in "how to invest."

Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on performance in class quizzes, spreadsheet

exercises, and exams.

Prerequisite: Mathematics 103 or equivalent. Not open to first-year students. Not open to junior or

senior Mathematics majors except by permission of the instructor. Not open on a pass/fail basis.

Enrollment limit:42 (expected: 42).

MATH 180(S) The Art of Mathematical Thinking: An Introduction to the Beauty and Power

of Mathematical Ideas~

What is mathematics? How can it enrich and improve your life? What do mathematicians think

about and how do they go about tackling challenging questions? Most people envision mathemati-

cians as people who solve equations or perform arithmetic. In fact, mathematics is an artistic en-

deavor which requires both imagination and creativity. In this course, we will experience what this

is all about by discovering various beautiful branches of mathematics while learning life lessons

that will have a positive impact on our lives. There are two meta-goals for this course: (1) a better

perspective into mathematics, and (2) sharper analytical reasoning to solve problems (both mathe-

matical and nonmathematical).

Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based primarily on projects, homework assign-

ments, and exams.

Prerequisite: Mathematics 100 (or demonstrated proficiency on a diagnostic test--see Mathemat-

ics 100) or permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 50 (expected: 50). Not open to students

who have taken mathematics courses other than Mathematics 100, 101, 103, 170, Statistics 101.

(This course is part of the Critical Reasoning and Analytical Skills initiative.)

Hour: 10:00-10:50 MWF                                                               BURGER

MATH 209(S)(formerly MATH 210) Differential Equations and Vector Calculus

Historically, much beautiful mathematics has arisen from attempts to explain heat flow, chemical

reactions, biological processes, or magnetic fields. A few ingenious techniques solve a surprisingly

large fraction of the associated ordinary and partial differential equations. The mystical Pythagore-

an fascination with ratios and harmonics is vindicated and applied in Fourier series and integrals.

Integrating vectorfields over surfaces applies equally to blood flow, gravity, and differential geom-

etry.

Format: lectures/discussion, three hours a week; problem sets. Evaluation will be based on problem

sets, hour tests, and a final exam.

Prerequisite: Mathematics 105. No enrollment limit (expected: 31). Students may not normally get

credit for both Mathematics 209 and Mathematics/ Physics 210.

Hour: 10:00-10:50 MWF                                                               MORGAN

MATH 210(S) Mathematical Methods for Scientists (Same as Physics 210)
(New course for 2001--see under Physics for full description.)

MATH 211(F,S) Linear Algebra
Many social, political, economic, biological, and physical phenomena can be described, at least
approximately, by linear relations. In the study of systems of linear equations one may ask: When
does a solution exist? When is it unique? How does one find it? How can one interpret it geometri-
cally? This course develops the theoretical structure underlying answers to these and other ques-
tions and includes the study of matrices, vector spaces, linear independence and bases, linear trans-
formations, determinants and inner products. Course work is balanced between theoretical and
computational, with attention to improving mathematical style and sophistication.

As a complement to calculus, which is the study of continuous processes, this course focuses on the

discrete, including finite sets and structures, their properties and applications. Topics will include

basic set theory, graph theory, logic, counting, recursion, and functions. The course serves as an

introduction not only to these and other topics but also to the methods and styles of mathematical

proof.

MATH 305(S) Applied Real Analysis

In this course, we will take a more rigorous look at the limit, the integral, and how they interact. This

will give us the background to explore Fourier series and possibly Fourier integrals. Fourier series

are fundamental in the study of many differential equations, such as the wave equation and the heat

equation.

MATH 312(S) Abstract Algebra

Algebra gives us the tools to solve equations. Sets such as the integers or real numbers have special

properties which make algebra work or not work according to the circumstances. In this course, we

generalize algebraic processes and the sets upon which they operate in order to better understand,

theoretically, when equations can and cannot be solved. We define and study the abstract algebraic

structures called groups, rings and fields, as well as the concepts of factor group, quotient ring, ho-

momorphism, isomorphism, and various types of field extensions.

Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on problem sets and exams.

MATH 321(F) Knot Theory

Take a piece of string, tie a knot in it, and glue the ends together. The result is a knotted circle, known

as a knot. For the last 100 years, mathematicians have studied knots, asking such questions as, "Giv-

en a nasty tangled knot, how do you tell if it can be untangled without cutting it open?" Some of the

most interesting advances in knot theory have occurred in the last ten years.

This course is an introduction to the theory of knots. Among other topics, we will cover methods of

knot tabulation, surfaces applied to knots, polynomials associated to knots, and relationships be-

tween knot theory and chemistry and physics. In addition to learning the theory, we will look at open

problems in the field.

Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based on problem sets, midterms, and a final exam.

MATH 323(S) Applied Topology

In topology, one studies properties of an object that are preserved under rubber-like deformations,

where one is allowed to twist and pull, but one cannot tear or glue. Hence a sphere is considered the

same as a cube, but distinct from the surface of a doughnut. In recent years, topology has found

applications in chemistry (knotted DNA molecules), economics (stability theory), Geographic In-

formation Systems, cosmology (the shape of the Universe), medicine (heart failure), robotics and

electric circuit design, just to name some of the fields that have been impacted. In this course, we

will learn the basics of topology, including point-set topology, geometric topology and algebraic

topology, but all with the purpose of applying the theory to a broad array of fields.

MATH 404(S) Ergodic Theory

Ergodic theory studies the probabilistic behavior of dynamical systems as they evolve through

time. This course will be an introduction to the basic notions in ergodic theory. The course will start

with an introduction to the necessary topics from measure theory: sigma-algebras, measurable sets

and measurable transformations. Then we will cover ergodic, weak mixing, mixing, and Bernoulli

transformations, and transformations admitting and not admitting an invariant measure. There will

be an emphasis on specific examples such as group rotations, the binary odometer transformations,

and rank-one constructions.

MATH 413(F) An Introduction to p-Adic Analysis

Almost your entire mathematical life has been spent on the real line and in real space working with

real numbers. Some have dipped into complex numbers, which are just the real numbers after you

throw in i. Are these the only numbers that can be built from the rationals? The answer is no. There

are entire parallel universes of number that are totally unrelated to the real and complex numbers.

Welcome to the world of p-adic analysis-where arithmetic replaces the tape measure and numbers

take on a whole new look. Here we will explore this new notion of number and discover its impact

on arithmetic, geometry, and calculus. It turns out that p-adic analysis not only dramatically simpli-

fies many mathematical areas but also provides a powerful tool for analyzing number theoretic is-

sues.

Format: lecture/seminar. Evaluation will be based primarily on homework, examinations, and class

MATH 417(F) Algebraic Error-Correcting Codes

In the modern world, transmission of information is vital. Many methods used to transmit data,

however, are susceptible to outside influences that can cause errors. For example, information sent

via phone lines can be corrupted by lightening. Algebraic Error-Correcting Codes provide an ele-

gant and efficient way of dealing with these errors. This course will be an introduction to this topic.

Although the mathematical tools for designing error-correcting codes (groups, rings, fields, vector

spaces) are studied in their own right, we will focus on the applications of these theoretical concepts

to coding theory. The course will cover various types of codes including repetition codes, parity

check codes, linear codes, Hamming codes and generalized Reed-Solomon codes.

                            STATISTICS COURSES

STAT 101(F) (formerly MATH 143) Elementary Statistics and Data Analysis

It is nearly impossible to live in the world today without being inundated with data. Even the most

popular newspapers feature statistics to catch the eye of the passerby, and sports broadcasters over-

whelm the listener with arcane statistics. How do we learn to recognize dishonest or even uninten-

tionally distorted representations of quantitative information? How are we to reconcile two medical

studies with seemingly contradictory conclusions? How many observations do we need in order to

make a decision? It is the purpose of this course to develop an appreciation for and an understanding

of the interpretation of data. We will become familiar with the standard tools of statistical inference

including the t-test, the analysis of variance, and regression, as well as exploratory data techniques.

Applications will come from the real world that we all live in.

Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on performances on quizzes and exams.

Prerequisite: Mathematics 100 (or demonstrated proficiency on a diagnostic test; see Mathematics

STAT 201(S) (formerly MATH 243) Statistics and Data Analysis

Statistics can be viewed as the art (science?) of turning data into information. Real world decision-

making, whether in business or science is often based on data and the perceived information it con-

tains. Sherlock Holmes, when prematurely asked the merits of a case by Dr. Watson, snapped back,

"Data, data, data! I can't make bricks without clay". In this course, we will study the basic methods

by which statisticians attempt to extract information from data. These will include many of the stan-

dard tools of statistical inference such as the t-test, analysis of variance and linear regression as well

as exploratory and graphical data analysis techniques.

STAT 346(F) Regression and Forecasting

This course focuses on the building of empirical models through data in order to predict, explain,

doing this. Through no fault of its own, regression analysis has perhaps the most used of all data

analysis methods. We will study both the mathematics of regression analysis and its applications,

including a discussion of the limits to such analyses. The applications will range from predicting the

quality of a vintage of Bordeaux wine from the weather to forecasting stock prices, and will come

from a broad range of disciplines.

   Music majors are encouraged to participate in departmental ensembles throughout their careers
at Williams; i.e., for eight semesters. Majors are required to participate in departmental ensembles
for at least four semesters. The student must petition to meet this requirement in an alternative way.
Music majors are also expected to attend departmentally-sponsored concerts.

Foreign Languages
   Music majors are strongly urged to take courses in at least one foreign language while at Wil-

liams.

Musicianship Skills

   Music majors are strongly urged to maintain, refine and improve their musicianship skills, such
as sight-singing, score reading, melodic and harmonic dictation, and keyboard proficiency,
throughout their entire Williams career.

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN MUSIC
   Three routes toward honors and highest honors are possible in the Music major:

   a. Composition: A Composition thesis must include one major work completed during the senior year, a
      portfolio of smaller works completed during the junior and senior years, and a 10- to 15-page discus-
      sion of the student's work.

   b. Performance: A Performance thesis must include an honors recital given during the spring of the
      senior year and a 15- to 20-page discussion of a selection of the works performed. The student's
      general performance career will also be considered in determining honors.

   c. History, Theory and Analysis, or Ethnomusicology: A written Historical, Theoretical/Analytical, or
      Ethnomusicological thesis between 65 and 80 pages in length and an oral presentation based on the
      thesis is required. A written thesis should offer new insights based on original research.

   To be admitted to the honors program, a student must have at least a 3.3 GPA in Music courses
(this GPA must be maintained in order to receive honors), and have demonstrated ability and expe-
rience through coursework and performance in the proposed thesis area. A 1- to 2-page application
to the honors program, written in consultation with a faculty member, must be made to the chair of
Music before or during spring registration in the junior year.

   Honors candidates must enroll in Music 493(F)-W031-494(S) during their senior year. A student
who is highly qualified for honors work, but who, for compelling reasons, is unable to pursue a
year-long project, may petition the department for permission to pursue a thesis over one semester
and the winter study term. If granted, the standards for evaluating the thesis in such exceptional
cases would be identical to those that apply to year-long honors projects. Final submission of the
thesis must be made to the Music Department by April 15 of the senior year. The department's deci-
sion to award honors will be based on the quality of the thesis.

   Courses involving individual vocal or instrumental instruction involve extra fees which are sub-
sidized by the department. (See Music 251-258 and Studies in the Musical Art 325, 326, 427, 428).
For further information contact the Coordinator of Private Instruction.

                                    ________________________________

   There are two introductory courses in music at Williams College. The student is urged to read the
descriptions of Music 101 and 103, and to consult the instructors to determine which course will
best assist his or her growth in understanding music.

MUS 101(F) Listening to Music: An Introduction

Intended for non-major students with little or no formal training.

When you listen to music--on the radio, on a CD, at a concert--how much do you really hear? This

course has two goals: to refine listening skills, thus increasing the student's understanding and en-

joyment of music, while at the same time providing a survey of the major composers and musical

styles of the Western classical repertory to be encountered in concert halls today. Students will be

introduced to music from the Baroque, Classical, Romantic, and Modern periods, including works

by composers such as Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Brahms, Mahler, and Stravinsky. Genres to be

covered include the symphony, chamber music, opera, song, and choral music. Attendance at se-

lected concerts on campus required.

Evaluation based on two tests, two concert reports, and a final exam.

No prerequisites.

Enrollment limit: 40.

Hour: 10:00-10:50 MWF                                                              HIRSCH

MUS 103(F) Basic Music Theory and Musicianship

This course is designed for students with a strong instrumental or vocal background. Although

there is no prerequisite, students are expected to be proficient in reading at least one clef. Stu-

dents should take a placement exam during First Days.

Prepares the student for the study of common-practice harmony with a review of the fundamentals

of music theory and an introduction of triadic harmony through figured bass realization at the key-

board, composition of harmonic progressions, harmonization of melodies, and extensive eartrain-

ing exercises.

The first half of the course reviews the basic principles of pitch and rhythmic notation, key signa-

tures, modes, scales and intervals and triads, as well as the fundamentals of triadic harmony. The

remainder of the course emphasizes triadic progression through written assignments and figured

bass realization at the keyboard including inversions and some altered chords.

Sightsinging, sightreading, eartraining, and harmonic structural analysis are pursued concurrently

with keyboard and written theory. Students are required to attend a weekly skills lab and to develop,

outside of class, their vocal, aural, and keyboard competence through regular practice. Music soft-

ware may be used for some written assignments as well as eartraining drill. The software will be

available both on the network and in the Bernhard Music Technology Lab.

Format: three lectures and one eartraining skills lab per week. Evaluation will be based on assign-

ments, quizzes, and a final exam. All will have both written and aural components. Students with

previous theory training or Advanced Placement credit may be permitted to go directly into 104; see

department.

Enrollment limit: 15 in each section.

MUS 104(S) Music Theory and Musicianship I

This course is designed for potential majors and students with a strong instrumental or vocal back-

ground. Students are expected to have competence in reading all clefs and must have a working

knowledge of triadic harmony and figured bass realization. Students should take a placement exam

during First Days.

A study of common-practice harmony with emphasis on both keyboard and chorale style. The

course reviews triadic progression in keyboard style, introduces principles of chorale style and part

writing, non-chord tones, dominant seventh and other seventh chords, borrowed chords, and modu-

lation all through written assignments, figured bass realization at the keyboard, eartraining exer-

cises, and analysis of musical examples of the period.

Sightsinging, sightreading, eartraining, and dictation are pursued concurrently with keyboard and

written theory. Students are required to attend a weekly skills lab and to develop, outside of class,

their vocal, aural, and keyboard competence through regular practice. Music software will be used

MUS 115(F) Introduction to Twentieth-Century Music
Twentieth-century Euro-American art music involved a persistent exploration of the limits of musi-
cal possibility. Encounters with this music often challenge our ears and musical minds and require
us to reconsider fundamental conceptions of music itself. Throughout the course, we will investi-
gate in what ways the basic elements of music (e.g., harmonic organization, rhythm, timbre, instru-
mentation and performance conventions) were extended and revolutionized. Topics and styles to be
discussed include: atonality, expressionism, twelve-tone techniques, neoclassicism, electronic and
computer music, music theatre, stochastic music, minimalism, and neoromanticism. We will also
consider the music of this century in relation to contemporary developments in the other arts and to
popular musical styles. The syllabus will include works by such composers as Debussy, Mahler,
Stravinsky, Schoenberg, Webern, Bartók, Weill, Milhaud, Shostakovich, Ives, Copland, Babbitt,
Stockhausen, Messiaen, Boulez, Berio, Cage, Górecki, and Glass.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on two tests, two short papers, and a final ex-
am.

MUS 116(S) Music in Modernism+
The synthesis of the arts was a primary pursuit of modernist composers, artists, choreographers, and
writers. Seeking either to realize Wagner's "total work of art" in the theater, or to uncover the more
general correspondences celebrated by Baudelaire, modernists consistently looked beyond their
own media. Collaborations on works of "total theater" were common: Satie, Cocteau, Massine, Pi-
casso; Brecht, Hindemith, Weill; Stravinsky, Nijinsky, Bakst; Claudel, Honegger, Rubinstein.
Modernists explored new connections between music and color (Scriabin, Kandinsky), music and
literature (Joyce, Mann), and music and dance (Duncan, Graham). Occasionally, modernists at-

                                             ­ 243 ­
Music

tempted to unite the arts on their own: Schoenberg painted, Pound composed, and Kokoschka

wrote. Our focus will be on those works of music, art, dance, and literature that explored new rela-

tionships between the arts. One goal will be to investigate whether specific equivalents exist be-

tween techniques of modernist painting, poetics, choreography, and composition. Aware of the

risks and rewards of interdisciplinary study, we will attempt our own theories of artistic synthesis.

This course is designed to bring multiple perspectives to the study of music in modernism.

Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation based on three papers and class participation.

No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20.

MUS 117(F) Mozart

This course will examine the extraordinary life and musical genius of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.

Through guided listening, students will gain

appreciation of Mozart's classical compositional style and its timeless appeal. The class will ex-

plore Mozart's pivotal position as a musician in Viennese society; his strange combination of

bawdy behavior and sublime artistry; his relationship with his domineering father, as well as with

Haydn, Beethoven, and Salieri; and the myths about Mozart that have sprung up in the two centuries

since his death.

Evaluation based on class participation, listening quizzes, several short papers, and a final exam.

there is a "women's sound" in music, the representation of women in music by men, the gendered

understanding of musical forms, genres, and techniques, the historical spheres of women's music-

making, and the challenges faced by female musicians in various social contexts from the Middle

Ages to the present. The class will explore women's contributions to music as composers, perform-

ers, teachers, patrons, and scholars.

Evaluation based on class participation, two papers, a class presentation, and a final exam.

MUS 134(F) Music and Ritual

Throughout human history worldwide, music has been and continues to be recognized as a power-

ful medium enabling access to the spiritual, the divine, and the magical. This course will examine

the role music has played in the spiritual dimension of human existence over the past millennium,

focusing primarily but not exclusively on music within the Western Christian tradition. Listening

and reading assignments will explore such topics as music in medieval monasteries and convents,

rituals of worship in the age of cathedrals, Renaissance music for the cult of saints, Bach as theolo-

gian, the Romantic Requiem, and twentieth-century composers' search for the spiritual in an age

defined by world war and technological revolution. American topics may include Native American

music, Shape Note singing, African-American Gospel music, and the New Age music phenome-

non.

MUS 137(F) Great Conductors/Great Orchestras

An examination of the rise of the conductor in the nineteenth century and the growth of the orchestra

in the late-nineteenth and twentieth centuries with special attention to the role of the maestro in

building the musical organization and repertoire in Europe and in North America. Special attention

will be given to figures for whom we have major legacies of recorded and visual materials: Bern-

stein, Toscanini, Koussevitzky, Stokowski, Karajan, Solti, Szell, etc.; together with their respective

musical organizations and the rise and influence of the recording industry in the twentieth century.

Music covered will include both opera and the traditional symphonic repertoire of the nineteenth

and twentieth centuries. The role of the orchestra as the center of North-American musical life will

be examined historically together with the changed status due to a change of patronage now. Stu-

dents will be encouraged to work on a project of a particular orchestra and related conductors to

produce a research project reported both orally and in written form at semester's end.

No prerequisites. Students from the disciplines of the social sciences particularly welcome.

MUS 201(F), 202(S) Music Theory and Musicianship II

Music 201-202 presents the harmonic practices of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries (c.

1825-1950) through analysis, performance, dictation, and composition of characteristic examples

of "romantic" and "modern" harmony.

In Music 201 the development of chromatic harmony is presented from Beethoven through Debus-

sy and Mahler by means of analysis, composition, sightsinging, keyboard application and dictation.

In Music 202 the principles of twentieth-century harmony, from Schoenberg to Varese and the

"avant-garde," are presented by means of analysis, composition, sightsinging, performance ap-

plication and dictation.

To supplement the development of musical skills appropriate to the period, students are expected to

attend weekly skills labs in eartraining, sightsinging, and keyboard application, as well as to devel-

op, outside of class, their vocal, aural, and keyboard competence through regular practice of the

MUS 207(F) Music in History I: Antiquity--1750

This course explores 1000 years of music-making in Western European culture, beginning with the

philosophical and theoretical origins of that music in ancient Greece and extending to the life and

music of J.S. Bach. Topics covered will include how the sound of music changed over a millen-

nium; the different functions it served and how genres developed to serve these functions; the lives

of the men and women who composed, performed, and wrote about music; and how the changing

notation and theory of music related to its practice over the centuries. At the same time, the course

provides an introduction to the modern study of music history, sampling a broad range of recent

scholarship reflecting an array of critical approaches to the study of early music in our own day.

Format: three meetings per week. Field trip(s) may be required. Evaluation will be based on

quizzes, several papers, and a final project.

Required for Music majors. Open to qualified non-majors with the permission of the instructor.

Hour: 10:00-10:50 MWF                                                        BLOXAM

MUS 208(S) Music in History II: 1750-1900

A survey exploring the development of music in Western society from the Classical through the

Romantic and the turn into the twentieth century. Emphasis will be on the contextual study of works

by such composers as Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, Schumann, Berlioz, Wagner, and Richard

Strauss. Changing musical styles will be examined within the framework of the philosophy and aes-

thetics of the period, with special attention paid to the use and purpose of music and the role of the

musician in his or her society.

Evaluation will be based on class participation, written assignments, a midterm, and a final exam.

MUS 212(F) Jazz Theory and Improvisation I

The theory and application of basic techniques in jazz improvisation including blues forms, swing,

bebop, modally based composition, Afro-Cuban, etc. Appropriate for students with very little spe-

cific experience in jazz as well as more experienced students. Knowledge of all key signatures, ma-

jor/minor keys and modes, intervals, triads and basic seventh chords (including inversions) and

their functions within keys, and competence on an instrument is essential. Alternates between lec-

ture style exposition of theoretical topics and their specific applications in an informal perfor-

mance/rehearsal setting.

In addition to the development of skills, written work consists of assignments (e.g. harmonic analy-

sis and realization as well as exercise in transposition and transcription) and a final project (e.g.

transcription of a recorded solo or a composition).

Evaluation will be based on quizzes, a final exam, a final project and performance, as well as im-

provement as measured in weekly class performance and studios if appropriate. Cannot be taken

pass/fail.

Prerequisite: Music 103 or permission of the instructor. Music 104 strongly recommended. Enroll-

ment limit: 15.

MUS 213(S) Jazz Theory and Improvisation II

A continuation of Music 212, this course builds upon theoretical knowledge, performance and aural

skills developed previously. Students will deal with more complex theoretical and performance is-

sues, such as modal interchange and minor key harmony, use of symmetric scales, commonly-used

reharmonizations of the blues and "I Got Rhythm" chord progressions, and Coltrane's "Three Ton-

ic" harmonic system.

The format is the same as for Music 212, with two weekly meetings, alternating between theory and

performance sessions.

Requirements: two transcription projects and an original composition, as well as a midterm and fi-

nal exam and participation in a recital at the end of the semester.

Prerequisite: Music 212. Enrollment limit: 15.

MUS 214(F) Basic Conducting

This course will introduce and develop a broad range of skills associated with conducting. Primari-

ly focusing on score reading and baton technique, the course will include exercises in sightsinging,

keyboard skills, vocal/instrumental skills, musicological pursuits, rehearsal techniques, aural train-

ing, and organizational skills.

Weekly conducting and score reading assignments will form the core of the work load and larger

projects involving conducting existing ensembles (vocal and/or instrumental) will be the basis of

the midterm and final exams.

MUS 231(S) Nothing But the Blues*~

For the past 100 years, blues has been an important and influential form of African-American music

that has spread its influence far beyond Black Americans. This seminar examines the history and

evolution of the blues and asks several questions. What values and beliefs are implicit in or are ex-

pressed through the blues? How has the social experience of African-Americans affected blues mu-

sic? How has this music changed over time and in different places? Have these changes allowed this

music to speak to audiences? What have various forms of the blues meant to African-Americans, to

white Americans, to Europeans, Africans, and other peoples? Are there significant differences in

the ways in which men and women approach singing or playing the blues? What has been the im-

pact of the blues on other forms of music?

Evaluation will be based primarily on student presentations in class and essays.

Prerequisite: prior knowledge of, or course work in, music, African-American history, or African-

American culture. Enrollment limit: 10.

This seminar, the culminating course in the major, will focus on a classic subject of musical inquiry:
the relationship between music and language. Is music itself a language? Does joining words to
music impart power to the words or provide signification to the music? How should text be set to
music? These questions have intrigued composers, philosophers, and linguists throughout history
and across the globe. Our work in this seminar will involve both the analysis of specific vocal styles
and the critical interpretation of historical and contemporary theories of music and language. We

   Neuroscience is a rapidly growing interdisciplinary field concerned with understanding the rela-
tionship between brain, mind, and behavior. The interdisciplinary nature of the field is apparent
when surveying those who call themselves neuroscientists. Among these are anatomists, physiolo-
gists, chemists, psychologists, philosophers, computer scientists, linguists, and ethologists. The
areas that neuroscience addresses are equally diverse and range from physiological and molecular
studies of single neurons, to investigations of how systems of neurons produce phenomena such as
vision and movement, to the study of the neural basis of complex cognitive phenomena such as
memory, language, and consciousness. Applications of neuroscience research are rapidly growing
and include the development of drugs to treat neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's dis-
ease and Parkinson's disease, the development of noninvasive techniques for imaging the human
brain such as PET scans and MRI, and the development of methods for repair of the damaged hu-
man brain such as the use of brain explants. Combining this wide range of disciplines, areas of re-
search, and application for the study of a single remarkably complex organ--the brain--requires a
unique interdisciplinary approach. The Neuroscience Program is designed to provide students with
the opportunity to explore this approach.

THE PROGRAM

   The program in neuroscience consists of five courses including an introductory course, three
electives, and a senior course. In addition, students are required to take two courses, Biology 101
and Psychology 101, as part of the program.

   Introduction to Neuroscience (Neuroscience 201) is the basic course and provides the back-
ground for other neuroscience courses. Ideally, this will be taken before the end of sophomore year.
Either Biology 101 or Psychology 101 serves as the prerequisite. Electives are designed to provide
in-depth coverage including laboratory experience in specific areas of neuroscience. At least one
elective course is required in Biology (Group A) and one in Psychology (Group B). The third elec-
tive course may also come from Group A or Group B, or may be selected from other neuroscience
related courses upon approval of the advisory committee. Topics in Neuroscience (Neuroscience
401) is designed to provide an integrative culminating experience. Most students will take this
course in the senior year.

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN NEUROSCIENCE

   The degree with honors in Neuroscience provides students with the opportunity to undertake an
original research project under the supervision of one or more of the Neuroscience faculty. In addi-
tion to completing the requirements of the Neuroscience Program, candidates for an honors degree
must enroll in Neuroscience 493-W031-494 and write a thesis based on an original research project.
Presentation of a thesis, however, should not be interpreted as a guarantee of a degree with honors.
Students interested in pursuing a degree with honors should contact the Neuroscience Advisory
Committee in the spring of their junior year.

ture and function of the nervous system, basic neurophysiology, development, learning and

memory, sensory and motor systems, language, consciousness and clinical disorders such as

schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. The laboratory focuses on current

topics in neuroscience.

Format: lectures, three hours a week; laboratories every other week. Evaluation will be based upon

laboratory reports, a lab practical, two hour exams and a final exam.

Prerequisite: Psychology 101 or Biology 101. Open to first-year students who satisfy the prerequi-

site. Enrollment limit: 144 (expected: 100). Preference given to Biology and Psychology majors.

NSCI 401(S) Topics in Neuroscience

Neuroscientists explore the empirical and theoretical issues inherent in the study of brain and beha-

vior. The overall objective of this seminar is to create a culminating senior experience in which pre-

vious course work in specific areas in the Neuroscience Program can be brought to bear in a synthet-

ic, interdisciplinary approach to understanding complex problems. The specific goals for students

in this seminar are (1) to evaluate original research and critically examine the empirical evidence

for theoretical issues, and (2) to gain an experiential understanding of this discipline through group

work, oral presentations, and experimental design. Topics and instructional formats will vary

somewhat from year to year, but in all cases the course will emphasize an integrative approach in

which students will be asked to consider topics from a range of perspectives including molecular,

cellular, systems, behavioral and clinical neuroscience. Previous topics have included memory, au-

tism, depression, alcoholism, language development, and stress.

Format: student-led discussions and presentations, three hours a week. Evaluation will be based on

presentations, participation in class discussion, and a term paper.

Prerequisite: This course is open only to seniors in the Neuroscience program. Enrollment limit: 24

(expected: 16). Preference given to seniors in the neuroscience program.

This course is required of all senior students in the Neuroscience Program.

Hour: 1:10-3:50 W                                                            ZIMMERBERG

NSCI 493(F)-W031-494(S) Senior Thesis
Independent research for two semesters and a winter study under the guidance of one or more neu-
roscience faculty. After reviewing the literature in a specialized field of neuroscience, students de-
sign and conduct an original research project, the results of which are reported in a thesis. Senior
thesis work is supervised by the faculty participating in the program.

                             PERFORMANCE STUDIES

Advisory Faculty: Professors: BUCKY*, D. EDWARDS, EPPEL, HOPPIN***, OCKMAN*, DAR-
   ROW*, Coordinator. Associate Professor. CASSIDAY. Assistant Professors: BEAN, Coordina-
   tor, BURTON, S. HAMILTON, KAGAYA, L. JOHNSON, A. SHEPPARD. Lecturers: BROTH-

   Performance Studies provides an opportunity to inhabit a place where the making of artistic and
cultural meaning intersects with critical reflection on those processes. The cluster has as its primary
goal the bringing together of those students and faculty engaged in the creative arts, i.e., studio art,
creative writing, dance, film and video, music, and theater with those departments that reflect in
part on those activities, e.g., Anthropology and Sociology, Art History, Classics, foreign languages,
Comparative Literature,English, History, Music, Philosophy, Psychology, Religion and Theater.

   The cluster allows faculty and students to conduct intensive and focussed interdisciplinary stud-
ies in performance. The central ideas which performance studies confronts--action, body, frame,
representation, race, ethnicity, gender, politics, history and transcultural experience--circulate
within and through the subjects and fields upon which the cluster draws.

                                    ­ 251 ­
Performance Studies, Philosophy

   Students in Performance Studies are encouraged to do three things: 1) try different artistic media,
both in the curriculum and beyond; 2) move between the doing of art and performance and thinking
about that process; and 3) prepare a portfolio of their work in different media. The list of courses
below is divided between doing courses (practicums) and reflection/criticism courses. Voluntary
portfolios are entirely optional. What we suggest is that portfolios should draw on at least four pro-
jects or productions. They should show critical self-reflection on the creative processes, compari-
son of the artistic media employed and also demonstrate performance criticism on the work of
others. Preparation of the portfolio should normally begin in the second semester of the junior year.
It will be done under the supervision of a member of the advisory committee and will be presented
in the senior year to faculty and students interested in the cluster.

                                PHILOSOPHY (Div. II)

                                       Chair, Professor ALAN WHITE

Professors: SAWICKI*, WHITE. Associate Professor: GERRARD. Assistant Professors: CRUZ,
   DUDLEY, MLADENOVIC.

   To engage in philosophy is to ask a variety of questions about the world and our place in it. What
can we know? What should we do? What may we hope? What makes human beings human? These
questions, in various forms, and others like them are not inventions of philosophers; on the contrary,
they occur to most people simply as they live their lives. Many of us ask them as children, but later
either ignore them, or accept answers we can live with. Philosophers, however, seek to keep such
questions open, and to address them through reasoned discussion and argument, instead of accept-
ing answers to them based on opinion or prejudice.

   The program in philosophy is designed to aid students in thinking about these issues, by ac-
quainting them with influential work in the field, past and present, and by training them to grapple

                                                                                           Philosophy

with these issues themselves. The program emphasizes training in clear, critical thinking and in ef-
fective writing. Philosophy courses center around class discussions and the writing of interpretive
and critical essays.

MAJOR
   Philosophy is a discipline with a long and intricate history, a history that remains an integral part

of the discipline. In this way, it differs dramatically from the natural sciences: for example, although
no contemporary physicists or biologists embrace Aristotle's physics or biology, among philoso-
phers there continue to be champions of Aristotle's metaphysics and of his ethics. Because of the
richness and continuing importance of the history of philosophy, the program is designed to give
majors a historical background that will acquaint them with a wide variety of approaches in philo-
sophical issues, and will provide them with a basis for evaluating and contributing to contemporary
debates.

   A total of nine courses is required for the major in Philosophy. Students should begin with Philos-
ophy 101 and 102, in either order; both are required for the major. These courses provide introduc-
tions to historical figures and themes that continue to be influential in many contemporary discus-
sions in the two major areas of philosophical inquiry, i.e., practical inquiry into issues of ethics and
politics, and theoretical inquiry into issues of knowledge, belief, understanding, and reality. Fol-
lowing 101 and 102, students should take 201 and 202 again in either order; neither is required for
the major, but both are prerequisites for many upper-level courses and both are strongly recom-
mended for students who think they may be interested in pursuing graduate study in philosophy.
The final required course is the Senior Seminar, Philosophy 401.

   Following your completion of 201 and 202, you will have the background you need in order to
decide which four additional courses will, along with the Senior Seminar, best complete your major.
Members of the department will gladly advise you, but you will have discovered which areas, top-
ics, and figures are most important to you. Non-majors are invited to ask the chair for advice on
course selection.

   Students considering graduate study in philosophy are strongly urged to develop reading compe-
tence in German, French, or Greek before graduation.

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN PHILOSOPHY
   The degree with honors in Philosophy is awarded to the student who has demonstrated outstand-

ing achievement in a program of study that extends beyond the requirements of the major. The ex-
tension beyond major requirements may take the form either of independent work culminating in a
senior essay or thesis (the independent-study route) or of additional course work (the directed-
study route). Candidates must have GPAs of 3.6 or higher in their courses in philosophy, both at the
time of applying for candidacy and at the end of senior year. Juniors interested in pursuing honors
should so inform the Department Chair no later than mid-April.

   The independent-study route to honors requires the completion and defense of either a senior
essay produced in the fall semester plus winter study period (maximum 40 pages) or a year-long
senior thesis (maximum 75 pages). Plans for either essay or thesis (including a brief proposal and
bibliography, worked out in consultation with an advisor) must be submitted to the department in
April of the junior year. A recommendation for graduation with honors will be made on the basis of
the thoroughness, independence, and originality of the student's work.

   The directed-study route to honors required the completion of two courses in philosophy in addi-
tion to the nine required for the major. Candidates taking this route must also submit to the depart-
ment revised copies of two term papers (10 pages or longer) written for philosophy courses they
have taken; each student will be assigned an adviser to help guide the process of revision. A recom-
mendation for graduation with honors will be made on the basis of the scope of the student's course
work, the quality of the student's participation in Philosophy 401, and the thoroughness, indepen-
dence, and originality reflected in the submitted papers.

PHIL 101(F,S) Introduction to Moral and Political Philosophy+
Throughout the history of Western philosophy, there have been debates concerning how human be-
ings should live: What should we do both with our lives as wholes and in specific problematic situa-
tions? The debates have addressed us both as individuals and as members of political communities.
This course aims to aid us in responding to these debates, and in living our lives, on the basis of
reasoned conclusions rather than from unrecognized presuppositions. The course concentrates on
Plato's Republic, the most influential ethical and political text within Western philosophy, but we
assess the Republic in light of elaborations and criticisms that have developed over the past 2500
years, in works by Aristotle, Kant, and Mill.
Emphasis on class discussion and the writing of critical papers. Requirements: frequent short pa-
pers, totaling 20-30 pages. This course is writing-intensive.

PHIL 102(F,S) Introduction to Metaphysics and Epistemology+

Metaphysics and epistemology are the two core pursuits of theoretical philosophy (as opposed to

practical philosophy, the focus of Philosophy 101). Metaphysics is concerned with the ultimate

character of reality. The metaphysician seeks to develop knowledge (as opposed to mere opinion or

belief) of all things natural, human, and divine. She asks, for example: Are we free, or are our acts

determined? Is there a God? If so, what must God be like?

Epistemology is concerned with how we determine the difference between knowledge and mere

opinion. The epistemologist thus asks: What does it mean truly to know something? How can we

acquire such genuine knowledge? Answers to these epistemological questions are essential if we

are to have any confidence in the methods and results of our metaphysical investigations.

This course will emphasize the established historical classics that provide the basis for understand-

ing contemporary work on metaphysics and epistemological issues; we will consider, among oth-

ers, the work of Descartes, Hume, and Kant.

Emphasis on class discussion and the writing of critical papers. Requirements: frequent short pa-

pers, totaling 20-30 pages; this course is writing-intensive.

No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 25 per section (expected: 20-25 per section). Preference to first-

PHIL 103(S) Logic and Language

Logic is the study of reasoning and argument. More particularly, it concerns itself with the differ-

ence between good and bad reasoning, between strong and weak arguments. We all examine the

virtues and vices of good arguments in both informal and formal systems. The goals of this course

are to improve the critical thinking of the students, to introduce them to sentential and predicate

logic, to familiarize them with enough formal logic to enable them to read some of the great works

of philosophy that use formal logic (such as Wittgenstein's Tractatus), and to examine some of the

connections between logic and philosophy.

Requirements: a midterm, a final, frequent homework and problems sets.

This course is a prerequisite for Philosophy 109, Philosophy of Science.

Hour: 10:00-10:50 MWF                                                     GERRARD

PHIL 201(S) Continental Philosophy: From Hegel to Poststructuralism+

This course is designed to introduce students to the complicated history of post-Kantian philosophi-

cal thought in continental Europe. Figures to be considered may include Hegel, Marx, Kierkegaard,

Nietzsche, Husserl, Heidegger, Sartre, Habermas, Gadamer, Derrida, and Foucault; movements

discussed may include phenomenology, existentialism, hermeneutics, continental feminism, and

poststructuralism.

By introducing students to main currents and figures in the modern continental tradition, Philoso-

phy 201 will prepare them for more advanced courses drawing from this tradition; relevant courses

are offered in a variety of departments, including Anthropology and Sociology, English, Compara-

tive Literature, Philosophy, Political Science, and Religion.

Requirements: attendance, participation, and frequent short papers, totalling 20-30 pages.

No prerequisites, although Philosophy 102 (and/or 101), or relevant upper-division theory courses

in other departments, are highly recommended. Open to first-year students only with the permis-

sion of the instructors.

Hour: 9:55-11:10 TR                                                       DUDLEY and WHITE

PHIL 202(F) Analytic Philosophy--Language and Mind
This course is designed to introduce students to twentieth-century philosophy by focusing on two of
its premiere research areas, language and mind. Each of these topics has been studied independent-
ly of the other, with the philosophy of language dominating the first half of the century and the phi-
losophy of mind surging in the second half. Research on language and mind have also enjoyed a
fruitful liaison, as much of the technical apparatus of the philosophy of language has been used to
illuminate the mind. The other side of this coin is that language is something that minds achieve, and
some prominent theories of linguistic meaning have emphasized psychological elements of lan-
guage use. The course will begin with the work of Frege, Russell, and Wittgenstein, and end with
the work of Putnam, Dennett, Fodor and Churchland. The course is intended to prepare students for
more advanced research on either language or mind. At the same time, the course aims to offer an
overview of the methods and intellectual style of analytic philosophy. Thus, it will also serve as

preparation for advanced work in epistemology, philosophy of science, metaphysics, and ethics.

PHIL 208(F) The Philosophy of Education: Moral Autobiography+~

(Revised version of a course taught by the instructor in several years ago.)

In Plato's dialogue, Meno asks, "Can you tell me, Socrates, can virtue be taught?" We will investi-

gate Meno's question through such moral autobiographies as John Stuart Mill, Autobiography, Mo-

handas K. Gandhi, An Autobiography: The Story of My Experiments with Truth, Harriet A. Jacobs,

Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl, and Georges Dreyfus, The Sound of Two Hands Clapping: The

Education of a Tibetan Buddhist Monk.

We will begin the course by writing (and sharing with each other) our own (brief) moral autobiogra-

phies. During the semester, in light of the readings and class discussions, we will continually and

seriously revise our moral autobiographies, culminating in polished, longer final works. Thus, this

is a writing-intensive course, and all the writing (after the first week) will consist of revision.

Prerequisite: Philosophy 101 or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Pref-

erence given to sophomores.

(This course is part of the Critical Reasoning and Analytical Skills initiative.)

PHIL 250T(S) Conceptions of Human Nature

We are all human, and in our daily lives, we seem to know what we mean when we make that claim.
However, when we start reflecting on what it is to be human - whether all human beings, in spite of
individual and social differences, share the same nature, whether that nature is unchangeable,
whether it is animal, or divine, or neither, and whether anything follows from the way we naturally
are to the ways we should lead our lives, treat others and organize our societies--we can see that the

                                       ­ 255 ­
Philosophy

commonsensical assurance about there being an easily identifiable human nature in all of us gives

way to a myriad of questions and problems.

Conceptions of human nature--sometimes explicit, sometimes implicit--have shaped many philo-

sophical, scientific and religious views, in addition to providing grounds for many human practices,

such as law, arts, medicine and education. The aim of the course is to examine a variety of different

accounts of human nature, and a variety of consequences different thinkers have derived from their

accounts. We will read selected texts by Aristotle, Hobbes, Locke, Voltaire, Rousseau, Freud, Dar-

win, Skinner, and Sartre, as well as several contemporary philosophers and scientists. In each read-

ing, we will try to articulate what the favored conception of human nature consists in; what kind of

evidence is provided in its support; what are the consequences derived from it about human happi-

ness, the ways we should lead our lives, the manner in which we should treat others, and the ways in

which human societies should be organized; how are such norms derive from a descriptive account

of human nature, and whether such derivations can be justified. Finally, we will confront and evalu-

ate the two central assumptions which all of the different accounts share: that there is a universal

human nature, an "essence of humanity," and that an understanding of it is necessary for thinking

about morality, law, politics, human knowledge, and religion.

Course structure: For 10 weeks, the course will be conducted in a tutorial format, each pair of stu-

dents meeting with me for an hour a week. In the first and the last week of the semester, however, I

will organize a two-hour seminar for the whole class. Everyone interested in taking the course will

be seriously considered, irrespective of the official enrollment status. In order to be considered,

however, you must contact me no later than by December 1, 2001.

Requirements: class and tutorial attendance; six short papers, and six oral comments on your tutori-

al partner's papers.

Prerequisites: one course in philosophy, or permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 10 (ex-

pected: 10).

Hour: TBA                                                                      MLADENOVIC

PHIL 261(S) Fake: A Path into the Philosophy of Art (Same as INTR 261)

Suppose the Williams Record crack investigative reporters discovered that Michelangelo's Mona

Lisa has been destroyed, and the painting in the Louvre is actually a nineteenth-century forgery.

Should that change your aesthetic appreciation of the work? Ted Turner colorized Casablanca and

other classic black and white films. Did he destroy the artistic integrity of the films? Which is better:

a damaged Rembrandt, or one restored using twentieth-century materials? Suppose someone writes

his name on a ready-made object (such as a urinal) and displays it in a museum. Is it art? These and

more questions will be examined by working with philosophical literature, works of art, legal cases

(and perhaps an X-ray machine). This course will be taught in conjunction with an exhibition at the

Williams College Museum of Art: "But is it Real?" The students in this course will be responsible

for preparing the exhibition publications. Students will be required to attend an accompanying lec-

ture series sponsored by the course and WCMA.

Prerequisite: an eagerness to think deeply about what one sees. Enrollment limit: 50. (We will divide

into sections for hands-on work in the museum.)

PHIL 304(S) Aristotle

Hegel argues that Aristotle's central and invaluable insights into phenomena of life, growth, and

purpose were so thoroughly distorted by the influence of Christianity as to be essentially lost to the

Western intellectual tradition until his own time. Heidegger goes yet further, describing Aristotle as

"the last of the great philosophers who had eyes to see and ... the energy to force inquiry back to the

phenomena and to the seen and to mistrust from the ground up all wild and windy speculations, no

matter how close to the heart of common sense." In this class, we pursue the task of disclosing Aris-

totle's inquiry by focusing on Physics, Metaphysics, and On the Soul. The course will be conducted

as a seminar.

Required writing will involve short weekly or bi-weekly papers for the first eight weeks of the

course, and an extensive term paper.

Evaluation will be based on the required writing and on participation in discussion.

Prerequisite: Philosophy 102 or permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 15 (expected: 5-15).

Preference given to majors and prospective majors in Philosophy and Classics.

PHIL 308(S) Wittgenstein's Investigations

Bertrand Russell claimed that Ludwig Wittgenstein was "perhaps the most perfect example I have

ever known of genius as traditionally conceived--passionate, profound, intense, and dominating."

Wittgenstein's two masterpieces, the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus and the Philosophical Inves-

tigations, stand like opposing poles around which schools of twentieth-century analytic philosophy

revolve. The Wittgenstein of the Tractatus is known as the "earlier Wittgenstein," the Wittgenstein

of the Investigations is known as the "later Wittgenstein." This course is an intensive, line-by-line

study of the Investigations--one of the greatest (and thus, one of the most controversial) books in

the history of philosophy. Aside from its overwhelming influence on late-twentieth-century philos-

ophy and intellectual culture, any book which contains the remark, "if a lion could talk, we could

not understand him," deserves serious attention. Assigned secondary literature will include: Antho-

ny Kenny, Wittgenstein; Robert Fogelin, Wittgenstein; Oswald Hanfling, Wittgenstein's Later Phi-

losophy; and Ray Monk, Ludwig Wittgenstein: The Duty of Genius.

Requirements: one short midterm paper (5-7 pages) and one longer final paper (12-15 pages).

Prerequisite: Philosophy 102 required; Philosophy 202, 204, 206 or another course in analytic phi-

losophy highly recommended.

PHIL 309(S) Kant

This course will provide an intensive study of the philosophy of Immanuel Kant. Kant's transcen-

dental idealism is profoundly important: it constitutes a challenge to rationalist metaphysics, a re-

sponse to Hume's empiricist skepticism, and systematically integrates epistemology, ethics, and

aesthetics in a way that has shaped modern Western thought. It is also profoundly difficult: more

than 200 years after its development, there is still vehement disagreement not only over whether or

not Kant was right, but over what Kant actually said. In this course our goal will be to understand

Kant's philosophy as a systematic whole, in terms of the tight-knit relationships that bind all his

ideas into one comprehensive vision. We will attempt to understand what Kant said and why, how it

is important, and the extent to which it is right. We will read significant portions of all three of Kant's

most important works (the Critique of Pure Reason, Critique of Practical Reason, and Critique of

Judgment), and may occasionally make use of secondary literature.

Requirements: several short assignments; final paper of 12-15 pages.

Prerequisite: Philosophy 102. Expected enrollment: 5-15.

Hour: 1:10-2:25 MR                                                      DUDLEY

PHIL 316(F) Emotions

Philosophy is often described as "thinking about thinking"; variously conceived inquiries into the

nature, limits, and canons of human reasoning have always been at its heart. Without challenging

the centrality of such projects for philosophy, this course will focus on a less emphasized, but equal-

ly essential aspect of our lives: emotions. What are emotions, and how should we think about them?

What is the proper "geography"--classification and analysis--of our emotions, and what is their

relation to our beliefs, judgments, and evaluations? Which methodological approach--if a single

one can be thus privileged--should we adopt for examining emotions? Finally, what is the scope

and nature of an adequate theory of emotions, what are the desiderata for such a theory, and what

should count as evidence in its favor? We will examine a variety of philosophical and scientific

(psychological and biological) theories of emotion, as well as some more recent theories developed

within history, sociology and anthropology.

Requirements: four short (2-3 pages) and two longer (5 pages) papers, class presentation and class

participation.

Prerequisites: Philosophy 102 and one 200 or 300 level philosophy course. Enrollment limit: 20

(See under Religion for full description.)

PHIL 360T(F) Aesthetics

In this tutorial we will explore questions concerning the nature of art. For example, what does it

mean for art to be beautiful? Should all art strive for beauty, or is there a place and purpose for ugly

art? Is art merely entertainment, or does it reveal truth? If the latter, what sort of truth does it reveal

(philosophical, religious, political) and how? If it is entertainment, is it a special sort of entertain-

ment--"elevating" us, say, or "purging" us of dangerous desires--or simply one kind of fun among

others? How you answer these questions may affect how you answer some political ones: Should

the state underwrite the arts? Should it censor them? What sort of artworks should be politically

encouraged or discouraged, if any?

We will approach these issues through an exploration of some of the most important and influential

philosophical positions on art found in the Western intellectual tradition. We will also consider how

these positions illuminate particular artworks, and how they bear on current political controversies

related to art (such as whether the National Endowment for the Arts should continue to exist and, if

so, what role it should play; and whether politicians should have a say regarding the artworks that

are to be displayed in museums that receive public funding).

Authors to be read may include Plato, Aristotle, Lessing, Kant, Schiller, Hegel, and Heidegger.

Format: tutorial. Requirements: Students will meet weekly in pairs, and will alternate between pre-

senting a paper and offering a critique of the paper presented by their partner.

Prerequisite: Philosophy 101 or 102 or 201 or permission of the instructor.

Hour: TBA                                                                         DUDLEY

PHIL 401(F) Senior Seminar: Concepts

As the capstone seminar, this course is required of all senior majors. For 2001-2002, the seminar

will focus on philosophical treatments of concepts. Concepts have been at the center of historical

debates in mind, language, epistemology, metaphysics and psychology. In contemporary philoso-

phy, positions span a spectrum of views from treating concepts as metaphysically real and known a

priori to maintaining that concepts are merely empirically acquired cognitive structures of catego-

rization. We will investigate this active controversy.

Students will take active roles in leading discussions. Requirements: weekly writing assignments

and a final paper.

Prerequisite: senior major status (or, in extraordinary cases, permission of instructor). Expected en-

rollment: 7.

Hour: 1:10-3:50 W                                                                 CRUZ

   The instructional Physical Education Program at Williams is an integral part of the students total educa-
tional experience. As a part of the liberal arts concept, the program develops the mind body relationship,
which is dependent upon the proper integration of physical and intellectual capacities. The main objective
of the physical education program is to develop in each student an appreciation of physical fitness and
wellness, and to expose them to a variety of activities that are suitable for lifetime participation.

   Four credits of Physical Education represents one of the requirements for the College degree. There
are five physical education units during the year. In the fall academic semester, there are two six-week
physical education quarters. Winter Study is another unit, and there are two physical education quar-
ters in the spring academic semester.

   What is light? How does a transistor work? What is a proton made of? Why are metals shiny?
Why is glass transparent? There are people for whom questions like these are of more than passing
interest; some of them become physics majors. A physics student experiments with the phenomena
by which the physical world is known and explores the mathematical techniques and theories that
make sense of it. The major serves as preparation for further work in pure or applied physics, other
sciences, engineering, medical research, science teaching and writing, and other careers involving
insight into the fundamental principles of nature.

   In addition to the physics major, the Physics Department also offers a major in astrophysics, in
cooperation with the Astronomy Department. That major is described elsewhere in the Bulletin.

MAJOR

Introductory courses
   Students considering a major in physics should take both physics and mathematics as first-year

students. A student normally begins with either Physics 131 or Physics 141:
   1) Physics 131 Particles and Waves. This is designed as a first course in physics. It is suitable for

students who either have not had physics before or have had some physics but are not comfortable
solving "word problems" that require calculus.

   2) Physics 141 Particles and Waves--Enriched. Students in this course should have solid back-
grounds in science and calculus, either from high school or college, including at least a year of high
school physics.

   The Department of Mathematics will place students in the appropriate introductory calculus course. The
physics major sequence courses all make use of calculus at increasingly sophisticated levels. Therefore,
students considering a Physics major should continue their mathematical preparation without interruption
through the introductory calculus sequence (Mathematics 103, 104, and 105). Students are encouraged to
take Physics 210 as early as possible. Physics 210 is cross listed as Mathematics 210 for the benefit of those
students who wish to have the course listed with a MATH prefix.

Physics

Advanced Placement
   Students with unusually strong backgrounds in calculus and physics may place out of Physics

141 and begin with Physics 142 in the spring. On rare occasions a student with an exceptional back-
ground will be offered the option of enrolling in Physics 201.

   Placement is based on AP scores, consultation with the department, and results of a placement
exam administered during First Days. The exam can also be taken later in the year by arrangement
with the department chair. The exam covers classical mechanics, basic wave phenomena, and in-
cludes some use of calculus techniques.

Requirements for the Major
A total of ten courses in physics and mathematics are required to complete the Physics major.
Students who place out of both Physics 141 and Physics 142 and begin their studies in Physics
201 are required to take a total of nine courses.

Required Physics Sequence Courses
   Physics 141 Particles and Waves--Enriched
      or Physics 131 Particles and Waves
   Physics 142 Physics Today
   Physics 201 Electricity and Magnetism
   Physics 202 Waves and Optics
   Physics 210 Mathematical Methods for Scientists
   Physics 301 Introductory Quantum Physics
   Physics 302 Statistical Physics

Required Mathematics Course
   Mathematics 105 Multivariable Calculus

   Students entering with Advanced Placement in mathematics may obtain credit toward the major
for the equivalent Mathematics 105 taken elsewhere.

Electives
   At least two more physics or other approved courses must be taken, bringing the total number of

courses for the major to ten. The following provisions apply to these elective courses:
   1) Mathematics 104 may be counted if taken at Williams
   2) Mathematics 209 may substitute for Physics 210.
   3) Astronomy 111 may count in place of Physics 141 if a student places out of 141 (see below).
   4) An additional Astronomy or Astrophysics course above the introductory level that is acceptable for
      the astrophysics major may be counted.
   5) Two approved Division III courses above the introductory level may be substituted for one Physics
      course. Approval is on an individual basis at the discretion of the department chair.

Preparation for Advanced Study
   Students who may wish to do graduate work in physics or engineering should elect courses in

both physics and mathematics beyond the minimum major requirements. The first-year graduate
school curriculum in physics usually includes courses in quantum mechanics, electromagnetic
theory, and classical mechanics that presuppose intermediate level study of these subjects as an un-
dergraduate. Therefore, students planning graduate work in physics should elect all of the follow-
ing courses:

   Physics 402T Applications of Quantum Mechanics
   Physics 405T Electromagnetic Theory
   Physics 411T Classical Mechanics

Advising
   Both majors and non-majors are encouraged to consult with the department chair or course

instructors about course selections or other matters.

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN PHYSICS
   The degree with honors in Physics will be awarded on the basis of a senior thesis presenting the

results of a substantial experimental or theoretical investigation carried out under the direction of a
faculty member in the department. There is no rigid grade point average required for admission to
the program or for the awarding of the degree with honors, but it is normally expected that honors
students will maintain at least a B average in physics and mathematics. Students will normally ap-
ply for admission to the program early in the spring of their junior year and during senior year these
students will normally elect Physics 493, W031, and 494 in addition to the usual requirements for
the major. At the end of winter study, the department will decide whether the student will be ad-
mitted to honors candidacy. Both a written thesis and a colloquium presentation of the results are

                                                ­ 260 ­

required. The degree with honors will be awarded to those who meet these requirements with dis-
tinction. The degree with highest honors will be awarded to those who fulfill them with unusually
high distinction.

   Honors candidates will also be required to participate in departmental colloquium talks.

OPTIONS FOR NON-MAJORS

   Many students want to take a self-contained and rigorous full-year survey of physics. For such
students, the most appropriate sequence will be either Physics 131 or Physics 141 followed by
Physics 132, depending on the student's background in science and mathematics (see Introductory
Courses above). Either of these sequences satisfies the physics requirement for medical school.

   The department also offers less quantitative or more specialized courses for non-majors. This
year there are two such offerings: Physics 100 and Physics 109.

PHYS 100(S) Physics of Everyday Life

How do things work? What makes a car go or a bird fly? Why do microwaves heat food? How does a

CD player work? Why are diamonds hard and metals shiny? How do we see?

Science is all around us. From common objects to high technology, science is part of our everyday

lives. Amazingly, with a few powerful principles we can understand the materials that make up our

world and the rules that govern their behavior--that's physics.

In this course we will explore the world we know and the microscopic components from which it is

made, and we will extract from this exploration the central concepts underpinning contemporary

physics. The mathematics used in the course will be basic algebra and trigonometry.

Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based on weekly homework, a midterm, a project, and a final

exam.

No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 120 (expected: 75).

Hour: 1:10-2:25 TF                                                                   WHITAKER

PHYS 109(F) Sound, Light, and Perception
Light and sound allow us to perceive the world around us, from appreciating music and art to learning the
details of atomic structure. Because of their importance in human experience, light and sound have long
been the subject of scientific inquiry. How are sound and light related? How do physiology and neural
processing allow us to hear and see the world around us? What are the origins of color and musical pitch?
This course introduces the science and technology of light and sound to students not majoring in physics.
We will start with the origins of sound and light as wave phenomena, and go on to topics including color,
the optics of vision, the meaning of musical pitch and tone, and the physical basis of hearing. We will also
discuss some recent technological applications of light, such as lasers and optical communications.
The class will meet for two 75-minute periods each week, including some lectures and some conference
sections, in which small groups of students work together on hands-on, interactive experiments. A detailed
week-by-week schedule of activities will be presented at the beginning of the semester.
Format: mixed lecture/lab/discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, periodic homework,
one in-class exam, a short oral presentation, and a final exam.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 50 (expected: 40, 20 per section).

Hour: 11:20-12:35 TR   Conferences: 9:55-11:10 R, 11:20-12:35 R, 1:10-2:35 R S. BOLTON

PHYS 131(F) Particles and Waves

We focus first on the Newtonian mechanics of point particles: the relationship between velocity,

acceleration, and position; the puzzle of circular motion; forces; Newton's laws; energy and mo-

mentum; and gravitation. The historical context in which these ideas developed will be discussed.

We then turn to the basic properties of waves, such as interference and polarization, with emphasis

on light waves. Finally, we bring the two strands together with a brief discussion of the wave-par-

ticle duality of modern quantum mechanics.

This course is intended for students who have not studied physics before or who have had some

physics, but are not comfortable solving "word problems" that require calculus. (Students with

strong backgrounds in the sciences are encouraged to consider taking Physics 141 instead.) Physics

131 can lead to either Physics 132 (for students wanting a one-year survey of physics) or Physics

142 (for students considering a physics major).

Format: lectures, three hours a week; laboratory, three hours every other week. Evaluation will be

based on problem sets, hour tests, labs, and a final exam.

Corequisite: Mathematics 103. No enrollment limit (24/lab section); expected: 60.

Hour: 11:00-11:50 MWF  Labs: 1-4 M, T, W                                             S. BOLTON

PHYS 132(S) Electromagnetism and the Physics of Matter
This course is intended as the second half of a one-year survey of physics. In the first half of the

semester we will focus on electromagnetic phenomena. We will introduce the concept of electric

                                      ­ 261 ­
Physics

and magnetic fields, and study in detail the way in which electrical circuits and circuit elements

work. The deep connection between electric and magnetic phenomena is highlighted in a discus-

sion of Faraday's Law of Induction. In the second half of the semester, we introduce several of the

most central topics in twentieth-century physics. We will discuss Einstein's theory of special rela-

tivity as well as aspects of quantum theory. We will end with a treatment of nuclear physics, radioac-

tivity, and uses of radiation.

Format: lectures, three hours a week; laboratory, three hours every other week. Evaluation will be

based on problem sets, labs, hour tests, and a final exam.

Prerequisite: Physics 131 or 141 or permission of the instructor, and Mathematics 103. No enroll-

ment limit (24/lab section); expected: 60.

PHYS 141(F) Particles and Waves--Enriched

This course covers the same topics as Physics 131, but with a higher level of mathematical sophis-

tication and more emphasis on waves. It is intended for students with solid backgrounds in the

sciences, either from high school or college, who feel comfortable solving "word problems" that

require calculus. Physics 141 can lead to either Physics 132 (for students wanting a one-year survey

of physics) or Physics 142 (for students considering a physics major).

Format: lectures, three hours a week; laboratory, three hours every other week. Evaluation will be

based on problem sets, hour tests, labs, and a final exam.

PHYS 142(S) Physics Today

The twentieth century has been an extremely productive and exciting time for physics. Special rela-

tivity has extended physics into the realm of high speeds and high energies. Quantum mechanics

has successfully described phenomena at small energies and small distance scales. Our understand-

ing of atoms, molecules, and solids has developed from a few revolutionary ideas into a sophisti-

cated framework which today supports technologies that were unimagined in 1900.

This course will introduce many important developments in physics, including special relativity,

the Bohr model of the atom, Schrodinger's wave mechanics in one dimension, the chemical bond,

energy bands in solids, and nuclear physics.

Format: lectures, three hours a week; laboratories, three hours every other week.

Evaluation will be based on problem sets, laboratory participation, two hour tests, and a final exam.

Prerequisites: Physics 141 and Mathematics 103, or equivalent. Physics 131 may substitute for

Physics 141 with the permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: none (24/lab section); ex-

pected: 50.

PHYS 201(F) Electricity and Magnetism

In this course, we study electromagnetic phenomena and their mathematical description. Topics

include electromagnetic induction, alternating circuits, and the electromagnetic properties of mat-

ter. We also introduce Maxwell's equations, which express in remarkably succinct form the essence

of the theory.

Format: lecture/discussion, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours per week; weekly prob-

lem sets. Evaluation will be based on problem sets, lab work, hour tests, and a final.

Prerequisite: Physics 142. Corequisite: Mathematics 105. No enrollment limit (16/lab section); ex-

pected: 25.

PHYS 202(S) Waves and Optics
Wave motions are characteristic of almost every type of material, including strings, springs, water,
and solids. They also describe the behavior of electromagnetic fields and elemental matter. Despite
these diverse settings waves exhibit many common characteristics, so that the understanding of a
few simple systems can provide insight into a wide array of phenomena. In this course we begin
with the study of oscillations of simple systems with only a few degrees of freedom. We then move
on to study transverse and longitudinal waves in continuous media in order to gain a general de-
scription of wave behavior. The rest of the course focuses on electromagnetic waves, and in particu-
lar on optical examples of wave phenomena. In addition to well known optical effects such as inter-
ference and diffraction, we will study a number of modern applications of optics such as short pulse
lasers and optical communications. Throughout the course mathematical methods useful for high-
er-level physics will be introduced.
Format: lectures/discussions, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours per week.
Evaluation will be based on problem sets, lab work, a midterm, and a final exam.

PHYS 210(S) Mathematical Methods for Scientists (Same as Mathematics 210)

This course covers a variety of mathematical methods used in the sciences, focusing particularly on

the solution of ordinary and partial differential equations. In addition to calling attention to certain

special equations that arise frequently in the study of waves and diffusion, we develop general tech-

niques such as looking for series solutions and, in the case of nonlinear equations, using phase por-

traits and linearizing around fixed points. We study numerical techniques applied not only to differ-

ential equations, but also to ordinary integration and curve fitting, and we discuss the estimation of

error in numerical calculations. It is expected that most students in the class will be familiar with a

programming language and able to do homework assignments requiring simple programming;

however, we will offer a series of optional sessions on programming in TrueBasic for students who

do not have this background.

Format: lectures, three hours a week. Evaluation will be based on weekly homework, a midterm

exam and a final exam.

Prerequisites: Mathematics 105 and familiarity with Newtonian mechanics at the level of Physics

131. No enrollment limit (expected: 20).

PHYS 301(F) Introductory Quantum Physics

This course serves as a one-semester introduction to the history, formalism, and phenomenology of

quantum mechanics. We begin with a discussion of the historical origins of the quantum theory, and

the Schroedinger wave equation. The concepts of matter waves and wave-packets are introduced.

Solutions to one-dimensional problems will be treated prior to introducing the system which serves

as a hallmark of the success of quantum theory, the three-dimensional hydrogen atom. In the second

half of the course, we will develop the important connection between the underlying mathematical

formalism and the physical predictions of the quantum theory. We then go on to apply this knowl-

edge to several important problems within the realm of atomic and nuclear physics.

Format: lectures/discussion, three hours per week; problem sets; laboratory, three hours per week.

Evaluation will be based on problem sets, lab reports, a midterm exam, and final exam.

PHYS 302(S) Statistical Physics

In an information age where a primary challenge is to extract insight and meaning from mountains

of data statistical physics is an essential tool. The natural world is built with many small compo-

nents interacting in a simple but coordinated way. With a probabilistic view, we may make sense of

the cooperative phenomena which emerge.

We can associate thermodynamic free energies with microscopic states. With calculations and sim-

ple numerical exercises we shall probe a wide variety of physical phenomena: magnetism, gasses,

heat engines, thermal radiation, electrons in solids, polymers, random walks in fluids or in the stock

market, and genomic information.

Format: lecture/discussion, three hours per week.

Evaluation will be based on weekly problem sets, quizzes, and a final exam.

Prerequisites: Physics 142, Physics 210. No enrollment limit (expected: 15).

PHYS 318(F) Materials Science: The Chemistry and Physics of Materials (Same as Chemistry

Materials Science is a broad study of the physical properties of substances, such as hardness, elas-
ticity, electrical conductivity, and optical properties. This course investigates the relationship be-
tween microscopic structure and macroscopic properties of polymers (plastics, elastomers, liquid
crystals), electronic materials (semiconductors, conducting polymers, and superconductors) and
solids (metals, magnets, ceramics, minerals, and glasses). We approach these topics from both
physical and chemical perspectives, reflecting the interdisciplinary nature of the field. For instance,
we explore how the underlying structure of materials arises from quantum mechanics and how tem-
perature determines collective response properties such as elasticity or conductivity. This course

   The Political Economy major is designed to give students a grasp of the ways in which political and
economic forces interact in the shaping of public policy. The major includes substantial study of the central
analytical approaches in both political science and economics and seeks to surmount the sometimes artifi-
cial barriers of specialization that may characterize either discipline taken by itself. In the junior and senior
years a conscious merging of the approaches in the two fields is undertaken in the three required Political
Economy courses. (These courses are designed by, and usually are taught jointly by, political scientists and
economists.) Political Economy 301 examines major writings in political economy and analyzes economic
liberalism and critiques of economic liberalism in the context of current policy issues. Political Economy
401 examines interactions of political and economic forces in contemporary international affairs. Political
Economy 402 examines such interactions in selected current public policy issues. Background for these
senior courses is acquired through courses in international economics, public finance, and domestic and
international/comparative politics and policy.

   Students in Political Economy 402 visit Washington, D.C. Sunday night through Wednesday of
the first week of spring vacation to conduct interviews relating to their Political Economy 402
group projects. This is a course requirement.

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN POLITICAL ECONOMY
   Due to the special demands of this interdisciplinary major, the only route to honors in Political

Economy is the thesis. Seniors may pursue the honors thesis course (Political Economy 493-W031)
during the fall semester and winter study period. The third course contributing to such an honors
program would normally be an elective in Political Science, Economics, or Political Economy, tak-

                                                ­ 265 ­
Political Economy

en during the junior year. This course, which may be one of the required electives, must be closely
related, indeed must prepare the ground for the honors thesis.

   Juniors in the Political Economy major with at least a 3.5 GPA in the program may apply for the
honors thesis program by means of a written proposal submitted to the chair before spring registra-
tion. Written guidelines for such proposals are available in the chair's office. The proposal should
have been discussed with at least two faculty members, and at least one faculty advisor from each
discipline should be solicited by the student prior to submission of the proposal.

   Final decisions about admission to the honors program will be made in early summer, when
spring grades become available.

   To achieve the degree with honors in Political Economy, the thesis must be completed by the end
of winter study period and be judged of honors quality by a committee consisting of the two advi-
sors and a third reader. A thesis judged to be of particular distinction will qualify its author for the
degree with highest honors.

COURSE NUMBERING SYSTEM
   The numbering system for courses offered and required in Political Economy is identical to the

system outlined in the Williams College Bulletin on page 43.

POEC 301(F) Analytical Views of Political Economy (Same as Economics 301 and Political

Science 333)

This course explores the relationship between politics and economics by surveying influential

works of political economy. Its first part examines three major systems of thought in relation to the

historical development of capitalism in Western Europe: the classical liberalism of Adam Smith,

Karl Marx's revolutionary socialism, and the reformist ideas of John Stuart Mill, R. H. Tawney, and

John Maynard Keynes. The second part considers more recent writings that revise and critique lib-

eralism from a variety of perspectives. The historical focus of the course permits you to appreciate

the ongoing dialogue between classical and contemporary views of political economy, while class-

room discussion involves frequent reference to current public policy issues. Required in the Politi-

cal Economy major but open to non-majors.

Format: discussion/lecture. Requirements: eight 2-page papers and a final exam.

Prerequisites: one course in Economics and either Political Science 201 or 203 or AP credit in

American Politics (or permission of the instructor). Enrollment limit: 35 (expected: 32). Preference

given to Political Economy majors and sophomores intending a Political Economy major.

Hour: 1:10-2:25 MR                                                                       MAHON

POEC 397(F), 398(S) Independent Study
Open to juniors or seniors majoring in Political Economy, with approval of a faculty supervisor and

the chair.

POEC 401(F) Politics of the International Economy

This course examines major issues in the politics of the international economy. After briefly con-

sidering various theoretical perspectives on international political economy, it analyzes important

issue-areas including: trade; capital movements; the organization of production; immigration; and

the role of international organizations in addressing global economic and ecological issues.

Format: discussion/lecture/seminar. Requirements: several short papers, a group project, and a fi-

nal exam. In addition, class attendance and participation are essential.

Prerequisites: a course in international economics or Economics 110-120, or the equivalent; satis-

faction of the international/comparative Political Science course requirement (see list of major re-

quirements above) prior to or concurrently with this course. Enrollment limit: 20 (expected: 10-20).

Preference given to Political Economy majors.

Required in the major but open to non-majors.

Hour: 1:10-2:25 TF                                                        CONNING and PAUL

POEC 402(S) Political Economy of Public Policy Issues

The core of this course consists of analyses by student study groups of current issues of public policy. The

student groups investigate the interacting political and economic aspects of an issue, do extensive reading,

conduct interviews in Washington (during spring recess) with public and private officials, write a major

report on their findings and recommendations, and defend it orally in a public session.

Format: seminar with student presentations.

Prerequisites: Economics 253 or 255; satisfaction of the Political Science U.S. institutions and policymak-

ing course requirement (see list of major requirements above).

Required in the major and open only to Political Economy majors.

   Politics is most fundamentally about community--it is how we manage to live together and craft
a common destiny. Communities, however, need power, and political science therefore attends to
the ways power is grasped, maintained, challenged, or justified. The contest over power gives poli-
tics its drama and pathos. Since power may be used wisely or foolishly, rightly or cruelly, politics
affects our lives most profoundly. No matter whether we find it distasteful, inspiring, appalling or
alluring, politics is for high stakes. For this reason, the effort to understand politics aims not only to
describe and explain, but also to improve political life.

   The Political Science major is structured to allow students either to participate in the established
ways of studying politics or to develop their own foci. To this end, the department offers two routes
to completing our major, both requiring nine (9) courses. On the one hand, we invite students to
organize their major through the subfields that structure the discipline of political science (Ameri-
can politics, international relations, political philosophy, and comparative politics). On the other,
we encourage students to develop individual concentrations reflecting their particular interests re-
gardless of subfields.

MAJOR
   SUBFIELD CONCENTRATION ROUTE: Upon declaring a major, students choose a subfield

from American politics, international relations, political theory, and comparative politics. The sub-
field concentration draws at least four (4) of the nine courses from one subfield, and includes the
appropriate core course from 201-204, two electives at the 200 or 300 level of the student's choice
and the senior seminar (or an individual project) in the student's subfield. (A degree with honors in
Political Science requires one (1) or two (2) additional courses which DO NOT count toward the
nine (9) major requirements.) With permission of the department chair, students may take a senior
seminar in a different subfield, providing the student takes a third elective in the subfield of con-
centration. In addition, students must take courses in two subfields outside the subfield of con-
centration to satisfy the breadth requirement (all courses at the 100 level and all methods courses
also count toward the breadth requirement).

   INDIVIDUAL CONCENTRATION ROUTE: Alternatively, students may devise a concentration
of their own. In this event, the student prepares a curricular plan in consultation with a faculty advi-
sor, explaining the nature of the concentration and the courses the student will take. The individual
concentration also requires nine (9) courses, with at least five (5) thematically linked courses
constituting the concentration. Of these five courses, four are electives at the 200 or 300 level, in-
cluding one from 201-204, and one is a senior seminar or individual project. In addition, students
pursuing an individual concentration must take at least two other courses that illustrate breadth in
political science. To complete the requirement, the student has his or her choice of any two other
courses within the Political Science Department. The faculty advisor and the department chair must
approve the student plan.

ADVISEMENT
   When a student chooses to major in Political Science (usually at the end of the sophomore year),

he or she may register with any Political Science faculty member at the designated time and places.
The registering faculty member will ask for preferences for a permanent faculty advisor and will
assist undecided students in finding an advisor whose interests match theirs. In all cases students
will be paired by the end of their sophomore year with an advisor who will continue with them
through graduation.

COURSE NUMBERING
   The course numbering used by the Political Science Department reflects the format and special-

ization of a course more than its level of difficulty. The 100-level courses are designed to address
questions of broad political interest. The courses are pitched both to those considering and not con-
sidering political science as a major. The 200-level courses are divided between our core courses
and our electives. The core courses, numbered between 201-204, serve as introductions both to the
substance of the politics and the subfields organizing the study of politics. The core courses, which
were previously numbered at the 100 level, are open to all students, including first-year students
and non-majors. The 200-level elective courses provide general overviews of political processes,

                                                ­ 267 ­
Political Science

problems and philosophies in a way generally accessible without prerequisites. 300-level courses
are more specialized and usually require prerequisites. 400-level courses are senior seminars of-
fered for students in the major; senior seminars also are open to juniors and to non-majors.

WINTER STUDY PROJECT
   The department welcomes relevant WSP 99 proposals that can make important contributions to

the student's understanding of public affairs and politics. Majors, seniors, and students without pre-
vious WSP 99 experience have preference.

THE JUNIOR YEAR ABROAD
   A major in Political Science can be readily and usefully combined with study in a foreign coun-

try. Normally, no more than two semester courses taken abroad in a program approved by the Col-
lege may be counted toward the requirements for a degree in Political Science.

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE
   The Political Science Department grants honors to candidates who, (1) complete the Senior

Seminar, (2) receive at least a grade of 3.50 on either a Senior Essay (491-W030 or W030-492:
Honors Route One) or a Senior thesis (493-W031-494: Honors Route Two), and (3) have a mini-
mum GPA of 3.4 in Political Science.

   To become a candidate for honors, (1) the student must apply in the second semester of junior
year, (2) the research proposal must be acceptable to the department's honors committee, and (3)
the applicant's GPA in Political Science courses for the first six semesters must be at least 3.4. (A
degree with honors in Political Science requires one (1) or two (2)additional courses which DO
NOT count toward the nine (9) major requirements.)

ADVANCED STUDY IN AMERICAN POLITICS

   The Department of Political Science provides the opportunity for an unusually gifted student to
engage in an entire year's advanced research in American politics under singularly favorable condi-
tions. Supported by income derived from an endowment fund, the student, designated the Sentinels
of the Republic Scholar (after the name of the fund), receives a substantial research stipend to cover
costs associated with the proposed project.

   This unique research course (Political Science 481-W033-482) is designed to encourage the pur-
suit of excellence among the most talented Williams students of Political Science. Admission to it is
awarded to the most distinguished candidate on the basis of demonstrated capacity for outstanding
work and of the project's promise for creative contributions to the understanding of American poli-
tics, political institutions and thought.

PSCI 100(F) (Section 01) Asia and the World (Same as Asian Studies 201)*

Asia looms large in contemporary world politics: Japan is gradually assuming an expanded region-

al national security role; The People's Republic of China is emerging as a multifaceted Great Pow-

er; India is challenged by rising ethno-nationalism; and Indonesia is wracked by the economic dis-

locations of the 1997 financial crisis. This course will explore both the historical background and

current dynamics of political and economic issues in these four countries, drawing on themes of

imperialism, nationalism, and globalization.

Format: lecture. Requirements: two short papers and a final exam.

No prerequisites. It is an introductory class and, therefore, no prior coursework in Political Science

or Asian studies is necessary. Enrollment limit: 60.

PSCI 101(S) (Section 03) Small is Beautiful: The Greens and Globalization

While best known for their environmental politics, Greens are interested in considerably more than

just dolphin-safe tuna and renewable energy. Their political agenda includes reorienting global

trade, reducing the power of transnational corporations, even advancing alternative models for the

organization of the international system. Greens in Europe, North America and around the world

are offering an increasingly distinctive critique of globalization rooted not so much in the evils of

capitalism as in the size of human institutions. In short, they contend that the destruction of not only

the natural environment but of political democracy and even human society is an outgrowth of the

largeness of our states and our economies. This course examines contemporary global trends--in-

cluding expanding international trade and investment, the growth of international political author-

ity, the industrialization of food production, global climate change--from a Green perspective and

critically engages the fundamental Green strategy of subsidiarity and localization. We will read

some classic texts of Green decentralist thinking (including Leopold Kohr's The Overdeveloped

Nations and E.F. Schumacher's Small is Beautiful), assess what globalization is, evaluate the Green

critique of it, study the successes (and failures) of Green parties in Europe, and debate the feasibility

of Green alternatives to the liberal new world order.

Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: three short papers, final exam, class participation.

PSCI 101(F) (Section 04) Activism+

Acting up politically gets people in trouble, but it also gets things done. When the people and the

issue they attack stretch across national borders, the consequence is not only to affect the way gov-

ernments deal with a problem, but also to reorient patterns of political interest, fellow feeling,

knowledge, and value from state-centered to transnational networks: international activists create

new institutions as they avoid old ones. Yet activists can cause problems for the people they intend

to help, infantilizing the needy, screwing up, and then running back to headquarters, leaving local

people with the mess. Although the activities of international nongovernmental organizations

(NGO) and social movements are often seen as inept and harmless, in reality they present opportu-

nities to do a great deal, of both good and harm. This seminar will review the tradition of direct

action, consider whom action is supposed to benefit (the doer or the done-to?), and look at cases of

success and failure. Examples which will ground our discussion include the anti-slavery move-

ment, environmentalism, anti-war/nuclear freeze, AIDS activism, and social justice.

Requirements: three papers.

No prerequisites. Restrictions: this class is limited to 18 and open only to first- and second-year

PSCI 201(F,S) (formerly 110) Power, Politics, and Democracy in America

A survey of American politics critically examining and questioning the vitality and viability of de-

mocracy in the United States. It begins by examining what kind of political system the founders had

in mind and reviews recent theories of power and of how and whether the people rule. We will con-

sider how important it is to broaden participation and to include groups, such as women and minori-

ties, who have been historically excluded from politics. After an overview of the politics of Ameri-

can national institutions--elections, Congress, the presidency, and the Supreme Court--the course

concludes by addressing three questions: How well does American democracy anticipate, assess,

and solve problems? Does everyone have some power in the political process? Does democratic

practice produce public policy which has equitable outcomes?

Format: first semester is lecture; second semester is lecture/discussion. Requirements: participa-

tion in class discussion, a midterm and/or final exam, and two short papers.

No prerequisites. This is an introductory course, open to all students, including first-year students.

PSCI 202(F,S) (formerly 120) World Politics: An Introduction to International Relations
International politics differs from domestic politics in the absence of centralized, legitimate institu-
tions. Anarchy characterizes the world of sovereign states--there is no world government, nor
agreement that one is desirable or even possible. This lack of a common authority means that any
dispute among countries is up to the countries themselves to settle, by negotiating, appealing to
shared norms, or using force. For this reason, while international relations involves many of the
same topics that consume domestic politics--ethnic antagonisms, spending on aid, war, national

PSCI 203(F) Introduction to Political Theory

What is justice? What does it entail for individuals and communities? How can it be secures, social-

ly and politically? Who decides? On what basis? These questions have been controversial since

their earliest formulations, and they remain controversial now. This course introduces the study of

political theory by exploring some of the key controversies. Drawing on both contemporary and

classic theories, and using practical examples from today's world, we will examine justice in rela-

tion to such themes as authority, equality, democracy, power, oppression, liberalism, capitalism,

bureaucracy, community, cultural pluralism, and rights. Specific theorists will vary from year to

year, but may include such thinkers as Plato, Aristotle, Hobbes, Machiavelli, Locke, Rousseau,

Marx, Mill, Nietzsche, Weber, Arendt, Rawls, and Foucault.

PSCI 204(S) (formerly 140) Introduction to Comparative Politics: Dodging the Apocalypse in

South Africa*

The forces of nationalism, democracy, and capitalism dominate contemporary politics. Nations

help organize political communities, identifying who belongs with whom. Democracy sets forth a

just and legitimate way of governing the communities organized by nations. And capitalism sets

terms for allocating resources, providing opportunities and discipline. We like to think these forces

are compatible, that each uniquely reinforces the other. But such is not necessarily the case, as

shown by the recent experience of South Africa. Capitalism and nationalism are not new to South

Africa. Now they are pillars of constitutional democracy, but before they were pillars of apartheid.

This course will use the rise, demise and aftermath of apartheid in South Africa to examine the rela-

tionship of nationalism, democracy, and capitalism. What was apartheid and how does democracy

work against the background of entrenched poverty inherited from apartheid? What is nationalism

in South Africa, what is its connection to "racism" and "racialism," and what do "democracy" and

"nations" mean in a multi-cultural and radically unequal society?

Requirements: two short papers and a final exam.

PSCI 211(F) Public Opinion and Political Behavior

After the Progressive Era, citizenship became to be defined as individual citizens making vote judg-

ments based on information about the public state of affairs and their own individual preferences.

As such, the definition presumes that citizens can be informed about public issues and can form

rational judgments. At the same time, given the great distance from events common for most citi-

zens, voters would have to rely on outside sources of information, whether from the media, political

parties, special interests, or political elites. Who would win in the ensuing struggle to determine

public opinion? The focus of this course is the role of public opinion in democracy. How do events

and crises influence the formation of and change of public opinion? When and under what condi-

tions can pressure groups and the mass media influence the formation of public opinion on current

domestic and international issues? Can public opinion influence individual voter's choices? What

strengthens or weakens public opinion's influence on political leaders? Each student selects an area

of public opinion of particular interest (e.g., racial attitudes, abortion, foreign policy, changing

ideological beliefs, equality) to analyze what is known about public opinion in that area.

Requirements: midterm exam, final exam, and a project report.

States Supreme Court and the exercise of judicial review. In this class we examine the ways in
which the Constitution protects individual rights while accommodating the often competing claims
of groups and communities. Some of the topics to be considered include: equal protection under
law, substantive and procedural due process, freedoms of speech and religion, and privacy. Under
these rubrics are to be found such issues as affirmative action, capital punishment, hate speech,
property rights, abortion, and gender discrimination. Much of the reading is of Supreme Court opin-
ions that highlight the politics of constitutional development.

Thomas Jefferson to Bill Clinton and Kenneth Starr. Some of the topics to be considered include:

the powers of the federal and state governments, the executive's emergency powers, and the Su-

preme Court's authority to nullify the acts of other branches. Under these general headings are to be

found such issues as the power to regulate firearms, the power to establish an office of independent

counsel, the power to overturn a judicial decision through congressional action, the power to de-

prive citizens of rights during wartime, the power to define the terms of impeachment, and the pow-

topics such as U.S. diplomacy toward revolutions and independence movements in Haiti and the

Spanish colonies; imperialism and the so-called Spanish-American war of 1898; the Panama Ca-

nal; and the Good Neighbor Policy. The middle part of the course will concentrate on the Cold War

period, considering how enduring economic interests and new strategic priorities shaped the U.S.

response to leftist movements and regimes in Guatemala, Cuba, Chile and Nicaragua, as well as the

role of human-rights concerns in policymaking. The final part of the course will discuss, in histori-

PSCI 229(F) Global Political Economy

Thirty years ago the production, distribution, consumption and accumulation of goods, services

and capital were predominantly national, organized by nation-states and within national territories.

Today they all are increasingly global in scope, and nation-states find themselves more and more

the subjects of mobile transnational corporations, international trade tribunals, global currency

markets and natural resources cartels than their masters. All of these developments have direct and

far-reaching effects on the power of states, the wealth of societies, and the life chances of billions of

people around the world. This course offers a broad introduction to the politics of global economic

relations, emphasizing the inherent and inseparable intertwining of politics and economics, power

and wealth, the state and the market. It begins with a short overview of liberal, mercantilist, Marxist

and green theoretical traditions (including Smith, Ricardo, List, Mill, Marx, Gramsci and others)

and a study of the emergence of the contemporary global order. We will examine both global trade

and global finance, along the way focusing on several issues of recent interest including free trade,

foreign direct investment, currency blocs, international labor standards, uneven development and

the global spread of American-style consumerism.

PSCI 232(F) Modern Political Thought (Same as Philosophy 232)

This seminar surveys some of the major themes and canonical texts in modern political thought.

Although roughly following a chronological order, the course is thematically constructed. The first

week presents the uniquely modern way of looking at the relationship between statecraft and soul-

craft, and dilemmas and challenges it poses. The first half of the course explores the development of

liberalism understood as a way of coping with modernity. Drawing from Hobbes, Locke, Kant, and

Mill, we will discuss such topics as reason and revelation, social contract and popular sovereignty,

obedience and resistance, authority and legitimacy, rights versus good, and history and progress.

Using Rousseau as a transitional figure, the latter half moves on to interrogate liberal modernity by

engaging with Hume, Burke, Hegel, Marx, Nietzsche, and Weber, in which we will examine issues

like reason and rationality, society versus community, alienation, revolution, and class, and the dis-

enchantment of authority. During the last week, we will revisit this master narrative and discuss it in

light of the contemporary theoretical development.

Everyone has a political ideology of some sort. They shape our attitudes, values, motivations and

beliefs about politics, help us to orient ourselves within the political landscape, and mediate be-

general concept of political ideology and how it differs from other forms of political thought and

practice, and particular political ideologies, such as liberalism, socialism, conservatism, fascism,

feminism, anarchism and environmentalism. Emphasis is placed on the historical sources, philo-

sophical foundations and argumentative structures of these ideologies, and what they tell us about

the nature of ideology generally.

The futures of Mexico and the United States are now bound up more closely than ever. Yet Mexico

enters this future with a much different past and, compared to our own, its political system still ob-

eys some very different rules. What are the legacies of the expiring PRI system? Can Mexico over-

come a tradition of political corruption? Can Mexico become "modern," as so many of its leaders

have said it should, and still be Mexico? After a survey of Mexican political history, this course

explores several themes of current interest: North American Free Trade and neo-liberal develop-

ment strategy; problems of the countryside; foreign relations; changes in religious practices and

beliefs; law enforcement; the hyper-urbanization of Mexico City; immigration and border issues;

new indigenous identities and armed conflict; and the inter-penetration of Mexican and North

PSCI 262(S) America and the Cold War
This course will examine the rise and fall of the Cold War. Our focus will be on four central issues.
First, why did America and the Soviet Union become bitter rivals shortly after the defeat of Nazi
Germany? Second, which side, if any, was primarily responsible for the length and intensity of the
Cold War in Europe? Third, how did the Cold War in Europe lead to events in other areas of the

world, such as Cuba and Vietnam? Finally, could the Cold War have been ended long before the

collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989. Political scientists and historians continue to argue vigorously

about the answers to all these questions. We will examine both traditional and revisionist explana-

tions of the Cold War, as well as the new findings that have emerged from the partial opening of

Soviet and Eastern European archives. The final section of the course will examine how scholarly

interpretations of the Cold War continue to influence how policymakers approach contemporary

issues in American foreign policy.

The most powerful international actors have always attempted to shape the international order in a

range of ways, seeking to advance their political and economic interests worldwide. This course

considers the efforts of great powers to create an international order that benefits them, as well as the

responses of rivals and less powerful states in the world. After discussing theoretical notions of state

power and international order, we focus on historical changes in the international system since

1870, including Europe's imperial expansion; nationalist responses in Asia, Africa, Latin America,

and the Middle East; Soviet-American rivalry in the postwar era; and the global preeminence of the

United States since the end of the Cold War.

rules. Every week, students will learn, apply, and evaluate a research technique. We will discuss

how to state a researchable question and how to determine what counts as an answer to that ques-

tion. We will consider what constitutes valid evidence, how to identify and evaluate alternative ex-

planations for the same event, and how to separate coincidence from cause. Students will do inter-

views, surveys, archival research, case studies and field studies. The course assumes no statistics,

nor will it teach statistics; instead, our focus will be on the other issues involved in conceiving and

executing a research project in the social sciences.

PSCI 306(S) Practicing Feminism: A Study of Political Activism (Same as Women's and

Gender Studies 306)

What constraints and opportunities confront feminists as they struggle for social change? What are

the sources of and limits on their power? How and when do they choose to compromise and negoti-

ate, or object and fight? How does activism look? What forms does it take now and in the recent

past? How are women's issues represented in the culture through the press, through other media,

through art? This course will explore the issues and problems of putting feminism into practice. Part

of that exploration will take place directly in social service agencies or non-profits which concern

the lives of women and girls; students will be investigating these questions in the trenches in a

hands-on environment.

We will examine issues such as organizational dynamics, budgetary and administrative constraints,

client-staff interactions, power and dependency, and mother-child-family relationships; students

will also be interning at community agencies involved in health care, social services, and work. A

variety of interactions with these organizations will take place: supervisors will come to class to

discuss their work and its relationship to women and girls; students will do presentations about their

work sites in relation to issues raised in reading and discussions; the class may visit an organization

or attend a meeting relevant to a given topic. Projects can be either papers which pull together re-

search and experience from the work site, or public art projects relating to the student's non-profit

and its targeted populations.

Format: discussion. Requirements: weekly internship, readings, weekly 1-page discussion paper,

final project.

PSCI 310(F) Political Psychology (Same as Psychology 345)
Issues central to political psychology are at the heart of most disputes in politics about what is pos-
sible. For example, many political philosophers begin their analyses with a statement about "human
nature." Claims about progress presume that human nature will be positively developed by political
change. The enlightenment held that rationality would be strengthened by progress, and thereby
make democracy more viable. Those who defend authoritarian regimes often do so by proclaiming
that the general public is incapable of self-rule. Much of these disputes rest on evidence of various
sorts that speak to the degree of rationality, capacity for justice, and empathy of people. We explore
what psychology tells us about the capacity for justice and rationality among mass publics and lead-
ers. Political psychology explores how people perceive, and misperceive, the world around them,
how and when people attend to politics, and how people make political judgments. The course pays
special attention to the surprising roles that emotions play in enabling rationality in politics.

When Clinton was elected in 1992, he vowed that united control of government would bring policy

change. When Republicans took control of the House and Senate after the 1994 elections, they pro-

claimed they would pass a revolution. But what really happened? What leads to policy change, and

what inhibits it? In this course, we will examine the making of public policy in the United States. We

will discuss how problems get defined as public problems worthy of government attention, and the

kinds of solutions that are seriously considered by policymakers. Through several case studies, we

will consider the ability of the U.S. to adopt comprehensive policies, and evaluate the effectiveness

of the solutions adopted.

investigate efforts to implement policy and the counter-offensive to subvert the same, often while

retaining the letter of the law. The major focus of the course is the U.S. Voting Rights Movement, a

product of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and one prime illustration of the debate over a policy con-

sensus in the context of fragmentation represented by federalism, separation of powers, and racial

and ethnic diversity in the polity. The course selects from a range of contemporary policy areas for

comparison including abortion rights, environmental protection, educational equity, immigration,

regulation of business, and public support for the arts.

PSCI 326(S) Hierarchies in International Relations
The international system is often assumed to be anarchic, i.e. ruled by none. States are formally
sovereign, there is no global policeman and war is frequent. At the same time, some states are clear-

                                ­ 277 ­
Political Science

ly more powerful than others, some regions richer than others, some societies more developed than

others, some cultures more dominant than others, some genders and races more privileged than oth-

ers. Thus despite formal anarchy and the political equality among states and societies that it implies,

there is a pervasive international hierarchy born of unequal political-economic relations, domina-

tion and exploitation at the global level. This course seeks an understanding and explanation of con-

temporary international hierarchy from a critical or radical perspective. Some key questions asked

in the course include: Is 'free trade' really free? Are we experiencing a global race to the bottom? Is

'globalization' just another word for 'Americanization'? Along the way we will study various

Marxist interpretations of global capitalism and the international political economy, including clas-

sical Marxism, dependency theory, world systems theory, and neo-Gramscian work. We will also

review some critical non-Marxist approaches including green theory, feminism and post-colonial

studies.

PSCI 334(S) Civil Society and Its Discontents

The end of cold war ushered in an era of wild optimism about a more peaceful, democratic world.

This alleged global democratization has often been accounted for in terms of the (re)emergence of

civil society, both domestic and international. The consensus ceases, however, as we examine the

concepts of civil society that are used for various purposes. Some imagines laissez-faire market,

while others, bowling leagues. Some find its archetype in literary salons of the Enlightenment era,

while others, in trade unions. For some, it is a civic educational site for (lost) civility or trust, while

for others, it is an arena for rational dialogue and interest coordination. There seems to be no one

thing to be called civil society. This seminar surveys various "modes" of civil society, while reeval-

uating the contemporary enthusiasm for civil society. Readings will be selected from both classic

and contemporary theoretical sources.

PSCI 339(S) Interpretation in the Social Sciences

In surveying major perspectives in social theory, this seminar puts particular emphasis on the value

of social theory for empirical, social science researches. The seminar is predicated on the premise

that we are bound to confront the social interactions, practices, and institutions not as empirically

given, but as something to be reconstructed in our mind. Our conceptual reconstruction is dictated

by a gestalt of factors: an imaginary vision of society, key concepts and metaphors, preferred data

base, a methodological prejudice, founding figures and subsequent lineage, and discursive contexts

surrounding the subsequent criticisms. Together, they form a coherent "perspective." The goal is to

teach students to recognize the deployment of various theoretical perspectives, often implicitly and

partially, in current social science research. Each week, we will examine a major social theory and

then see how it operates in empirical research; the first reading of the week will be drawn from the

theoretical texts, and the second from a contemporary example of empirical research informed by

those theories. The first half of the seminar surveys classic perspectives based on empiricism and

positivism, while the second half examines their critiques, including hermeneutics and pheno-

menology. Theoretical texts are likely to include those by Ranke, Hintze, Bentham, Smith, Marx,

and Durkehim for the first half; Weber and Freud as signaling paradigmatic transitions; and Heideg-

ger, Gadamer, Ricoeur, Habermas, Levi-Strauss, Geertz, and Foucault for the second half.

PSCI 349T(F) Cuba and the United States*+

Between Cuba and the US there is a long and deeply felt history of dependence and conflict. After
the collapse of the USSR, Cuba entered a deep economic depression and in response, began a de-
cade-long "special period" that has combined new repression with an opening to religious practice,

                           ­ 279 ­
Political Science

and strong official protection of the social "conquests of the Revolution" with a vigorous popular

pursuit of the Yankee dollar. Where is Cuba headed? Can the US do anything constructive at this

juncture? This course examines Cuba's relationship with its often troublesome and demanding

neighbor to the north, from José Martí and 1898 to the present. Materials include journalism, offi-

cial pronouncements of the Cuban revolutionary regime, travel accounts, polemics by émigrés,

policy statements of the US government, and a wide range of academic works.

In the first week the entire class will meet once for lecture and discussion on Cuba's colonial politi-

cal economy. In the next ten weeks we will consider ten themes under a tutorial format. In the final

week we will discuss the twelfth theme, the future of Cuba, in another meeting of the entire group.

Requirements: Students write five-page papers and two-page responses for alternate sessions, for a

total of five papers and five responses. In the tutorial session, essays will be read aloud or presented

in outline form, then critiqued by the discussant, and then defended.

Prerequisites: any course on Latin America or permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 10

PSCI 362(S) The Vietnam War (Same as Asian Studies 303)*

The Vietnam War continues to provide instant "lessons" of history for everyone concerned with

contemporary American foreign policy. Unfortunately, these lessons are often contradictory or

simply wrong. This course will seek to rescue the Vietnam War from the distorted images of Holly-

wood and the sacred truths of those on both the Right and Left of the political spectrum. First, we

will examine the origins of the Vietnam War in the late 1940's and 1950's within the larger frame-

works of anti-communism and de-colonization. Second, we will examine the war from the perspec-

tive of both the North and South Vietnamese. Third, we will examine the political science theories

of nation-building and escalation that led both John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson to commit

over 500,000 American troops to Vietnam. Fourth, we will examine the antiwar movement and the

political and strategic factors that finally ended the war in 1975. The final section of the course will

examine the enduring impact of the war on Southeast Asia and revisit the lessons of Vietnam in the

context of contemporary American foreign policy.

PSCI 410(S) Senior Seminar in American Politics

The focal point of this research seminar will be on the state of American democracy early in its third

century. Two elements provide a basis for judging the state of American politics: first, we begin

with a comparison of politics at the founding of the Republic with the state of politics in our own

time; second, each seminar participant will engage in research on a particular aspect of American

politics. Among the topics that will be considered are: the competing conceptions of democracy;

the appropriate roles of the various institutions of politics (the press, political parties, local, state,

and national politics); and, the social and economic systems and their diverse effects. Combined,

these two elements will enable the seminar to consider how the American political system has

changed and whether it has changed for the better and/or worse. Has the increasing diversity of the

American population, the growth of imperial responsibility, the impact of the world economy on

America (and of the American economy on the world), the pace of technological change, among

other modern features, made democratic politics more or less possible?

Format: discussion. Requirements: a research paper and oral presentations in the seminar.

No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15. Senior majors have precedence.

Hour: 2:35-3:50 TF                                                                     MARCUS

PSCI 420(F) (Sections 01 and 02) Senior Seminar in International Relations: National
Interest and International Security
The founding fathers of the American republic drew a sharp distinction between the national inter-
est and the interests of the international system. Ideals and principles were clearly subordinate to a

                                                           Political Science

selfish and narrowly defined national interest. Beginning with Woodrow Wilson, American elites

have increasingly equated the national interest with the promotion of larger ideals, such as democ-

racy and collective security. Not surprisingly, the Wilsonian conflation of the American national

interest with the interests of the international system has been challenged at both home and abroad.

This senior seminar will examine the complex and controversial relationship between the national

interest and international security from both theoretical and historical perspectives. Specific topics

to be explored include globalization, cultural imperialism, alliances, democracy promotion, nu-

clear proliferation, and international peacekeeping.

Format: seminar. Requirements: weekly assignments and a 25-page research paper.

PSCI 420(S) (Section 03) Senior Seminar in International Relations: State Power, Economic

Nationalism, and Globalization

This course examines the interrelations of the state structures, economic practice and national iden-

tity. We start with a historical study of how the socio-cultural image of "nation" emerged as a legiti-

mating device for state power and how national economies took shape from the mercantilism of

early-modern statebuilding. This history suggests that politics crucially influences how we define

ourselves collectively and how we produce and exchange goods and services. The second part of

the course asks whether the apparent primacy of politics has been displaced by the forces of eco-

nomic globalization. In a world economy, where capital accumulation transcends territorial bound-

aries, how can economic activity be made to serve state interests and how can a distant national

identity be preserved? Or will globalization make it impossible for states to maintain their econom-

ic and cultural foundations? These questions will be explored through historical and theoretical

texts, as well as an analysis of Japan.

Format: seminar. Requirements: one short paper and a 25-page research paper on a topic to be cho-

sen in consultation with the instructor.

PSCI 420(S) (Section 04) Senior Seminar in International Relations: States and Markets in the

World Economy

The world economy has seen a persistent tension between the centralized and authoritative alloca-

tion of resources by states and more decentralized, market-driven forms of economic exchange by

private actors. This seminar addresses this tension by focusing on the relationship between power

and wealth in international relations. We will examine

several different areas of international political economy, including trade and monetary relations,

foreign direct investment, dependency and development, and challenges in foreign economic poli-

cymaking.

Seminar format. Requirements: in addition to a substantial amount of reading, requirements in-

clude three 8- to 10-page papers on predetermined topics.

PSCI 430(F) Senior Seminar in Political Theory: The Concept of the Political

This senior seminar in political theory is designed for an in-depth engagement with Max Weber and
Carl Schmitt. Weber and Schmitt shared similar understanding of modernity that in their view cul-
minated in a rationalized "iron cage" or a neutralized "total state"; and both called forth a revivifica-
tion of the "political" as a way out of the otherwise inevitable petrification. Weber, however, re-
affirmed liberal parliamentarism and pluralistically organized civil society as viable media for his
project of (re)politicization, a project Schmitt scorned as too timid. Notoriously, Schmitt, a self-
claimed student of Weber's, went on to become the "crown jurist" of the Third Reich. What are the
political implications of the kind of cultural pessimism, or theories of modernity in general, that
both Weber and Schmitt embraced? Why such different outcomes in terms of their political ideas?
What do these similarities and differences tell us about the nature of the "political" in modern
times? Investigating the theoretical tension between liberalism, modernity, and the political, we
start with Weber's rationalization thesis as well as the political writings, and move on to examine
major works by Schmitt.
Format: seminar. Requirements: class participation, presentation and three 6- to 7-page papers.

neuroscience have had a profound impact on the understanding of diseases that affect cognition,

behavior, and emotion. This course provides an in-depth analysis of the relationship between brain

dysfunction and disease state. We will focus on neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's

disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease. We will consider diagnosis of disease,

treatment strategies, as well as social and ethical issues. The course is taught in the tutorial format

and provides students with the opportunity to present material based upon: (1) review of published

literature, (2) analysis of case histories, and (3) observations of diagnosis and treatment of patients

both live and on videotape. Students design and conduct an empirical project.

Format: tutorial. Evaluation based on position papers, class participation, and research project re-

port.

Prerequisites: Psychology 212 (same as Biology 212 or Neuroscience 201). Enrollment limit: 10

(expected: 10).

Satisfies one semester of the Division III requirement.

PSYC 321(S) The Psychology of Language

How do we acquire language? How do we use it? How does language affect our thought and experi-

ence? This course examines language from multiple perspectives and focuses on several key issues

such as language acquisition, the use of language and gesture to communicate, and how language

biases the ways we think about what we experience. In approaching these issues, we will draw on

research from psychology (especially cognitive psychology and the psychology of language) but

also from disciplines outside of psychology, such as anthropology and linguistics.

Format: seminar

Requirements: two short papers, research paper, class participation, and class presentation.

Prerequisite: Psychology 221 or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 25 (expected: 15).

PSYC 323(F) Sensation and Perception

People and animals typically behave effectively with respect to the world. What are the mecha-

nisms that allow us to gain and make use of information about our surroundings and about objects at

a distance? The course will focus on the physiological processes underlying sensation (sight, hear-

ing, and touch), the qualitative aspects of human perceptual experience, and on how perception and

action are interconnected. The theoretical focus will be on whether perception is an indirect and

passive inferential process or a direct and dynamic information-seeking process.

Format: lecture/discussion.

PSYC 332(F) Cognitive Development
How do infants make sense of their world? When do children understand the distinction between fan-
tasy and reality? What events do children remember, and how accurate are early memories? How do
cultural experiences affect the way that children think and problem-solve? These questions form the
basis of a course that examines both the biological and social factors that influence the development of
intellectual skills during the childhood years. We consider both theoretical (e.g., what is the relation-

                                      ­ 285 ­

ship between thought and language) and applied questions (e.g., do children misunderstand media

messages), and we explore the similarities and differences in cognitive development of normally-de-

veloping children and children with developmental disabilities (e.g., autism). The work of both classi-

cal (e.g., Piaget, Luria) and contemporary theorists (e.g., Case, Fischer) is compared and contrasted.

PSYC 346T(S) Egocentrism and Social Judgment

"There is...one thing and only one in the whole universe which we know more about than we could

learn from external observation," wrote author C. S. Lewis. "That one thing is ourselves. We have,

so to speak, inside information; we are in the know." The purpose of this tutorial is to consider Lew-

is's truism from the perspective of empirical research in social psychology-to explore current and

classic research on egocentrism and social judgment to better understand how beliefs and knowl-

edge about the self influence emotion, cognition, and behavior. Among the topics to be considered

are introspection and self-insight (are people as "in the know" about themselves as they think?),

self-prediction of emotion and behavior, self-appraisal, self-deception, the self in memory, and the

(sometimes surprising) lengths to which people will go to maintain positive self-esteem. A goal of

the course is to develop an overall view of "the self" as a cognitive system that facilitates informa-

tion processing and assists in everyday functioning, but which is subject to a variety of biases and

shortcomings.

Format: tutorial. Evaluation will be based on position papers, class participation, and the empirical

project presentation and final report.

PSYC 347(F,S) Psychology and the Law

This course deals with applications of psychology to the legal system. Relevant psychological

theory and research address the following controversies: scientific jury selection, jury decision-

making, eyewitness testimony, child witnesses in abuse cases, hypnosis, lie-detector tests,

interrogations and confessions, the insanity defense, and the role of psychologists as trial consul-

tants and expert witnesses. Observations are made of videotaped trials, demonstrations, and mock

jury deliberations. Students conduct original research in the area. No knowledge of the law is neces-

sary.

PSYC 348(S) Group Dynamics

What are the driving forces behind group behavior? This topic is covered on both theoretical and

applied levels with an emphasis on putting theory into practice. The types of groups discussed range

from the small (two members) to the extremely large (thousands of members). Topics such as group

performance, cooperative problem-solving, competitive problem-solving, social dilemmas, cul-

tural in-group bias, group think, and loss of self will be covered in detail. These areas of research

will be related to relevant "real world" topics such as the performance of sports teams, committee

decision-making, team negotiation, and mob mentality. Both classic and recent research on dynam-

ic group processes will be outlined and discussed in class.

MAJOR
   The major in Religion is designed to perform two related functions: to expose the student to the

methods and issues involved in the study of religion as a universal phenomenon of psychological,
sociological, and cultural/historical dimensions; and to confront students with the beliefs, practic-
es, and values of specific religions through a study of particular religious traditions. It is a program
that affords each student an opportunity to fashion his/her own sequence of study within a pre-
scribed basic pattern constructed to ensure both coherence and variety. It consists of at least nine
semester courses as follows:

Required sequence courses
   Religion 101 Introduction to Religion
   Two seminars (courses numbered 301-309)
   Religion 402 Issues in the Study of Religion

Elective courses
   Five additional courses in Religion are to be selected in such a way that at least one course is taken

in both the Western and non-Western traditions. Students will construct their sequence in consulta-

                                    ­ 289 ­
Religion

tion with departmental advisors and subject to their approval. In order to achieve a deep coverage of
a particular religious tradition or set of related problems in the study of religion, students are urged
to select three electives that together have some kind of coherence, be it cultural, historical, or topi-
cal. Related courses from other departments or programs may be included among the three courses,
and the point of coherence can be the subject of research papers in the senior seminar.

   Students are advised to elect additional courses in related fields (e.g., psychology, sociology, an-
thropology, art, history, philosophy) in order to gain a clearer understanding of the social and cultur-
al contexts in which religions appear.

   For those who wish to go beyond the formally-listed courses into a more intensive study of a par-
ticular religious tradition, methodological trend, or religious phenomenon (e.g., ritual, symbol-
formation, mysticism, theology, etc.), there is the opportunity to undertake independent study or,
with the approval of the department, to pursue a thesis project.

   The value of the major in Religion derives from its fostering of a critical appreciation of the com-
plex role religion plays in every society, even those that consider themselves non-religious. The
major makes one sensitive to the role religion plays in shaping the terms of cultural discourse, of
social attitudes and behavior, and of moral reflection. But it also discloses the ways in which
religion and its social effects represent the experience of individual persons and communities. In
doing these things, the major further provides one with interdisciplinary analytical tools and cross-
cultural experience and opens up new avenues for dealing with both the history of a society and
culture and the relationships between different societies and cultures. What one learns as a Religion
major is therefore remarkably applicable to a wide range of other fields of study or professions.

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN RELIGION

   The degree with honors in Religion requires the above-mentioned nine courses and the prepara-
tion of a thesis of 75+ pages with a grade of B+ or better. A thesis may combine revised work done in
other courses with new material prepared while enrolled either in Religion 493-W031 or Religion
W031-494. Up to two-thirds of the work in the thesis may be such revised work, but at least one-
third must represent new work. The thesis must constitute a coherent whole either by its organizing
theme or by a focus on a particular religious tradition. Candidates will also be expected to present
the results of their thesis orally in a public presentation. Students who wish to be candidates for
honors in Religion will submit proposals and at least one paper that will be included in the thesis to
the department in the spring of their junior year. Students must have at least a 3.3 GPA in Religion to
be considered for the honors program.

The chair will serve as advisor to non-majors.

REL 209(F) American Jewish History: From New Amsterdam to Williams College (Same

as History 374 and American Studies 213)~

In 1654 a ship carrying 23 Jewish refugees fleeing the Brazilian Inquisition sailed off course and

landed in New Amsterdam. Some 350 years later, American Jewry has come to constitute one of the

largest, richest, and most important Jewish communities in the world. This course surveys the in-

between years, examining the experiences of Jewish immigrants and their children as they have

sought to negotiate a place for themselves in a society whose regard for religious minorities has run

the spectrum from hostile to ambivalent. Combining historical and sociological approaches, we

will pay particular attention to the construction and the continuous reformation of American Jewish

identity, looking at such topics as the transformation of "Judaism" from a racial to an ethnic catego-

ry; the articulation of discourses of "chosenness" in a pluralistic, secularizing society; the develop-

ment of contemporary revitalization movements (Reconstructionists, Havurahniks, etc.); and the

place of Jews in American higher education.

Instead of taking the usual exams, students in the class will demonstrate their learning and develop

their skills by conducting original research, digging through the College archives and conducting

oral histories with alumni. If all goes well, their final projects will form the backbone of a published

volume on the history of Jews at Williams College.

Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: full attendance and participation, brief weekly response

papers, and one 18- to 25-page research paper.

No prerequisites. Open to all classes. Enrollment limit: 20 (expected: 20).

REL 225(S) Religion and Popular Culture in America (Same as Sociology 225 and

American Studies 225)~

For almost a hundred years, commentators have described the progress of religion in the United

States in terms of progressive secularization. The thesis of this course is that the opposite is true: far

from becoming a culture void of enchantment, America is becoming more religious every day. You

just have to know where--and how--to look. In this class we will uncover the theological dimen-

sions of American mass media products (theodicy in the X-files, eschatology in Marilyn Manson),

explore the ideological dimensions of religious material culture (evangelical t-shirts, Kosher Chi-

nese cookbooks), and examine the appropriation of popular genres by religious subcultures (East-

ern Orthodox hardcore 'zines, Christian diet manuals). We shall supplement our investigations with

readings from such cultural theorists as Horkeimer, Adorno, Althusser, Gramsci, Hall, Fiske, Bour-

dieu, Bordo, and Baudrillard.

Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: full attendance and participation, brief weekly response

logical aspects. On the other hand, this course also seeks to bring out the personal relevance of Bud-

dhist ideas, ensuring that they are not just considered as objects but also as partners in an ongoing

conversation. We start by examining the Theravada tradition of South and South-East Asia through

which we seek to understand some of the basic Buddhist ideas such as no-self, suffering and its

origin, and the possibilities for freedom. We then move to the Indian and Tibetan Mahayana tradi-

tions, which are characterized by an increase in the importance of compassion on the basis of the

bodhisattva ideal. In dealing with Buddhism in Tibet, we focus more particularly on the tantric as-

pects of its tradition. Throughout the course, we are careful to consider Buddhism not just as a set of

thought provoking ideas that can be studied in abstraction from their implementation, but as being

based on socially inscribed practices. We examine a broad range of practices, ranging from so-

called popular rituals to the practices of virtuosi. In particular, we examine meditation in the Thera-

vada and Tibetan Tantric traditions. In this way, we gain a realistic appreciation of the nature, role

and difficulties of such a practice, and dispel some of its misunderstandings.

REL 290(S) Heidegger and Levinas

This course will explore the thought of two major twentieth-century thinkers: the towering German

figure in European phenomenology, Martin Heidegger, and his French Jewish follower, interlocu-

tor, and ultimately critic, Emmanuel Levinas. The first part of the course will focus on Heidegger's

most important work, Being and Time, assessing his contribution to continental thought through a

consideration of his adaptation of ontology and his treatment of a set of major concepts, e.g., Being,

the everyday, care, temporality, and death. The second part of the course will turn to Levinas, a stu-

dent of both Husserl and Heidegger, who sought to translate the phenomenological method of his

teachers into a French idiom. In so doing, he thoroughly reworked it, increasingly distancing him-

self from what he saw as the anonymity of Husserl's Ego or Heidegger's Being and substituting for

them a concern with encounter, with intersubjectivity, with the other, with the face-to-face. The

principal questions this part of the course will ask are: how, if at all, does Levinas go further than

Heidegger? Is Levinas right that the ethical moment is essentially absent from Being and Time?

What role does sexual difference play in Levinas's contribution? And finally, how do his Jewish

writings relate to his project as a whole, and especially his dialogue with Heidegger?

Readings will include major works and essays from both thinkers.

Requirements: attendance and participation, several short writings assignments, final paper.

REL 304(F) From Hermeneutics to Post-Coloniality*

This course explores some of the theoretical trajectories available in "our" pluri-cultural and

(post)modern world by focusing on the relation between truth and interpretation, particularly in a

pluri-cultural context. We start with Gadamer's hermeneutics, which stresses the importance of be-

ing aware of one's cultural background and prejudices, an important prerequisite for understanding

cultural differences. Hermeneutics has also, however, several blind spots, which we examine

through the critiques of Derrida, Foucault and Said. With Derrida we learn the critical tools and the

rigor necessary to question some of the central notions such as identity and difference which are

often taken for granted. With Foucault we question the relation between truth and power in inter-

pretation, and thematize the complexities of power. With Said's Orientalism, a seminal description

of the ways in which the West has (mis)represented the "East," we examine the nature of (mis)inter-

pretation of other cultures and the role that ethnocentrism has played in the formation of modernity.

We also consider some of the more compelling critiques of Said's work such as Bhabha's warning

against the essentialization of difference and Spivak's argument against the often too easy appropri-

ation of cultural differences. We conclude by considering two concrete situations in India and Egypt

which illustrate the relevance of the post-colonial critique and its main proponents, Said, Spivak

and Bhabha (otherwise known as the "Holy Trinity"). Reading list: H.G. Gadamer, Truth and Meth-

od. F. Saussure, Course in General Linguistics. J. Derrida, Of Grammatology. P. Rabinow, Foucault

Reader. E. Said, Orientalism. T. Mitchell, Colonizing Egypt. Hawley, Sati: The Blessing and the

REL 306(S) Feminist Approaches to Religion (Same as Women's and Gender Studies 282)

What does feminist theory have to offer the study of religion? How have participants in various

religious traditions helped to produce and enact feminisms? Feminism and religion have a long but

often troubled history of interconnection. In this course, we shall explore a range of feminist

theoretical perspectives that have either emerged out of particular religious contexts or have been

applied to the study of religious traditions and practices. We shall consider how conflicts within

feminism-especially those pertaining to issues of sexuality, race, class, nationality, ethnicity, and

religious affiliation-make a difference for the ways that religion as a category is interpreted. Au-

thors considered in this class will include: Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Mary Daly, Elisabeth Schussler

Fiorenza, Katie Cannon, bell hooks, Judith Butler, Judith Plaskow, Ada Maria Isasi-Diaz, Kwok

Pui Lan, Rachel Adler, M. Elaine Combs-Schilling, Adrienne Rich, Patricia Williams, Sallie McFa-

gue, Melanie Morrison, and Marijas Gimbutas.

Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: brief weekly writings assignments; one class presenta-

tion; one 5-page essay; one 15-page research paper.

REL 308T(F) Imagining "Religion" (Same as Anthropology 308T)

Our conceptual categories of religion and the rubrics under which we group them--"Confucian-
ism," "Christianity," "primitive religion"--are historical constructions of knowledge and power.
The term "Hinduism," for example, was coined by British clerics and colonial officials during the
Raj to describe a very wide variety of beliefs and practices. Similarly, the Western fascination with
"Buddhism" reflects a romanticized and very narrow vision of a particular set of East Asian tradi-
tions. Standard terminology ("heaven," "mysticism," "salvation") reflect a specific theological fra-
mework. Even the idea of "religion" itself as a sui generis category of human experience is a rela-
tively recent and ideologically loaded invention.
In this tutorial we will investigate the role of scholars, theologians, anthropologists, nationalists,
journalists, seekers, and other interested parties in the construction of religious categories, and ex-
amine the ways in which their tacit assumptions have informed both elite and popular discourse. In
addition to reading theoretical works (by Foucault, Said, Clifford) and intellectual histories (by
Brian Harrison, Philip Almond, David Chichester, Steven Wasserstrom), we will spend time dis-
secting supposedly objective studies of comparative religions (by Lord Herbert of Cherbury, Volt-
aire, Max Muller, Madam Blavatsky, Mircea Eliade).
Meeting in pairs, each student in the tutorial will write and present orally five 5- to 7-page papers
every other week on the assigned readings. Students not presenting an essay have the responsibility

                    ­ 295 ­

of critiquing the work of their colleague. The tutorial will culminate in a final written exercise. This

course will count as a major seminar for Religion majors.

MAJOR--French Language and Literature
   The French major consists of nine courses above the 103-104 level with optimally one course

each from the following areas:

1) Poetry and Poetics

2) Prose Narrative and Fiction

3) Theatre and Dramatic Literature

4) Thematics, Special Topics, Survey Courses

Students must also take a 400-level capstone seminar which may count toward any of the four
required areas.

   Working with the major advisor, the student will formulate a curricular plan that will ensure bal-
ance and coherence in courses taken. Such balance and coherence will be based on the above areas
of literary and cultural investigation. Prospective majors should discuss their program with the ma-
jor advisor by the end of their sophomore year. This is especially imperative for students who are
planning to spend a part or all of their junior year in France.

   The major seeks to provide training in literary and cultural analysis and linguistic expression
through the study of selected texts. Emphasis is placed on the changes in form and subject matter
from the Renaissance to the modern era.

   Inasmuch as all courses in French assume the active participation of each student in discussions
conducted in the foreign language, regular attendance at class meetings is expected.

MAJOR--French Studies
   The major in French Studies is an interdisciplinary program that provides students with the op-

portunity to acquire skills and knowledge embracing the cultural, historical, social, and political
heritage of France. The program allows for an individualized course of study involving work in
several departments and the opportunity to study abroad.

   Students electing the French Studies major should register with the French Studies faculty advi-
sor during their sophomore year. At that time they should submit a feasibility plan that articulates
their projected program.

   The French Studies major consists of ten courses satisfying the following requirements:
   1) at least two courses in French language and/or literature above the French 103 level;
   2) a senior seminar;
   3) Electives: The remaining courses needed to complete the major must be drawn from at least
three different departments and relate primarily to an aspect of the culture, history, society, and poli-
tics of France. These courses will be selected in consultation with members of the Department of
Romance Languages. Appropriate electives might include:

      ArtH 254 Impressionism (Deleted 2000-2001)
      History 307 The French and Haitian Revolutions
      Religion 301 Psychology of Religion
      All courses in French literature and language above the 103 level.

   In addition, students should take at least two non-language courses that are taught in French.

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN FRENCH
   Two alternative routes are available to those who wish to apply for the degree with honors.
   The first of these involves the writing of a senior thesis. Honors candidates are required to devote

to their theses two semesters of independent study (beyond the nine courses required for the major)
and the winter study period of their senior year (493-W031-494). The thesis will be written in
French and will usually be in the range of from forty to sixty pages. Candidates are expected to sub-
mit thesis proposals in May of their junior year. By the end of the first semester of the senior year,
students will normally have finished the research for the thesis. By the end of the winter study peri-
od, candidates will submit to the department an outline and rough draft of their work. At this time,
the student will make a presentation of his project at a departmental colloquium. The thesis will be
discussed and evaluated to determine whether or not the student should continue in the honors pro-
gram. The second semester of independent thesis work will be spent revising and rewriting the the-
sis. The completed dissertation in its final form will be due at the end of April. The second route is a
group of three clearly related courses (offered by the Department of Romance Languages or by oth-
er departments, such as History, Art, Philosophy, English, etc.), only one of which may be counted
in the nine courses comprising the major. One of the courses will be an Independent Study (plus
senior year WSP 030). At the end of the spring semester the student will write an essay that synthe-
sizes the content of the three related courses. Students may apply for this route by November 2 of the
senior year.

   In the case of both routes to the degree with honors, the department's recommendation for gradu-
ation with honors will be based on the originality and thoroughness of the finished project.

THE CERTIFICATE IN FRENCH
   The Certificate in French Language and Culture consists of a sequence of seven courses for

which the student must earn the cumulative grade average of B or higher. In addition, the student
must achieve a score of 60 on the College Level Examination Program (CLEP) College French
(Levels 1 and 2) test. This test will be administered by the Department of Romance Languages once
a year during the month of April to all candidates for the Certificate in French Language and Cul-
ture.

   For students with little or no prior background in French, the course sequence consists of French
101-102, French 103-104, and any three courses in French above the 104-level, one of which must
be at the 200 level or higher. If the student begins with French 103-104, the sequence then continues
with three courses in French above the 104 level, including one at the 200 level or higher. The stu-
dent must then take two more courses either in French above the 104 level or in other departments.
The courses in other departments must contain a significant component of material representing

                                                ­ 297 ­
Romance Languages

French or Francophone cultural, intellectual, political, social, and art-historical topics. The choice
of the courses must be approved by the department.

PLACEMENT
   A placement test in French is administered at Williams at the opening of the fall semester. Incom-

ing first-year students who register for any French course above the 101-102 level must take this
test, regardless of their previous preparation.

STUDY ABROAD
   French majors are strongly encouraged to complete part of the major requirements by studying

abroad either during the academic year or the summer. Through its special affiliation with the Ham-
ilton Junior Year in France, the department offers a comprehensive academic and cultural experi-
ence in a francophone environment. Major credit for study abroad will normally be assigned as fol-
lows: up to 1 credit for one semester; up to 3 credits for a full year or two semesters. The final assign-
ment of credit will be authorized in consultation with the student's major advisor upon return to
Williams. Such credits can only be determined by review of course format, materials, and evidence
of satisfactory academic performance. Any student contemplating study in France is advised to
consult with faculty members in French before selecting a study abroad program. Because of the
wide range of academic quality, some programs are considered deficient, and, therefore, unsatis-
factory choices for Williams students.

LITERATURE COURSES

RLFR 109(F) Introduction to French Literature: The Literature of Desire and

Repression

A study of representative French texts from the seventeenth to the twentieth centuries in which the

issues of desire and repression help the reader to understand authorial intention and its relation to

the process of writing. Among the topics to be discussed: the transposition of male and female

voice, the rhetoric of desire and sexuality, Platonism and the sublimation of desire, the salon as a

venue of power, provincial and city life as settings for the elaboration of gender themes and con-

flicts, language and its relation to money and desire, and levels of aggression and passivity. Texts to

be read and discussed: Phèdre (Racine), Manon Lescaut (Prévost), Eugénie Grandet (Balzac), Ma-

dame Bovary (Flaubert), L'Amant (Duras), La Lectrice (Jean). Conducted in French.

Requirements: class participation, a midterm exam, and several short papers.

RLFR 110(S) Introduction to French Literature: The Search for Identity

"We are so used to disguising ourselves for others," wrote the seventeenth-century author, La Ro-

chefoucauld, "that we wind up disguised to ourselves." Through the study of short masterpieces of

the seventeenth, eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth centuries, we will study a variety of authors'

different approaches to questions of self-deception, self-discovery, and self-understanding. Writers

to be studied include Pascal, La Rochefoucauld, Mme. de La Fayette, Chateaubriand, Mme. Claire

de Duras, Balzac, Maupassant, Mauriac, Colette, and Camus. Conducted in French.

Requirements: active participation in all class discussions, three short papers, one longer paper, one

oral presentation.

RLFR 207(S) Nineteenth-Century French Novel

Still perceived as a "minor" genre at the end of the eighteenth century, the novel was quickly ele-

vated as the literary form of choice in the years following the French revolution. In this course, we

will study the evolution of the novel as a genre in nineteenth-century France, paying particular

attention to the social and historical context in which the novel developed and transformed over the

course of the century. Important areas of investigation will include the ways in which the novel

serves as a "reflection" of contemporary French society, the emergence of new literary "types" in

the nineteenth-century novel, as well as the impact of the changed and changing reading public on

the genre. Texts will include examples of the romantic and historical novel (Hugo's Notre-Dame de

Paris), of the realist novel (Balzac's La Cousine Bette and Flaubert's Madame Bovary), and of the

naturalist novel (Zola's Germinal). We will also look at the ways in which such literary "classics"

have lent themselves--and continue to lend themselves--to cinematic adaptations, and will ex-

plore the blurring of the lines between elite and popular culture that results from such adaptations.

Requirements: class participation, oral presentations, three short papers and a final paper.

RLFR 211(F) The Poetry of Revolution and Modernism: Baudelaire, Rimbaud, Mallarmé

With modernism begins a revolt that writes itself in as well as against language. Poetry in France,

especially from 1850 on, initiates a revolution. It seeks to subvert the world and the word, to open

consciousness to untried experiences of the real, and to call into question the forms of representa-

tion by which society and culture maintain their power. The course will focus attention on the sub-

versive intent of three major nineteenth-century poets whose works attempt to create a truly revolu-

tionary and modern consciousness that will define French literature and criticism well into the late-

twentieth century. Certain subjects to be discussed in depth will include: (1) the search for the un-

known; (2) the escape from the world; (3) the attitude toward nature and the modern city; (4) the use

of symbol and allegory; (5) the power of memory in poetic re-creation; (6) the nature of the prose

poem as a new modernist genre; (7) the genesis of symbolism; (8) the place of dream and hallucina-

tion in poetic experience; and (9) the relation of music (Claude Debussy, Pierre Boulez, Jim Morri-

son) to poetic expression. In particular, the works of each poet will be discussed in relation to the

historical and cultural events of the time: Baudelaire and the modernization of Paris; Rimbaud and

the insurrection of the Paris Commune; Mallarmé and fin-de-siècle and symbolist aesthetics. Read-

ings will include Baudelaire's Les Fleurs du mal and Le Spleen de Paris; Rimbaud's early poems,

Une Saison en enfer, and Les Illuminations; and Mallarmé's Poésies; plus critical writings by Ben-

jamin, Blanchot, Kristeva, and Bonnefoy. Conducted in French.

Requirements: active participation in class discussions, two papers, one hour exam, and oral class

presentations.

RLFR 316(S) (formerly 214) Travels, Topographies, Curiosities and Encounters: The
Renaissance Sense of Place
Renaissance thinkers and writers are fascinated with the past as a living, spatial register and with the

future as a construct of the imagination. Through the study of representative French Renaissance

texts centered on travel, exploration, and inquiry, this course will explore the way in which six-

teenth-century writers approach discovery as a mode of recognition that helps authenticate and de-

fine our sense of place. For the Renaissance this sense is shaped from a variety of sources prompting

writers to return to the major Greek and Latin travel epics (The Odyssey and The Aeneid), to rewrite

these epic journeys as phantasmagoric quests and figures of poetic aspiration, and to establish the

relevancy of the past for helping Europe come to terms with the dislocating discovery of the "New

World." We shall focus on François Rabelais's Tiers livre and Quart livre, Joachim Du Bellay's

archeological and Odyssean sonnets in Les Antiquitez and Les Regrets, and Michel de Montaigne's

Essays. Conducted in French.

Requirements: class participation, two papers, an oral presentation, and a one-hour exam.

Prerequisite: French 109, 110, or 112, or permission of the instructor. The course fulfills the require-

ment for the senior seminar.

RLFR 330(S) Senior Seminar: The Poetics and Politics of Memory (Same as Comparative

Literature 402)

The seminar will examine the literary and artistic representations of memory in an effort to reveal how the

act of remembering is determined by historical, cultural, political, and ideological perceptions of the past.

We will study the relationship of memory to history, to commemoration, to confession, to autobiography,

to narrative reconstruction, to testimony, to nostalgia, and to forgetting. The history of remembrance as

well as the different forms of memory--private versus public, psychoanalytic versus collective, personal

versus social, everyday versus historical--will be discussed. Since memory is a sign of and a surrogate for

something that is absent or that has been lost, we will focus our attention on the memorializing aspects of

memory in Renaissance theories concerning "the art of memory," in the development of mnemonic tech-

niques, in the valorizing of certain rituals or protocols of remembrance, in the construction of monuments

of commemoration, and in the private and public celebration of birthdays, anniversaries, bicentennials, and

similar events. Other areas of concern will be: the role of gender in the reconstruction of the past, the

formation of identity through personal and historical recollection, and the way images of the past determine

perceptions of the present and the future. Readings from different centuries and by writers of different na-

tionalities will be selected from among the following: Baudelaire, Freud, Kafka, Proust, Perec, Borges,

Marshall, Woolf, Nabokov, Kundera, Bishop, Calvino, and writers of the Holocaust. Critical and theoreti-

cal readings will include texts by Bergson, Halbwachs, Yates, Benjamin, Nora, Blanchot, Barthes, Derrida,

and Sacks. All readings in English.

                                         SPANISH

   The Spanish major consists of nine courses above the 103-104 level. These nine courses include
301, any course 200 level or above (excluding RLSP 205 and RLSP 303), 401, and 402.

   The major seeks to provide training in literary analysis and linguistic expression, as well as an
appreciation of Hispanic civilization, through the study of the major writers of the Spanish-speak-
ing world.

   Students majoring in Spanish may replace one of their Spanish electives with a Linguistics
course or with one course in Latin-American Studies that is 200-level or higher, or with a course in
Comparative Literature.

   Inasmuch as all courses in Spanish assume the active participation of each student in discussions
conducted in the foreign language, regular attendance at class meetings is expected.

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN SPANISH

   Candidates for a senior thesis must have maintained a 3.5 GPA in the major by the time of proposal
submission. Two alternative routes are available to those who wish to apply for the degree with honors.

   The first of these involves the writing of a senior thesis. Honors candidates are required to devote
to their theses two semesters of Independent Study (beyond the nine courses required for the ma-
jor--and the winter study period of their senior year (493-W031-494). The thesis will be written in
Spanish and will usually be in the range of from forty to sixty pages. Candidates are encouraged to
submit thesis proposals in May of their junior year. By the end of the first semester of the senior year,
students will normally have finished the research for the thesis. By the end of the winter study peri-
od, candidates will submit to the department a completed first draft of their work. At this time, the
student will make a presentation of his project at a departmental colloquium. The thesis will be dis-
cussed and evaluated to determine whether or not the student should continue in the honors pro-
gram. The second semester of independent thesis work will be spent revising and rewriting the the-
sis. The completed dissertation in its final form will be due at the end of April.

   The second route is a group of three clearly related courses (offered by the Department of Ro-
mance Languages or by other departments, such as History, Art, Philosophy, English, etc.), only
one of which may be counted in the nine courses comprising the major. One of the courses will be an
Independent Study (plus senior year WSP 030) in the spring of the senior year, at the end of which
the student will write an essay that synthesizes the content of the three related courses. Students may
apply for this route by November 2 of the senior year.

   In the case of both routes to the degree with honors, the department's recommendation for gradu-
ation with honors will be based on the originality and thoroughness of the finished project.

THE CERTIFICATE IN SPANISH

   The Certificate in Spanish Language and Culture consists of a sequence of seven courses for
which the student must earn a cumulative grade average of B or higher. In addition, the student must
take a proficiency test and achieve a score of "Advanced." The test will be administered by the de-
partment once a year during the month of April to all students desirous of obtaining the Certificate.
Those so interested should express their intent to the chair of the department by March 1 or earlier.

   For students with no prior Spanish background, the course sequence will consist of Spanish
101-102, Spanish 103-104, and three courses in Spanish above the 104 level, with at least one of
these courses at the 200-level or higher taken at Williams. If the student starts out the sequence at
Spanish 103-104, in addition to the three courses in Spanish beyond the 104 level (including a
200-level course or higher), two electives may be taken in other departments. One elective should
be in Spanish or Latin-American cultural history (art, literature, drama, music) and the other in
Spanish or Latin-American intellectual, political, or social history. Spanish 111, 112, or 208 can be
counted for the elective requirement.

List of possible electives in other departments:

Anthropology 215 The Secrets of Ancient Peru: Archaeology of South America
Anthropology 216 Native Peoples of Latin America
Anthropology 217 Mesoamerican Civilizations
ArtH 200 Art of Mesoamerica
ArtH/Anthropology 219 The Art and Archaeology of Maya Civilization: A Marriage Made in Xi-

   balba
Economics 226 Economic Development and Change in Latin America
History 242 Latin-American from Conquest to Independence
History 243 Modern Latin America, 1822 to the Present
Political Science 344 Rebels and Revolution in Latin America
Political Science 349T Cuba and the United States

Other electives may likewise be considered as departments create new courses. However, students
should consult with the chair of Romance Languages before making any enrollment decisions.

PLACEMENT

   A placement test in Spanish is administered at Williams at the opening of the fall semester. In-
coming first-year students who wish to register for any Spanish courses above the 101 level must
take this test.

STUDY ABROAD

   Spanish majors, as well as non-majors interested in further exposure to the language and the cul-
ture, are strongly encouraged to include study in Spain or Latin America as part of their program at
Williams. Through its special ties with the Hamilton College Academic Year in Spain, the depart-
ment offers a comprehensive linguistic and cultural experience in a Spanish-speaking environment,
for periods either of a semester or a year. Credit for up to two courses per semester overseas can be
granted toward the Spanish major. Students interested in study abroad should consult with a mem-
ber of the department at their earliest convenience.

RLSP 208(S) The Spanish Civil War in Literature and Film
The Spanish Civil War (1936-39) has generated a vast bibliography and filmography that reflects
widely antagonistic interpretations. The ideals and passions of this war have not subsided, and in-
deed have been recreated and relived time and again in art and literature. On a world level it was the
first clear clash between democracy and totalitarianism. From the Spanish perspective, it remains
the most important single event in understanding modern Spain. The course will begin with a histor-
ical introduction to the origins, development, and outcome of the war, then concentrate on the poet-
ic and personal accounts of mostly Spanish authors, as reflected in poetry, short fiction, novels, and
films. Readings by Ayala, Sénder, Aub, Andújar, Goytisolo, Matute, Neruda, Alberti, Machado,
and others. Classic and contemporary films, as well as documentaries, will be shown each week.

RLSP 401(F) Senior Seminar: Studies in Spanish Literature--Madrid: De Siglo a Siglo

It is difficult to reconcile the radically different identities Madrid has assumed over the past hundred

years. Does the Madrid Ernest Hemingway once called "the capital of the world" have any connec-

tion to the isolated Madrid of the post Civil War? In this course, we will examine the significance of

Madrid as a reflection of Spain-both in times of freedom, and in times of censorship. Madrid has

both been represented, and in turn, shaped by literary works. Beginning with the late-nineteenth

century and the Madrid of Galdós, we will work our way through the city during the turn of century,

the Civil War, the Franco era, the transition to democracy, and la movida. We will consider the dif-

ferent incarnations of the urban landscape as they reflect the vision of each particular author, as well

as socio-economic and political events of the period. Materials will include novels, theater, short

stories, poetry, articles, and films. We will read works by Galdós, Baroja, Buero Vallejo, Cela,

Martín Santos, Umbral, J.J. Millás, Grandes, and others. Evaluation will be based on active student

participation in class discussions, oral reports, and two short papers. Conducted in Spanish. Prereq-

uisite: any 300-level course or permission of the instructor. Expected enrollment: 8.

Hour: 1:10-2:25 MR                                                                     FOX

RLSP 402(S) Studies in Modern Latin-American Literature*+

In the early-twentieth century the concept of "the Modern" was alternately exhilarating and bewil-

dering, inspiring and disturbing for Spanish American writers. This course will examine various

responses to modernity and modernization in Spanish American literature from 1900-1945, con-

sidering such topics as urbanization, immigration, neo-imperialism, social revolution, and the con-

flict between foreign and indigenous cultural forms. Writers to be considered include modernistas

José Martí and Rubén Darío; vanguard poets César Vallejo, Alfonsina Storni, and Oliverio Giron-

do; novelists Mariano Azuela, José Eustasio Rivera, and Miguel Angel Asturias; story-writers Ho-

racio Quiroga, María Luisa Bombal, Eduardo Mallea, and Jorge Borges; editor and memoirist Vic-

toria Ocampo.

Requirements: midterm and final exams, one 5-page paper and one 15-page paper, a presentation

on one of the writers or literary movements being studied, and participation in class discussions.

Expected enrollment: 12.

LANGUAGE STUDY
   The department provides language instruction to enable the student to acquire all four linguistic

skills: understanding, speaking, reading, and writing. Russian 101-W088-102 covers the basics of
Russian grammar. Russian 103 and 104 offer additional instruction in grammar and provide exten-
sive practice in reading and conversation. Russian 201 and 202 aim to develop facility in speaking,
writing, and reading.

STUDY ABROAD
   The department strongly encourages students desiring to attain fluency in Russian to spend a se-

mester or year studying in Russia or one of the former Soviet republics. Students generally apply to
one of several approved foreign study programs. Russian 104 or the equivalent and junior standing
are normally prerequisite for study abroad.

LITERATURE AND CULTURE IN TRANSLATION
   The department regularly offers courses on Russian literature and culture in English for those

students who have little or no knowledge of Russian, but who wish to become acquainted with the
major achievements in Russian literary and cultural history.

THE CERTIFICATE IN RUSSIAN
   To enhance a student's educational and professional profiles, the Certificate in Russian offers a

useful tool for using the language in a wide variety of disciplines. The sequence of language and

culture courses is designed to supplement a student's major at Williams by enabling the student to
expand his or her knowledge in a related field.

   The course of study for the certificate gives credit for Russian 101 and 102, which do not count
toward the major. Students who enter Williams with previous training in Russian may substitute
more advanced courses for the 100- and 200-level courses; they can also be exempted from up to
two of the required courses. Thus, in order to earn a certificate a student must take no fewer than five
courses (including three language courses) after enrolling at Williams.

   Students must receive a minimum grade of B in each course taken in the sequence. In addition,
they must receive a score of at least 85% on a standardized language proficiency test administered
by the department.

abroad.

Russian Studies
   Russian Studies offers students an interdisciplinary approach to the intellectual and cultural history

of Russia and the former Soviet republics. Students complete the major by combining courses in Rus-
sian language and literature with courses in history, political science, music, economics, and art.

   The Russian Studies major consists of ten courses. Students selecting the major must normally
complete Russian 202 or the equivalent by the end of the junior year. Majors will normally be ex-
pected to take the 400-level seminar offered in their senior year, even if they have previously taken
another version.

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN RUSSIAN

   At the beginning of the second semester of the senior year, students may nominate themselves to
candidacy for the degree with honors. By the end of the junior year at the latest, however, they will
have established in consultation with the department their qualifications for embarking on the proj-
ect, the pattern of study to be followed, and the standards of performance.

   Students earn a degree with honors by submitting a senior thesis (493- W031-494) of honors
quality.

RUSS 203(F) Nineteenth-Century Russian Literature in Translation (Same as Comparative
Literature 203)
Literature provided the primary medium for political, philosophical, and religious debate in nine-
teenth-century Russia. It was also one of the major fora through which "Russia" could begin to de-
fine itself as a nation, tied to, but distinct from, Western Europe. For a long time, Russian authors
had relied quite heavily on foreign literary models for inspiration and direction, and it was only in
the early part of the nineteenth century that a specifically "Russian" tradition could be seen to em-
erge. In addition to its task of introducing major Russian authors and their ideas, this course will
seek to examine the rise of Russian literature as such, its key movements and their proponents, and
the recurring theme of "Russianness" and national identity. Readings by Karamzin, Chaadaev,
Pushkin, Gogol, Goncharov, Turgenev, Dostoevsky, and Chekhov. All readings will be in English.

RUSS 206(S) Topics in Russian Culture: Feasting and Fasting in Russian History

This course will use the methodology of food history to explore the broader historical, economic,

and artistic conditions that gave rise to Russian culture. We will examine culinary practice as well as

the social context of cooking and eating in Russia. In order to elucidate the important interplay be-

tween culture and cuisine, we will discuss such issues as the domestic roles of women and serfs, the

etiquette of the table, the role of drinking and temperance movements, and the importance of feasts

and fasts in the Russian Orthodox Church calendar. Short stories, memoirs, and cookery books will

provide insight into class and gender differences, cooking techniques, and the specific tastes that

characterize Russian cuisine. This class will present Russian culture from a predominantly domes-

tic point of view that originates from the wooden spoon as much as from the scepter. Knowledge of

Russian is not required.

Requirements: several short written assignments and class presentations and a final project involv-

ing research in some aspect of Russian culinary history and participation in a communal feast.

twentieth century. Our viewing will include a wide variety of cinematic genres, as well as Russia's

most influential film directors, such as Sergei Eisenstein, Dziga Vertov, Andrei Tarkovskii, and

Nikita Mikhalkov. As part of our effort to understand Russian films in their own context, we will

read ground-breaking texts on Russian cinematic theory, critical responses to directors and their

films, as well as historical examinations of the development of Russian film. Primary course read-

ings will be in Russian, with some secondary readings in English. Class sessions will be conducted

RUSS 402(S) Senior Seminar: Spectacles on His Nose, and Autumn in His Heart-The

World of Isaac Babel

Known alternately as "master of the short story" and the "Russian Maupassant," Isaac Babel was one

of the most intriguing and gripping authors of early Soviet Russia. Although he was in no way prolific,

Babel's writing was very popular in his lifetime, both in Russia and abroad. Still, though he continues

to be widely read by Russians, his name in the West is often overshadowed by Bulgakov, Pasternak,

and Solzhenitsyn. By way of Babel's life and work, this course will examine what it meant to be a

Russian, a Jew, and a non-party author in the 1920s and 1930s. Babel's writing was extremely varied:

he wrote sketches, newspaper articles, short stories, plays, and movie scripts. Among others, primary

readings will include the two cycles Red Cavalry and Tales of Odessa, some early sketches, such as

his literary manifesto Odessa, a great number of his autobiographical and other short stories, the play

Maria, and a selection of his letters. We will also read some reminiscences on Babel by his contempo-

raries, and this will broaden our understanding of the man, the writer, and his era. All course readings

will be in the original, and class will be conducted entirely in Russian.

Format: seminar. Requirements: active class participation, frequent short writing assignments, class

presentations, and a final research project.

   Science and Technology Studies (SCST) is an interdisciplinary program concerned with science
and technology and their relationship to society. In addition to being concerned with the historical
development and a philosophical understanding of the ideas and institutions of science and technol-
ogy; Science and Technology Studies also examines their ethical, economic, social, and political
implications.

   The role that science and technology have played in shaping modern industrial societies is gener-
ally acknowledged, but few members of those societies, including scientists and engineers, possess
any understanding of how that process has occurred or much knowledge of the complex technical
and social interactions that direct change in either science or society. The Science and Technology
Studies Program is intended to help create a coherent course of study for students interested in these
questions by providing a broad range of perspectives. At the present time courses are offered which
examine the history or philosophy of science and technology, the sociology and psychology of sci-
ence, the economics of research and development and technological change, science and public
policy, technology assessment, technology and the environment, scientometrics, and ethical-value
issues.

   To complete the requirements of the program, students must complete six courses. The introduc-
tory course and senior seminar are required and three elective courses are chosen from the list of
designated electives. Students may choose to concentrate their electives in a single area such as
technology, American studies, philosophy, history of science, economics, environment, current
science, or current technology, but are encouraged to take at least one elective in history, history of
science, or philosophy. The sixth course necessary to complete the program is one semester of labo-
ratory or field science in addition to the College's three-course science requirement. Other science
courses of particular interest include Chemistry 110 and Biology 134.

   The program is administered by a chair and an advisory committee of faculty who teach in the
program. Students who wish to enroll normally register with the chair by the fall of their junior year.

gies by employing a case study approach. They then apply these methods to a major research proj-

ect. Students may choose topics from fields such as biotechnology, computers, biomedical engi-

neering, energy, and other resource development. Students will apply their background of histori-

cal, philosophical, and technological perspectives in carrying out their study.

Requirements: research paper or project.

   As a reflection of the theatre's historical relationship to literature and the arts, stage production is
studied in the context of the literary and artistic movements which have informed theatrical endeav-
or. The major in Theatre emphasizes the collaborative nature of the discipline by drawing upon
courses offered by faculty of the Language, Literature, Music, and Art Departments. Although stu-
dents will be equipped to proceed to graduate and professional schools in theatre, the major is pri-
marily directed toward those interested in studying the theatre as an artistic phenomenon and as an
interpretive tool. Because a deep understanding of theatre requires training and experience with the
synthesis on stage, the major includes curricular study of production and performance, as well as
continued participation in departmental stage production.

   Williamstheatre, the production arm of the Department of Theatre, operates under the supervi-
sion of the departmental faculty. Major departmental productions as well as laboratory and exper-

   The department strongly recommends that students elect additional collateral courses in dramat-
ic literature taught by the English and modern language departments, and courses in opera taught by
the Music Department. Students with an interest in theatre design should particularly elect Art Stu-
dio courses in drawing.

   Production requirement for the major: All majors in Theatre are required to participate in a mini-
mum of eight productions in addition to the laboratory requirement for Theatre 102. Participation in
at least three of the eight must be in technical production, and one must be in stage management.
Assignment to productions is normally made in consultation with the department and chair.

   Theatre majors are strongly urged to include dance and fencing in fulfilling their Physical Educa-
tion requirements.

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN THEATRE
   Candidates for Honors will apply for admission through the submission of a portfolio to the De-

partment Chair by February of their junior year, as well as a description of their proposed project.
The portfolio will be comprised of four parts:

   1. The first part will include a list of the courses students have taken relevant to their work towards the
      major, This list will include courses offered by the Theatre Department, but may also include classes
      taken other Departments. Students should also list and describe relevant independent studies and pro-
      duction credits.

   2. The second part of the portfolio will include a selection of materials developed for these courses and
      productions listed in Part 1. The selection should include at least three papers or samples of other
      written work, and might also include design projects, directors notebooks, studio art projects, actor's

      journals or other forms of documentation of the candidate's work. For students who have taken a
      semester away, it is particularly important that they provide the Department with a detailed picture of
      their activities while studying off-campus. Course descriptions and syllabi should be submitted in
      addition to a list of courses taken and activities performed.

   3. The third part of the portfolio is a annotated bibliography of dramatic texts which the student has
      read, drawn from a list supplied by the Department. Annotations should reflect a particular angle of
      engagement with the text, that reflects the area or areas that the student has chosen to emphasize in
      their theatrical training. For instance, one might choose to write from the point of view of an actor, a
      designer, a director, a playwright, or a dramaturg.

   4. The portfolio should conclude with a retrospective essay that reflects on the materials that are being
      submitted. Students should look for connections between the various aspects of their work, state any
      theoretical positions that they have come to embrace, assess their strengths and weaknesses, and dis-
      cuss their educational goals for their work with the Department during their Senior year.

   The portfolio will be examined alongside the student's record and their project description; a de-
termination will then be made as to their admission into the Honors program. Students intending to
apply for Honors, should meet with the Department Chair by the end of the fall semester of their
junior year.

THEA 101(F) Introduction to Theatre

The course will look at dramatic texts in relation to their production potential. Students will read 10

to 12 plays taken from various periods and cultures, and 'see' them on the stages of their imagina-

tions. The plays to be studied will also be seen in the context of some of the important theatrical

traditions and theories from which they emerged or which they helped influence.

There will be a practical element to the course--a Wednesday lab during which students will work

in groups on various theatrical assignments. There will be some acting (you do NOT have to be an

actor or even WANT to be an actor to take this course), some directing, and some designing--all at

the basic level.

Format: lecture course with a practical lab. Students will be assessed on their level of participation,

their attendance in class and their collaboration within smaller groups. There will be 2 two-page

papers--responses to the productions seen at the AMT during the semester, and a final assignment

--either practical or paper.

This course is a prerequisite for Theatre 203 and 301. No enrollment limit (expected: 50-70).

Hour: 9:55-11:10 TR              Lab: 1:10-3:50 W                                          EPPEL

THEA 102(S) Introduction to Technical Theatre

As an overview of performance spaces, play technologies, and production, the course will examine

how and where plays are performed, produced, and designed. Students will attend lectures, partici-

pate in labs in drafting and technical production, and will be required to participate on the produc-

tion crew of one or more departmental productions.

Prerequisite: Theatre 101. This course is a prerequisite for Theatre 201.

Hour: 8:30-9:45 TR, 1:10-3:50 W                                                         CATALANO

THEA 201(F) The Design Response

A study of theatrical design modes and concepts. This course will deal with the formation of a de-

sign response to playtexts and other dramatic materials, and the translation of that response into

scenery, lighting and costumes. Students will study the development of images that communicate

with other theatre artists and the audience to convey feeling and meaning.

The course will aim to develop overall visual design skills, study the techniques employed in devis-

ing set, costume and lighting, as well as the ways in which they can interrelate to form a unified

design. To this end, we will stress the development of verbal and visual communication skills to

convey design ideas, and study process (individual and collaborative) as well as product.

Evaluation will be based on weekly projects, a larger final project and class participation in discus-

sions and labs. All visual presentations will be accompanied by short written assignments.

Prerequisite: Theatre 102 or ArtS 100 or ArtS 103 or permission of the instructor. This course is a

prerequisite for Theatre 307 and all upper-level design courses. Enrollment limit: 12.

THEA 211(S) Topics in African-American Performance: Theatre, Film, and Dance of the

Harlem Renaissance (Same as American Studies 211)*

From 1919 to 1929, Harlem in New York City was "in vogue." The rate of African-American cultural

production of theatre, film, and dance was astounding during this period, known also as The Negro Awak-

ening and the Decade of the New Negro. At the onset of the decade, there were around twenty published

plays by African-Americans; by the end, the number increased to over eighty. W. E. B. Du Bois, in his

tireless promotion of African-American artists, put out the call for plays to "depict our life, experience and

humor." Twenty plays with African-American themes appeared on Broadway, five written by African-

Americans. The Broadway theatre pieces most often consisted of black musical revues--the precursors to

the American musical--and featured the best black performers of the day in year-long runs. Most revues,

such as Shuffle Along and Blackbirds, featured cakewalk and tap dancing and the music of the jazz age. In

addition, African-American film production companies, makers of "race" films, were flourishing, headed

by the visionary filmmaker Oscar Micheaux and numbering over one hundred by the end of the decade.

In this course, we will explore these cultural productions of the era of the Harlem Renaissance in relation to

their place in African-American performance history. What happened in African-American performance

during this period has arguably influenced all black artistic production since then, and we will examine this

argument in depth. In addition, we will consider the fluidity between the forms of theatre, film, and dance

and also between performance and the thriving literary scene, with luminaries such as Langston Hughes

and Zora Neale Hurston, who both wrote plays as well as novels, poetry and essays.

Students will be evaluated on the basis of class participation, presentations, and a semester-long research

project.

No prerequisites.

Hour: 9:55-11:10 TR                                                                                BEAN

THEA 215(F) Femininity on Stage (Same as Comparative Literature 213 and English 215)

This survey course will look at the construction of femininity on stage. Theatre has always been a

place where the construction of the gender identity of women has readily happened, with or without

their participation. The course will consider the works of women playwrights from Aphra Behn

(The Rover, 1677-1681) to Diana Son (Stop Kiss, 2000) as cultural commentary. In addition, we will

look at plays that have made significant statements about the role of women in society, such as Euri-

pides' The Trojan Women, Shakespeare's Taming of the Shrew, Dion Boucicault's The Octoroon,

and Rodgers and Hammerstein's South Pacific. Finally, we will explore the work of contemporary

feminist playwrights.

Format: seminar. Students will be evaluated on the basis of class participation, a midterm exam, and

several short position papers.

No prerequisites. No enrollment limit (expected: 20).

Hour: 11:20-12:35 TR                                                                BEAN

THEA 216(S) Writing for the Theatre

Performance" process. Students will be expected to share in each other's work on a weekly basis.

Evaluation will be based on attendance, completion of class assignments, and class participation.

Permission of instructor required. Enrollment limit: 15.

introduction to the field of performance studies and its theoretical bases in anthropology, dramatic

theory, poststructuralism, psychoanalytic theory, folklore, religion, cultural studies, literary theory,

religion, philosophy, feminist theory, and queer theory. In addition to reading and discussing theory,

local live and recorded performances will be considered. Williams faculty who are advisory faculty

for the Performance Studies Cluster (see page 252 of the course catalog) will give guest lectures.

The course will culminate in the showing of students' final projects.

THEA 401(F) Advanced Project in Theatre

To complete the degree in theatre, majors are required to complete an independent project for their

senior year, either in fall (THEA 401) or in the spring (THEA 402). In the fall of the junior year,

students should propose several possible projects to the Department, which may or may not include

a production component. Part of THEA 301 (The Junior Seminar) will be devoted to guiding senior

project proposals. By the end of the fall semester in the junior year, final proposals should be sub-

mitted for consideration by the Department. Collaborative projects between two or more seniors are

preferable. A collaborative project involving the entire class is also a possibility, and this should be

discussed with the Chair of the Department early in the junior year. The schedule in the junior year

for proposals for the senior theatre project is:

1) Initial, BRIEF proposals (several per student) submitted to the Department by October 17, 2001.

2) Proposals reviewed by the Department and returned to the students for revision by November 1.

3) Final proposals submitted by students to the Department by December 1.

THE NATIONAL THEATRE INSTITUTE

   The Department of Theatre is affiliated with the National Theatre Institute, which offers addi-
tional theatre study through its resident semester program. The Institute is fully accredited by Con-
necticut College and is a member of the Twelve-College Exchange. Limited numbers of Williams
students can therefore be selected to take a full semester of intensive theatre study at the NTI, lo-
cated at the Eugene O'Neill Memorial Theatre Centre in Waterford, Connecticut. During the se-
mester, students from participating colleges live and work as members of a theatre company gain-
ing experience with professional theatre artists in a workshop environment. Early application is es-
sential.

   Women's and Gender Studies can be defined as the study of how gender is constructed, how it is
inflected by differences of race, ethnicity, sexuality, class, etc., how gender affects the experiences
and situations of men and women, and how assumptions about gender influence the construction of
knowledge and experience. The program in Women's and Gender Studies is therefore open to stu-
dents majoring in a wide variety of disciplines who wish to focus in a coherent way on gender is-
sues. The program is designed to introduce students to scholarship in Women's and Gender Studies,
which has brought neglected material into established fields and raised important methodological
questions about sex and gender that cross disciplinary boundaries and challenge established intel-
lectual frameworks.

THE CONCENTRATION
   To fulfill the requirements for a concentration in the Women's and Gender Studies Program, stu-

dents will take five courses. Women's and Gender Studies 101, Introduction to Women's and Gen-
der Studies, introduces students to major works in the development of modern feminist thought and
to issues central to Women's and Gender Studies. Students are encouraged to take Women's and
Gender Studies 101 in their first or second year. In addition, students elect three Women's and Gen-
der Studies courses from at least two departments. Electives will vary according to the course offer-
ings each year. Students may develop a student-initiated course as an elective. In order to confront
the breadth of issues raised by Women's and Gender Studies as an interdisciplinary mode of inquiry,
students are advised to distribute their choices as widely as possible. In their junior or senior year,
after taking Women's and Gender Studies 101 and two electives, one of which may be taken concur-
rently, students are required to take a Women's and Gender Studies seminar, in which they will write
a substantial essay or develop a project in an area of special interest. This seminar explores topics in
Women's and Gender Studies. The topic varies from year-to-year. Under exceptional circum-
stances, the chair can allow an Independent Study to substitute for the seminar. Students may take
more than one seminar, space permitting.

   Students are urged to declare a concentration in the Women's and Gender Studies Program by the
fall semester of their junior year. To do this, or to obtain further information about the program,
contact the Women's and Gender Studies chair, Stetson D13, x2305.

CONTRACT MAJOR IN WOMEN'S AND GENDER STUDIES
   In consultation with the chair of Women's and Gender Studies, students may develop a contract

major proposal in Women's or Gender Studies. Interested students should meet with the chair in the
first semester of the sophomore year. Students proposing a contract major should take Women's and
Gender Studies 101 and plan to take Women's and Gender Studies 402 in their junior or senior year.
Contract major proposals must be approved by the Committee on Educational Policy.

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN WOMEN'S AND GENDER STUDIES
   Honors in Women's and Gender Studies may be granted to concentrators or contract majors after

an approved candidate completes a thesis (493-W031, W031-494) or honors project (491-W030,
W030-492), delivers a public presentation of the work, and is awarded an honors grade by her/his
advisor and one other reader from the Women's and Gender Studies Program.

   The honors project may be one semester (plus winter study) or a year-long project. It may consist
of a conventional research thesis of 40-70 pages or of other modes of presentation (e.g., art, music,
poetry, theater, fiction). Proposals for non-thesis projects may include evidence of experience and
competence in the chosen mode.

   A student may become a candidate for honors in Women's and Gender Studies after the follow-
ing criteria are met:

   1) in April of the junior year, submission and Women's and Gender Studies Committee approval
of a 4- to 6-page project proposal, in which the ideas, aim, general methodology, and preliminary
bibliography for the project are outlined and a faculty advisor is named;

   2) at the end of the junior year, cumulative grade point average of B+ from courses in two of the
three academic divisions (humanities, social science, natural science);

   3) on the first day of classes of the senior year, submission and approval by the faculty advisor of a
5- to 10-page prospectus for the project.

   All honors work, including the public presentation will be graded by at least two faculty mem-
bers--a third will be consulted if there is a significant discrepancy between the first two graders.
Readers' grades will be averaged and honors will be awarded as follows: A+/A Highest Honors;
A-/B+ Honors.

WGST 402(S) Constructing Womanhood in Victorian Britain

This course is designed to enable advanced Women's Studies students to engage in common re-
search on interdisciplinary topics. Our popular image of Victorian womanhood is of a role that is
uniform and highly restrictive. In fact, though, "the woman question" in various forms and incarna-
tions was a hotly contested issue throughout the period, in art, literature, politics, religion and other
public discourses, with women taking active and public part in the contestation to an unprecedented
degree. This period also saw the emergence and/or public legitimation of a number of scientific and
social science disciplines--evolutionary biology, comparative anthropology, sociology, psycholo-
gy, physiology, and more--most of which turned their attention at some point or another to the vital
question of women's essential identity and proper role in society. All of these discourses were of

                            ­ 320 ­
Women's and Gender Studies, Critical Reasoning and Analytical Skills Courses

course also heavily inflected by issues of race and class. Our goal will be to gain a multifaceted

picture of the process of constructing and reconstructing womanhood in this period, with the partic-

ular avenues of inquiry to be determined by student interests.

Format: seminar. Requirements: weekly reading and occasional short papers and one substantial

research paper (15-20 pages) or final project. Students will present work-in-progress and be asked

to read and discuss one another's work.

Prerequisites: Women's and Gender Studies 101 and two electives (one of which may be taken in

the term in which the seminar is held.) Enrollment limit:20. Preference given to seniors.

                       ANALYTICAL SKILLS (CRAAS) COURSES

   To one degree or another, every class at Williams goes beyond its subject--be it mathematics,
Machiavelli, or modernism--to teach intellectual skills that have wide application in other fields as
well as outside of the academy: scientific reckoning, expository writing, rhetorical analysis, oral
presentation, and so on.

   Courses offered under the CRAAS initiative--those with a tilde symbol (~) following the course
title--foreground such analytical skills. While each CRAAS class covers a different topic, all are
aimed particularly at developing the processes necessary for excellence in a range of fields: tech-
niques for analyzing ideas, data, texts or artworks; approaches to interpreting, synthesizing, and
developing arguments; strategies for presenting ideas and results.

   CRAAS classes typically emphasize the practices of meta-analysis--self-criticism, editing, and
revision--with the goal of constant improvement. Many classes feature peer tutoring, small group
work, and intensive one-on-one engagement with the professor. Students should leave a CRAAS
course with a substantially heightened ability to approach problems, analyze texts, and craft argu-
ments in whatever discipline they may go on to explore.

   A few CRAAS courses are restricted to advanced students, but the majority are open to all, and
some are specifically targeted for first year students. Most have strictly limited enrollment. Because
these classes cultivate the general strategies of effective scholarship, students are encouraged to
consider taking a CRAAS course early in their academic careers.

                     PEOPLES AND CULTURES COURSES

   The peoples and cultures requirement is intended to help students to begin to understand the
cultural diversity of American society and the world at large, so that, as citizens of an increasingly
interconnected world, they may become better able to respond sensitively and intelligently to
peoples of varied social backgrounds and cultural frameworks. Courses which fulfill this require-
ment are thus designed to familiarize students with some dimension of American cultural diversity
or that of the non-Western world. Each student must complete one graded semester course primari-
ly concerned with: (a) the peoples and cultures of North America that trace their origins to Africa,
Asia, Latin America, Oceania, or the Caribbean; Native-American peoples and cultures; or (b) the
peoples and cultures of Africa, Asia, Latin America, Oceania, or the Caribbean. Although this
course, which may be counted toward the divisional distribution requirement, may be completed
any semester before graduation, students are urged to complete the course by the end of the sopho-
more year.

                          RELATED COURSE LISTINGS

   There are a number of significant areas of studies in which Williams offers many relevant courses, yet
no formal program. To alert students to the opportunity for integrating courses from diverse disciplines into
a focus area and to encourage them to do so, the courses in this section are organized as lists of topic-related
courses. For their full descriptions, see the respective departmental sections.

Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual Studies
   Gay, lesbian, and bisexual studies focuses on the social construction of sexuality, past and pres-

ent. Although, at present, Williams does not have a formal concentration in gay, lesbian, and bi-
sexual studies, the College offers a number of courses which examine how social, cultural, and
political institutions shape sexualities, as well as the responses and resistances thereto, through a
variety of texts and contexts. The following courses include significant components on gay, les-
bian, and bisexual studies (at least two weeks out of the semester).

                        WRITING-INTENSIVE COURSES

   Courses designated as "writing-intensive"--those with a plus symbol (+) following the course
title--stress the process of learning to write effectively. Such courses include a substantial amount
of writing (cumulatively, at least 20 pages), usually divided into several discrete assignments. Nor-
mally, one or more of these assignments are returned to students for revision and resubmission.
Instructors pay close attention to matters of punctuation, grammar, style, and the construction of

                           Director, Professor CHRISTOPHER M. WATERS

THE PROGRAMME
   Williams College offers a year-long programme of studies at Oxford University in co-operation

with Exeter College, Oxford. Based at Ephraim Williams House in North Oxford, the Programme is
designed to integrate students into the intellectual and social life of one of the world's greatest uni-
versities. It uses the Oxford tutorial system and follows the Oxford three-term calendar. The resi-
dent director administers Ephraim Williams House, oversees the academic programme, and serves
as both academic and personal advisor to the students.

   Students in the Oxford Programme enroll for the full academic year, which consists of the Mich-
aelmas, Hilary, and Trinity terms. These are each eight weeks long (running from early October to
early December, mid-January to mid-March, late April to mid-June), and there are two intervening
six-week vacations during which students may be expected to continue reading as preparation for
upcoming tutorials.

   Over the course of the three terms, students normally take four full tutorials and one half tutorial,
although some choose to substitute a fifth full tutorial for the half tutorial.

THE CURRICULUM
   In addition to extensive opportunities to pursue British and Commonwealth studies, the Pro-

gramme offers instruction in other fields for which Oxford is particularly noted or which are repre-
sented only marginally or infrequently in the Williams curriculum. Special provision is made for
accommodating student interests or curricular needs that extend beyond the fields of study listed
below. No disciplinary or departmental interest, therefore, is necessarily excluded. Instruction is by
tutorial, often supplemented by attending a programme of lectures or seminars from among the rich
array sponsored by the University each term.

   In summary, all students enrolled in the Oxford Programme are required to complete four full
tutorials and one half tutorial

TUTORIALS

   Students elect four full tutorials and one half tutorial, and sometimes, five full tutorials, during
the academic year. A full tutorial consists of eight tutorial sessions, and a half tutorial of four tutorial
sessions. These are weekly meetings of one or two students with an Oxford tutor at which the stu-
dent presents an essay on an assigned topic with discussion focusing on that topic. Eight essays in
all will be written for each full tutorial subject and four for each half-tutorial subject. At the start of
the term tutors will assign a list of readings, which students will be expected to complete on their
own during term time and the vacation. Students may be encouraged to follow a pertinent lecture
course offered by the University in the general area of the tutorial subject.

lical studies, chemistry, applied mathematics, nineteenth- and twentieth-century English history,
physics, psychology, social anthropology, theology). For a full description of subjects offered regu-
larly at Oxford University students should consult the most recent edition of University of Oxford
Examination Decrees and Regulations, a copy of which is available in the Dean's Office. Students
requesting a specially arranged tutorial must indicate as a backup choice one of the tutorial offer-
ings from 211-282, and realize that it may not prove possible to accommodate their requests.
A sample list of recent specially arranged tutorials, by discipline: Anthropology: Anthropological
Analysis and Interpretation; Archaeology: Anglo-Saxon Archaeology, Archaeology of Mesopota-
mia; Biology: Mammalian Genetics; Chemistry: Physical Chemistry; Classics: Cicero the Orator,
Homer's Odyssey, Roman History; English: Creative Writing, Irish Writers, Women's Writing, Mod-
ern Critical Theory; History: Imperialism and Nationalism 1830-1966, Military Tactics and Strate-
gy in Europe; Intellect and Culture in Victorian England; Ottoman Empire 1566-1807; Law: Juris-
prudence; Maths: Number Theory; Statistics; Political Science: Comparative Government, Great
Power Politics 1776-1919; Religion: Christian Ethics, The Four Gospels, Old Testament Biblical
Narrative; Studio Art: Figure Painting.

Grades and Credits

   Grades for each tutorial reflect the mark assigned to all eight (or four) tutorial sessions, including
their related essays, considered together, as well as the mark for the final examination on work ac-
complished in the tutorial and supplementary reading. Final examinations are three hours in the
case of full tutorials and two hours in the case of half tutorials. The final grade recorded on the Wil-
liams transcript is calculated by counting the tutorial mark as two-thirds and the final examination
mark as one-third.

   Upon satisfactory completion of the requirements for the Williams College Oxford Programme
students receive academic credit for a full Williams academic year. Grades are incorporated into
their Williams transcript and are included in the computation of their GPA.

   Tutorials may be used toward fulfilling the divisional distribution requirement; a student may earn
a year maximum of three distribution credits, with no more than one from each division, for the year.

NON-CREDIT FOREIGN LANGUAGE STUDY

   In addition to their required tutorials, students may begin or continue the study of a wide range of
foreign languages on a non-credit basis through a variety of arrangements available through the
University as well as a number of other educational and cultural institutions in the city of Oxford.
The Programme normally subsidizes such study.

STUDENT LIFE

   The Williams College Oxford Programme offers students every opportunity to integrate fully into
life at Oxford. The University offers access to an exceptional variety of sports, societies, interest
groups, activities, and cultural events. Students are closely associated with their counterparts at Exeter
College, are able the share in the social life of the College, to use its athletic facilities, and to dine in
Hall during the week. They have access to the University's athletic events, concerts, theatrical produc-
tions, museums, and to some of its many libraries. All may become members of the Oxford Union
Debating Society, which, in addition to its debating activities and club rooms, possesses dining facili-
ties and the largest lending library in the University. Students are housed (in doubles) at Ephraim Wil-
liams House, which is equipped with its own library, computer lab, and common rooms as well as with
laundry and dining facilities, and which serves one catered dinner a week during the term. The house
is within easy walking distance of the University Parks, convenient to the Summertown complex of
shops and restaurants, and about five minutes by bicycle to the heart of the University.

   There is an orientation period in October before the beginning of the academic year to help ac-
quaint students with Oxford and the opportunities and challenges they will meet during the year.
Throughout the academic year, provision will be made for day trips to such nearby points of interest
as Stratford, Stonehenge, Bath, Wells, Chepstow Castle and Tintern Abbey, and Parliament in Lon-
don. Students will also attend a number of theatre productions and other cultural events. In addition,
Oxford's proximity to London gives students ready access to that city's multiple attractions and
resources. The Oxford-London train service is an hourly one, and the journey takes just over an
hour. Buses run even more frequently, and the journey takes about an hour and a half.

ILLNESS AND INSURANCE

   You must be covered either by the Williams College student health insurance policy or some oth-
er comprehensive insurance plan (generally your family's health insurance). While in the U.K., you
will be covered under the National Health Service (N.H.S.) for routine visits at the Exeter College
group medical practice and for emergency hospital treatment. Prescription drugs are available
through the NHS at a nominal fee. There are only limited outpatient psychological counseling ser-
vices available through the NHS and the Oxford Programme. Any extensive or long-term counsel-
ing would have to be covered by your personal health insurance policy. Finally, you are not likely to
be covered under the NHS for medical services received in other foreign countries, especially non-
European Community countries.

FEES

   The tuition and room fees for the Programme are equivalent to those for a year at Williams. Stu-
dents are responsible for their own transportation, most of their meals, and personal expenses. For
planning purposes, students and their parents should expect the cost of a year on the Williams Col-
lege Oxford Programme to be about the same as a year at Williams. Financial aid eligibility will be
figured on the usual basis of tuition, fees, room, board, and personal and book expenses just as if the
student were at Williams. Similarly, the normal self-help contribution would be expected. Since the
academic year ends later at Oxford than at Williams, the summer earning expectation for the fol-
lowing year will be reduced by one half and the difference made up by additional Williams aid.

APPLICATION

   Admission to the Programme is on a competitive but flexible basis. Students must apply to the
Dean's Office by the prescribed deadline (normally in February) and, prior to applying, should con-
sult with the chair of their major department. They can expect to be notified of acceptance before
Spring break. It is the normal expectation that they will have completed the College's distribution
requirement by the end of their sophomore year. The Admissions Committee takes the GPA into
account and expects applicants to have demonstrated capacity for independent work. Applicants
must identify two Williams faculty members who are willing to provide references (the committee
will not request those faculty members to write letters but will contact them). Because of the empha-
sis at Oxford on written work, at least one of these faculty members should be able to offer an assess-
ment of the applicant's writing ability.

                    WILLIAMS PROGRAM IN TEACHING

   The Williams Program in Teaching is designed to address two goals:

   1) To enable Williams undergraduates to study the ideas, questions, and practices involved in good
      teaching, and to earn certification to teach in public schools.

   2) To promote and facilitate an exchange of ideas about teachers, learners and schools, within and be-
      yond the Williams campus.

   In order to meet the first goal, we have embarked on a partnership with our neighboring college,
MCLA, long devoted to the preparation of schoolteachers. Williams students interested in earning
certification must talk to the Director of the Program in Teaching (Susan Engel, x4522), in order to
discuss how to meet the requirements of this program.

In broad outline:
   In addition to choosing and fulfilling requirements for a Liberal Arts major, students seeking cer-

tification must also take the following courses some time during their four years:
--Psychology 334 The Psychology of Education,
--a 30-hour prepracticum in teaching,
--a course on reading in a specific content area,
--a course on classroom management, and
--a course on adolescent development.
--a course on instruction and curriculum.
(Several of these requirements can be met during winter study.)

   Students must also make a formal application to the MCLA teaching program (this is easily done
with the guidance of their advisor and Susan Engel). Acceptance into this entitles them to enroll for
a required post-BA semester at MCLA, during which time they will fulfill the supervised teaching
practicum necessary to earn certification.

   In addition, students who want to study teaching and possibly pursue a career in teaching, but not
seek certification, should contact Susan Engel to find out more about student teaching options, reg-
ular semester courses, winter study opportunities and special events sponsored by the Program of
Teaching.

                           WINTER STUDY PROGRAM

                      REMINDERS ABOUT WSP REGISTRATION

   All students who will be on campus during the 2001-2002 academic year must register for WSP.
Registration will take place in the early part of fall semester. If you are registered for a senior thesis
in the fall which must be continued through Winter Study by departmental rules, you will be regis-
tered for your Winter Study Project automatically. In every other case, you must complete registra-
tion. First-year students are required to participate in a Winter Study that will take place on campus;
they are not allowed to do 99's.

   Even if you plan to take a 99, or the instructor of your first choice accepts you during the registra-
tion period, there are many things that can happen between registration and the beginning of Winter
Study to upset your first choice, so you must list five choices. You should try to make one of your
choices a project with a larger enrollment, not that it will guarantee you a project, but it will increase
your chances.

   If you think your time may be restricted in any way (ski meets, interviews, etc.), clear these re-
strictions with the instructor before signing up for his/her project.

   Remember, for cross-listed projects, you should sign up for the subject you want to appear on
your record.

   For many beginning language courses, you are required to take the WSP Sustaining Program in
addition to your regular project. You will be automatically enrolled in this Sustaining Program, so
no one should list this as a choice.

   The grade of honors is reserved for outstanding or exceptional work. Individual instructors may
specify minimum standards for the grade, but normally, fewer than one out of ten students will qual-
ify. A grade of pass means the student has performed satisfactorily. A grade of perfunctory pass
signifies that a student's work has been significantly lacking but is just adequate to deserve a pass.

   If you have any questions about a project, see the instructor before you register.
   Finally, all work for WSP must be completed and submitted to the instructor no later than Friday,
January 25th. Only the Dean can grant an extension beyond this date.

                                WINTER STUDY 99'S

   Sophomores, juniors and seniors are eligible to propose "99's," independent projects arranged
with faculty sponsors, conducted in lieu of regular Winter Study courses. Perhaps you have encoun-
tered an interesting idea in one of your courses which you would like to study in more depth, or you
may have an interest not covered in the regular curriculum. In recent years students have undertak-
en in-depth studies of particular literary works, interned in government offices, assisted in foreign
and domestic medical clinics, conducted field work in economics in developing countries, and giv-
en performances illustrating the history of American dance. Although some 99's involve travel
away from campus, there are many opportunities to pursue intellectual or artistic goals here in Wil-
liamstown.

   99 forms are available online:
                       http://www.williams.edu/Registrar/winterstudy/99direct.html

   The deadline for submitting the proposals to faculty sponsors is Thursday, 27 September.

                AFRICAN AND MIDDLE EASTERN STUDIES

AMES 026 Experiencing Africa and the Middle East
The AMES program is developing opportunities in Africa and the Middle East for WSP. At present
there are possibilities for one or more students to work with NGOs in Zimbabwe and to observe
Peace Corps efforts in Burkina Faso. Students interested in the details of this and any other opportu-
nities should consult with the chair of African and Middle Eastern Studies in September. Interested
students will be asked to submit a formal application and to do preparatory work under the chair's
supervision during the fall semester. Arrangements for travel, residency, and project will be worked
out in consultation with the student, the chair, and our on site contacts.
The project will culminate in a 10- to 12-page report submitted to the chair.

                                                                                                                     MUTONGI

ANSO 011 Berkshire Farm Internship
A field placement at Berkshire Farm Center and Services for Youth in Canaan, New York. Berk-
shire Farm Center is a residential treatment facility for troubled, at-risk adolescent boys who have
been remanded to the Farm by the Family Court. These youths come primarily from lower socio-
economic strata, are very ethnically diverse, and hail from both urban and rural areas throughout
New York State. The problems that they bring to Berkshire Farm are multiple. These include: the
psychological scars of dysfunctional families, including those of physical, emotional, and sexual
abuse; chemical dependency; juvenile delinquency; inability to function in school settings; and
various other issues. Residential treatment is a multi-modal approach that includes anger-replace-
ment training, social skills training, and behavioral modification.
Williams students will commute to Berkshire Farm and work under supervision in one of the fol-
lowing areas: school, cottage life, chemical dependency unit, research, recreation, performing arts,
or in individual tutoring. Students will keep a journal reflecting on their experiences. A weekly
seminar with the instructor will draw on service learning experience.
Prerequisite: Placement is only through interview with instructor before registering for course. En-
rollment limit: 13. (All queries about this course should be directed to the instructor, who can be
reached at 518-781-4567, ext. 322.)
Cost to student: none.

ANSO 012 Children and the Courts: Internship in the Crisis in Child Abuse
The incidence of reported child abuse and neglect has reached epidemic proportions and shows no
signs of decreasing. Preventive and prophylactic social programs, court intervention, and legisla-
tive mandates have not successfully addressed this crisis. This course allows students to observe the
Massachusetts Department of Social Services attorney in courtroom proceedings related to the care
and protection of children. Students will have access to Department records for purposes of analysis
and will also work with social workers who will provide a clinical perspective on the legal cases
under study. The class will meet regularly to discuss court proceedings, assigned readings, and the
students' interactions with local human services agencies.
Requirements: access to an automobile is desirable but not required; some transportation will be
provided as part of the course. Evaluation will be based on keeping a journal and submitting a
10-page paper at the end of the course. Full participation in the course is expected.
Enrollment limit: 15. (All queries about this course must be directed to the instructor, Judge Locke.
Phone messages may be left at 458-4833.)
Meeting time: mornings and afternoons.
Cost to student: $25 for books and photocopies.

ART HISTORY

ARTH 010 What is New England?
Employing a variety of media, we will seek to answer the question of whether New England is: what
it thinks it is, what others in America think it is, what it is that it is "documented" as being. Should
this region be seen as being special, and even revered, and why? Is its main attribute simply "old-
ness" and of what does that consist? The hope is to "see" something that is multifarious, maybe even
contradictory, and whether there is some kind of Puritan, colonial core--mythical or otherwi-
se--and how its present day ripples may be made manifest. Towards this end we will explore a vari-
ety of sources, including Bennington tombstone inscriptions, Governor Bradford's diary, Sibley's
Harvard Graduates, farmers' journals, Boston trustee's statements of what "corpus" is, letters from
the Lowell girls and from Irish immigrants, several colleges' acts of incorporation, and bio-technol-
ogy prospectuses (for the arguable world center of that nascent industry, near Kendall Square, Cam-
bridge). Attention will be given to visual documents or artifacts (besides tombstones), in the works
(inter alia) of Ralph Earl, Charles Sprague Sargent, Emma Coleman, John Marin, Paul Strand, and
Neil Rappaport. From this welter of evidence, does New England seem old and spent or increasing-
ly like the rest of America or something fragmented and disjunctive or even cutting-edge: whether
the landscape or site be littoral or montane or interfluvial? An optional three-day field session dur-
ing the third week will visit some sites or habitats at first-hand.
Requirements: a presentation and paper, by each class member, on a selected aspect of New En-
gland will conclude this course. Besides the final paper there will be notetaking assignments. A
passing grade will be determined on the basis of assiduous class attendance and participation as
well as the successful completion of written and oral assignments.
Enrollment limit: 15. (The class is especially intended for students from other regions of the United
States, or abroad, and preference will be given to them. Natives, however, will not be shunted.)
Meeting time: mornings.
Cost to student: $250,texts, $10 local field sessions, and $150 for an optional three-day field ses-
sion.

can suburb. What histories and cultural forces have helped to produce the suburb? How does the
suburb as a social formation relate to the way people experience time and space, and their own un-
derstandings of self? To explore this topic, we will examine experimental video, Hollywood film,
contemporary fiction, critical literature, and aspects of material culture. Examples might include
films and videos like Nest of Tens, Star Maps, The Ice Storm, Body Double, Safe, American
Beauty, Superstar, Possibly in Michigan, and Visible Cities, writings by Jeffrey Eugenidies, Lynn
Spiegel, Daniel Clowes, Guiliana Bruno, and others, and related phenomena such as the shopping
mall, the gated community, the domestic worker, the Santee school shooting, and Martha Stewart.
Students will be required to produce two videos and participate in at least one field trip. No prior
video experience is necessary; the course will cover basic production a editing techniques.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 10.
Meeting time: mornings.
Cost to student: $75.

ARTS 012 New York City Field Trip
This studio course will involve two day-long field trips to New York City to view and critique con-
temporary art at museums and galleries, and to make artwork in response to that critique. In addition
to readings and discussions about the exhibitions, students are expected to keep visual journals as
documentation/sketchbooks and to finish one drawing project that is related to the New York work

in concept or style. This project will involve six or more extensive drawings. Although there is an
element of "apprenticeship" in this approach, students are expected to create their own individual,
unique works.
Evaluation will be based on attendance at the two field trips, participation in discussions, and the
quality of the student's journal and month-long project.
We will meet once a week during the two weeks of field trips--we will leave Williamstown at 8:00
a.m. and return at 9:00 p.m. During the other two weeks of WSP, we will meet twice a week for three
hours in the Spencer Studio Art Building on campus. Students are expected to work outside of class
time to finish their journals and projects.
Prerequisite: ArtS 100. Enrollment limit: 10.
Meeting time: afternoons.
Cost to student: $100 to help cover transportation costs (van rental, subways), dinners in New York,
journal/drawing supplies, and reading packets.

ARTS 013 Figure Modeling
This course is designed as an introduction to the challenges of working with the figure in a sculptur-
al context. The class will be structured as a working studio with the students sculpting in clay from a
live model. The first half of the course will emphasize learning the technical and physiological as-
pects of the human figure; structure, proportion, gesture, and basic anatomy. The latter half of the
course will be concerned with the creative aspects of working with the figure and of developing
individual interpretations of the human form. In addition to working studio sessions, there will be
two slide lectures on the human form in art. Each student will be evaluated on the success of their
sculpture, attendance, participation, and effort. This course requires approximately 15 hours per
week of individual investigations into the human form.
Prerequisite: ArtS 100. Enrollment limit: 15.
Meeting time: TR, 9 a.m.-noon.
Lab fee: $95.00.

ARTS 014 Trade and Artistic Exchange: An Introduction to the Archaeology of Global
Process in the Third and Second Millennia B.C.
In the mid-second millennium B.C. the International Style was prevalent in the Eastern Mediterra-
nean, incorporating iconographic and stylistic elements from the Aegean, Egypt and the Near East.
Such an artistic environment is both diagnostic and an integral part of interaction among these dif-
ferent regions. This course will explore how these relationship grew up over time, discuss the role
of polities, states and individuals in the demand and production of prestige goods, and investigate
how art can act as a form of communication capable of crossing language, politically drawn geo-
graphic boundaries, and ethnic barriers. The exchange of raw materials and finished goods will be
examined alongside the artistic relationships.
Classes will be a mixture of lecture and discussion. Students will participate in a hands-on experi-
mental archaeology lab involving an ancient gold-smithing technique. This will emphasize produc-
tion variability, skill, labor and time investments. In addition to the lab component, students will be
expected to prepare reading prior to seminar style discussion once a week. A final 10- to 15-page
paper will also be required.
Enrollment limit: 12.
Meeting time: afternoons.
Cost to students: $30.

ARTS 015 Digital Drawing
This is a studio drawing course that will use computer to create a digital drawing. Unlike a conven-
tional drawing medium, computer provides a unique drawing ground in which the physical rela-
tionship between the artist and art work seems somewhat distanced. It also carries an unfortunate
burden of being looked at as something unreal to be an art object even today because of what we are
so used to seeing on monitor (be it computer monitor or TV). What is fascinating about it is the fact

                                                ­ 337 ­
Winter Study Program

that it is a drawing of lights.
This course will cover basic techniques of drawing using a digital drawing tablet with a software
such as Adobe Photoshop. It will focus on not only a creation of a drawing but also the understand-
ing of seeing the image on screen as something concrete as a
drawing on other materials. There will be discussion on net art through various web sites in class
using a projector. The students will be assigned to explore other art on the web.
The class will also have prints made from the image students created on a monitor to examine and
understand the transformation of one medium to another. This will enable students to see two imag-
es generated from the same source, yet entirely different pieces of art work. The class will end with
an exhibition of drawings both on monitors and prints and a web site of the drawings created in the
class.
Evaluation will be based on class participation, the body of drawings created and the final exhibi-
tion of the work.
No experience in drawing or computer knowledge is required. Enrollment limit: 10.
Meeting time: afternoons.
Cost to student: $150 for printing.

ARTS 016 Fresco Painting
Fresco is one the oldest painting techniques in Western Art. Learn how to paint in the same medium
that Michaelangelo used to paint the Sistine Chapel. In this course students will learn to paint in this
ancient medium on portable panels. Students will slake lime, mix plaster, grind pigments and paint
on the wet plaster. Projects will include copying a section of a Renaissance fresco as well as creating
frescos of individual student's own design. This course will provide a greater understanding of the
process of painting as well as enhance one's understanding of Renaissance Art. No prerequisites.
Evaluation will be based on participation in all aspects of the workshop and completion of the pro-
jects.
Enrollment limit: 18. Preference given to art majors.
Meeting time: TW, 10 a.m.-4 p.m. All work will be completed during class time with the exception
of the drawing notebook and some background readings.
Cost to student: $15.

ARTS 017 Structural Model Making
An introduction to the principal structural systems and how they are constructed, by means of mak-
ing accurate, working, table-top models. These models of variously shaped arches, barrel and groin
vaults, flying buttresses, domes on pendentives and squinches, truss and suspension bridges pro-
duced in this class are intended to serve in the future as teaching aids, and the emphasis will there-
fore be on making them both clear and accurate. Participants will design and build models that not
only demonstrate how a variety of structural systems work, but how they were built as well; in the
case of arches, vaults and domes, as much attention will be paid to the design of efficient and easily
removable and reusable centering as to the space-spanning parts themselves. One of the primary
issues to be considered is the relative strength-to-weight ratio of the model and the system it repre-
sents, and the problem of making structural models that accurately reflect the scale of weights and
thrusts. Although models of centering will be constructed of wood, and probably most of the sys-
tems as well, the possibility of making effective models in other materials, particularly stone and
plaster, will also be investigated.
Evaluation will be based on participation in class discussion, the quality of the models, and written
manuals for their use as teaching devices.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15.
Meeting time: For the first week, class will meet every day for a two-hour morning session of the
discussion of structural systems, brainstorming and model planning, as well as an introduction to

the tools in the sculpture studio. Most of the remainder of the course will be spent in studio work.
There will be three two-hour morning periods of supervised lab time a week, and discussion meet-
ings for progress reports. It is expected that the projects will require a good deal more time than just
the hours spent in class.

ARTS 018 Editorial Cartooning (Same as Political Science 018)
This course, taught by an editorial cartoonist for a major metropolitan daily newspaper, introduces
students to the "Ungentlemanly Art" through discussion and an emphasis on the creation of their
own work. It is not an art course so much as an exercise in disciplining the mind to distill abstract
concepts and opinions into visual and verbal symbols that can be clearly, economically and persua-
sively communicated to the reader. Previous drawing experience, while helpful, is not a prerequi-
site for the course. In fact, non-art majors are particularly encouraged to enroll. The basics of per-
spective, proportion, and shading will be covered as needed to provide all students with the neces-
sary skills to express themselves. What is much more important is that the prospective student have
an inquisitive mind, a healthy interest in current events, a willingness to enter into spirited class-
room discussion, and an appreciation of satire. Former students have indicated that they found the
intellectual skills they acquired in this course to be useful in many different areas. In addition, sever-
al overcame fear to discover drawing abilities that they did not know they possessed. Class assign-
ments will be critiqued in a non-threatening atmosphere. The instructor, who will be continuously
producing daily cartoons for his newspaper, will also present his own work for criticism.
Evaluation of student performance will be based upon classroom participation and completion of
assigned material.
Enrollment limit: 15.
Meeting time: afternoons.
Cost to student: $75 for art materials.

ARTS 019 Digital Photography
A hybrid of video and photography, montage and painting, digital photography has changed our
expectations and largely redefined "photography." This course is an introduction to digital, art
photography. Students will learn to operate a digital camera and manipulate their files, in Photo-
shop, on a Macintosh computer. (All equipment will be provided by the college.) Students should
be prepared to make a five day per week commitment to attending either labs or class meetings in
order to complete the work required for this class.

ASST 013 Feng Shui
Feng shui is the study of the way in which our environments affect every aspect of our lives. The
selection of a property site and the placement of buildings on a property, of rooms within a building
and of furniture within a room influence us, sometimes in obvious ways, often in very subtle ways.
The goal in this course is to give students a foundation in the history and concepts of feng shui that
will lead to the practical application of feng shui. We will explore the origins and principles of this
ancient Chinese discipline and analyze how this Eastern philosophy is applicable in our Western
society. Our in-depth analysis of the many levels of feng shui, from the mundane to the transcenden-
tal, will include a comparison of feng shui to the similar architectural designs, traditions and rituals
of other cultures and of the animal world. We will also consider the correlation between an environ-
ment and the individuals who inhabit that particular space. By the end of the course, we will analyze
properties on or near the Williams campus, including spaces in which the students have a special
interest. We will determine what changes can be made in those environments to improve the lives of
the occupants.
We will meet five times a week for two-hour sessions. Field trips in the Williamstown, North
Adams and Hancock area to analyze specific properties will be held during class.
Evaluation will be based on class participation, class assignments and a research paper or design
analysis.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 18.
Meeting time: mornings
Cost to student: $50 for book, handouts, and materials.

CHIN 025 China for Tourists, China for Peasants
In this travel course to a remote mountain village and a tourist must-see in China, and two towns in
between, we will explore the possibilities of mutual understanding in a variety of cross-cultural en-
counters. We will fly to Guilin and begin our journey on a boat down the scenic Li River to Yang-
shuo, where "West[ern] Street" offers an opportunity to investigate the ways the local landscape
and Chinese and Western cultures are commodified for tourists from both China and abroad. Our
destination is a village in Hunan, where we will spend a total of 10 days living in the homes of farm-
ing families and learning about the realities of their lives, to understand the concrete effects of na-
tional policy that focuses on development of cities at the expense of the countryside. Students will
choose in advance a specific topic for investigation (rice farming, the raising of hogs, citrus grow-
ing, education, health care, care of the elderly, how the village got running water or electricity, the
story of the pagoda, marriage or funeral practices, ghosts, etc.) and present an oral report to class-
mates and villagers, which we'll follow with a discussion in town about our research experiences.
We will also visit the county seat, where we will conduct two day-long workshops for county En-
glish teachers, to give something back to the wider community that welcomes us. We'll have orien-
tation sessions in the fall to choose topics, select readings on tourism studies and rural China, pre-
pare English instruction materials, and prepare ourselves for the trip.

JAPN 010 Introduction to the Japanese Language and Culture (Same as Linguistics 010)
Have you ever studied Japanese or thought of studying Japanese? This is an ideal course for stu-
dents who are curious about the Japanese language and culture. It will examine different aspects of
the Japanese language through broader theoretical perspectives specifically, its history, lexicon,
phonology, grammatical structures, sociolinguistics, and discursive-cultural dimension. For exam-
ple, what is the origin of the Japanese language and how does it relate to Chinese or Korean? Why
does Japanese have three different writing systems? (historical linguistics) How does Japanese dif-
fer from English? (typology, phonology and syntax) Why can children learn Japanese so easily?
(psycholinguistics) Are there gender and generational differences in Japanese? (sociolinguistics)
Requirement: Class participation and reading, research project and presentation on selected issues
on Japanese language.
No prerequisites.
Meeting time: mornings.
Cost to student: $50 for books and printed materials.

JAPN 011 Embodied Learning (Same as Theatre 011)
Performance has outgrown its rather narrow theatrical meaning and has come to serve as a para-
digm for the means by which we participate in our culture and in our world. With that sea change in
understanding comes a necessary rethinking of the roles of "learning" and "training". The notion of
"embodied learning" describes the vivid interplay between the intellect and the viscera, necessary
to successfully engage in any number of performances, from combat, to dance, to participating in
the language and behavior of a target culture.
While the goals of the course (and the reading materials) are far-reaching, the methods of the studio
activity are comparatively focused. The instructor will draw on experiences training with artists
associated with the Japanese butoh dance movement. These exercises provide an intensive physical
challenge, while inviting the imaginative release necessary to successfully improvise within a care-
fully defined subtextual structure. This is an experience-based course that explores ways in which
the body participates in learning.
The class will meet 12 hours per week (in four 3-hour installments, or according to the availability
of space). It will be a highly physical class, consisting of exercises that move through the space, and
those that require direct physical interaction among students and between instructor and student.
Assignments will include reading materials addressing issues of embodied learning from a variety
of viewpoints, written summaries of one or more of those selections, and regular journal writing.
No prerequisites. Students are encouraged to make an honest assessment of their own health, condi-

JAPN 012 Japanese Dyeing: Joy of Kusaki-zome
Kusaki-zome is the traditional Japanese art of dyeing with plant dye. Using a simple technique, it
brings out the wonderful colors in vegetables, flowers, tree leaves and twigs. For instance, tea
leaves provide a light brown. What color do you think onion skins would give? The most interesting
thing is that the color is never the same since the hue of colors differs greatly depending on the sea-
son when the plants were harvested. The technique is simple; if you can boil eggs, you can enjoy
Kusaki-zome. This class requires no previous artistic training. The course will include lectures on
the history of Kusaki-zome as well as hands-on experience.
Evaluation will be based on the completion of two projects, with a journal describing the projects,
as well as participation in the final class exhibition.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15 per section. (To accommodate student demand, two sections
of this course will be offered.)
Meeting time: mornings.
Lab fee: $35.

                                      ASTRONOMY

ASTR 016 Observational Astronomy
This course, meant for non-majors, will focus on the most basic aspects of astronomy and will be
observing-intensive, taking full advantage of various telescopes housed on the Williams College
observing deck. Topics to be covered will include the constellations and night sky in general, plan-
ets, the moon, the sun, stars, and galaxies. Study of these topics will require a mix of both day and
night class sessions during which students will make observations using binoculars, telescopes, and
the naked eye. Observing will take place on all class dates during which the sky is clear. On those
days when the sky is cloudy, we will do in-class exercises or discuss current topics in astronomy
such as results from the Hubble Space Telescope. Student observations will be recorded in draw-
ings, notes, and computer printouts and/or photographs. The class will take a field trip to the new
Rose Center for Earth and Space at the Hayden Planetarium in New York City
Evaluation will be based on an oral presentation and detailed wrtieup of the student's observations
(equivalent to a 10-page paper).
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 25. Preference to students with no previous astronomy observ-
ing experience.
Meeting time: 3 two-hour EVENING observing sessions each week plus additional self-scheduled
observing or World Wide Web work; separate daytime sessions for solar observing; and a few after-
noon sessions, mainly to make arrangements for observing.
Cost to student: $75 for books, materials, and field trip.

Students will undertake an independent project in which they will learn the theory and practice of
transmission and scanning electron microscopy. they will do their own sample preparation, operate
the two electron microscopes, and take pictures of relevant structures, go digital and manipulate
those images in Photoshop (do you want your erythrocytes red or blue?) or go conventional and do
tried-but-true black and white photography. there will be brief reading assignments, a guest speaker
and a 10-page paper with 6 really good micrographs required.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 8. No preference given.

BIOL 011 Outbreak Investigations: An Introduction to Field Epidemiology
This course will introduce students to the practical and exciting science of epidemiology, as it re-
lates to the control of communicable diseases. How do epidemiologists ("disease detectives") de-
tect outbreaks of illness, and how do they investigate outbreaks to determine how to stop the spread
of the disease? How can they determine if their interventions were helpful? Specific diseases and
their control will be used as examples, such as polio, AIDS, tuberculosis, Lyme disease, West Nile
Virus, and "mad-cow disease." Class activities will include a field data collection exercise, a com-
puter lab using the CDC software program "Epi-Info", and discussion of assigned articles or book
chapters. Two or three guest speakers will give first-hand accounts of epidemic investigations. Ap-
plication of these tools to chronic disease epidemiology will also be discussed. Readings include
textbook chapters introducing epidemiologic concepts, original classic articles from medical jour-
nals about specific outbreak investigations, and popular fictional and non-fictional accounts of epi-
demics and their control.
Evaluation will be based on a 10-page paper on some aspect of infectious disease epidemiology,
selected from a broad list of potential topics, and a brief class presentation on the same topic.
No prerequisites. Basic statistical methods will be introduced but no prior familiarity with statistics
is assumed. Enrollment limit: 15.
Meeting time: afternoons. The course will meet two afternoons a week for three hours.
Cost to student: $50.00 for books and course reading packet.

BIOL 012 Gene Quest
This course offers the opportunity to participate in a research project whose aims are to identify
highly conserved genes in diverse animals using polymerase chain reaction and other standard mo-
lecular biology techniques. The basic genetic mechanisms that define the types of cells in a body
and those that define the shape of the developing animal are remarkably similar from flies to frogs.
Although regulatory genes are shared between animal groups, their function may or may not be
conserved. This is likely to account for the tremendous morphological variation observed in ani-
mals. The first step in understanding changing gene function in animals is to identify the highly
conserved genes. In order to clone their gene of interest, students will examine sequence data, de-
sign primers, and amplify fragments from genomic DNA. The course will meet twice a week for
three hours in addition to independent work outside of scheduled class.
Evaluation will be based on a laboratory notebook, poster, oral presentation, and a 10-page paper.
No prerequisite. Enrollment limit: 10.
Meeting time: mornings.

BIOL 014 Social Justice Issues in Health Care Delivery

Widening economic disparities, both domestic and global, threaten to derail the progress achieved
over the last century in the arena of universal public health. Is basic health care a human right? How
is the delivery of health care in the twenty-first century influenced by prejudice, inequality, and in-
justice? Readings and in-class discussions will focus on four case studies: perceptions of disability
and access to reproductive technologies, distribution of AIDS drugs to resource-poor individuals
and countries, health care provision to migrant farm workers, and the Dutch experience with eutha-
nasia. This course includes a major experiential learning component, in which you will carry out an
internship in a clinical or social service setting. Throughout the month, we will reflect individually
and as a group on the field placement experiences and the social justice issues encountered in these
settings.
Evaluation will be based upon a 10-page paper placing the internship experience in the broader con-
text of social justice concerns.
Requirements: serious commitment to internship (15-20 hours/week), journal reflecting on field
experience, one presentation on the social justice issues surrounding a specific infectious disease,
active participation in classroom discussions (three two-hour meetings per week).
No prerequisites, but students will be asked to meet with their field placement supervisor once prior
to Winter break to discuss expectations and potential contributions to be made by the student. En-
rollment limit: 12. Student selection criteria: Interested students must consult instructor prior to
registration.
Meeting time: mornings for in-class discussions, times for field placement to be arranged to best
suit the needs of the host organization.

BIOL 015 Conservation of Songbirds in North America

Songbird populations in North America are increasingly threatened from anthropogenic changes to
the landscape they inhabit. Because they are an intensively studied taxa, birds provide a model sys-
tem to explore issues in conservation. This course combines discussion, data analysis, and indepen-
dent inquiry into the conservation status and population trends of North American birds, emphasiz-
ing songbirds. We will discuss past examples, analyze current status and population trends of birds
by exploring data from the Breeding Bird Survey, and evaluate current institutional efforts to con-
serve songbirds in North America.
Evaluation will be based on the completion of course assignments including an independent project
and presentation (equivalent to a 10-page paper). Attendance and participation will also be taken
into account. Assignments and analysis will be completed outside of class.
No prerequisites, however previous courses in ecology are useful. Enrollment limit: 14. Priority
given to Biology majors and Environmental Studies concentrators.

BIOL 021 Internships in Biology
Sophomores, juniors and seniors wishing to do internships with conservation organizations, na-
tional or state parks, field research, or laboratory research at other institutions should sign up for
Biology 021 as their winter study course. Students must make all the arrangements for the intern-
ships directly with the sponsoring organization. The costs of travel and room and board must be
borne by the student. In addition, the student must independently design the project and have it ap-
proved by Professor Swoap before October 5, 2001. The form for this proposal is on the biology
web site (www.williams.edu/Biology/)--follow the "courses" link. Upon approval of the project,
the student can register for the course.
Previous internships have included such diverse programs as working on the problem of introduced
species with a local or national environmental organization, monkey census within Equitorial
Guinea, working at a raptor rehabilitation center, and working with their home state's department of
environmental management.

CHEM 013 The Popular Culture of Football (Soccer) Around the World
Football, or, as erroneously called in the USA, soccer, is the most popular sport in the world. In
many countries the sport goes beyond playing the game; it becomes part of your daily life. After
losing the European cup, the fan's passion for the local or national teams has been criticized for the
aggressive behavior in the stands and the rioting in the streets. Is this behavior part of football or just
our human nature? The course looks at the women's NCAA basketball final four tournament and
the riots by Purdue fans to answer the question.
In this course we explore the beauty, fanaticism, ethics and social change that football brings with it,
and the differences and similarities of the culture of football in several parts of the world. Students
learn of the culture through the assigned readings. Some of the readings include: The Miracle of
Castel di Sangro, by J. McGinniss; Ethnic and Religious Identity in Modern Scotland: Culture, Pol-
itics, and Football, by J. M. Bradley; Passion of the People? Football in South America (Critical
Studies in Latin American and Iberian Culture), by Tony Mason; British Football and Social
Change: Getting in to Europe, by J. Williams; The Culture of Fear: Why Americans are Afraid of
the Wrong Things, by B. Glassner; and Soccer Madness: Brazil's Passion for the World's Most Pop-
ular Sport, by Janet Lever. Finally, students explore the role of gender and the differences and simi-
larities between football in the USA and other countries.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation is based on two short papers (2 pages) relating to assigned
readings, a third paper on a topic of personal interest and participation in class discussions.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 30.
Meeting time: afternoons. The course will meet three times a week with occasional extra meetings
for special projects.
Cost to student: $100 for books.

CHEM 014 Emergency Medical Technician--Basic
A course designed to prepare students for the Massachusetts EMT exam and to provide training to
become certified as an Emergency Medical Technician. The course teaches the new national stan-
dard curriculum which makes reciprocity with many other states possible. This is a time-intensive
course involving approximately 130 hours of class time plus optional emergency room observation
and ambulance work. Students will learn, among other skills, basic life support techniques, patient
assessment techniques, defibrillation, how to use an epi-pen, safe transportation and immobiliza-
tion skills, as well as the treatment of various medical emergencies including shock, bleeding, soft-
tissue injuries, and child birth. In order to reduce the number of class meetings required during Win-
ter Study Period, the course will hold a few meetings beginning in the fall semester. These class
meetings, which are mandatory, are held on Sundays with the following schedule: 4 November (ori-
entation), 11 November, and 18 November.
Format: lecture/laboratory. Evaluation is based upon class participation and performance on class
exams, quizzes and practical exercises.
Prerequisite: recommended that students have American Heart Association Level C BLS Provider
CPR Cards or American Red Cross BLS provider CPR cards before entering the EMT Class. A CPR
class will be offered in October for those students wishing to take the EMT class who don't already
have CPR cards. Enrollment limit: 24.
Meeting time: mornings and afternoons; schedule TBA in October.
Cost to student: $300/student plus approximately $75 for textbook, stethoscope, and BP cuff.

CHEM 015 Epidemiology, Epidemics, and Human Health
Epidemiology is about the distribution of, and determinants of disease in human populations. While
the discipline first developed around epidemics of infectious diseases, its low technology ap-
proaches have been usefully employed to study most of the major acute and chronic non-infectious
disease epidemics of the last 50-100 years, including pellagra, coronary heart disease, and lung can-
cer, and some of the minor epidemics, for example, occupational asbestos exposure and lung dis-
ease, and even the use (and misuse) of C-section in delivering babies.
The main purpose of this course is to stimulate critical thinking and impart an understanding of the
logic and scientific methods of epidemiology in answering questions or hypotheses related to the
etiology of specific human diseases, their prevention, their early detection, their prognoses, and the

effectiveness of treatments used to cure or alleviate their effects. We will be interested primarily in
the observational and experimental methods of epidemiological inquiry in human populations, and
their application to new questions, rather than the acquisition of specialized information or arcane
facts.
It has been said that at least 50% of the basic science you will learn as an undergraduate and in medi-
cal school will be proved wrong, perhaps within 10 years. While this might be a bit of an exaggera-
tion, it is no exaggeration to suggest that no one really knows which 50%! For future health profes-
sionals, an understanding of epidemiologic methods will make it easier for you to keep up with the
rapid pace of knowledge, and help you deliver the best, evidence-driven care.
By means of a few introductory lectures, and more class discussion, including unknown exercises
(Whodunnits, in the New Yorker style of the late Burton Rouche), perhaps presented by groups of
students working collaboratively, the review of current and some classical papers in the medical
and public health literature, and the reading of selected chapters of a condensed, basic text in epide-
miology, we will come to an appreciation of the rules of evidence in epidemiologic research. While
some explanation of biostatistical applications will be necessary to understand the literature, this
will not be a course in biostatistics.
This course is aimed towards students who are committed to the liberal arts and have an interest in
health issues beyond the cellular level, including those with an interest in medicine, public health,
other health-related careers, the law, economics, etc.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation is based on class participation and a circa 10-page paper,

sented to the whole group at the final sessions.

CLAS 013 Biblical Hebrew in a Month (Same as Religion 013)
This course will enable students to read the Bible in the original Hebrew in a fast, fun, and focused
way. Topics include the difference between BeGeD-KeFeT, BuMaF, K'MiNPaTS, and the Throaty
Five. Meet sentences without verbs, the extra pronoun, and word pairs. Discover a word's three let-
ter root and explore the mysteries of the Shwa and Dagesh. Learn the seven "buildings" of the He-
brew verb and find the missing letters. In addition to this intensive study of Hebrew vocabulary and
grammar, attention will also be given to the polyvalence of biblical discourse. The paratactic and
terse character of the TaNaKH produce narratives tantalizingly "fraught with background" that
virtually cry out to the reader "interpret me". Thus, by the end of the course, students will have read
the Book of Ruth with an understanding of both biblical language and biblical style.
Students will be evaluated on the basis of regular attendance, preparation, and class participation. In
addition, students will be required to prepare a translation and grammatical commentary of 10-15
verses selected from the Book of Genesis as a final project. In order to facilitate the learning of He-
brew in a month, the course includes frequent quizzes and homework assignments. The course will
meet three days a week for three hours a day covering three chapters/session. Students are expected

CLAS 026 Archaeological Tour of Greece (Same as Religion 026)
This trip offers a unique opportunity to see how material culture both enriches and complicates our
understanding of ancient Greek culture and early Christianity as it emerges from the textual evi-
dence. Our goal is to explore the various and diverse aspects of Greek culture as these are recorded
in the physical space. Our additional goal is to experience the Greece of today, so that you can also
reflect on the continuities and discontinuities of this culture. We will visit archaeological sites, mu-
seums, and churches on mainland Greece and the island of Crete.
Requirements: a travel journal; one brief oral presentation to group following a site visit; a 10-page
paper.

                          COMPARATIVE LITERATURE

COMP 011 The Colonialist Vision (Same as English 024)
From the peak of imperialism to its decline, what were the myths, observations, and prejudices that
informed the European view of the colonial enterprise? How is the relationship between colonial-
ists and colonized expressed in literature and film? Do men and women writers figure the colonial-
ist experience differently? The readings will include both authors who wrote from direct contact
with the peoples of Africa and Asia and those who fabricated a purely imaginary construct of a dif-
ferent culture. Other topics for discussion will focus on romantic images of conquest, the symbol-
ism of exotic settings, and the varied places assigned to women within the colonialist enterprise.
Texts will include Flaubert's Salammbo, Forster's Passage to India, Kipling's The Man Who Would
Be King, Dinesen's Out of Africa, Markham's West With the Night, and Lahiri's Interpreter of Mal-
adies. We will also watch the filmic adaptations of Kipling's, Dinesen's and Forster's novels and
discuss short theoretical readings by Said, bell hooks, Spivak, and others. All readings in English.
Evaluation is based on active class participation and a 10-page paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20.
Meeting time: mornings. The course will meet for two hours twice a week with two hours of film
screenings.

COMP 012 Roland Barthes: The Romance and Poetry of Criticism (Same as English 023
and French 012)
For most of his life the French philosopher and cultural critic Roland Barthes used critical theory as
a substitute for the "novel" he never brought himself to write. One could call his theoretical and
critical essays a fiction and a poetry by other means. In the course we will study the imaginative and
metaphorical elements of Barthes's writing, especially in works concerning the mythification of
culture (Mythologies, 1957), the primacy of textuality (The Death of the Author, 1968), the erotics
of reading and writing (The Pleasure of the Text, 1973), the redefinition of subjectivity (Roland
Barthes by Roland Barthes, 1975), the rhetoric of love (A Lover's Discourse, 1977), and the repre-
sentation of death and loss (Camera Lucida: Reflections on Photography, 1980). Discussion will be
given as well to Barthes's theory of the sign, his fascination with the body, his investigation of the
languages of desire, and his study of the imaginary (l'imaginaire) in literature, the plastic arts, soci-
ety and popular culture (fashion, music, and advertising). All readings in English.
Requirements: class participation, one class oral presentation, one 12-page final paper.

                                COMPUTER SCIENCE

CSCI 010 C, UNIX and Software Tools
This course serves as a guided tour of programming methods in the UNIX operating system. The
course is designed for individuals who understand basic program development techniques as dis-
cussed in an introductory programming course (Computer Science 134 or equivalent), but who
wish to become familiar with a broader variety of computer systems and programming languages.
Students in this course will work on UNIX workstations, available in one of the Department's labo-
ratories. By the end of the course, students will have developed basic proficiency in the C program-
ming language.
The increasing success of UNIX as a modern operating system stems from its unique ability to "pro-
totype" programs quickly. Students will use prototyping tools, such as Awk and "shell scripts" to
write "filters" for transforming data from a variety of sources. It will become clear that in many
cases the overhead of programming in languages such as C, Pascal, or FORTRAN is unnecessary.
Moreover, students will learn to effectively use software tools such as debuggers, profilers, and
make files.
Evaluation will be based on several programming assignments and shell scripts due throughout the
term. While none of the projects in the course will be particularly large, the successful student will
develop a tool chest, which will extend their computing "effectiveness" in their particular field. Stu-
dents with computing needs particular to their field are encouraged to advise the instructor before
the first meeting.
Prerequisite: Computer Science 134 or equivalent programming experience. Enrollment limited to
20.

ECON 010 The East Asian Miracle
This course is intended to help CDE fellows integrate the material they studied in the first semester
by applying it to the circumstances of a particular group of countries. During the 2002 Winter Term
session we will focus on a case study of what are widely perceived to be successful development
experiences--those of the East and Southeast Asian "miracle" economies. We will consider issues
such as the desirability of the economic transformations that have taken place in these countries, the
conditions that may have made such transformations possible, the roles that specific policies may
have played in bringing them about, the causes of the recent economic crisis in the region and its
implications for future growth in the affected countries, as well as the lessons that the East and
Southeast Asian experience may hold for other developing countries.

                                                                                                                      MONTIEL

ECON 011 Public Speaking
It has been said that most people fear public speaking more than death. In a world in which most of
us are asked at one time or another to say something to a group, public speaking is a skill which
everyone should learn. This course will help you become an organized and persuasive public speak-
er. You will create your own public speaking style that is comfortable, confident, and conversation-
al. We will focus on organizational techniques, handling visual aids effectively, eye contact and
body language. A supportive atmosphere will give each person an opportunity to receive feedback.
Students will be required to give five to six oral presentations to the class; most of these presenta-
tions will be videotaped. Students will also be required to review their videotapes and write a cri-
tique of their presentations.

ECON 012 Business Risk Analysis: Inside the Mind of a Banker
So you think that business and finance are a big mystery and potentially boring? Discover how easy
it is to understand how a company works and how interesting risk analysis can be. Do you feel that a
career in business is not for you, but want to know enough to invest your millions wisely? Or are
you, perhaps, considering business or finance as a career and would like a head start (not to mention
a leg up in the interview process)? Or maybe you picture yourself as the boss someday, no matter
what your field. Then this is the course for you! This experience will provide a basic overview of
financial analysis with a particular emphasis on the banker's perspective. Among the topics that we
will discuss are: the qualitative and quantitative aspects of risk analysis, understanding financial
statements, how businessmen and bankers manage and mitigate the risks in their businesses, the
principles of financing international trade and projects, and how bankers decide on the structure and
pricing of loans. We will also explore some of the concepts used in determining a reasonable price to
pay for a particular stock.
Evaluation will be based on attendance, classroom participation, and group and individual assign-
ments, including a final project involving the written and/or oral analysis of a company.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20. Preference for juniors and seniors. Not intended for stu-
dents with extensive prior financial experience.
Meeting time: afternoons.
Cost to students: $40 for texts and reading packet.

ECON 013 Real Estate and Community Development
Real estate development is an engine in urban environments and can be either destructive to exist-
ing neighborhoods or a powerful positive force for community development. For non-profit devel-
opers, public officials, lenders and investors, and nonprofit community development directors all
need to know the same real estate development principles to make judgements and make new pro-
jects work. This course will examine the process and prospects of real estate development as an
economic activity and how it can be a positive force for community development. The course will
combine classroom meetings and extensive analysis and discussion of actual case histories of real
estate development projects, along with examination of their community development impacts.
The course will involve fieldwork in Boston with site visits to selected projects and meetings with
principals involved in some of the developments studied.
Students will be expected to attend class sessions and site visits, and will work in small teams to
prepare analyses and observations based on cases studied. A limited familiarity with Microsoft Ex-
cel will be expected.
Prerequisite: permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 12.
Meeting time: afternoons.
Cost to student: $85. Students will be responsible for their own accommodations and living ex-
penses while in Boston.

                                                                                        B. MITCHELL and S. SHEPPARD

ECON 014 The Practice of Public Health
Dollar for dollar, improvements in public health measures are often more effective in improving
health than traditional "medical" responses to illness, but the advantages of public health ap-
proaches are often overlooked. This course will introduce students to the field of public health and
community health improvement. Topics for discussion will focus on important public health move-
ments such as the campaigns to address smoking, fluoridation, global warming and AIDS. Students
will examine the theory and practice of modern public health and will be able to conduct their own

research projects and design interventions for health issues of interest to them.
Students will be evaluated at the end of each course component for a basic understanding of public
health principles and they will also be evaluated on class participation. The major portion of a stu-
dent's evaluation will come from a 10-page research paper in which students will identify an impor-
tant health issue, analyze the issue and develop an intervention that addresses the issue from
theoretical perspectives presented in class. Students will be expected to identify possible resources
for this intervention, budget an intervention and receive the endorsement of a local health official or
government officer for their proposed project.
Class will be held in an informal lecture setting. Readings will be assigned at each lecture.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15.

ECON 017 Business Economics
In this course, the class will carry out a real-time forecast of the U.S. economy and explore its im-
plications for the bond and stock markets. The course will build upon principles of both macro and
micro-economics. It will provide an introduction to the work done by business economists and the
techniques they use. An economic database, chart-generating software and a statistical analysis
program will be available to each student on the Jessup computers and, if necessary, on a disk for
IBM-compatible computers.
The first week will focus on becoming familiar with the database, looking for relationships between
key economic variables, and studying movements in interest rates over the period 1960-2000. Early
in the first week, the class will be divided into teams of 2 students with each team choosing a partic-
ular aspect of the economy to forecast.
During the second and third weeks, the class will work with various leading indicators of economic
activity and will prepare forecasts of the key components of gross domestic product and other key
variables. The fourth week will feature a formal presentation of the economic forecast with invited
guests from the Wall Street investment world.
To put the forecasting exercise in context, there will be class discussions of business cycles, credit
cycles, long waves in inflation and interest rates and the impact of the Internet on the economy and
the stock market.
There will also be a 3-page paper summarizing the result of the forecast project. Because essential
concepts and tools are covered during the first week, all students are expected to attend the first
class.
No prerequisites, but Economics 101 or another semester course in Economics is strongly recom-
mended. Enrollment limit: 22.
Meeting time: mornings, 3 times per week. There will be two afternoons of workshops lasting
approximately 30 minutes with hands-on instruction for each team. Each student should expect to
spend a reasonable amount of time on homework, and to participate in short presentations of their
analyses as the work progresses as well as in the formal presentation during the last week.
Cost to student: $25 for text and other materials.

                                                                                         THOMAS SYNNOTT (Instructor)

ENGL 010 Fan Cultures
This course will introduce the history of, and current interest in, fans of popular culture. We will
read recent accounts of X-philes, Barbie collectors, soccer-supporters, Star Trekkers, romance nov-
el readers, and Civil War battle reenactors, to name but a few. As well, we will examine some of the
ways fans express their interest in popular cultures--through zines, in on-line discussion groups, at
conventions, in the sampling techniques of rap and techno music, or in the retro styles of fashion.
Chief among our concerns as a class will be: Are fans merely consumers of mass culture, or are they
cultural producers in their own right? What kinds of television programs, sports events, films, or
dance crazes spark fan interest? Why do fans identify with specific fictional characters? Are fans
radically different from or entirely representative of "mainstream" society? In what ways do fans
appropriate sub-cultural interests ("alternative" music, folk traditions)? In what ways do fans resist
or reinterpret mass culture? Students will have the opportunity both to engage in critical analyses of
popular culture as well as to document, either through autobiography or ethnography, a specific
example of fan culture of their own choosing. Readings will include works by Roland Barthes, Wal-
ter Benjamin, Bill Buford, Michael De Certeau, Henry Louis Gates, Horkheimer and Adorno, Nick
Hornby, Tony Horwitz, Wayne Koestenbaum, Henry Jenkins, George Lipsitz, Tania Modleski,
Constance Penley, Jan Radway, Erica Rand, and Salman Rushdie.
Requirements: two papers (one 4-5 pages, one 6-8 pages).
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 25. Preference will be given to seniors in any major, then En-
glish majors.
Meeting time: mornings. The course will meet twice a week for three hours.
Cost to student: $50.

ENGL 011 Ireland in Film: Contemporary Irish Cinema
Ireland has long provided a rich subject for Hollywood fantasy, being represented in film as either a
mythic space for emerald-green romanticism, or, more darkly, as a place of political terror and en-
during internecine ideological rivalries. In this course we will view and discuss major films from
the recently ascendant indigenous Irish cinema--works in which Irish directors have begun to offer
their own distinctive critique of the country's political and cultural history, and to interrogate the
master-myths of nationality which still animate the notion of "Irishness." To characterize the tradi-
tion that recent Irish films have sought to refute, we will start with a Hollywood movie: John Hus-
ton's The Quiet Man (1952), a populist classic which humorously exploits almost every cliche of
Irish cultural tourism. Our subsequent viewing will be drawn from the following, as time allows:
Jim Sheridan's The Field (1990), In the Name of the Father (1993), and (as writer) Into the West
(1993); Neil Jordan's The Crying Game (1992), Michael Collins (1996), and The Boxer (1998); Pat
O'Connor's The Ballroom of Romance (1982) and Cal (1984); Cathal Black's Pigs (1984) and Ko-
rea (1995); and Gillies MacKinnon's The Playboys (1992).
Requirements: regular attendance, active participation in class discussions, several short "re-
sponse" papers, and one 6-page final paper.
Prerequisite: A prior film course (such as English 204, 364, 370, 371, or 395), or English 226, or
permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 18.

ENGL 013 Your Favorite Author
Winter Study is a perfect time to read, and this is a class for people who would like to deepen their
relationship with an author they have only "dated casually" in a classroom encounter. It will be run
as a colloquium. In the first week, you will choose the author you want to explore, compile a list of
the author's complete works, decide how much of it you want to read, and assign two or three items
(poems, stories, chapters from novels, acts of plays, essays) to the rest of the class for reading and
discussion. In the second week, you will compile a list of biographies and autobiography, and do
some selective reading to discover how many "lives" your author had, what kinds of things the
biographers agree and disagree about, whether and how your author's life illuminates or compli-
cates an understanding of the works. In the third week, you will find out what's hot and controver-

sial in critical and scholarly discussions of your author. In the fourth week, you will draw on your
reading to write an imitation or parody of your author, complete with introductory commentary.
Evaluation will be based on annotated bibliographies and oral presentations in the first three weeks
(60%), and a written 10-page parody-plus-commentary in the final week (40%).
Requirements: regular attendance is mandatory.
Prerequisite: A 100-level English course (except 150), or any literature class in the Literary Stud-
ies/Comparative Literature program or in any of the language departments. Enrollment limit: 12.
Preference is given to upper-class literature majors.
Meeting time: mornings. The course will meet three times a week for two hours.
Cost to student: $25.

ENGL 014 Literature and Seduction (Same as Comparative Literature 014)
Can literature about seduction tell us something about the seductiveness of literature? This course
will look at literary texts, and a few films, which involve erotic persuasion in various ways: some
tell about seductions, some--love poetry, for instance--are intended to be seen as forms for seduc-
tion, some simply are seductive. Works will range from Ovid and Shakespeare to film noir and Coc-
teau's Beauty and the Beast. We will also read two novels--Nabokov's Lolita and J. G. Ballard's
Crash--as well as essays by Jean Laplanche, a psychoanalytic theorist whose work focuses on the
logic of seduction. We'll consider these works in their own rights, of course, but also for what they
suggest about seduction's relationship to some fundamental issues concerning desire, the self, pow-
er, and representation.
Requirements: a 10-page final paper.
Prerequisite: A 100-level English course (except 150), or permission of the instructor. Enrollment
limit: 18.

ENGL 015 Lyric Voices: Subjects and Objects of Writing
When we think of lyric, so often what comes to mind is the singular, expressive voice of the writer.
Whether about love, life, or politics, poems grab their readers by the timbre and tone of voice. Yet
equally often, the "voices" poets and fiction writers adopt are radically not their own. In the form of
personae, imaginative identifications and appropriations, lyric voices emerge from bodies and
landscapes with an intensity that highlights but also confounds notions of identity--racial and re-
gional, ethnic and sexual, gendered and economic. What guarantees the appeal of poetry so often is
less authenticity than persuasive performance, which has consequences both aesthetic and politi-
cal.
This course will explore from the inside how poetry and fiction lift themselves off the page, setting
the objects of the world into a bizarre motion of their own. It will explore how we hear and how we
project the voices that make poetry possible. Students will learn about how writers come to a dis-
tinct sense of voice--through critical and creative writings in prose and poetry. Half-seminar, half-
workshop, this course will require students to complete frequent exercises and to keep a daily writ-
ing journal. In addition to becoming familiar with a range of contemporary writers, students will
report to classmates on current sites of writing--in journals and anthologies, on-line alternatives,
video and vocal recordings. We'll think about how poetry is represented in popular culture, such as
in movies like Slam!, the documentary Slam Nation, or even Hal Hartley's recent Henry Fool. Fi-
nally, students will organize two readings--one for their own winter creations and one to feature an
up-and-coming east coast writer, who will visit class and give a public reading. Featured writers
may include: Russell Edson, Anne Carson, George Oppen, Dorianne Laux, Kim Addonizio, Ter-
rence Hayes, Ai, Junot Diaz, Li-Young Lee, Wayne Koestenbaum, Frank Bidart, Crystal Williams,
Sapphire, Melanie Rae Thon, Jack Gilbert, Dana Levin, Anne Marie Macari, James McCombs, and
Reetika Vazirani.
Students will be evaluated based on a portfolio of writing and in-class participation.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15.
Meeting time: mornings. The course will meet three times a week for two-and-a-half hours.
Cost to student: $30.

ENGL 016 Bob Dylan on Film
Bob Dylan is most commonly thought of as a musician and songwriter. But ever since he first rose to
fame on the Greenwich Village folk scene in the early 1960s, he has enjoyed a shadow career as a
film artist: as an actor, director, editor, and composer. In this class, we will look at how Bob Dylan's
image has been shaped in film and video, and how this work relates to Bob Dylan, musician. The
class will view rare TV footage and rarely-viewed works of Dylan's own, like "Eat the Document"
and "Renaldo and Clara," as well as Dylan-related works by feature filmmakers and documentari-
ans, including Martin Scorsese, Sam Peckinpah, D. A. Pennebaker, Dennis Hopper, Stephen
Frears, and Curtis Hanson.
Requirements: a 10-page paper or equivalent project. Some mandatory film screenings may occur
outside of regularly-scheduled class times.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20. Priority given to seniors.
Meeting time: afternoons. This course will meet twice a week for three hours.
Cost to student: $75.

ENGL 017 Looking at Contemporary Documentary Photography (Same as ArtH 017)
This course explores the evolution of modern documentary photography. We'll start with Robert
Frank's The Americans, and consider how Frank's singular vision deeply shaped the next genera-
tion of photographers working the American streets and landscape. Diane Arbus, Bruce Davidson,
William Klein, Lee Freidlander, Danny Lyon, Gary Winogrand are some of the photographers
whose work we'll get to know well. We'll discuss the new wave of independent and Magnum
photojournalists (Josef Koudleka, Susan Meiselas, Gilles Peress, Sebastio Salgado, and Alex
Webb)--the wars they cover from Vietnam to Iraq to Bosnia, and the personal visions they explore.
We'll explore the diverse currents of documentary photography through the work of Bill Burke,
Larry Clark, Lois Conner, Linda Connor, Larry Fink, Nan Goldin, Emmet Gowin, Sally Mann,
Mary Ellen Mark, Nicholas Nixon, and Abelardo Morell. We'll also explore the gray areas between
photographic fact and personal fiction through the work of Duane Michaels, Joel Peter Witkin, and
Carrie Mae Weems, and also the large-scale epic photographs of Gregory Crewdson, Jeff Wall,
Philip-Lorca diCorcia, and Andreas Gursky. Slide presentations will occupy half of the first meet-
ings and give way to discussion of issues in documentary photography.
Requirements: Students will be encouraged to work on individual projects of their own choice.
Each student will make a brief presentation to the class on a documentary topic of their choice. A
final paper expanding on this documentary topic will be due at the end of the course. Students will
be evaluated on their classroom presentation, general participation, and their written work. The
course involves a field trip to New York City to visit collections at the Museum of Modern Art, the
Whitney Museum of American Art, and the International Center of Photography, and to meet with
curators of photography at these institutions.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 12.
Meeting time: mornings. The course will meet three days a week for two hours.
Cost to students: $30 for personal expenses for the New York field trip.

ENGL 018 English Rhymes and Rhythms
      Blest be all metrical rules that forbid automatic responses,
      Force us to have second thoughts, free from the fetters of self.
                                    --W. H. Auden

This course is designed to increase awareness of the expressive possibilities of the traditional
sounds of English verse, those established patterns of rhyme and rhythm from which "free verse" is
free. We will not only read verse, but listen to it, speak it, and write it, in pursuit of a fuller experience
of past and present poetry. Each student will also create a "memory anthology" of individually cho-
sen poems. Our goal is to awaken the ear as well as the mind. Though the course should improve the
ability to recognize and analyze poetic forms and prosodic effects, it will proceed through practical
exercises rather than analytical essays, with a strong tilt toward the actual writing of verse. We will

                                                ­ 355 ­

examine poems by such versifiers as Dr. Seuss, Shakespeare, Hopkins, Wilbur, and Larkin, with
others suggested by the class, and verse written by class members. We'll end with a reading of Vik-
ram Seth's brilliantly formal (and informal) novel in verse, The Golden Gate.
Students will be evaluated on the basis of their verse exercises, their regular and active attendance,
and the care and commitment with which they present their anthologies, to be spoken from memory
in the presence of the instructor.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15. Priority given to seniors, then to other students.
Meeting time: afternoons. The course will meet three or four times (as needed) each week for two
hours.

ENGL 019 Representing Jazz (Same as Music 019)
The music called "Jazz" has been, in substance and in its associations, a rich cultural signifier. This
course will examine various attempts in written and visual media, in commentary and in style, to
define "jazz" and its cultural significance. Texts will include essays, fiction, poetry, autobiographi-
cal works, interviews, journalism, film clips, photographs, and paintings. We will give particular
attention to musicians such as Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Billie Holiday, and Charles Min-
gus. We will read texts by LeRoi Jones (Amiri Baraka), Ralph Ellison, Albert Murray, Bob Kauf-
man, Ntozake Shange, Whitney Balliett, and others.
Requirements: Students will be expected to contribute actively to the in-class analysis of texts and
images. A class presentation and a final ten-page paper will also be required.

A bootcamp in video production. For twelve days, we will study non-fiction films and videos, dis-
cuss theoretical issues surrounding documentary, and hold training workshops in sound recording,
lighting, and videography. We will then fly to Tucson, Arizona, where we will spend ten days shoot-
ing footage of Biosphere II and interview staff members and scientists. The footage--supplement-
ed by additional shoots--will form the basis of an hour-length documentary. Approximately half of
the students enrolled will have already done some work in video. Students with no such experience
will be trained in skills--like sound recording and line production--that can be taught more quick-
ly. All students will share in the conception and execution of the shoot.

planet. If we assume each wanting high standards of living like the U.S. then we should expect the
consumption of natural resources to produce 400 billion tons of solid waste every year. That is

enough waste to bury greater Los Angeles 100 meters deep. Industrial ecology is a dynamic sys-
tems-based framework utilizing knowledge of ecological systems towards the design of economi-
cally wise industrial systems on every scale that minimizes the creation of waste and pollution. Our
overly consumptive society has traditionally not paid adequate attention to issues of waste and
pollution. As a result of this it is now highly important that future leaders in all fields have at least a
basic understanding of what the practice of industrial ecology can bring to their organization and
society as a whole. Journey on a voyage of discovery as we attempt to apply the waste and pollution
free wisdom of natural systems towards the development of new ways of imagining industrial sys-
tems that mimic nature's efficiency and pollution free processes of production.
This course will utilize Williams College as an educational industrial site. We will create an ecolog-
ical footprint of Williams that will help us to better understand resource consumption and waste
production. We will further generate an input/output model of the college that will serve to help us
track materials movement and energy use. Finally we attempt to pinpoint areas along the input/out-
put model that are producing waste and pollution problems. Through group brainstorming, mind
mapping, poems, field trips, and a game simulation activity, participants will learn creative ways of
working towards solving problems of waste and pollution in an economical way.
Evaluation is based on the quality of the journal writing assignments and a 10-page final paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 16. If demand exceeds capacity, prospective students will be
asked to describe their goals in a short e-mail application to the instructor.
Meeting time: mornings, TR from 10-1. Some reading material will be assigned prior to the first
class.
Cost to student: $35 for book and reading packet.

ENVI 013 Global Climate Change
Global warming and the resulting climate change is considered by many to be the single most
threatening environmental issue we will face in the coming century. While the processes that have
led to the current crisis can be understood by the study of science, solutions to the problem must
come from the intersection of science, economics, and policy.
Specific issues to be covered in this course include:

      * What is the scientific basis of global warming?
      * Is there consensus within the scientific community as to the severity of the problem?
      * What evidence supports or refutes the claim that anthropogenic sources are to blame?
      * What action is called for on the local, national, and international level, and is such action
      economically and politically feasible?
This course is designed to be an interdisciplinary overview of the issues surrounding global warm-
ing, including science, economics, policy, and politics. Classes will be a mixture of lecture, discus-
sion, and presentations by guest speakers. We will learn to think critically about information on
global warming that comes from different sources and interest groups. Readings for the course will
include The Heat Is On, by Ross Gelbspan, scholarly publications, and articles from the mass me-
dia.
Evaluation will be based on class participation, a final paper, and a class presentation.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15.
Meeting time: afternoons. The course will meet three times per week for two hours.
Cost to student: $50 for books and photocopies.

ENVI 016 Tiny Footprint: Living Sustainably in the New Millennium (Same as Biology
016)
How much of the earth's natural resource do you currently consume on a daily basis? What are some
of the technologies, changes in mind-set, and cultural movements that will enable you (or force
you!) to live in a more sustainable way in the near future? How will such changes affect your quality

of life? In this course each participant will address the first question quantitatively by estimating his
or her ecological footprint. An ecological footprint is the area of land required to sustainably regen-
erate the natural resources consumed by daily actions. In class, we will discuss selected sustainable
technologies (e.g., natural building, renewable energy systems, and hydroponic/aquaponic food
production) and social issues dealing with sustainability. We will also engage in a few hands-on
group projects, and take field trips to see houses built with renewable materials and talk with sus-
tainable living pioneers. Each participant will then investigate a selected topic in sustainability,
evaluating current consumption patterns, ways in which technology and/or behavior change could
reduce environmental impact, and hypothesizing how that change would affect quality of life. Find-
ings will be published on a new sustainable living website (tinyfootprint.org), which this class will
organize and launch. (Web authoring tools and techniques will be presented if needed.)
Evaluation is based on the research project, a web page design (10-page paper equivalent), and class
participation.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 16. Preference will be given to Environmental Studies concen-
trators.
Meeting time: MWR, 10 a.m.-noon, with some Tuesdays, 10 a.m.-4 p.m. reserved for field trips or

GEOS 010 Geology of the National Parks
A vicarious trip through selected national parks of the U.S. and Canada with emphasis on the geo-
logical basis for their unique scenery. Areas to be studied will be chosen in order to illustrate a wide
variety of geologic processes and products. The class will meet most mornings during the first two
weeks for lectures and discussions, supplemented with lab work devoted to the interpretation of
topographic and geologic maps and to the study of rock samples. Readings will include a paperback
text as well as short publications of the U.S. Geological Survey and of various natural history
associations. The second part of the month will involve independent study of topics chosen by the
students in preparation for half-hour oral presentations during the last week. The oral reports will be
comprehensive, well illustrated explanations of the geology of a particular national park or monu-
ment of the student's choice, using maps, slides, and reference materials available within the de-
partment and on the internet. A detailed outline and an accompanying bibliography will be sub-
mitted at the time of the oral presentation.

GERM 010 Marx and Nietzsche
Though radically opposed in their basic world views, Karl Marx (1818-83) and Friedrich Nietzsche
(1844-1900) exhibited striking similarities in their critiques of modern bourgeois society as it was
emerging in the nineteenth century. Their analyses of the religious, economic, political, sexual and
linguistic predilections of the rising middle class continue to exert enormous influence on social
critics today, even as the middle class reigns triumphant. We will compare and contrast their ideas in
the context of German society from the final defeat of Napoleon (1815) to the start of the First World
War (1914). We will also consider whether their relevance today is more than academic. Among
works to be read: by Marx, "Early Writings," "The Communist Manifesto," "Capital" (selections),
and by Nietzsche, "On the Use and Abuse of History," "The Gay Science" (selections), and "The
Anti-Christ."
Evaluation will be based on two short papers.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15.
Meeting time: mornings. We will meet three times a week for two-hour sessions.

guistics wrote the two most influential works of fantasy literature, The Hobbit and The Lord of the
Rings. We will investigate how Tolkien's mastery of Anglo-Saxon and Old Norse literature, as well

as the culture of post-war Britain, shaped the creation of his fantasy-universe known as Middle
Earth. By examining the works of Tolkien within their larger intellectual, social, and cultural con-
texts, we will uncover how an author of children's fantasy came to define the image of the Middle
Ages in modern British and American popular culture.

Migration is often understood in the aggregate, as the mass movements of people. Yet migration is
also an intensely personal experience. This course will explore how Latinas and Latinos have told
their migration stories. After a brief historical overview of a particular group's migration history,
we will read fictional and autobiographical accounts to address what life was like in the home coun-
try, the experience of the journey, and the challenges of adjusting to life in the United States.

HIST 013 History of Sports in America
This course examines the development and explores the meanings of American sports from the
colonial era through the twentieth century. Historically, sports have offered Americans an arena in
which to play out many of the nation's most important and contentious cultural issues. Precisely
because sports are largely seen as "apolitical," the meanings of race, gender, and class are worked
out on the field with a candor not possible elsewhere. Through discussions of primary documents,
both written and visual, and through an individual research project, we will examine the relation-
ship between Americans and sports. In particular, we will focus on the links between sports and
America's sense of itself as a nation, explore the effects of industrialization, urbanization, and im-
migration on sporting life and practice, and discuss the ways in which sports both reinforce and
challenge historical meanings of racial and gender identity. We may even get in a game or two our-
selves.

HIST 014 Ethics, Journalism and American Society
Why did scores of reporters shove microphones at Monica Lewinsky, even after she made it clear
she was not granting interviews? Under what conditions, if any, should journalists lie to get a story?
Should news organizations publish nasty allegations from anonymous sources? Is it ever proper for
investigative reporters to go undercover? When, if ever, should hidden cameras and secret record-
ing devices be deployed? Should reporters take big bucks to appear on TV talk shows?
Journalism used to be considered an honorable profession. And now? Recent opinion polls indicate
that Americans trust reporters no more so than they do lawyers. Of late, journalists have been por-
trayed in mainstream American movies as bumbling, arrogant fools. The question is: To what de-
gree have media ethics gone astray? This course will examine contemporary ethics in American

HIST 015 Hands-On Investigative Reporting
So, you've always been intrigued by investigative reporters--or at least wondered how they dig up
all that stuff.
Students will learn how to obtain information--confidential and otherwise--in a moral, responsi-
ble and effective fashion. First, the course will provide a hands-on approach to how investigative
reporters gather information. What methods are actually used?
Second, this course will first take a hard look at investigative reporting in the U.S. Increasingly,
American journalists are delving into topics in politics, in business, and in the lives of individuals
that previously have been off-limits. At what point will the media have gone too far? Do prying
journalists make for a better or worse American society? The course will include case studies, mov-
ies, outside readings and visits from working investigative journalists and a media attorney.
Requirements: an investigative project. Working in groups, students will be required to go out and
search for hard-to-locate information in Williamstown.
No prerequisites, other than an insatiably curious mind. Enrollment limit: 30.
Meeting time: MWF mornings.

HIST 016 Social Justice and Mental Illness in America (Same as Psychology 016)
The historical and current treatment of mentally ill people in the United States reflects our social
and political beliefs and values as much as it does the state of scientific knowledge. By studying the
history of, and making intensive visits to, institutions for treating people who are mentally ill, we
will seek to answer questions such as: how and why did "asylums" evolve? Why are so many people
with mental illness found in jails today and why do some hospitals resemble jails? How are social
justice and civil rights issues related to the practical issues facing mental patients and their families?
Throughout the course, we will integrate historical and psychological perspectives.
Evaluation will be based on class participation and a 10-page paper.
Prerequisites: At least one regular semester course in Psychology. Enrollment limit: 20.
Meeting time: mornings.
Cost to student: $30 for books and Xeroxes.

HIST 017 History in Pieces
Burgoyne Surrounded, Mexican Cross, Log Cabin, Texas Star, Mariner's Compass, Storm at Sea,
Drunkard's Path, Underground Railway are just a few of the many quilt patterns designed by our
American ancestors, representing events, political or social, in this country in the eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries. In this course students will study American history through quilts. At the same
time, they will learn traditional and contemporary methods of quilt making. Each student will select
a traditional American quilt pattern and reproduce that pattern in the form of a "sampler" block. In
addition, each student will design and translate a twentieth-century event into a quilted wall hang-
ing or lap quilt. Both completed pieces will be the basis of a quilt show to be scheduled during the
second semester.
Evaluation will be based on regular participation in class and completion of the two quilt projects.
Students should understand that these are time consuming projects and they must be prepared to put
in considerable time beyond actual class hours.
No prerequisites, but sewing experience is useful. Enrollment limit: 15.

HIST 018 American Strategy in World War II: War Plans and Execution
During the Second World War, the United States fought a global conflict. By late 1943, for example,
American forces were in combat in Italy, New Guinea, the Solomon Islands and the Central Pacific.
The war against the U Boat threat and the air war against Germany continued with increasing inten-
sity, and the allied staffs were engaged in planning the 1944 invasion of France. To achieve the na-
tion's basic political objective--the unconditional surrender of Germany and Japan--the United
States devised a series of strategic and operational war plans for both the European and Pacific areas
of operation. A number of factors including inter-allied and inter-service disputes, logistics, and
enemy actions frequently led to results that were quite different from the planner's expectations.
The course will examine the major US war plans using selected readings and a number of actual
plans. The course will then explore the realities of battle and the differences between plans and exe-
cution.
Requirements: class participation, attendance and a 10-page essay.
No prerequisites.
Meeting time: afternoons. The course will meet twice a week for three hours.
Cost to student: $30 for books and xeroxes.

HSCI 016 Ayurveda: Art of Healing (Same as Special 016)
This course will cover the history and roots of Ayurveda. We will study and discuss the cosmic
evolution of this system as it is seen through Yoga. We will delve into ancient Vedic knowledge and
discover how this science of health and longevity grew out of these ancient traditions. The students
will be taught the basics of Ayurveda and its approach to health and balance through the study of the
Doshas or biological humors and the four elements that govern them. The student will be exposed to
pulse diagnosis, the use of herbs, the use of mantra in healing, jyotish ( eastern astrology) and medi-
tation. The student should leave with an understanding of their own make-up and how to keep them-
selves balanced and an understanding of the inherent balances found in nature and how they are
applied to humans.
Students will be required to complete readings, participate in class discussions, keep a journal and
submit a 10-page final paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15.
Meeting time: afternoons, 2 hours 3 times per week.
Cost to student: $50.00.

INTR 011 Drawing to a Close: Illustrating Disappearing Farms (Same as ArtS 023 and
Environmental Studies 011)
This studio/field course will illustrate, document, and interpret the abandonment of farms in the
region over the past 50 years. In the 1950s there were dozens of dairy farms in Williamstown and
now there are just two. The stories of why farms have disappeared are both intriguing and varied
and will be explored through students using visual media (sketching, drawing, painting, and mixed
media). Early in the course participants will study the landscape history of the region as well as
learning drawing techniques. Then participants will be assigned to individual farms and farmers to
interpret the past and present farmscapes and gain insights into the transitions out of agriculture.
The course is taught by Mary Natalizia, a local artist and art teacher and Henry W. Art (ENVI/
BIOL) who is a fellow of the Williams Center for Technology in the Arts and Humanities for the
year. Professor Art is working on a project, Half a Century of Land Use Change in Williamstown,
that explores the decline of farms through oral history, aerial and ground level photography. The
creations of this course will be publicly displayed and may be included in a multi-media product on
disappearing dairy farms that Prof. Art is producing.
Evaluation will be based on course participation, a journal, and creations.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 12. Selection will be based on a short e-mail statement, should
the course be over-enrolled.
Meeting time: mornings.
Cost to students: $45 for materials.

INTR 012 Philanthropy
This course will introduce students to the history of American philanthropy, its role in the support of
cultural and social services, and its relevance to personal enrichment and fulfillment. Through a
process that involves: (1) the identification and study of non-profit organizations in Berkshire
County; (2) the evaluation of their missions and the effectiveness of their programs; and (3) the
awarding of grants (with funds made available for that purpose), students will develop experiential-
ly-based knowledge of the non-profit organizations serving their community, the challenges of rec-
onciling needs and resources, and the value of charitable giving as part of a balanced life.
Students enrolled in the course will be responsible for determining the structure of its grant-making
process. The students will be responsible for discussing and deciding: (1) the types of organizations
or activities they will consider for support; (2) the manner in which they will evaluate an organiza-
tion's programs and needs; and (3) the number and size of grants. Each student will be responsible
for choosing one non-profit organization to study and to present to the class for its consideration.
The students' deliberations will be shaped and informed by guest speakers with professional and
personal experience as philanthropists and by readings in the history and impact of American phi-
lanthropy. The course instructor will not serve any determining role in the allocation of funds. There
will be no limits placed on how the students choose to execute their duties except that: (1) all grants
must be made to non-profit (501(c)(3)) organizations in the local Berkshire community and (2) no
grants may be made for political purposes or to Williams College. After grants have been awarded,
students will evaluate and summarize their grant-making process in a written document submitted
as part of the course requirement.
Students' evaluations will be based on the quality of their presentations on the non-profit organiza-
tions selected for advocacy, the quality of contributions to the class's discussion of granting policies
and decisions, and final papers.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15. Preference is given to juniors and seniors.
Meeting time: variable days, in the morning.
Cost to student: $25.

INTR 013 Managing Non-Profits: An Insider's Look
This course will focus on the study of the particular skills needed to run a successful non-profit or-
ganization, which include administration, creative vision, financial management, fund raising, and
public accountability. It will also consider, absent the profit motive, what spurs a non-profit's pur-
suit of excellence. The syllabus is based on a series of case studies and presentations by administra-
tors and directors from arts, social service, educational, and environmental organizations. Notable
institutions, such as the New York City Ballet, the Children's Aid Society, and MASS MoCA, will
be represented. Class discussion will be informed by assigned readings and organizational mater-
ials. A two- or three-day mid-week trip to New York City to visit non-profits and to attend perform-
ances by non-profit companies is also planned.
Student evaluation will be based on class attendance (which is required) and acceptable preparation
as evidenced by class participation and familiarity with the assigned readings and other materials.
Two students will be assigned to each class to act as co-leaders of the class discussion. They will be
responsible for: (1) familiarizing themselves with the materials about the organization and the guest
speaker; (2) undertaking additional reading and research on the subject of the organization's mis-
sion, and (3) preparing questions and discussion points. Finally, a 10-page paper will be due by the
last day of class in which the student: (1) evaluates the organizations and executives s/he has studied
in terms of integrity of mission and effectiveness in forwarding its cause; and (2) identifies the com-
mon characteristics or traits shared by the non-profit executives whom s/he considers most success-
ful.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15.
Meeting time: variable days, in the afternoon; also a 2-day field trip to New York City.
Cost to student: $50 for books and readings.

INTR 018 Wilderness Leadership
This Winter Study project is for students who would like to participate in an off-campus experien-
tial education opportunity. Students will be required to research an appropriate accredited program
i.e. National Outdoor Leadership School, Outward Bound etc., that will provide a suitable learning
environment and be at least 22 days in length. The Director of the Williams Outing Club will assist
students in their search if necessary. Upon choosing a program and being accepted, students will
meet with the Director in a pre-program meeting in December to create a framework for observing
group dynamics and studying a variety of leadership styles. A required ten-page paper based on
their journals will be required immediately after their return to campus for the start of third quarter.
There will also be a follow up class to debrief the experience in the last week of February. All pro-
grams must meet with the approval of the Outing Club Director.
Requirements: course approval by WOC Director, daily journal writing with focus on leadership
and group dynamics, 10-page paper and 2 class meetings pre and post trip. Evaluation will be based
on a 10-page paper and class discussions.

No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20. Not open to first-year students. Interested sophomores, jun-
iors and seniors must consult with WOC Director before registration.
Cost to student: varies depending on the program selected--range is generally from $1,500-3,000.

INTR 025 Williams In Washington: Leadership in Our Nation's Capital
An on-site study of leadership in America's capital city. Students will spend two weeks in Washington, DC
meeting with leaders in government, business, and the not-for-profit world. During the initial classes, stu-
dents will study leadership theory, as well as participate in an assessment of their own leadership styles.
While the focus of the course is leadership, the course also provides an overview of the political and public
policy process, through the stories of guest speakers. The following issues are just some of those that will
be considered: Is politics corrupt? What role does the media play in setting national policy? How do forces
outside the nation's capital influence government? This course will be of interest to anyone who wants to
understand Washington, D.C. and the people who live and work there.
Students will stay downtown, and will travel by metro to meeting locations around the district. A variety of
activities will be available on both weekends and weekdays, including an informal meeting with D.C. area
alumni. Travel to D.C. and housing is covered in the course fee--metro fares and most meals will be the

At the "crossroads of the world," Panama provides an ideal venue from which students can study
leadership in a multicultural and international context. As a gateway, Panama and its canal are sym-
bols of globalization that can help students understand many of the forces affecting the contempo-
rary world. Students will spend nearly the entire January term in Panama, where they will reside in
newly renovated apartments at the Ciudad del Saber or the City of Knowledge, located near the
Pacific entrance of the Panama Canal and within a short distance from Panama City (www.ciudad-
delsaber.org.pa). A former military base for U.S. forces during their administration of the Canal
Zone (and with all the recreational resources of a former command post of high import), the area
now serves as a research center, technology park and residence for visiting universities from around
the world.
During their stay, students will be engaged in classes and field trip with ample time for independent
exploration. Topics include: Latin American History; Society and Politics; The New World Econo-
my; The Social and Ecological Ramifications of Globalization; and New Technologies and Future
Opportunities. The course is team-taught by Professors from Williams, professionals in Panama,
and visiting experts from the Smithsonian Tropic Research Institute based in Panama. Field trips
include such itineraries as a visit to Parliament and other government building in Panama City, a
transit of the Panama Canal (and a visit to the Panama Canal Authority and Museum), an overnight
to the archeological site Cerro Juan Diaz on the Pacific side of the country, and a visit to the new
Galeta Marine Laboratory in Colon at the Atlantic entrance of the Canal. Opportunities for interac-
tion with students from other universities will be offered, both in the classroom setting, and in less
formal, social outings.
Evaluation will be based on class participation; completion of an interview of a Panamanian citizen,
and a 10-page paper at the conclusion of the course.
No prerequisites, but while a working knowledge of Spanish isn't required, familiarity with the lan-
guage will enhance a student's experience while in Panama. Enrollment limit: 15. Preference will
be given to students with course work in Latin-American Studies, Leadership Studies, and/or Politi-
cal Science.
Cost to student: $1,775.

MATH 010 Humor Writing (Same as English 027)
What is humor? The dichotomy inherent in the pursuit of comedic intent while confronting the real-
ity of attempting to comprehend the transient nature of adversity can ratchet up the devolving
psyche's penchant for explication to a catastrophic threshold, thwarting the ecstatic impulse and
pushing the natural proclivity for causative norms beyond the possibility of pre-situational adapta-
tion.
Do you know what that means? If so, this is not the course for you. No, we will write funny stuff, day
in and day out. Or at the very least, we will think it's funny. Stories, essays, plays, fiction, nonfiction,
we'll try a little of each. And we'll read some humor, too.
Is laughter the body's attempt to eject excess phlegm? Why did Plato write dialogues instead of
monologues? Who backed into my car in the Bronfman parking lot on the afternoon of March 2,
2001? These are just a few of the questions we will not explore in this course. No, we won't have
time because we will be busy writing. (But if you know the answer to the third question, there's a

MATH 012 The Art of Chess
Chess is a beautiful and very inspiring game. No game has surpassed chess in its popularity in all

offered inspiration to scientists, artists, and writers. Such is the subtlety of the game that no one has
been able to determine whether it is an art, a science, a sport, or a combination of them all. This
course will be an introduction to the beautiful and inspiring world of chess.
Topics include basic principles: openings, middle-game and endings; mathematical aspects of
chess; general theory of a middle-game play; end-game strategies. We will look at some famous
games, discuss chess problems and organize a tournament among students and computer programs.
Evaluation will be based on class participation and problem assignments.

MATH 013 Concealing, Stealing and Revealing Data: The Science and Politics of
Encryption
Throughout history, wars have been won and lost based on a military's ability to successfully send
secret messages and to break the enemy's secret codes. In fact, until the last century, most uses for
encryption were related to the military. Since the invention of high-powered computers and the In-
ternet, however, there has been an explosion in the need for and usage of encryption. In the 1970's,
public-key encryption was invented, allowing two parties who want to communicate in a secure
way to do so even without already sharing a secret "key". Today, there are numerous mathematical
methods used for encryption - many which are surprisingly simple. In this course, we will study
some of the more popular methods, including the Diffie-Hellman public-key exchange, RSA, and
PGP. We will also discuss the increasing number of uses of encryption, including the securing of
transactions on the Internet, "digital fingerprints," and recent attempts to digitally protect copy-
righted text, music and video. Finally, we will discuss the opportunities and challenges that the in-
vention of these cryptosystems has presented individuals, businesses and the United States govern-
ment. Until about two years ago it was illegal to export "strong" encryption. Today companies with
copyright concerns are attempting to literally remove certain simple and relatively well known de-
cryption algorithms from the realm of public knowledge. In this course, we will study the history
and political atmosphere surrounding these issues, and discuss some of the controversies that are
shaping up for the years to come.

MATH 014 Fantasy Novels of C.S. Lewis and Charles Williams (Same as English 028)

Both Lewis and Williams were members of The Inklings, the remarkable group of British authors
and thinkers who met regularly at "The Eagle and Child" Pub in Oxford, where writers (including
Tolkien) read their works in progress to one another. Lewis is well-known; the works of Williams
have received less recognition, but were admired by W.H. Auden, Dorothy L. Sayers, and T.S. Eliot.
Both Lewis and Williams approached their work as staunch Anglican Christians, and their point of
view will be respected in this course; however, their novels can speak to the lives of all readers who
are sensitive to their own world and to human relationships.
Readings will include the Ransom Trilogy of Lewis: Out of the Silent Planet, Perelandra, and That
Hideous Strength (often called "the Charles Williams novel written by C.S. Lewis"), and Wil-
liams's War in Heaven and Descent into Hell (which Lewis listed as one of the ten books which most
influenced his own thinking). The month will conclude with Lewis's final novel Till We Have
Faces.
Evaluation will be based on attendance and participation in all discussions. The final project will be
a 10- to 20-page short story in the style of, incorporating some ideas of, or using literary techniques
of the novels read. Alternatively, students may choose to write an expository or critical paper of
about 15 pages relating some or all of the novels read to other fiction by these two authors or to
works of comparable writers such as George MacDonald, Madeleine l'Engle, or J.K. Rowling.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 14.
Meeting time: mornings.
Cost to student: $40-50 for books.

MUS 011 Music and Film
This course will involve an intensive study of the history, theory, and interpretation of film music.
We will begin by creatively considering how film and music might be united in the cinema and with
introductory readings in film music theory and history. We will then focus our interpretive and ana-
lytical work and class discussions on selected films. While most of our attention will be devoted to
the work of major composers and directors of American and European film (with possible exam-
ples from Japanese and Indian cinema), we will also consider more specialized subjects related to
the instructor's research. Sample topics to be explored include: music and the silent film; Holly-
wood musicals; opera and film; Herrmann and Hitchcock; Rota and Fellini; music's role in cine-
matic propaganda; rock music video; Kubrick's musical decisions; psychoanalytic interpretations
of film sound.
This course will meet for two hours three times a week in the morning. Students are also required to
attend three 90-120 minute film screenings each week either in the late afternoon or early evening in
addition to completing the assigned reading before each class meeting.
Evaluation will be based on active participation in class discussions and one 12- to 14-page paper or
a creative film music project approved by the instructor.
No prerequisites, although prior experience in film studies or some musical background will enable
students to engage more fully in the course's interpretive and analytical work.| Enrollment limit: 15.

MUS 025 Cuban Music and Dance
In the form of salsa, Latin jazz, mambo, or rumba, Afro-Cuban music and dance has had a world-
wide impact for more than seventy years. This intensive winter study course will take students to
Cuba to study Afro-Cuban music and dance (primarily rumba and son) on one of two tracks--either
as composers or as performers (musicians or dancers).
On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, performers and composers will have 4 hours per day of in-
struction with members of Afro-Cuba, a renowned folkloric performing ensemble. Founded in
1957, members of this group trace their ancestry to Nigeria and the Congo, they perform religious
and secular music derived from these traditions.
On Tuesdays and Thursdays, performers will practice and discuss what they have learned from

Afro-Cuba and work with Prof. Ernest Brown and KweYao Agyapon, artist in residence in dance,
learning about Cuban music and dance--their history, role in Cuban culture, and world-wide im-
pact. On these days, composers will practice what they have learned from Afro-Cuba and work with
Prof. Ileana Perez Velasquez on compositions inspired by their encounter with Afro-Cuban music
and dance. Students who play guitar, bass, trumpet, or other instruments should bring them. A piano
will be provided. Up to 8 student composers will work with Prof. Perez Velasquez and 12 musicians
or dancers with Prof. Brown and Mr. Agyapon. If feasible, this course will culminate in a free public
performance of materials learned.
Evaluation in both sections of the course will be based on participation, progress in the develop-
ment of performance or compositional skills, and a 10-page paper or its equivalent. Students must
attend every class and may not miss more than one class and pass this course.
No prerequisites, but experience and skill as a composer, musician, or dancer preferred. Fluency in
Spanish is not required but is very helpful. For composers, write a letter to Prof. Perez Velasquez,
explaining your experience and interest in this course. For dancers and musicians, write a letter to
Prof. Brown explaining your experience and interest in this course. Enrollment limit: 8 composers,

PHIL 010 The Possibilities of Hypertext
Text is linear: you read it in a straight line, from beginning to end. Hypertext is non-linear: you start
reading somewhere, proceed until you encounter an interesting link, click, and poof - you're trans-
ported somewhere else. Some people claim this makes hypertext capable of changing the way we
think. Traditional text, so the claim goes, can communicate only those thoughts or contents that are
amenable to expression in a linear form. By employing the non-linear form of hypertext, then, we
might be able to express thoughts that simply cannot be communicated in books or essays. This
course will explore the possibilities of hypertext. We will read hypertexts and discussions of hyper-
text, and each student will create his or her own hypertext as a final project.
Evaluation will be based on the quality of the final hypertext project, and on attendance and parti-
cipation. We will meet three times a week for two-hour sessions, with additional computer-lab
times scheduled as needed. Most work on the hypertext projects will be completed outside of class.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15.Preference given to seniors.
Meeting time: mornings.
Cost to student: $50-$100 for software and reading materials.

PHIL 011 Why New Englanders Eat What They Eat
Have you ever wondered why the food of New England is sugary and bland: is it the people, the
land, the economy? Do New Englanders like their diets or are they forced into them? This course
will investigate these kinds of questions by looking at the political, economic, cultural, and climatic
factors that have shaped the diet and culture of New Englanders.
We will begin our course by learning about the ecology and culture of food developed by Native
Americans: how did they hunt, gather and farm, and how did their methods of procuring food form
their relationship to nature and to each other? Then we will consider the diet of the first European
settlers and their interaction with Native Americans. Issues such as differing uses of the land, what
was considered by the term "property," and what was being sold by the Native Americans to the set-
tlers will be considered. Next we will examine how food was used to try to socialize the next wave
of immigrants to New England and how women used food to gain entrance to higher education,
which also opened the door to science in food. Finally we will look at international issues such as
genetically modified foods, the economic and cultural impact of agribusiness, over-fishing the seas
and pollution as it relates to our food. We will enjoy a historically accurate demonstration of life in
the 1700's at Historic Deerfield and a guest speaker.

PHYS 010 Light and Holography
This course will examine the art and science of holography. It will introduce modern optics at a level
appropriate for a non-science major, giving the necessary theoretical background in lectures and
discussion. Demonstrations will be presented and students will make several kinds of holograms in
the lab. Thanks to a grant from the National Science Foundation, we have 7 well-equipped hologra-
phy darkrooms available for student use.
Students will be evaluated on the basis of regular attendance, completion of 4 laboratory exercises,
and a holography laboratory project or a 10-page paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 28. Preference will be given to students with no previous college
course in physics more advanced than Physics 100.
Meeting time: At the beginning of WSP, the class will meet for lecture and discussion three morn-
ings a week and for lab twice a week. Later classes will be mainly laboratory.

PHYS 011 Introduction to Computer Aided Drafting and Design (CADD) (Same as ArtS
022)
Students will gain a fundamental knowledge of techniques used in two dimensional (2D) and three
dimensional (3D) computer aided drafting. The course begins with an emphasis on CADD nomen-
clature as applied to drawing in 2D . We then become concerned with drawing in 3D and visualizing
spatial relationships by creating wireframe entities of shapes found in everyday life. This will lead
to 3D surface and solid modeling techniques including Boolean operations, mass recognition and
shape manipulation. Following this introduction, the students will be challenged to explore creating
objects of their choosing and develop photorealistic renderings with differing light sources and
changing textures. Art, science, mathematics, and other students who are interested in communi-
cating their design ideas in a 3D form will find this course interesting, as well as those students seek-
ing exposure to an engineering point of view. Students will create a computer solid model of a de-
sign idea and develop the photorealistic rendering that optimizes their design's presentation. This
rendering together with the student's 2D and 3D drawings will form the basis for evaluating his/her
success.
No prerequisites other than a familiarity with the Windows operating system. Enrollment limit: 15.
Meeting time: 1-4 p.m. three times per week. This is a fast moving course. The creative renderings
will reward the student's commitment to attendance and lab time.
Cost to student: $200 for the CADKEY Windows software package.

PHYS 012 Meet the Right Side of Your Brain: Drawing as a Learnable Skill
Representational drawing is not merely a gift of birth or a magical ability granted by angels, but a
learnable skill. If you ever wanted to draw, but doubted you had the ability or believed you could not
learn, then this course is for you. This intensive course utilizes discoveries in brain research to teach
representational drawing. By using simple techniques and extensive exercises you will discover
and develop the perceptual shift from your symbol based left hemisphere to your visually based
right hemisphere. This cognitive shift enables you to accurately see and realistically represent the
physical world. You will learn to draw a convincing portrait, and a still life drawn from a plaster
cast. This course is designed to develop your powers of observation and enhance your innate cre-
ative problem solving abilities, which are applicable in any field. Students need no previous artistic

POEC 026 Healthcare in Havana: A Comparative Study of Resource Allocation and
Public Health Policy (Same as Special 026)
The claim is frequently made that the American healthcare system is the best in the world. What
constitutes a "good" healthcare system? What tools can we use to comparatively evaluate systems
of healthcare delivery? By what measures can we gauge their abilities to meet the needs of their
societies? Is there a role for principles of equity and distributive justice in prioritizing and allocating
healthcare resources? This Winter Study course aims to explore these and many other questions by
spending three weeks in Cuba investigating a healthcare system very different from our own. We
plan to visit a number of sites to gain a deeper understanding of Cuban healthcare: hospitals; free
clinics; pharmaceutical offices; government offices; and community health centers, among others.
The course will focus on issues such as HIV and AIDS prevention and management in a developing
country; maternal-child health and prenatal preventive care; the impact of a non-market, central-
ized economy on healthcare delivery; end-of-life care; and the unique ability of a nationalized
healthcare system to promote a unified public health agenda. Our base will be in Havana, where we
will stay in the dormitories of the National School of Public Health. From Havana, we will take
several day and weekend trips to rural Cuban communities and points of interest around the island.
We will involve ourselves in many aspects of Cuban culture, from history and politics to the local art
and music scene. Readings, formal and informal discussions with Cuban citizens and healthcare
professionals, small-group workshops, and sharing of journal reflections will complement our ex-
periences. We have been coordinating with MEDICC, an organization that routinely organizes trips
of this sort for American medical students.
No prerequisites, but previous Spanish language experience is preferred. Enrollment limit: 10-15.
Cost to student: $2000 per person (includes airfare, 3 weeks lodging, transportation, most expenses
on the island, and most meals.)

PSCI 010 Controversial Issues in Education
This seminar is designed to explore controversies in primary and secondary education in the United
States. We will begin by considering the major challenges facing public education, including retain-
ing qualified teachers and administrators, curbing school violence, and addressing inequities in
funding. We then will consider the main proposals for and the likely consequences of various pro-
posals for reform. In particular, the course will address debates about "high stake" testing, bilingual
education, special and gifted education; charter schools, vouchers, and education-for-profit pro-
gram; and curriculum theory and the role of character education. While evaluating the sides of each
issue, students will consider the philosophy grounding each perspective and the political and social
effects of the different methods of reform. Texts will include: James Wm. Noll, Taking Sides:
Clashing Views on Controversial Educational Issues; Alfie Kohn, The Schools our Children De-
serve; E.D. Hirsch, The Schools We Need and Why We Don't Have Them; and a reader of articles and
essays.
Requirements: Students enrolled in the seminar are expected to complete reading assignments and
engage actively in class discussions. Each student will select an educational issue to research in
depth and present in a 10- to 12-page paper at close of the term.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15.
Meeting time: MW EVENINGS.
Cost to students: books and reading materials.

PSCI 011 The Development of Inuit Art
Inuit art (which includes the following genre of art: sculpture, graphic arts, as well as jewelry, wall
hangings, pottery and other modes) is a very modern development. It can be dated very precisely to
the early 1950s. Since that beginning it has gained world-wide attention. There are galleries of Inuit
art not only through out Canada and the United States but also Europe and Asia. Inuit art is included
in the collections of major museums throughout the world. The production of Inuit art developed in
response to the sudden change in Inuit life from nomadic subsistence in the norther arctic regions of
Canada to fixed settlements on Baffin Island and regions around Hudson Bay and the consequent
need to create a cash based economy. The course will cover the development of Inuit art focusing on
the major centers (Cape Dorset, Baker Lake, Arviat, etc.), the major artists (Kenojuak, Oonark,
George Arlook, Latcholassie, Parr, Pauta, etc.) and the major forms of sculpture and print making.
The changing character of Inuit life and governance (the Canadian government recently completed
a major reconstitution granting much of the people of the arctic north autonomy as a self-governing
region called Nunavut). In addition to the technical development of the art, its history and the biog-
raphy of the major artists, we will be exploring the cultural context of Inuit art to the Inuit as well as
to the international market. There will be assigned readings and a paper assignment with students
choosing from the following topics: a study of a particular work of art, the work of a particular artist,
some aspect of Inuit life or politics, or economic analyses (e.g., using Inuit art auction results over
the years). There will be visiting lectures by major Inuit art dealers.
Evaluation will be based on the paper, class attendance and participation.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 25.
Meeting time: afternoons, three classes per week.
Cost to student: $50 for readings.

                                                                                                                       MARCUS

PSCI 012 Presidential Elections
This course traces the electoral problems of the presidential election of 2000 back to the root causes
from the drafting of the U.S. Constitution to the U.S. Supreme Court decision of Bush v. Gore. This
course includes a mix of political history, constitutional law, state elections laws, and the presiden-
tial electoral process. Guest speakers, subject to availability, involved with various aspects of the
presidential electoral process will offer their perspectives regarding such elections.
Students will be required to prepare a 10-page paper on the topic of retaining or changing the pres-
idential election system which in addition to being submitted to the Instructor, will also be sent by
the students to their two respective U.S. Senators and their U.S. Representative.
No prerequisites, except for an interest in politics. Enrollment limit: 15.

PSCI 013 Assessing Race in Communities of Interest
The class is concerned with an interesting convergence in the area of public policy (concerning the
constitutional status of federal voting law) and political theory (pertaining to assessments of com-
munity in contemporary social relations). The key question involves the impact of minority race
claims on community where the claims come under legal protection in civil rights laws. The issue is
developing in sharp relief in the wake of the 2000 census and the redistricting of electoral offices.
The U. S. Supreme Court, in a series of opinions associated with the Shaw cases, set the stage for
consideration in the legal area as to how and whether "community" in the traditional sense, has been
replaced by new, essentially "virtual," relationships and, if so, how traditional racial claims--racist
or benign--may interact in the new settings. Readings will include key court opinions to set the
problem and then move to writings that may help assess the outcomes through a review of alterna-
tive definitions of community and the evolution of relationships of identity that may be subsumed at
a sub-national level.
Requirements: a short 10-page paper.

PSCI 014 Civil Rights Law
This course will examine contemporary civil rights law including application of constitutional and
statutory law to modern civil liberties issues. The course will address discrimination, employment,
privacy, sex harassment and police misconduct issues. The course will emphasize analysis of cases
and related materials, as opposed to a historical perspective. Students will analyze appellate court
decisions and related materials, mostly U.S. Supreme Court decisions and select federal statutes. A
substantial portion of the class time will be devoted to discussion of the cases and students will be
expected to participate in class discussion and will "argue" from positions taken in some of the ca-
ses. The course will also likely utilize a "model case" whereby students will be distributed a factual
scenario at the inception of the class which will be discussed from time to time throughout the term
as the class covers applicable legal principles and theories.
Requirements: one 8- to 10-page research paper, addressing a civil rights topic to be decided by
student and instructor. Evaluation will be based on the analysis of a student paper and class parti-
cipation. This course will necessitate reading of court decisions and statutes prior to class so there
can be meaningful in-class discussion.
No prerequisites, although an interest in civil rights issues is recommended. Enrollment limit: 20.
Preference given to juniors and seniors.
Meeting time: mornings, two or three times per week.
Cost to student: $65 for materials (copies of court decisions).

PSCI 015 Charismatic Leadership as a Democratic Virtue
Charisma is a virtue hardly democratic. It presumes hierarchical superiorities and excellences that
are less likely to be achieved through rational calculation and willful striving than to be given by
birth or through revelation. It is, one might say, an aristocratic virtue. In Max Weber's influential
definition, thus, charisma as a type of authority is seen as something transcendental, revelatory, and
purely accidental, standing in stark opposition to legal authority that relies on secularism, rationali-
ty, and predictability--the kind of values that are consonant with what Weber calls "passive democ-
racy." This seminar revisits this conventional understanding of charismatic leadership and its rela-
tionship to democracy as Weber articulated it by examining the following two claims. First, Web-
er's "philosophical anthropology" reflects his preoccupation with the political education at the
mass level in which a muted form of charisma as a citizen virtue is deemed critical for sustaining a
robust parliamentary democracy. Second, Weber believed a pluralistically organized "civil soci-
ety" to be necessary for the democratic permeation of charismatic personalities, without which bu-
reaucratic conformity and mediocrity would be unavoidable. Through this engagement with Web-
er, in short, the seminar will explore a crucial tension between charisma (as a citizen virtue), democ-
racy (as a political system threatened from within), and bureaucracy (as a historical inevitabili-
ty)--a tension that still reverberates in our contemporary situation.
Requirements: one short paper, 8-10 pages.
No prerequisites, although some knowledge of modern political thought will be useful. Enrollment
limit: 15.

This course is an internship experience in which students both work in and analyze government and
related nongovernmental organizations. The goal of the course is to develop student ability to ana-
lyze power, authority and decisionmaking in public organizations; in short, to better understand
leadership. Students may have internships in government and nonprofit organizations. They may
have internships in for-profit organizations if the internship involves significant involvement with
public issues. Examples include: town government offices; state or federal administrative offices
such as TANF, WIC, housing authorities; interest groups that lobby government such as Chamber
of Commerce, NOW, or the Sierra Club; nonprofit agencies such as Parenting Partners. Internship
arrangements are made in advance of the Winter Term during which the student serves as an intern.

The instructor works with each student to arrange an internship. Students are expected to spend the
better part of the day, five days a week, with the organization. Each student's internship mentor
sends a confirmation letter to the instructor verifying the internship and describing the nature of the
work to be performed by the intern. Students with Berkshire area internships will read a few short
reading assignments in common and meet with the instructor once a week as a group to compare and
analyze their experiences. Students whose internships are in their home community will meet as a
group before and after winter study to discuss their experiences. During winter study, they are ex-
pected to maintain weekly contact with the instructor. Finally, students will write a 10-page paper
on their experience.
Requirements: internship work and a 10-page paper analyzing issues of power, authority, and deci-
sionmaking in the organization. Evaluation will be based on the mentor's evaluation, participation
in the group discussions and the 10-page paper.
Enrollment limit: 15. At the time of registration, interested students should send a brief resume and
letter of interest. Materials should be sent to the Leadership Programs Coordinator.

PSYC 010 The Popularization of Psychological Disorders
In the past decade, psychological disorders have been popularized to an unprecedented degree in
Western societies. Syndromes like depression, attention deficit disorder, and panic disorder are
now regularly featured on prime-time television, in best-selling books, in radio and television ad-
vertisements, and in magazines. We will explore these popularized accounts of psychological dis-
orders and treatments, focusing on their accuracy, on the cultural assumptions and values expressed
in them, and on the possible psychological consequences of their popularization. Each student will
do library research on, and prepare a presentation about, popular depictions of a particular disorder
or treatment.
Evaluation will be based on class participation, paper proposal, and minimum 10-page paper.
Prerequisites: Psychology 252 or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 15.

PSYC 011 From Segregation to Accommodation: Changing Perspectives on Disabilities
A radical shift in the laws and values shaping the participation of persons with disabilities in our
society has led to motorized carts in Professional Golf Association tournaments and modified exam
procedures for some students on our own campus. After a brief review of the history that brought us
to the currently accepted principles of normalization and inclusion, each student will conduct an
investigation through interviews and site visits into changing practices in a specific local context.
Alternatively, a student may focus an inquiry on a personal experience with his or her own disability
or that of a family member. The underlying aim of this course is to help students become better
equipped to participate in our society's continuing dialogue about the nature of disabilities and what
measures should be taken to accommodate those who have them. Reading selections will be drawn
primarily from the writings of persons with disabilities and their families.
Evaluation will be based on oral participation and a 10-page paper.

PSYC 013 Public Access Television Production
This course will focus on the development and use of public access television to educate the public
on various issues of psychosocial interest. Students will learn the elements of TV show production
and will work in small groups to create an educational show. Topics need to be well documented.
Class time will include viewing of public access productions. Production will take place at Willinet
Studio on Spring Street and will be aired on Channel 17. Students will use cameras, set, and editing
equipment to produce one thirty minute show each.
Evaluation will be based on the content, effort and quality of one public access TV show and one
10-page paper evaluating the production.
Prerequisites: Students must be eligible for admission to Willinet Studio. Students must consult
with instructor before registration. Enrollment limit: 12. (Preference will be given to seniors and
members of the film guild at Williams.)
Meeting time: afternoons, TR, 1-3 p.m. Students will spend additional time in the Willinet studio
creating their own productions at times to be arranged with the studio.
Cost to student: $50 plus cost of book.

                                                                                             SUSAN CONKLIN (Instructor)

PSYC 014 Science and Television Commercials
Television commercials often refer to the results of "scientific" experiments and surveys to pro-
mote products. An examination of the methods they use, however, suggests that T.V.'s rendition of
science portrays the real world to about the same degree as the rest of its programming. The intent of
this course is to use sound scientific methodology in replicating the experiments used as the basis
for these commercials. The initial part of the course will consist of a brief overview of basic scientif-
ic methodology. Students will then divide into groups, select a commercial that is based on an ex-
periment that uses "suspect" methodology, and replicate the study using proper procedures. Stu-
dents will submit a written report of their findings and then present them orally to the class. A "Pass"
will be contingent upon satisfactory completion of both oral and written presentations.
Evaluation will be based on class participation, paper proposal, and minimum 10-page paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 16.
Cost to student: $40 for materials.

                                                                                                                  P. SOLOMON

PSYC 015 Principles of Psychotherapy
Outlining the principles underlying the "talking cure", this course represents the kind of overview
of psychotherapy the instructor wishes he had received as an undergraduate. Topics covered will
include the particular arrangements for therapy, how they differ from other social situations, the
initiation of therapy, and principles of transference, counter-transference, personal history inves-
tigation and interpretation. Of particular interest will be to describe how, during psychotherapy,

persons change. Using both imagined therapy dialogues and published student auto-biographies,
efforts will be made at each stage to illustrate ways in which the general principles work out in prac-
tice. For the course paper, students will be asked to describe an issue of concern in the student's own
experience and to imagine how a therapist might collaborate in working on that issue. At the end of
the course the instructor will discuss each paper individually with each student.
Requirements: readings, class discussion, and a 10-page paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 10. Preferences given to juniors and seniors.
Meeting time: mornings.

PSYC 016 Social Justice and Mental Illness in America (Same as History 016)
The historical and current treatment of mentally ill people in the United States reflects our social
and political beliefs and values as much as it does the state of scientific knowledge. By studying the
history of and making intensive visits to institutions for treating people who are mentally ill, we will
seek to answer questions such as how and why did "asylums" evolve? Why are so many people
with mental illness found in jails today and why do some hospitals resemble jails? How are social
justice and civil rights issues related to the practical issues facing mental patients and their families?
Throughout the course, we will integrate historical and psychological perspectives.
Evaluation will be based on class participation and a 10-page paper.
Prerequisites: At least one regular semester course in Psychology. Enrollment limit: 20.
Meeting time: mornings.
Cost to student: $30 for books and Xeroxes.

                                                                                         WILDER and HEATHERINGTON

PSYC 017 Teaching Practicum
Students interested in teaching may submit applications for a Winter Study assignment as a teach-
er's aide at Mt. Greylock Regional High School or at the Williamstown Elementary School. Those
accepted will work under the supervision of a regular member of the teaching staff and submit a
report on their work at the end of the Winter Study Period. This project involves a four-week com-
mitment to full-time affiliation with the school. Interested students should consult before winter
study registration with Professor Friedman, 304 Bronfman. He will assist in arranging placements
and monitor students' progress during the four-week period.
Criteria for pass include full time affiliation with the school and a final 10-page report. The final
report should summarize the student's experiences and reflections as drawn from a daily journal.
Prerequisite: Approval of Professor Friedman required. Enrollment limited to number of places
available at the two participating schools.
Cost to student: none.

PSYC 018 Institutional Placement
Students interested in a full time January placement in a mental health, social service or applied
psychology (e.g., advertising, law) setting may consult with members of the Psychology Depart-
ment to make appropriate arrangements. Students should first make their own contacts with an in-
stitution or agency. They should also arrange to obtain a letter from a sponsor at the institution who
will outline and supervise the student's duties during January. The student must agree to keep a jour-
nal and to submit a final paper summarizing and reflecting upon the experiences outlined in the
journal.
Requirements: satisfactory evaluation from the institutional sponsor and a 10-page final paper.

will include discussion, video viewing, and experiments in learning styles. Readings to be assigned
will cover martial arts history, Zen thought and Eastern energy theory. Handouts will also be in-
cluded with Japanese terminology and sequences. The other two will be dojo (training hall) ses-
sions, focused on learning and practicing the techniques and routines. One of the eight sessions will
take place at the dojo in Pittsfield so that students will experience a karate class in a more traditional
setting and interact with students on other levels. By the end of the month, all students should be
ready for the first promotion; some may be ready for promotion to the second level. Final class will
be an evening performance and exhibit.
Evaluation: regular attendance, active participation, completion of assigned readings, submission
of three journal entries of 2 or more pages, participation in final performance, contribution to final

sions during which students will be able to practice what he has taught. Students will be expected to
attend classes and read the relevant books. They will be also asked to keep a journal, which will
serve as a basis for the final project. Readings: Wallace, A Passion for Solitude, Dalai-Lama, The
Dalai Lama at Harvard, Khetsun Sangpo, Tantric Practice in Nying-ma, Sogyal Rinpoche, The
Tibetan Book of Living and Dying.

REL 014 Language of the Holocaust
How name what is unnameable, unthinkable, unimaginable? Is silence the only response to un-
speakable acts? Or, if you can articulate a name, an authority, an identity, a reason for genocide, for
the annihilation of the Jewish people, how do you express or represent the experience without the
luxury of artifice? What are the terms of such expression? What claims does the experience make
on those who wish to define it? Is there an ultimate fiction greater than fact that such an event re-
quires? This course will concentrate on the relationships between historical/recorded (mimetic) in-
terpretations (i.e., first person accounts, religious and historical texts, documentary footage) and
constructed (poesis) interpretation of the Holocaust. The latter will include a sampling of films,
novels, poems, art of victims and survivors and others using the material of genocide as primary
source for the creation of a work of art. Within this framework questions regarding both the particu-
lar and universal nature of the Holocaust will be addressed. Course readings and material will offer
provocative pairings to sharpen and question the necessary yet paradoxically unstable distinction
between the mimetic and poetic mode: These might include Wiesel's Night; selections from the Old
Testament (Akidah and Book of Job) and the Zohar, Borowski's This Way to the Gas Chambers,
Ladies and Gentlemen and Scrap of Time and Other Stories; Charles Reznicoff's Holocaust and
Artie Spiegelman's Maus I and Maus II ; Expressionistic and concentration camp art; various his-
torical accounts; and selections form the work of Paul Celan, Nelly Sachs, A. Sutzkever, Edmund
Jabes, Aharon Appelfeld, Andre Schwarz-Bart, Terrence Des Pres and Daniel Goldhagen. Films

REL 025 Explorations in Solidarity: A Meeting of Minds and Hearts in Rural and Urban
Nicaragua

This course will explore the lived realities of the hemisphere's second most impoverished nation,
through the eyes of subsistence farmers, urban factory workers, and those working for progressive
social change. The effects of an increasingly globalized economy, a series of natural disasters (most
notably hurricane Mitch), and the changeable attentions of the developed world will be explored
through conversations with ordinary people, using some of the methods of popular education and
oral history. Significant attention will also be given to the effects on the material and spiritual well-
being of people of liberation theology and the base Christian community movement as well as other
influences, Christian and Marxist. The experience of the course will include approximately one
week of living (with minimal amenities) in a subsistence farming community. Travels and encoun-
ters in Nicaragua will be facilitated by Elena Hendrick and Luis Aguirre of the Asociacion Kairos
para la Formacion, an organization that links Christian communites north and south through soli-
darity toward the goal of transformed relationships. Throughout, students will be invited to enter as
deeply as possible the story of Nicaraguans, and to reflect on their own stories as North Americans
and the sometimes-volatile interaction between these stories. The goal is to begin to discover what it
would mean to shape a relationship with the people of Nicaragua according to a paradigm of solida-
rity--contrasted with the more familiar paradigms of national self-interest, on the macro level, and
charity on the micro level. The course will entail daily reflection sessions, for which a journal will
be kept.
Requirements: attendance at three orientation sessions prior to departure; an oral presentation to the
class at the conclusion of the experience; participation in a group presentation to the College com-
munity upon returning to Williamstown; and a final 10-page paper. Conversational knowledge of
Spanish, though not required, will be helpful. Willingness to live in physically demanding situa-
tions is essential.
Enrollment limit: 15.
Cost to student: $1,800 (including all food, lodging and in-country transportation) plus round-trip
airfare to Managua (approx. $450-700, depending on point of departure).

ix saga as interpretations, first, of French culture and the way the French view themselves with re-
spect to the rest of Europe and, second, of the way they view Europe in dialogue with French cultur-
al norms. Such issues as "la patrie" (homeland), linguistic characteristics, the idea of France,
French provincial distinctiveness, France's view of homogeneous national character seen through
its own cultural diversity, and the relationship of France to other specific regional cultures will be
studied as a way not only of defining the nation's historic legacy, but of coming to terms with the
way it sees its place within the vision of the European Union. Among the texts to be studied will be
Asterix the Gaul, Asterix and the Banquet, Asterix and the Normans, Asterix in Corsica , Asterix in
Britain, Asterix and the Goths, Asterix in Belgium, Asterix in Switzerland. Analysis of the primary
texts will be complemented by secondary cultural readings by prominent interpreters of French cul-
ture. The course will be conducted in English; readings will be in English, but those students who
wish to read the texts in the original French should make arrangements in advance with the instruc-

THEA 010 Shakespeare in Performance
Translating Shakespeare from the page to the stage has compelled centuries of actors. Responding
to a play or a moment in a play and distilling that response into a performable one, accessible to an
audience, is a process that is defined and redefined by theatre practitioners. In this course, students
will take several scenes from Shakespearean plays and realize them for performance. Examining
the text and the clues and signs offered by the structure of the poetry, students will direct and per-
form in these scenes. The final presentation will be fully mounted scenes presented to the college
community entitled "SHAKESPEARE--SEX, DRUGS AND ROCK 'N ROLL!" Evaluation will

SPEC 010 Quest for College: Early Awareness in Berkshire County Schools
Today's extremely competitive higher education market places significant pressure on students na-
tionwide to start planning for college at an increasingly early age while simultaneously demanding
ever-higher standards of excellence for admission to top schools. "Early Awareness" initiatives aim
to educate middle school students as to what lies ahead on the college horizon, empowering them to
make sound academic and extracurricular choices that will keep open a maximum of options. The
first week of this course will be spent in the classroom, exploring and discussing problems and is-
sues germane to the national trends towards greater (and earlier) college-related pressures. Students
will respond to a series of readings dealing with such issues as tracking, paid test preparation and
untimed testing, early decision, parental and peer pressures, special interests, misrepresentation of
information, independent counseling, and others. Class time will also be devoted to familiarizing
students with both the nuances of the college admission process and the administration of the early
awareness game, Quest for College. Students will spend the next two weeks visiting 10-12 Berk-
shire County middle schools, administering the game and inviting students to the culminating Col-
lege Day. All 8 students will then work together to plan and run College Day activities for students
and their parents. This day will include a) campus tours, b) general higher education info sessions,
and c) financial aid/scholarship info for the parents. If student and community interest is sufficient,
the course may culminate in a public presentation and open forum early second semester.
Evaluation will be based on completion of field work (school visits), organization and execution of
project to bring local middle school students to the Williams Campus for a day of early-awareness
related activities and a final paper (approxiamately 10 pages) reflecting on a course-related issue of
the student's choosing.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 8. Preference given to a) students with prior education/admis-
sion experience, b) students with access to transportation c) juniors and seniors. Interested stu-
dents must consult with instructors prior to registration. Students will be selected according to the
following criteria: a) experience in teaching or admission, b) access to transportation, and c) se-
niority. Provision will be stated that interested students must consult the instructors before registra-
tion, that instructors may determine depth of experience and focus of interest.
Meeting time: afternoons.
Cost to student: transportation to field work sites and purchase of text.

Winter Study Program

SPEC 011 Science for Kids (Same as Chemistry 011)
Are you interested in teaching? Do you enjoy working with kids? Do you like to experiment with
new things? Here is a chance for you to do all three! The aim of this Winter Study Project is to design
a series of hands-on science workshops for elementary school children and their parents. Working
in teams of 2-4, students spend the first two and a half weeks of Winter Study planning the work-
shops. This involves deciding on a focus for each workshop (based on the interests of the students
involved) followed by choosing and designing experiments and presentations that will be suitable
for fourth-grade children. On the third weekend of Winter Study (January 19, 20) we bring elemen-
tary school kids with their parents to Williams to participate in the workshops. You get a chance to
see what goes into planning classroom demonstrations as well as a sense of what it's like to actually
give a presentation. You find that kids at this age are great fun to work with because they are inter-
ested in just about everything and their enthusiasm is infectious. You also give the kids and their
parents a chance to actually do some fun hands-on science experiments that they may not have seen
before, and you are able to explain simple scientific concepts to them in a manner that won't be
intimidating. It is a rewarding experience for all involved.
Lecture/discussion/laboratory. Evaluation is based on participation in planning and running the
workshops. Each group is expected to prepare a handout with descriptions of the experiments for
the kids, parents, and teachers.
No prerequisites. You need not be a science major; all that is needed is enthusiasm. Enrollment lim-
it: 25.
Meeting time: Because the calendar this year allows only a brief preparation time for the work-
shops, classes meet as necessary until the workshops are completed. A "dress rehearsal" will be on
January 16. The workshop is run on the third weekend of Winter Study (January 19, 20) and atten-
dance from 9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. is mandatory that weekend. There are also one or two brief meet-
ings held in the fall term for preliminary planning.
Cost to student: none.

SPEC 012 How to Write Popular Science (Same as Chemistry 012 and English 012)
Science writers' work is important because they are the chief conduits between scientists and the
public, responsible for covering fields that are experiencing some of the most rapid advances in
history. Their reporting must translate scientific subjects into clearly understandable ones and at-
tempt to objectively put science news into personal, historical, political, economic, and social con-
text. In this course, you will analyze examples of successful science writing for the general reader--
science writing that entertains people while fascinating them. You will master library research me-
thods. And, you will develop your talents for writing clearly, accurately, and with an interesting
flair. We will read a lot, and by emulating good writing about science, you will develop skill in the
art of explanation, which will serve you well in other courses. There will be numerous short writing
assignments, including a longer final article popularizing a topic in science or technology of your
choosing.
Format: discussion. Evaluation is based on class participation and completion of all reading and
writing assignments.
Prerequisite: One Division III course prior to this course or permission of the instructor. Enrollment
limit: 10.
Meeting times: MWF mornings.
Cost to student: $30 for books.

SPEC 013 Food on Film (Same as Russian 013)
Food figures prominently in many great films, provoking not only the senses but also the appetite.
This course will explore the use of food as both sustenance and metaphor in a variety of internation-
al films, from the serious to the comic, from documentary to fantasy, from short to full-length fea-
ture. Films viewed will likely include La Grande Bouffe; The Cook, The Thief, His Wife, and Her
Lover; Like Water for Chocolate; Woman on Top; Delicatessen; The Blood of the Beasts; A Touch of
Spice; Tampopo; and Henry Jaglom's Eating. We'll also look at cooking-show clips from the TV
Food Network to see how they reflect contemporary culture.

SPEC 015 Deaf and Proud: An Introduction to Deaf Language and Culture
The aim of this course is to introduce students to the world of deafness. Although it is not a sign
language course, we will learn about the differences between American Sign Language (A.S.L.)
and invented sign systems such as Signed English. Students should expect to develop a basic under-
standing of the linguistic status of American Sign Language (A.S.L.), a language in which the
grammar is expressed on the face and which does not share the grammatical structures of English.
We will give specific attention to the social and economic status of the deaf community at large and
to the social and political constraints imposed upon them by a hearing community which denies
them education in their own language. Three approaches to deaf education will be addressed: oral,
signed English, and A.S.L. Several native signers will be invited to lecture and engage in dialogue
with students about deaf politics and culture. The course will be taught by an instructor with exten-
sive experience as an interpreter in the deaf community. In addition to exploring deafness from the
perspectives of deaf people, students will learn about the role of the interpreter in both deaf and
hearing communities. Major texts for the course may include the following: In This Sign by Joanna
Greenberg, a child of deaf adults, The Mask of Benevolence by Harlan Lane, Voices from a Culture
by Padden and Humprhies, and a collection of articles and videos.
Evaluation will be based on brief journal entries which record responses to videos, discussions and
readings following each class, a 5-page critical response essay to an assigned topic, class participa-
tion, and a final project (i.e., oral presentation, performance, essay, etc.).
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15.
Meeting time: Students will be required to attend two afternoon class meetings per week from 1-4
p.m.
Cost to student: $30 for books.

SPEC 019 Medical Apprenticeship

A student is assigned to a local physician, dentist, or veterinarian to observe closely his or her prac-
tice in the office and/or at the North Adams Regional Hospital, Berkshire Medical Center (Pitts-
field, MA), or Southwestern Vermont Medical Center (Bennington, VT). It is expected that a stu-
dent will spend the better part of the day, five days a week, with the physician or a period mutually
agreed upon by the student and the physician as being educationally significant. The program has
proven to be extremely successful in giving interested students a clear picture of the practice of
medicine in a non-urban area. An effort is made to expose the student to a range of medical special-
ties. A 10-page report written on some aspect of the month's experience is required.
Prerequisite: Interested students must attend a mandatory information meeting in early October,
prior to applying for this course. Enrollment limited to 44. (Preference is given to juniors, and then
sophomores, whose course work has been suggestive of a firm commitment to preparation for medi-
cal school.)
Cost to student: none, except for local transportation and vaccinations.

sues in the courts, the competing interests involved, the public impact of the decisions and, in most
cases, the difficulty of resolution. This will not be a course in Constitutional Law because students
won't be expected to master the many substantive areas of Constitutional Law. Students will have
an opportunity to make oral presentations during class periods. Students will spend two to three
days in Boston where they will have the opportunity to witness activities at the Middlesex County
District Attorneys Office and meet with representatives of the federal and state judiciary.
Evaluation will be based on a 10-page paper, an oral presentation, and regular participation in class.
No prerequisites Enrollment limit: 12. If the course is overenrolled, students will be asked to write a
short essay to determine selection.
Meeting time: MR mornings (all day while in Boston). Students will meet in December prior to the
break to discuss logistics and expectations for the course.

SPEC 035 Making Pottery on the Potter's Wheel (Same as ArtS 035)
Each class will begin with a lecture-demonstration, followed by practice on the potter's wheel.
Each student will have the use of a potter's wheel for each class. We will work on mugs, bowls,
pitchers, plates, jars, lids, vases, and bottles, and will finish these shapes as required by trimming
and adding handles, lugs, lids, spouts, and knobs. We will also work on several different handbuild-
ing projects. After the tenth class session, all class work will be biscuit-fired. The eleventh class will
be devoted to glazing the biscuited pieces. Glazing techniques will include pouring, dipping, layer-
ing, brushing, and stamping, and using wax resist and other masking techniques to develop pattern
and design. The completed work will then be glaze-fired. The last meeting will be devoted to a "fi-
nal exam" gallery show of your best work. Woven into lecture-demonstrations will be presentations
on various topics relating to the science and history of pottery making.
The two most important requirements for this course are attendance at all class sessions and enthu-
siasm for learning the craft of pottery making.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limited to 9.
Meeting time: mornings.
Cost to student: $145 plus makeup class fees ($30 per class) if applicable.

SPEC 039 Composing A Life: Finding Success and Balance in Life After Williams
To be at Williams you have learned to be a successful student, but how do you learn to be successful
in life? How will you define success in both your career and in your personal life? How will you
resolve the inevitable tradeoffs and achieve balance between the two? In short, what will constitute
the "good life" for you? We will borrow the concept of "composing a life", from a book by Mary
Catherine Bateson, as a very apt metaphor for the ongoing process of defining success and balance
in life. This course is designed: (1) To offer college students, on the threshold of entering adulthood,
and opportunity to examine and define their beliefs, values, and assumptions about their future per-
sonal and professional lives, and to consider how they might achieve a successful balance; (2) To
encourage students to gain a better understanding of how culture, ideology, and opportunity affect
their life choices; (3) To provide an opportunity for students to consider different models of success
and balance through an emphasis on case studies and "living cases" (in the form of guests from
various professions who have made different life choices); and (4) To aid students in contemplating
their career options through individual advising and introducing various career and life planning
resources. Through the use of selected readings, cases, guest speakers and field interviews, we will
explore both the public context of the workplace as well as the private context of individuals and
their personal relationships in determining life choices.
Evaluation will be based on regular attendance, class participation, field interview, and a 10-page
paper.

The Winter Study Period covers 23 calendar days.

NOTE:    A recent enactment of the Massachusetts General Court provides: "Any student...who is unable, because of his religious beliefs, to
         attend classes or to participate in any examination, study, or work requirement on a particular day shall be excused from any
         such...requirement, and shall be provided an opportunity to make up such...requirement which he may have missed because of
         such absence...provided, however, that such makeup examination or work shall not create an unreasonable burden upon such
         school...No adverse or prejudicial effects shall result to any student because of his availing himself of the provisions of this sec-
         tion."

                                                                           Approved by the Faculty, May 16, 1984
