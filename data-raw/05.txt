HISTORY OF THE COLLEGE
The chartering of Williams College in 1793 was an act of faith and certainly an act surpassing the
modest intentions of Colonel Ephraim Williams, for whom the college is named.
Colonel Williams had not intended to found a college. Enroute with his regiment of Massachu-
setts militia to join the battle with the French and Indians at Lake George, the Colonel had tarried
long enough in Albany to write his last will and testament on July 22, 1755. In it he bequeathed his
residuary estate for the founding and support of a free school in West Township, where for some
years he had commanded a detachment of militia at Fort Massachusetts, farthest outpost of the
province. The will stipulated that West Township, then in dispute between Massachusetts and New
York, must fall within Massachusetts and that the name of the township must be changed to Wil-
liamstown, if the free school was to be established at all.
On September 8, 1755, Colonel Williams was killed at the Battle of Lake George. On October 26,
1791, after many delays, fifteen scholars were admitted to the free school in Williamstown. Within a
year the trustees, not content with the original modest design of the founder, were captivated by the
idea of creating a college where, as they put it, "young gentlemen from every part of the Union" might
resort for instruction " in all the branches of useful and polite literature." The proposal was extremely
ambitious, to be sure, but ambition was a common American ailment. England did not develop a third
university until the nineteenth century; Williams was the twenty-first institution of higher learning to
flower in onetime British colonies, the second in Massachusetts, the sixth in New England. On June
22, 1793, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts granted a charter to Williams College.
I
The bold decision to plant a college in the wilderness betrayed the intentions of Colonel Wil-
liams; yet the new vision had been fed by the same sort of dreams that had led Ephraim Williams to
see a school and a comfortable community where only a military outpost had stood. The early trust-
ees and the legislature of the Commonwealth were to be remembered for their foresight, but in the
decades after 1793 they had reason to acknowledge that the soil they had chosen was stubbornly
uncongenial--so uncongenial, in fact, that for many years the trustees of Williams spent more time
and energy in trying to close the College than in trying to keep it open.
In 1819 they petitioned to move the college to Northhampton, and in 1821, having been spurned by
the legislature, President Zephaniah Swift Moore took matters into his own hands. Convinced that
almost everything about Williams was impossible--its location, its funds, its enrollment--he led a
group of students over the mountains into the Connecticut Valley. There he became their president
once again, at the struggling new college known as Amherst. As for Williams, one member of the
senior class wrote home to his father: "It remains for us to say whether it shall die suddenly, or whether
it shall linger along for two or three years."
In the past the public had come to the support of the institution. A lottery furnished funds essen-
tial to the opening of the free school. A public subscription was the answer of Berkshire County to
the threat of removal in 1819. What saved the College in 1821 was the willingness of the Reverend
Edward Dorr Griffin to take the job of president and the determination with which he drew upon the
College's reputation for religious conservatism to collect much-needed funds. By 1828, the Rever-
end Griffin could be seen standing in the middle of Main Street, supervising the construction of a
handsome new building, housing a chapel, a library, and classrooms, a testament to his confidence
and his skill. The building is now known as Griffin Hall.
The College which had been taking shape under Griffin and his predecessors was not unlike
many other New England colleges where the classical curriculum and a moral atmosphere served as
the basis for training young men for professional life. The college turned out its share of clergymen,
doctors, lawyers, and teachers, serving the needs of Western Massachusetts and surrounding com-
munities in New York and Vermont. But Williams was not yet a place to which "young gentlemen
from every part of the Union" resorted. In fact, Nathaniel Hawthorne, attending the commencement
exercises in 1838, jotted in his notebook some observations on the Williams students he saw there:
"Country graduates--rough, brown-featured, schoolmaster-looking...A rough hewn, heavy set of
fellows from the hills and woods in this neighborhood; unpolished bumpkins, who had grown up as
farmer-boys."
History of the College
­ 4 ­
Williams seldom knew financial security until the end of the nineteenth century. But it did have
assets that enabled it to develop into a prototype of the small New England liberal arts college. Scen-
ery, a reputation for moral soundness, a loyal body of alumni, and a devoted faculty went a long way
toward compensating for inadequate funds.
Of the scenery, Thoreau remarked, after a visit in 1844, "It would be no small advantage if every
college were thus located at the base of a mountain." For Thoreau the location of Williams was "as
good at least as one well-endowed professorship."
In the early years the religious reputation of the College depended on the essential orthodoxy of
its presidents and faculty. It gathered strength from the famous episode of the "haystack meeting" in
the summer of 1806. Five Williams undergraduates, seeking to continue their prayers and conversa-
tions in spite of a sudden thunderstorm, retired from a grove of trees to the shelter of a nearby hay-
stack, where they were inspired to launch the great adventure of American foreign missions. The
extremely informal ties with the Congregationalists saved it from the sometimes stifling strangle-
hold of an organic denominational connection.
During a crisis in the affairs of the College in 1821, a group of alumni met in Williamstown and
organized the Society of Alumni, dedicated to the future welfare of the College. Their action gave
Williams the distinction of organizing the first college alumni society in history. Alumni loyalty was
rewarded when, in 1868, the College provided for official alumni representation on the board of trust-
ees, an act of recognition in which only Harvard, among American colleges, anticipated Williams.
II
But essentially the College has built its reputation around teachers and teaching. Mark Hopkins,
who was a Williams professor from 1830 to 1887 and president of the College from 1836 to 1872, has
become a symbol of this emphasis. In American education Hopkins pioneered in making the student
the center of the educational experience, and he did it so well that one of his former students, U.S.
President James A. Garfield, immortalized his achievement in an aphorism which has passed into the
lore of American education: "The ideal college is Mark Hopkins on one end of a log and a student on
the other." The Hopkins tradition has become one of the College's great assets. It has been perpetuated
in the lives of generations of teachers.
Scenery, a reputation for building sound character, loyal but not especially affluent alumni, and
devoted teachers could keep the College open, but like most other colleges Williams did not experi-
ence growth and prosperity until the closing decades of the nineteenth century. The scenery, of
course, remained constant, but it developed into an even greater asset as the United States became
more urbanized and industrialized. Williams was still a country college; a Massachusetts court de-
cision of 1888 declared that cows owned by the college were tax exempt. The discovery that busi-
nessmen could profit from liberal education sent college enrollments upward as the century drew to
a close; now more Williams alumni were men of affairs, fewer were clergymen. By 1906, of all the
colleges in New England, Williams drew the largest percentage of students from outside New Eng-
land.
From 1793 through 1870 the Commonwealth of Massachusetts appropriated for Williams College
over $150,000, a sum of such importance that Mark Hopkins himself observed that he did "not see
how the College could have got on" without state aid. A new and more dependable source of financial
support was developed as the century drew to a close. In the 1890's Frederick Ferris Thompson of the
Class of 1856 became the first of many individuals to supersede the Commonwealth as the largest
benefactor of the College. Ephraim Williams' original bequest of $9,297 has since grown by addition-
al gifts and bequests to an endowment valued at approximately $1.3 billion.
III
Williams moved into the twentieth century firm in its intentions to remain a college, at a time when
aspirations toward university status were unsettling many of the old colleges. It adhered to a curricu-
lum that was designed for undergraduates; it made room for the elective principle, but it subjected
course election to safeguards and controls. The idea of a liberally educated man was not jettisoned in
favor of the widely accepted idea of almost complete student freedom in course election. A survey of
the college curriculum in 1925 showed that Williams had combined the principles of prescription and
election, the goals of concentration and distribution, in such a way as to be the only major American
History of the College
­ 5 ­
college without any absolutely required courses and without any uncontrolled wide-option electives.
The Williams curriculum has continued to evolve, but it has not undergone such a series of major
overhauls as characterize curriculums inspired by the popular educational fancy of the moment. Not
having abandoned itself to the elective principle in the nineteenth century, Williams did not need to
rescue itself with the general education principle of the twentieth century.
During its long history much of the life and tone of the college was shaped by students. While the
same influence continues, the competitive pressure for admission since World War II has allowed
for a new and significant degree of selectivity on the part of the College. Among the consequences
of this change have been a quickening of the intellectual life of the College and a reconsideration of
traditions and emphases no longer considered appropriate for an institution of liberal learning.
Among the first traditions to go was compulsory religious exercises, abandoned in 1962 after a
hundred years of gradual but steady erosion. Voluntary worship in the form of ecumenical chapel
services and the activities of student religious organizations carry on another long tradition. In re-
sponse to the concern of undergraduate leaders and the faculty and in recognition of the failure of
Greek Letter Fraternities to fulfill adequately objectives consistent with college purpose, the Trust-
ees in 1962 took the first of a series of actions that replaced fraternities with a residential house sys-
tem. Williams became, as a result, a much more open community. The decision to become coeduca-
tional and the admission of women to Williams as degree candidates in 1970 have reinforced the
spirit of equality and freedom conducive to a climate of learning.
In this atmosphere of change and heightened purpose the curriculum underwent appropriate
transformations, as a careful comparative study of the yearly catalogues readily shows, leading to
the present 4-1-4 curriculum and a more flexible and wide-ranging schedule and program both on
and beyond the campus. Changes in the curriculum included the addition of majors and the
introduction of interdisciplinary programs, along with the expansion of language offerings to in-
clude full, four-year cycles in Chinese and Japanese. Continuing the tradition of putting the student
at the center of the educational experience, Williams in the Fall of 1988 introduced in each depart-
ment at least one course taught as a tutorial, in which, typically, pairs of students meet weekly with
the professor to discuss a paper, problem set, or work of art produced by one of the students. By
1992 some 40 percent of the graduating class had experienced at least one tutorial course either in
Williamstown or in the Williams-Oxford program, run in association with Exeter College, Oxford,
which provides each year for some 30 Williams juniors a year-long immersion in the life of Oxford
University.
This curricular expansion reflected, and in part resulted from, the fact that the makeup of the col-
lege community was changing to mirror more closely the growing racial, ethnic, and religious di-
versity of American society. The percentage of Williams students who identified themselves as
members of one or more American minority group rose to 25 percent; of faculty almost 13 percent.
At the beginning of this decade, President Morton Owen Schapiro inaugurated a strategic plan-
ning process, through which the College community identified priorities for change in the curricu-
lum and in residential life. The size of the faculty is being expanded to provide more curricular op-
portunities for students in tutorials and experiential learning. Requirements have been added in in-
tensive writing instruction and in quantitative and formal reasoning. New programming and struc-
tures are being added to student residential life and major projects are underway to greatly enhance
the College's student center, its facilities for theatre and dance, and its office and teaching spaces for
faculty.

MISSION AND OBJECTIVES
We are to regard the mind, not as a piece of iron to be laid upon the anvil and hammered into any
shape, nor as a block of marble in which we are to find the statue by removing the rubbish, or as a
receptacle into which knowledge may be poured; but as a flame that is to be fed, as an active being that
must be strengthened to think and to feel--and to dare, to do, and to suffer.
President Mark Hopkins '24
Induction Address (1836)
Our colleges will not be rich enough until they are able to bring the education they offer within the
reach of the poorest young man in the land.
President P.A. Chadbourne '48
Induction Address (1872)
Dedicated to the welfare of the great common life of the State, [the College] may not much longer
close its doors to one half of the community because of their sex, neither may it narrow its labors or its
sympathies to any class, to any favored few.
James D. Canfield '68
Centennial Oration (1893)
[Young people] now entering college, if given their biblical life span--and who knows what more or
less than three score and ten?--will be carrying responsibilities well into the 21st century...No one can
pretend to more than a guess at what they will then be called upon to comprehend. This much we do know:
that no training in fixed techniques, no finite knowledge now at hand, no rigid formula they might be given
can solve problems whose shape we cannot yet define. Nor have they time to waste in pursuit of transitory
expedients, the ephemeral, the shallow or the merely popular.
The most versatile, the most durable, in an ultimate sense the most practical knowledge and intel-
lectual resources which they can now be offered are those impractical arts and sciences around which
the liberal arts education has long centered: the capacity to see and feel, to grasp, respond and act over
a widening arc of experience; the disposition and ability to think, to question, to use knowledge to
order an ever-extending range of reality; the elasticity to grow, to perceive more widely and more
deeply, and perhaps to create; the understanding to decide where to stand and the will and tenacity to
do so; the wit and wisdom, the humanity and the humor to try to see oneself, one's society, and one's
world with open eyes, to live a life usefully, to help things in which one believes on their way. This is
not the whole of a liberal arts education, but as I understand it, this range of goals is close to its core.
President John E. Sawyer '39
Induction Address (1961)
The longer history of education in our own culture has been such as to suggest the openness, resil-
ience, flexibility and power of that age-old tradition of education in the liberal arts that at its best is
consciously geared to no less inclusive an activity than that of living itself...[And] no education which
truly aspires to be a preparation for living can afford to ignore the fundamental continuities that exist
between the cultivation of specific areas of specialized knowledge, expertise or skill (without which
we could scarcely endure) and that more fundamental and wide-ranging attempt to penetrate by our
reason the very structures of the natural world, to evoke the dimensions and significance of the beauti-
ful, to reach towards an understanding of what it is to be human, of one's position in the universe, and
of one's relations with one's fellows, moral no less than material. Towards that attempt we seem im-
pelled by the very fiber of our being. In its total absence, while doubtless we survive, we do so as
something surely less than human.
The history, moreover, of that most American of educational institutions, the independent, free-
standing liberal-arts college, witnesses forcefully to the power of that central educational institution
when wedded to the other long-standing conviction that education is not a process that can wholly be
confined to classroom, laboratory, studio or library, but one to which the diverse experience and richly
variegated moments of life in a residential community must all combine to make their particular con-
tribution. Extracurriculum as well as curriculum; play as well as work; fellowship as well as solitude;
the foreign as well as the familiar; discomfort as well as ease; protest as well as celebration; prescrip-
tion as well as choice; failure as well as success.
President Francis Oakley
Induction Address (1985)
At Williams, with a spectacularly talented and devoted faculty and staff, great physical and finan-
cial wealth, and the absolute finest students in all of American higher education, we are obligated to
Mission and Objectives
­ 7 ­
realize a vision of educational excellence worthy of our extraordinary resources. That vision undoubt-
edly involves the optimal use of new technologies to enhance the special relationship between a stu-
dent and a faculty member; the breaking down of departmental boundaries, fostering cutting edge
interdisciplinary teaching and research; a way to link more effectively the education that takes place
within the classroom with the education that takes place in the dorm rooms and dining halls and on the
playing fields; a program that allows our students to venture out into the world in ways that reinforce
their classroom experiences; and a commitment to redouble our efforts to educate our students in an
environment that reflects the great strength of our diverse society and to keep the precious prize of a
Williams education open to the most talented students in the nation regardless of family background.
We have never wavered in understanding that our mission is to provide the highest quality under-
graduate education possible, centered on an appreciation and indeed a love of the liberal arts. We can
build on that legacy. This is a time for Williams to set a new standard of excellence in undergraduate
education for an entire industry crying out for guidance. Let history one day note that our community
had the courage to seize the moment.

THE CURRICULUM
Williams College offers a course of study leading to the degree of Bachelor of Arts. The course
requirements prescribe both the number of courses to be completed and the minimum grade level to
be achieved; the curriculum also requires that each student explore several fields of knowledge and
concentrate in one. The full requirements for the degree include meeting the minimum academic stan-
dards stated below, residing at the College, fulfilling the distribution requirement, completing a major,
and completing the physical education requirement.
The academic year is divided into two regular semesters and a Winter Study Program. The student takes
four courses in each semester and during January pursues a single program of study on a pass-fail basis.
The Winter Study Program, which began in 1967, is intended to provide students and faculty with a
dramatically different educational experience in the January term. The differences are in the nature of
the courses, the nature of the learning experience, and the change of educational pace and format from
the fall and spring semesters. These differences apply to the faculty and students in several ways: fac-
ulty can try out courses with new subjects and techniques that might, if successful, be used later in the
regular terms; they can explore subjects not amenable to inclusion in regular courses; and they can
investigate fields outside their usual areas of expertise. In their academic work, which is graded Hon-
ors, Pass, Perfunctory Pass, or Fail, students can explore new fields at low risk, concentrate on one
subject that requires a great deal of time, develop individual research projects, or work in a different
milieu (as interns, for example, or on trips outside Williamstown). In addition, Winter Study offers
studentsanopportunityformoreindependenceandinitiativeinalessformalsetting, more opportunity
to participate in cultural events, and an occasion to get to know one another better.
REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR OF ARTS DEGREE
Academic Requirement
To be eligible for the Bachelor of Arts degree a student must pass 32 regularly graded semester
courses and receive grades of C minus or higher in at least 19 of those semester courses, pass four
Winter Study Projects, fulfill the distribution requirement, complete all requirements for the major
including an average of C minus or higher, and complete the physical education requirement. Be-
ginning with the Class of 2006, students must also fulfill the quantitative/formal reasoning and
writing requirements.
Distribution Requirement
The distribution requirement falls into four parts. (Parts 3 and 4 DO NOT apply to the Class of
2005.)
1) DIVISIONAL REQUIREMENT--designed to ensure that in their course of study at Williams,
students take an appropriately diverse distribution of courses across the full range of the curricu-
lum.
For the purposes of the requirement, courses are grouped into three divisions: Division I, Lan-
guages and the Arts; Division II, Social Studies; and Division III, Science and Mathematics. A
full listing of the subjects in each division appears below.
Students must complete at least three graded semester courses in each division. Two in each divi-
sion must be completed by the end of the sophomore year. No more than two of the courses used
to satisfy the requirement may have the same course prefix.
Courses that fulfill the distribution requirement in Division I are designed to help students be-
come better able to respond to the arts sensitively and intelligently by learning the language,
whether verbal, visual, or musical, of a significant field of artistic expression. Students learn
how to develop the capacity for critical discussion, to increase awareness of the esthetic and
moral issues raised by works of art, and to grow in self-awareness and creativity.
Courses which fulfill the Division II requirement consider the institutions and social structures
that human beings have created, whether knowingly or unknowingly, and which in turn marked-
ly affect their lives. These courses are intended to help the students recognize, analyze, and eval-
uate these human structures in order that they may better understand themselves and the social
world in which they live.
The Curriculum
­ 9 ­
Courses which fulfill the Division III requirement are intended to provide some of the factual
and methodological knowledge needed to be an informed citizen in a world deeply influenced by
scientific thought and technological accomplishment, and to cultivate skill in exact and quantita-
tive reasoning.
Courses with the following designations receive divisional distribution credit as indicated:

2) PEOPLES AND CULTURES REQUIREMENT--intended to help students to begin to understand
the cultural diversity of American society and the world at large, so that, as citizens of an increasingly
interconnected world, they may become better able to respond sensitively and intelligently to peoples of
varied social backgrounds and cultural frameworks. Courses which fulfill this requirement are thus de-
signed to familiarize students with some dimension of American cultural diversity or that of the non-
Western world. Each student must complete one graded semester course primarily concerned with : (a)
the peoples and cultures of North America that trace their origins to Africa, Asia, Latin America, Ocea-
nia, or the Caribbean; Native American peoples and cultures; or (b) the peoples and cultures of Africa,
Asia, Latin America, Oceania, or the Caribbean. Students are urged to complete this course, which may
also be used to fulfill any of the other requirements, by the end of the sophomore year.
An asterisk following a course title indicates that the course may be used to meet the Peoples and
Cultures Distribution Requirement. A list of courses offered in 2004-2005 which meet the require-
ment is on page 317.
3) QUANTITATIVE/FORMAL REASONING REQUIREMENT--intended to help students be-
come adept at reasoning mathematically and abstractly. The ability to apply a formal method to
reach conclusions, to use numbers comfortably, and to employ the research tools necessary to
analyze data lessen barriers to carrying out professional and economic roles. Beginning with the
Class of 2006, prior to their senior year, all students must satisfactorily complete a Quantitative/
Formal Reasoning (QFR) course--those marked with a "(Q)." Students requiring extra assis-
tance (as assessed during First Days) are normally placed into Mathematics 100/101/102, which
is to be taken before fulfilling the QFR requirement.
The hallmarks of a QFR course are the representation of facts in a language of mathematical sym-
bols and the use of formal rules to obtain a determinate answer. Primary evaluation in these courses
is based on multistep mathematical, statistical, or logical inference (as opposed to descriptive an-
swers). A list of courses offered in 2004-2005 which meet the requirement is on page 321.
4) WRITING REQUIREMENT--Beginning with the Class of 2006, all students are required to
take two writing-intensive courses: one by the end of the sophomore year and one by the end of
the junior year. Students will benefit most from writing-intensive courses by taking them early in
their college careers and are therefore strongly encouraged to complete the requirement by the
end of the sophomore year. Courses designated as "writing intensive"--those marked with a
"(W)"--stress the process of learning to write effectively. Such courses include a substantial
amount of writing (a minimum of 20 pages), usually divided into several discrete assignments.
Instructors pay close attention to matters of style and argumentation. Enrollments are limited to
19. A list of courses offered in 2004-2005 which meet the requirement is on page 324.
Major Requirement
The Major Requirement is designed to assure that all Williams undergraduates will have the ex-
perience of disciplined and cumulative study, carried on over an extended period of time, in some
important field of intellectual inquiry. Juniors are required to declare a major and the selection is
normally made at the time of registration in the spring of the sophomore year.
MAJOR FIELDS
Majors are offered in the following fields:
American Studies History
Anthropology Japanese
Art Literary Studies
Asian Studies Mathematics
Astronomy Music

The Curriculum
­ 11 ­
GENERAL STRUCTURE OF MAJORS
1) A student ordinarily must elect at least nine semester courses in his or her major field. A particu-
lar major may also require an additional course and/or one Winter Study Project during the junior or
senior year.
A student may also fulfill the minimum requirements for a major by taking eight semester courses
in the major field and two semester courses, approved by a major advisor, in associated fields. In inter-
departmental majors, such as Political Economy, a larger number of courses may be required.
2) A prescribed sequence of courses, supplemented by parallel courses, and including a major
seminar, is required in some major fields. Other majors ask the student to plan a sequence of elective
courses, including advanced work building on elementary courses in the field, and ending in a one- or
two- semester faculty-organized course or project in the senior year. All majors provide a system of
counseling to help students plan programs reflecting individual interests as well as disciplined and
cumulative patterns of inquiry.
Courses in many major programs require prerequisite courses in related areas. A full description
of the detailed structure of each major is found under the heading of that major.
CONTRACT MAJOR
Students who wish to undertake the coherent study of an interdisciplinary subject not covered by
a regularly offered major may propose to be contract majors. Procedures for arranging a contract
major and for honors work in such a major are described in the section, "Courses of Instruction."
Students interested in this option should begin consulting with the Dean's Office and with potential
faculty advisors early in the sophomore year. A student completing a contract major may not do so
in conjunction with a second major. For further details, see page 130.
TWO MAJORS
A student may complete two majors with the permission of both majors and the Committee on
Academic Standing. Although a student may be granted permission to use a course from one major
to fulfill a particular requirement in the other, the student nevertheless must take the minimum num-
ber of courses in each field without counting any course twice. A student may be a candidate for
Honors in either or both of the majors, but a course for Honors in one major may not be used for an
Honors course in the other.
Physical Education Requirement
The Physical Education requirement provides students the opportunity of establishing and main-
taining a general level of fitness and well-being; of developing abilities in carry-over activities; of
discovering and extending their own physical capabilities; and of developing skills in activities with
survival implications, such as swimming, life saving, and water safety.
A swim test is required of all first-year students at the start of the academic year. Students who fail
to complete the test must pass a basic swim course given in the Physical Education program during the
first quarter of the year.
Students must complete four quarters of physical education by the end of the sophomore year un-
less excused by the Dean of the College and the Director of Health. Students must enroll in at least two
different activities in fulfilling the requirement.
Participation in a fall or spring intercollegiate sport is equivalent to two activity units and partici-
pation in a winter sport is equivalent to three units. A maximum of three credits may be attained
while participating in intercollegiate sports with the exception of a two sport athlete who can fulfill
the physical education requirement by totaling four units in two sports. Students may receive a
maximum of two activity units for participation in a club sport; the remaining two units must come
from the physical education activity program.
Residence Requirement
Students who begin college at Williams must spend a minimum of six semesters in residence at
Williams. Students transferring to Williams from other institutions must spend a minimum of four
semesters in residence at Williams, and those entering as sophomores are expected to spend six se-
mesters in residence. Students are considered to be in residence if they are taking a program of study
under the direction of the Williams College Faculty. Students must be in residence for both semesters
of the final year.
The Curriculum
­ 12 ­
The degree requirements must be completed within eight semesters, including any semesters for
which a student receives credit while not in residence at Williams. Thus, semesters spent away on
exchange or other approved programs at other colleges are included in the eight semesters. Similar-
ly, if a student from the Class of 2007 or earlier requests, and the Committee on Academic Standing
grants, degree credit based on Advanced Placement scores, then these semesters are also included
in the limit of eight.
ADDITIONAL CURRICULAR OPPORTUNITIES
Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate
At the discretion of the appropriate departments or programs, students presenting satisfactory
scores in Advanced Placement tests or International Baccalaureate higher level examinations may be
placed in advanced courses not regularly open to them and/or may receive course credit toward the
major or concentration. Therefore, if granted, this credit may be used as a prerequisite or in partial
fulfillment of the major or concentration requirements. AP and IB credit, however, may not be used to
reduce the normal course load of any semester, to make up a deficiency incurred at Williams, or to
satisfy the Distribution Requirement.
For members of the Class of 2007 or earlier, AP or IB credit (if in two or more subjects) may also
be used for acceleration, i.e. completion of the degree in fewer than four years. Starting with the
Class of 2008, this option will not be available.
Certificate in European Languages
Students may pursue a Certificate in four European languages offered at Williams (French, Ger-
man, Russian, and Spanish). The program certifies a particular degree of proficiency, cultural liter-
acy, and experience with the language in the context of one's college education. In order to gain the
proficiency and experience certified by the program, students must have taken a) at least five se-
mesters of college language (or the equivalent) and b) a standardized proficiency test administered
by the departments. In addition, students are required to gain familiarity with the culture in question
by taking at least one course each in a) the literature, music, art, or philosophy, and b) the history,
economics, or politics of the cultural area. Students must take seven courses altogether, up to two of
which may be taken abroad. Please refer to the respective language programs for details on the spe-
cific certificates.
Combined Program in Liberal Arts and Engineering
The 3-2 program enables qualified students to combine a liberal arts education at Williams with
undergraduate professional training in engineering. In this program, a student studies at Williams for
3 years, completing 24 courses and 3 Winter Study Projects. He or she then transfers to a leading engi-
neering school and studies for a Bachelor of Science degree, usually for 2 more years. Upon success-
ful completion of this program, the student receives a Bachelor of Arts degree from Williams and a
Bachelor of Science degree from the engineering school. For students majoring in physics, chemistry,
computer science, or mathematics at Williams, the requirements for the senior year courses and major
exercise are waived for the Williams degree. Only students who have taken the prerequisite courses,
who have at least a B average in scientific subjects, and who have a good record in other subjects will
be recommended by their major department and approved by the Committee on Academic Standing
for this program.
Williams has a formal agreement that simplifies the application process to the 3-2 engineering pro-
gram at Columbia University. Other engineering schools offer 3-2 programs which might be ap-
proved on a case-by-case basis. All engineering schools expect that 3-2 students will have completed
several science and mathematics courses at Williams, so it is necessary to plan course selections care-
fully. The booklet "Choosing First Year Courses" includes a list of Williams courses recommended to
prospective engineers.
The 3-2 program offers an established route to entry-level employment as an engineer. In recent
years, however, most Williams students have chosen to complete the Williams B.A. in the usual 4
years and then go to graduate programs in engineering. Please see the section of this catalog titled
"Preparation for Graduate and Professional Study." Also, prospective engineers at Williams have the
opportunity to take undergraduate engineering courses at other institutions through various exchange
The Curriculum
­ 13 ­
programs. For information about these opportunities, please see the section titled "Exchange Pro-
grams."
The pre-engineering advisor, Professor Jefferson Strait, will be happy to assist students interested
in any of the options leading to engineering careers. Many more details about pre-engineering can
be found on the Physics department page of the College website.
Co-ordinate Programs Offering Concentrations
In addition to majoring in a field, a student may choose to concentrate elective courses on a single
topic or area. Normally, a student declares a concentration at the time of registration in the spring of
the sophomore year. Concentrations are offered in the following programs:
African-American Studies
Biochemistry and Molecular Biology
Cognitive Science
Environmental Studies
International Studies
Jewish Studies
Latina/o Studies
Leadership Studies
Legal Studies
Maritime Studies
Neuroscience
Science and Technology Studies
Descriptions of these programs appear under the appropriate heading in this publication. If the
co-ordinate program courses are directly related to the major, a student may be allowed to reduce
the number of courses required to complete the major.
Co-ordinate Programs
A number of programs do not formally offer concentrations, but do provide students with the op-
portunity to work in areas that cut across departmental and program lines. These are: Bioinformatics,
Genomics, and Proteomics; Materials Science Studies; and Performance Studies. They are listed in
this publication in alphabetical order.
These programs provide guidance only and do not appear on transcripts.
The Critical Reasoning and Analytical Skills (CRAAS) Initiative
To one degree or another, every class at Williams goes beyond its subject--be it mathematics, Ma-
chiavelli, or modernism--to teach intellectual skills that have wide application in other fields as well
as outside of the academy: scientific reckoning, expository writing, rhetorical analysis, oral presenta-
tion, and so on.
Courses offered under the CRAAS initiative foreground such analytical skills. While each CRAAS
class covers a different topic, all are aimed particularly at developing the processes necessary for ex-
cellence in a range of fields: techniques for analyzing ideas, data, texts or artworks; approaches to
interpreting, synthesizing, and developing arguments; strategies for presenting ideas and results.
CRAAS classes typically emphasize the practices of meta-analysis--self-criticism, editing, and re-
vision--with the goal of constant improvement. Many classes feature peer tutoring, small group
work, and intensive one-on-one engagement with the professor. Students should leave a CRAAS
course with a substantially heightened ability to approach problems, analyze texts, and craft argu-
ments in whatever discipline they may go on to explore.
A few CRAAS courses are restricted to advanced students, but the majority are open to all, and
some are specifically targeted for first -year students. Most have strictly limited enrollment. Because
these classes cultivate the general strategies of effective scholarship, students are encouraged to con-
sider taking a CRAAS course early in their academic careers.
A list of CRAAS courses offered in 2004-2005 is on page 316.
Cross-Enrollment Programs
A limited number of students may register at Bennington College or Massachusetts College of
Liberal Arts for courses not offered by Williams. Interested students should contact the Registrar's
Office about arrangements.

Exchange Programs
The Twelve College Exchange Program includes Amherst, Bowdoin, Connecticut College, Dart-
mouth, Mount Holyoke, Smith, Trinity, Vassar, Wellesley, Wesleyan, Wheaton, and, for a semester
program, the National Theatre Institute, in Waterford, Connecticut. In addition, the College maintains
an exchange with California Institute of Technology, Howard University, Fisk University, the Thayer
School of Engineering at Dartmouth, and with Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.
Information on the programs and copies of the participating schools' catalogs are available at the
Dean's Office. Application deadline is in February of the preceding academic year.
Experiential Education at Williams
Experiential education involving "learning by doing" outside the classroom has been a relatively
understated but successful part of the Williams curriculum for a number of years. In addition to the use
of traditional laboratory work in the natural sciences and studio work in art, more faculty have been
challenging students to become more personally engaged in the Williams curriculum through field
work whether in the form of research, sustained work on special projects or through placement with
community organizations. Courses with an experiential learning component provide students with
opportunities to encounter firsthand the issues that they read and study about, requiring them to apply
academic learning to nonacademic settings and challenging them to use their experiences in those
settings to think more critically and deeply about what they are studying.
Courses involving experiential learning as defined above, range from fully integrated off-campus
programs such as the Williams-Mystic Maritime Studies Program (page 336) to courses involving
one small field research project. The amount and nature of the experiential component(s) will vary
according to the instructor's judgement. See page 316 for a list of 2004-2005 courses involving expe-
riential education.
A range of non-credit experiential education opportunities is also available to interested stu-
dents. Community service, internships, research, and the Museum Associates Program of the Wil-
liams College Museum of Art all provide students the chance to "learn by doing" outside the class-
room. Information on each of these non-credit forms of experiential learning is provided below.
Community Service:
Opportunities to put creative energy and initiative to use abound in community organizations in
the Williams College area. Service ranges from well-known work such as tutoring or building
homes with Habitat for Humanity, to working with newer, developing non-profit organizations
such as Chrysalis, an advanced stage AIDS residence. For more information, go to the Lehman
Community Service Council homepage on the College website at <http://wso.williams.edu:
8000/orgs/lehman/> or contact College Chaplain and Coordinator of Community Service, Rick
Spalding (Richard.E.Spalding@williams.edu).
Internships and Research Opportunities:
A wide variety of summer internship opportunities is available to interested students through the
Office of Career Counseling (OCC) and the Center for Environmental Studies (CES). Research work
opportunities are also available through individual departments.
Information regarding OCC's Williams College Alumni Sponsored Summer Internships can be
found at http://www.williams.edu/admin-depts/occ/ or by contacting Ron Gallagher, Program
Counselor at the Office of Career Counseling, Stetson Hall (Ronald.L.Gallagher@williams.edu).
Information regarding CES's summer internship and research opportunities can be found at
www.williams.edu/CES/resources/summeropps.htm or by contacting Sarah Gardner, Assistant
Director of the Center for Environmental Studies, Kellogg House (Sarah.S.Gardner@williams.e-
du). Information about research opportunities sponsored by individual departments is available
from Department Chairs.
Museum Associates:
The Museum Associates Program of the Williams College Museum of Art provides students an
opportunity to broaden their knowledge of art and art history, to learn about the field of museum
education, and to develop valuable communication and public speaking skills while working with
the public. The only academic requirement is the completion of ArtH 101-102. Applications are

accepted every spring. For more information, contact Barbara Robertson, Director of Education at
x2038 or by e-mail at broberts@williams.edu.
For more information about experiential education in general, contact Paula Consolini, Coordi-
nator of Experiential Education (pconsoli@williams.edu).
Honors Program
Williams awards the degree with Honors to those students who have demonstrated imagination,
initiative, and intellectual independence within the major. The Honors program requires two or three
courses constituting a clearly interrelated pattern of study, whether in the form of a thesis, specializa-
tion within the major, or interdisciplinary study with courses from other programs or departments. At
least one of the courses must be in addition to the minimum number required for the major; one may
be a Winter Study Project. A student who is completing two majors may be a candidate for Honors in
either or both of the majors, but a course for Honors in one major may not be used as an Honors course
in the other. Some programs also award honors for their concentrations.
Individual departments and programs describe special criteria, procedures, and patterns of study
for Honors in the "Courses of Instruction" section. Students should consult with their departments
on their Honors options prior to the senior year. Before the student has begun the last of the required
course units, the department or program determines whether the student is admitted to Honors can-
didacy. The degree is awarded with Honors or Highest Honors at the end of the senior year if, in the
judgment of the department, its criteria of excellence have been met.
Independent Study
When a particularly able student wishes to study a subject not covered by the normal offerings of
the College, arrangements may be made to undertake courses of independent study under faculty
supervision. Such arrangements are made with the appropriate department at the time of registra-
tion.
Study Away from Williams
Students may receive credit for work completed at other institutions or programs. Applications for
study elsewhere require the approval of the chair of thestudent'smajor,theDean's Office,and theCom-
mitteeonAcademic Standing.Studentsstudying away during the junior year should have already com-
pleted at least two courses in each division toward the divisional distribution requirement, the writing
and quantitative/formal reasoning requirements if applicable, and the physical education requirement.
Courses completed while away may be used toward the major with permission of the department or
program and/or to fulfill the peoples and cultures requirement with permission of CAS. All other degree
requirements must be met with courses taken under the supervision of Williams faculty.
Williams participates in study abroad programs in Spain and France (in cooperation with Hamil-
ton College); in China (as part of the Associated Colleges in China); in Sweden (in cooperation with
twelve other colleges and the University of Stockholm); in Denmark (with the University of Copen-
hagen Danish International Studies); and in Kyoto (the Associated Kyoto Program,runby agroup
ofelevencolleges). Williams students may also receive credit for approved programs at a wide vari-
ety of other institutions, or for work done directly in a foreign university or accredited four-year
American university if acceptable evaluation is possible. Students interested in study away should
consult the Dean's Office. Students must submit a pink petition and essay to the Dean's Office by
March of the preceding academic year for which they wish to study off campus. Students must be in
good academic standing with no deficiencies and follow the procedures as set out in the Guide to
Study Abroad.
The Williams Tutorial Program
The Tutorial Program offers Williams students a distinctive opportunity to take a heightened form
of responsibility for their own intellectual development. No student is required to take a tutorial
course, but any student with the appropriate qualifications and interests is invited to do so.
Tutorials at the 100/200 level are designed primarily for sophomores; sophomores are usually giv-
en enrollment preference for such courses, though interested juniors and seniors (and, in some cases,
first-year students) are often welcome. Tutorials at the 300/400 level are designed primarily for jun-
The Curriculum
­ 16 ­
iors and seniors (and, often, for majors in the discipline); first-year students and sophomores are wel-
come to apply, but are urged to consult the instructor before registering.
Tutorials place much greater weight than do regular courses--or even small seminars--on student
participation. They aim to teach students how to develop and present arguments; listen carefully, and
then refine their positions in the context of a challenging discussion; and respond quickly and cogent-
ly to critiques of their work. Tutorials place particular emphasis on developing analytical skills, writ-
ing abilities, and the talents of engaging in rigorous conversation and oral debate.
The ways in which particular tutorials are conducted vary across the disciplines, but here is a de-
scription of how most tutorials at Williams are organized. Tutorials are usually limited to ten students.
At the start of term, the instructor divides the students into pairs. Each pair meets weekly with the
instructor for roughly one hour. Many tutorial courses begin and end the term with a group seminar,
and in a few departments, instructors hold weekly group meetings of all tutorial members to provide
background information designed to facilitate the students' independent work. But the heart of every
tutorial course is the weekly meeting of the two students with the instructor.
At these weekly meetings, one student delivers a prepared essay or presentation (e.g., an analysis of
a text or work of art, a discussion of a problem set, a report on laboratory exercises, etc.) pertaining to
the assignment for that week, while the other student--and then the instructor--offer a critique. In the
following week, students switch roles. Typically, students write five or six essays (usually in the range
of 4-7 pages) during the term, and offer five or six critiques of their partners' work.
Since the program's inception in 1988, students have ranked tutorials among the most demanding--
and rewarding--courses they have taken at Williams. While not designed to be more difficult than other
courses, tutorials are nonetheless challenging, with frequent writing assignments and the expectation
that students will be well prepared to participate actively and effectively in weekly discussions. At the
same time, students have consistently placed tutorials among the most enriching and consequential
courses they have taken. They have appreciated the close attention to their writing and argumentation
skills; the opportunity to be held accountable, in a detailed way, for the extended implications of their
ideas; the chance to develop their oral abilities as they engage in debate; and the close intellectual bonds
tutorials build between teachers and students, and students with each other. Many students have formed
important advising and mentoring relationships with their tutorial teachers.
Registration information: Students register for tutorials as they would for any other course (but
should first check the description for prerequisites and to see if permission of the instructor is re-
quired). (2) Because of limited enrollments and the special arrangements involved in organizing tuto-
rials, students are encouraged to determine, as early as possible, their interest in and commitment to
the course. Students may not drop or add a tutorial after the first week of class. (3) Tutorials may not be
taken on a pass/fail basis.
More information: Please see page 323 of this catalog for a list of tutorials offered in 2004-2005.
Students may obtain detailed information about particular tutorials from the course descriptions
and the instructors. (All tutorials have a "T" after the course number.) For general information, ad-
vice, or suggestions about the program, please contact Professor Stephen Fix, Tutorial Program Di-
rector, in Stetson.
Williams-Exeter Programme at Oxford University
Williams offers a year-long programme of studies at Oxford University in cooperation with Exeter Col-
lege, Oxford. Based at Ephraim Williams House, Williams' study center at Oxford, the Programme is de-
signed to offer the fullest possible integration of the students into the intellectual and social life of one of the
world's great universities. It makes full use of the Oxford tutorial system and the Oxford three-term calen-
dar is followed.
In addition to extensive opportunities to pursue British and Commonwealth studies, the Pro-
gramme also offers instruction in other fields for which Oxford is particularly noted or which are rep-
resented only marginally or infrequently in the Williams curriculum. Interested students should con-
sult the Dean's Office and the "Courses of Instruction" section of this catalog.
Williams-Mystic Maritime Studies Program
The William-Mystic Seaport Maritime Studies Program offers students a unique opportunity to
explore the ocean, to travel the Atlantic and Pacific Coasts, and to undertake original research of their
own design in the humanities and sciences. A term at Williams-Mystic satisfies both a semester's
The Curriculum
­ 17 ­
credit and one winter study requirement, as well as intensive writing course credit. Four Williams
courses are offered as an integrated, multidisciplinary curriculum in the semester-long program at
Mystic Seaport, in Mystic, Connecticut: Maritime History, Literature of the Sea, Marine Policy, and
either Marine Ecology or Oceanography (see the American Maritime Studies section in this catalog).
Williams College faculty members serve as the Director and Marine Scientist. Travel includes an off-
shore voyage on the open ocean sailing aboard a tall ship, a seminar along the Pacific Coast, and a
seminar on Nantucket Island, all of which are cross-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary exercises. Stu-
dents live in historic, cooperative, coed houses at Mystic Seaport, the world's largest maritime mu-
seum, and have full access to world-class maritime collections, a maritime library, well-equipped lab-
oratory, and diverse coastal habitats (where field research can be undertaken in a wide variety of envi-
ronments, ranging from tidepools and salt marshes to sandy beaches and estuaries). Students also par-
ticipate in maritime skills under professional instruction, with choices such as celestial navigation,
maritime art, music of the sea, boat building, or small boat handling and sailing. Williams-Mystic
seeks candidates who are willing to try new things and work in a compelling academic environment.
No sailing experience necessary, and all majors welcome--a typical semester at Williams-Mystic is
represented by 12 to 14 different majors spanning the sciences and humanities. Sophomores, juniors,
and seniors can attend. Interested students should contact Williams-Mystic at admissions@williams-
mystic.org, call (860-572- 5359), visit the website (williamsmystic.org), or obtain a Williams-Mystic
catalog from the Dean's office. Applications are on the web and at the Dean's office. Financial aid and
scholarships are available.

ACADEMIC STANDARDS AND REGULATIONS
Attendance
In order to give students a larger share of responsibility for their own education, Williams College does
not administer a general system of required classroom attendance. The College expects students to make
full use of their educational opportunities by regular class attendance and to assume the academic risks
incurred by absences.
Although no formal system of class attendance is maintained by the College, instructors may set such
standards of attendance as they feel are necessary for the satisfactory conduct of their courses. Students
who fail to meet these standards may be warned by the instructor and notice sent to the Dean that continued
absence will result in their being dropped from the course. A failing grade will be assigned to any course
dropped after the regular course change period. Students who do not attend the first class meeting in a
semester course or Winter Study Project may be required to withdraw by the instructor. Attendance is re-
quired at announced tests and final examinations unless the student is specifically excused by the instructor
or the Dean's Office. Satisfactory attendance in four quarters of activities approved by the Department of
Physical Education is required except for students excused by the Dean and the Director of Health.
Registration
Registration for fall and spring semesters and for the Winter Study Program takes place at designated
periods during the academic year. There may be a $5 per day processing fee for any registration changes
accepted after the announced deadlines.
New students register by mail in early summer; soon after arrival at Williams, they meet with their as-
signed Academic Advisors to discuss the curriculum and their course selections. All course changes for
new students are made with the approval of the Faculty Advisors. During the first two years of study, stu-
dents are limited in the number of courses they may take in one department or subject each semester. For
full details, see page 45.
Course Change Period
Course changes may be made during a designated period at the beginning of each semester. No course
changes may be made after that period except with the approval of the Committee on Academic Standing,
after consultation with the Dean's Office. During Winter Study, a second Winter Study Project may be
added if the instructor approves but the original Project may not be dropped. A processing fee of $5 per day
may be assessed for each course change accepted after the announced deadline.
First-year and first-semester transfer students may be permitted to withdraw from one course (incurring
a deficiency but no grade penalty) as late as the tenth week of the semester. Upperclass students also may
once in subsequent years withdraw from a course under the same conditions. A withdrawal, recorded on
the transcript as a "W," is granted only with the approval of the instructor and a dean and only if there is
complete agreement between the instructor and the dean that, despite conscientious effort to do the work,
continuation in the course would be detrimental to the overall educational interest or health of the student.
The deficiency thereby incurred must be removed in the normal manner. See references to making up defi-
ciencies on page 20.
Course Load
Students are required to take and complete four courses each semester. In exceptional cases, students
may, upon petition to the Committee on Academic Standing and with departmental approval at the time of
registration, elect a pattern of five semester courses in the fall semester and three in the spring or three in the
fall and five in the spring; a pass-fail course cannot be used as the fifth course in this pattern.
If a student with a disability believes that he/she is unable to pursue a full course of study, the student
may petition the Disabilities and Accommodations Advisory Group for permission to pursue a reduced
course load. Such a petition must be accompanied by a professional evaluation which addresses the stu-
dent's inability to maintain a full course of study and discusses the rationale for a reduced course load.
Upon consideration of a student's petition and supporting documentation, the Disabilities and Accom-
modations Advisory Group makes a recommendation to the Committee on Academic Standing which
renders decisions. Such cases are considered on an individual basis and may be initiated at any time during
the student's tenure at Williams.
Academic Standards and Regulations

Fifth Course Pass-Fail Option
Except in the case of the unbalanced course program described above, a student may, at the beginning of
any semester, enroll in a fifth course that must be specified as the pass-fail course. By the sixth week, a
student must decide whether to continue the course, and if so, whether on a pass-fail or regularly graded
basis. A form for designating the option chosen will be sent from the Registrar's Office. A processing fee
of $5 per day may be assessed for 5th course grading option designations accepted after the announced
deadline. A course graded "Pass" may not be used as one of the thirty-two semester courses required to
complete the degree, to fulfill distribution or major requirements, or to make up a deficiency. A pass-fail
course converted to a fifth regularly graded course may be used to fulfill distribution or major requirements
or to make up a deficiency incurred in a prior term. The grade received will be included in the calculation
of the student's cumulative grade-point average.
Winter Study Project
Students must take and pass a Winter Study Project in each of their four years. Winter Study Projects are
graded Honors, Pass, Perfunctory Pass, or Fail. All work for Winter Study Projects must be submitted by
the last day of the Winter Study Program; work may be accepted after this date only with the permission of
a dean. Students who fail their Winter Study Projects will be placed on Academic Probation by the Com-
mittee on Academic Standing and will be required to make up the deficiency (see page 20). Students who
fail through gross neglect of work will normally be required to resign. A student who receives a second
Perfunctory Pass grade in Winter Study will be required to pass a fifth course, which may be graded on the
regular A-E or pass/fail basis, in the following spring or fall semester.
Grading System and Records
Williams uses the following system of grades: A, excellent; B, good; C, fair; D, passing; E, failing.
These letters, with plus and minus value, have the following numerical equivalents in calculating grade
averages:
A+ = 4.33 B+ = 3.33 C+ = 2.33 D+ = 1.33
A = 4.00 B = 3.00 C = 2.00 D = 1.00 E = 0
A­ = 3.67 B­ = 2.67 C­ = 1.67 D­ = 0.67
A permanent record of each student's grades is kept and this official record forms the basis for any aca-
demic action by the College.
A transcript of a student's cumulative academic record is available from the Registrar's Office upon
written request. Transcripts will not be issued for students who are in financial arrears.
Provisions relating to student records, access to them, and safeguards on their use are in the Student
Handbook.
First-Year Student Warnings
In the middle of each semester, instructors report to the Registrar those first-year students whose grades
at that time are unsatisfactory. The students and their academic advisors receive notices of warnings as a
matter of routine. The Dean's Office will inform parents of students who receive two or more warnings
unless instructed not to do so by the student within three working days of the receipt of the warnings.
Extensions of Deadlines
Deadlines for course work are set by the instructor with the following limitations:
 for courses with final exams, the latest that written work may be due is 5:00 p.m. on the last
day of reading period.
 for courses without final exams, the latest that written work may be due is 5:00 pm. on the
third-to-last day of the exam period.
If work is due before these deadlines, the instructor may grant an extension up to these deadlines solely
at his or her discretion. Short extensions beyond these deadlines may be granted by a dean but only with the
concurrence of the instructor. No extensions will be granted beyond the examination period except in the
case of serious illness.
Instructors may require students who have missed announced quizzes or hour tests to present satis-
factory explanations to a dean before they are permitted to make up the exercises.
Academic Standards and Regulations
­ 20 ­
If a student is absent from a final examination, a make-up examination may be given only with the
permission of a dean and at a time determined by the dean.
Deficiencies
A student receives credit for a course by obtaining a grade of at least D minus. If the student fails a
course, he or she must make up the deficiency.
If a failure occurs in the first semester of a full-year course, the student may, with the consent of the
instructor, continue the course and receive credit for the second semester only. If a failure occurs in the
second semester of a full-year course, credit for passing the first semester may be retained only with the
approval of the Committee on Academic Standing.
A senior who incurs a failure in the first semester in a required major course may be dropped from the
College at midyear.
Normally deficiencies can be made up only by courses taken after the deficiencies have been incurred.
A student must make up a deficiency in one of these ways:
1) obtain a grade of at least C minus in a summer school course, approved in advance by the Registrar,
at a regionally accredited four-year college or university; (The grade will not, however, be included
in the calculation of the student's cumulative grade point average.)
2) pass an extra graded course at Williams in the semester following the failure;
3) in the case ofafirst-semester failure ofayear-long language course, obtainagrade of at leastaCminus
in the work of the second semester of that course. The failure for the first semester will, however, re-
main on the student's record and will be included in the cumulative grade point average.
A deficiency must normally be made up before the start of the following academic year, or in the case of
a deficiency incurred in the spring semester, no later than the following fall semester. A student may, in
consultation with the Dean's Office, petition the Committee on Academic Standing with an alternate plan.
Separation for Low Scholarship
It is the policy of Williams College not to permit a student to remain in residence after it has become
evident that he or she is either unable or unwilling to maintain reasonable standards of academic achieve-
ment. At the end of each term, the Committee on Academic Standing reviews all academic records that fail
to meet the following minimum academic requirements:
For first-year students: Three grades of C minus or better and no failures each semester, and
at least Perfunctory Pass on the Winter Study Project
For upperclass students: Four grades of C minus or better each semester, and
at least Perfunctory Pass on the Winter Study Project
Students whose records fail to meet these minimum academic requirements or whose records otherwise
fail to show adequate progress may receive an academic warning, be placed on academic probation, or be
required to resign.
Students who are required to resign from the College for academic reasons are normally not permitted to
return for at least one year from the date of their resignation. A student who has been required to resign
from the College may petition the Committee on Academic Standing through the Dean for reinstatement
on two conditions only: all deficiencies must have been made up and a letter submitted to the Committee
that offers convincing evidence that the student is ready and able to complete work toward a degree at
Williams without further interruption.
When required to resign, students must vacate their rooms promptly. Financial aid students must also
see the Director of Financial Aid before leaving to discuss loan repayment and renewal of aid in the event
of readmission.
A student who fails to meet minimum academic standards in his or her final semester at Williams may
be required by the Committee on Academic Standing to meet them by earning grades of at least C minus
elsewhere before the B.A. will be awarded. If such work is required, it must be completed within three
years unless stipulated otherwise, and the courses must be approved in advance by the Registrar.
Withdrawal from the College in Good Standing
Students may request personal leaves of absence from a dean and, if granted, withdraw from the Col-
lege. Such time away, often as a period of reassessment and self evaluation, can prove to be educationally
Academic Standards and Regulations
­ 21 ­
beneficial. A withdrawal in good standing may be granted for not less than one semester and not more than
three years. Students who withdraw in good standing are readmitted with the approval of the Dean's Office
and are expected to complete the degree without further interruption.
Students may request permission from a dean to withdraw at any time. If a student is granted a personal
leave of absence after the semester begins, but before the end of the drop/add period, the transcript will list
the date of withdrawal as the day before the term began. If a personal leave is granted after the end of the
drop/add period, but before the end of the eighth week of the semester, the transcript will list the date of
withdrawal, but the semester will not count toward the maximum of eight allowed to complete the degree.
If a personal withdrawal is allowed after the eighth week of the semester, the transcript will list the date of
withdrawal and the courses in progress, each with a W; the semester will normally count toward the maxi-
mum of eight allowed to complete the degree and the student will incur deficiencies that must be made up
before returning to the College.
Refunds
Payment refund or credit in the event of withdrawal is described on page 28.
Eligibility for and Completion of Majors
To be eligible for any major, students must have received grades of C minus or better in each course in
the major taken in the first two years of college and Honors or Pass on any Winter Study Project taken in
that department. A senior may enter a major only upon the approval of the department chair and the Com-
mittee on Academic Standing.
In addition to passing each major course and, where required, a major Winter Study Project, the student
must maintain an average in the major of 1.67 or higher. Seniors who have an average below 1.67 in the
major field will normally not be allowed to continue. A senior who receives a grade of E in the first semes-
ter of a required major course may be dropped from the College at mid-year. A student who falls below
these standards may continue in the major only with the approval of the Committee on Academic Stand-
ing.
A senior major exercise is not required by every department but is by some. All departments requiring
such an exercise specify it as such in the description of their major programs in the "Courses of Instruction"
section, and all students in those departments must complete the exercise satisfactorily.
Eligibility for Extracurricular Activities
A student is eligible to represent the College in any athletic, dramatic, literary, or musical event and be in
the student government, or other organization as a member, substitute, or officer, unless he or she is de-
clared ineligible:
1) by the Dean;
2) by vote of the Discipline Committee; or
3) by vote of the Committee on Academic Standing because of a dangerously low record.
The Student Honor Committee may recommend to the Dean loss of eligibility as a penalty for a viola-
tion of the Honor Code.
Dean's List
All students who attain a semester average of 3.50 or higher in a program of four or more courses are
placed on the Dean's List for that semester.
Phi Beta Kappa Society
Students of the highest academic standing are eligible for election to membership in the Phi Beta Kappa
Society in accordance with the following rules:
1) The requirements for election to membership shall be a grade point average of 3.3 and Honors or
Pass in all required Winter Study Projects. There shall be two elections of new members for each class, at
the end of the junior and senior years.
2) At the end of the junior year, all students in the highest five percent of the class, ranked by cumulative
grade point average, shall be eligible for election provided they have met the requirements and have com-
pleted enough courses to be considered candidates for the B.A. degree in the following year. A student who
leaves Williams at the end of the junior year to attend graduate school may be elected under the above
procedures.
Academic Standards and Regulations
­ 22 ­
At the end of the senior year, all students not yet elected and in the highest 12.5 per cent of the class,
ranked by cumulative grade point average, shall be eligible for election provided they have met the require-
ments.
3) Students shall be eligible for election only if they have been students at Williams College for at least
two years.
4) Honorary members may be elected from distinguished alumni of at least twenty years' standing. No
more than one such member shall be elected each year.
5) Any student who shall have gained his or her rank by unfair means or who in the judgment of the
Dean of the College is not of good moral character is ineligible to election.
6) The name of a member elect shall be entered on the roll only after he or she has accepted the election
and has paid to the Treasurer the regular entrance fee.
7) Any undergraduate member who withdraws from the College before graduation or who falls short of
the minimum Phi Beta Kappa scholastic standing may, upon a two-thirds vote of the members present at
the annual meeting, be deprived of membership in the society.
8) Any undergraduate member who is expelled from the College shall be deprived of membership in
the Society.
9) While connected with Williams College as an officer of instruction or administration, any graduate of
Williams College who is a member of another chapter of Phi Beta Kappa shall be considered a regular
member of the Williams chapter.
10) While connected with Williams College as professor, associate professor or assistant professor, or
an officer of administration, any member of another chapter of Phi Beta Kappa shall have all the privileges
of the Williams chapter, including holding office and voting. While connected with Williams College, any
other officer of instruction or administration who is a member of another chapter shall have all the privi-
leges of the Williams chapter, except holding office and voting.
Awarding of Degrees
By vote of the Trustees, the degree of Bachelor of Arts is conferred at Commencement upon students
who have completed the requirements as to courses and grades to the satisfaction of the Faculty. The right
to a degree may, however, be forfeited by misconduct at any time prior to the conferring of the degree. No
degree in absentia will be conferred except by special vote of the Trustees on petition presented to the
Dean. Diplomas will not be authorized for students who have not paid College charges or have not re-
turned all books belonging to the library.
Graduation with Distinction
The Faculty will recommend to the Trustees that the degree of Bachelor of Arts with distinction be con-
ferred upon those members of the graduating class who have passed all Winter Study Projects and obtained
a four year average in the top:
35% of the graduating class -- Bachelor of Arts cum laude or higher
15% of the graduating class -- Bachelor of Arts magna cum laude or higher
2% of the graduating class -- Bachelor of Arts summa cum laude
­ 23 ­
ACADEMIC ADVISING
A variety of academic advice and counsel is provided to students during the course of their undergradu-
ate education. Instructors, departmental and administrative officers, and some special programs are avail-
able to help students explore and develop their academic interests and talents and take advantage of aca-
demic opportunities available through the College.
In the first year each student is assigned an academic advisor from the faculty or staff. This advisor
discusses course choices and academic requirements with the student. The Dean's Office coordinates this
advising program, reviews the academic progress of individual students, and--when appropriate--calls
students in to discuss their situations.
In the sophomore year, students may seek advice from deans, former advisors, and instructors, along
with preprofessional and other special advisors (see page 411). Sophomores are also encouraged to discuss
major options and requirements with faculty members from departments and programs in which they have
an interest before declaring a major in the spring semester.
The student-run Senior Advisor program provides additional advice and information for sophomore
students in particular, as well as for first-year students and any others with questions about particular
courses, departments, majors, or areas of study. Senior Advisors are nominated by departments and pro-
grams from among the year's senior majors. During the course of the year the Senior Advisors hold several
Course and Majors Fairs, keep informed about any changes in faculty and curriculum in their departments,
and generally make themselves available for consultation by students.
In the junior and senior years students are advised by faculty from their major departments or programs.
Each department or program determines its own advising system for its majors, although chairs are regu-
larly available for consultation.
ACADEMIC ASSISTANCE
Additional programs of academic assistance are also available through the Dean's Office. After confer-
ring with the instructor, a student needing extra help in a particular course may request a tutor recom-
mended to the Dean's Office by the department; costs of this tutoring are covered by the Dean's Office.
Students seeking to improve their writing skills in any course may take advantage of the Writing Workshop.
Trained and supervised by a coordinator, student writing tutors provide help with problems on papers al-
ready corrected and with drafts of papers in progress. The Math and Science Resource Center, a drop-in
help center staffed by student tutors, is also available to students of Biology 101, 102 and 202, Chemistry
151, 153, 155, 251, and 255, Mathematics 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105 and 106, Physics 131, 132, 141
and 142, and Statistics 101 and 201.
EXCHANGE AND STUDY ABROAD
Advising of exchange students and of Williams students wishing to study abroad in the junior year is
coordinated by the Dean's Office. Special orientation and information meetings are held during the fall
semester for new students and for students wishing to study abroad. Orientation and counseling of interna-
tional students is arranged by the International Student Advisor in the Dean's Office.
POSTGRADUATE AND PROFESSIONAL STUDY

­ 24 ­
ACADEMIC HONESTY
All students are expected to be familiar with the Williams College Honor Code and to reaffirm their
commitment to the Statement of Academic Honesty by signing an Honor Code Pledge at the beginning of
each academic year. The Honor Code covers all aspects of academic honesty, including the writing of pa-
pers and laboratory reports as well as all quizzes, homework assignments, hour tests, and examinations.
Statement of Academic Honesty
As an institution fundamentally concerned with the free exchange of ideas, Williams College has al-
ways depended on the academic integrity of each of its members. In the spirit of this free exchange, the
students and faculty of Williams recognize the necessity and accept the responsibility for academic hones-
ty.
A student who enrolls at the College thereby agrees to respect and acknowledge the research and ideas
of others in his or her work and to abide by those regulations governing work stipulated by the instructor.
Any student who breaks these regulations, misrepresents his or her own work, or collaborates in the mis-
representation of another's work has committed a serious violation of this agreement.
Students and faculty are to report violations and alleged violations of this agreement. Such reports are to
be submitted to the Student Honor Committee, consisting of eight student members of the joint Faculty-
Student Honor System-Discipline Committee. This committee is responsible for determining the guilt or
innocence of the accused person or persons, and for recommending appropriate punishments to the Dean.
A committee of faculty members to be designated by the Faculty will sit with the Student Honor Commit-
tee in an advisory capacity.
A quorum of three-quarters shall be required for the Committee to meet. A vote of guilty by at least
three-quarters of those present is necessary for conviction. A recommendation for dismissal must be made
by unanimous vote of those present, and shall be carried out only with the assent of the President of the
College.
The Committee is responsible for informing the student body of the meaning and implications of this
statement. The aforementioned faculty committee shall be responsible for informing faculty members of
the meaning and implications of this statement.
Any amendments to this statement must be made through a student referendum in which two-thirds of
the student body votes, and in which two-thirds of those voting vote for the amendment. These alterations
must be ratified by the Faculty.
Adopted 1971
Guidelines
Instructors are encouraged to submit to the Honor Committee a written statement defining how the
Statement of Academic Honesty applies to their courses or laboratories, and to explain such guidelines to
their students. Instructors may set any type of final examination or hour test, ranging from closed-book,
alternate-seating classroom exercises to open-book, "take-home" examinations or papers, and any require-
ments for laboratory exercises. Some instructors encourage cooperation among students but others do not.
If a student is unsure how the Honor Code applies in a particular situation, it is ultimately the student's
responsibility to find out from his or her professor, or from a member of the Honor Committee, how the
Honor Code applies in that situation. An open and highly individualized system can last only as long as
both the students and the faculty work together to create a true academic community.
In written material, students are expected to avoid the possibility of even unintentional plagiarism by
acknowledging the sources of their work. Careful observance of accepted standards of reference and
attribution is required. The basic rules are summarized below. Students are further advised to consult a
recognized style manual to learn how to acknowledge sources correctly. While academic honesty does not
demand a footnote on statements of common fact, it does require that a student provide clear footnotes or
other appropriate documentation and give credit in the bibliography to ideas, interpretations, and facts that
particular sources have contributed to the student's final work.
Academic Honesty
­ 25 ­
The basic rules of attribution require that:
1) A direct quotation (whether a single word or a phrase, sentence, paragraph, or series of paragraphs)
must always be identified by quotation marks, by indenting and single spacing, or by reduced type size of
the quoted material, and a note must be used to state the exact source.
2) A paraphrase of the work of another must be acknowledged as such by a note stating the source.
3) Indebtedness to the specific ideas of others, or the summarizing of several pages, even though ex-
pressed in different words, must be acknowledged by a note stating the source.
4) Every instance of the use of another student's laboratory reports, computer programs, or other mate-
rial must be acknowledged by a note.
5) Even the use of a student's own previous work must be acknowledged; thus, a student must obtain
the prior permission of all instructors concerned before submitting substantially the same paper in more
than one course.
Procedures for Alleged Violations
Students or faculty members who have discovered a violation or a possible violation of the Honor Code
should report it promptly either to the faculty chair or to the student chair of the Honor Committee. As
soon as possible after receiving a report of an alleged Honor Code violation, the Student Honor Committee
will convene to hear the case. The person bringing the charge will present the evidence to the Committee in
the presence of the accused student, who may then speak in his or her own defense both with and without
the accuser present. After the accused student has left the proceedings, the Committee will determine inno-
cence or guilt and, if the latter, will recommend an appropriate penalty to the Dean. Depending on the
circumstances of the violation, penalties then imposed by the Dean may include such possibilities as a
directed grade of E in the course, disciplinary probation, or temporary or permanent separation from the
College.
­ 26 ­
EXPENSES
Within the limits of available funds, Williams endeavors to offer its educational opportunities to all who
qualify for admission. Income from its endowment and annual contributions from its alumni and friends
have enabled Williams to keep its tuition at about half the actual cost per student to the College.
Payment of Term Bills
College bills for one-half of all tuition and fees are mailed to parents twice a year (in mid-July and mid-
December) for payment on August 15 and January 15; a fee of $250 may be charged if payment is re-
ceived after these dates. Term bills must be paid before the semester's classes begin or the student will not
be permitted to enroll in classes or remain in residence at the College. Billing statements for accounts with
outstanding balances or current activity will be issued monthly and are due upon receipt.
All outstanding balances must be paid to the Bursar, and all books and materials must be returned to the
Library, before the student is entitled to a degree or a transcript.
College Bills
College charges for tuition, room, board, and fees for the academic year 2004-2005 are as follows:
Tuition $29,786
Room Fee (including telephone service) 4,060
Full Board 4050
Student Activities Fee* 154
House Maintenance Fee (upperclass) or First-Year Dues 50
_______
$38,100
Other Expenses
Based on a study of expenses reported by financial aid students, a minimum normal budget for a college
year at Williams includes additional expenses estimated as follows:
Books 800
Clothing, Laundry, Recreation approximately 1200
_______
Estimated year's total, exclusive of travel expenses** $2,000
________________
*A student activities fee for support of non-athletic student organizations is charged to all un-
dergraduates as part of the College term bill. It includes, for example, subscriptions to the col-
lege newspaper, and admission to most drama productions and musical events on campus.
**Travel expenses are not included in figures listed above. The cost of two round-trip tickets is
added into each successful financial aid candidate's award.
Additional Items
A House Maintenance Fee of $50 per year is charged to upperclassmen as a part of the College term bill.
It is used to provide a base for the social and cultural programs of each residential House and to meet any
unusual maintenance expenses for the Houses. First-year class dues of $50 are charged at the rate of $25
each semester.
The Commonwealth of Massachusetts requires that, effective September 1, 1989, all full- and part-time
students enrolled in institutions of higher education located in Massachusetts must participate in a qualify-
ing student health insurance plan offered by the institution or in another health insurance program affording
comparable coverage.
Expenses
­ 27 ­
The College offers a qualifying student health insurance plan to all students. The College will allow
students to waive participation in this insurance plan if the student will certify in writing, before the begin-
ning of the academic year, that the coverage offered by an alternative program chosen by the student is
comparable to that of the qualifying program available at the College.
Information about the student health insurance program offered by the College, including current details
of its cost, is mailed to all students each year. Additional information about this program or about the Com-
monwealth's requirements is available through the Thompson Health Center at (413) 597-3166.
There may be a $5 per day processing fee for any registration changes accepted after the announced
deadlines. There is a charge of $25 for a lost key.
Payment of College Bills
A non-refundable deposit of $200 to reserve a place in the first-year class is required from all admitted
candidates (except certain financial aid recipients) by the Candidate's Reply Date of May 1. The deposit
appears as a credit on the term bill rendered in July.
College tuition statements for one half of all fees are mailed to the billing name(s) and addresses on
record twice a year--in July, payable by August 15, and in December, payable by January 15. Payment
may be made by check, money order, or wire transfer. Credit cards can not be used to pay tuition and fees.
A fee of $250 may be charged if payment is received after these dates.
Students who receive a scholarship(s) that was not awarded through the Williams Office of Financial
Aid must complete a Scholarship Information Sheet and mail it to the Financial Aid Office by early June.
Provisional credit will be posted to the semester bill for the following; anticipated disbursements of direct
loans for which a promissory note has been signed and returned to the Office of Financial Aid, anticipated
disbursements of outside loans approved by the lender, outside scholarships which have not yet been re-
ceived and applied against the student account and any remaining semester contract amount for the Ten
Month Payment Plan. If actual payment for the above provisional credits are not received by the date antic-
ipated, the provisional credit will expire and be removed from the student's account creating a balance due.
A check returned to the College for any reason such as "account closed" or "insufficient funds" will be
charged to the student's term bill and a "return check charge" of $20.00 will be assessed. The College
reserves the right to require that payment be made in the form of cash, cashier check or money order.
Students with bills still unpaid at the start of the semester who have not made satisfactory arrangements
with the Bursar will not be permitted to enroll in classes or remain in residence at the College. Furthermore,
if arrangements for payment after the start of the semester are approved by the Bursar and these expected
payments are not made on time, students may not be allowed to enroll for the next semester.
If efforts by the Bursar's Office to collect the monies owed are unsuccessful, the account could be
placed with a collection agency, and if the delinquency persists, the College's experience with the account
may be reported to a national credit bureau. It is the policy of the College to pass on to the debtor all reason-
able costs associated with collection of the debt through a collection agency. If at any time the student
believes information concerning payment delinquency is inaccurate, he/she should notify the College c/o
The Bursar's Office, P.O. Box 406, Williamstown, MA 01267.
There are several loan options available to parents through outside sources. These include the MassPlan
Loan through the Massachusetts Educational Financing Authority and the Federal Plus Loan Program.
Information on these loans can be found in the brochure A Guide to Borrowing for College.
Williams also offers an installment plan, administered by Tuition Management Services whereby the
yearly charges are paid in 10 equal installments starting in June, with no interest charges. There are no
income restrictions. Monthly payments will be the total cost (less any scholarships, Stafford or parent
loans) divided by 10. There is an administration fee for this program. Information on this program is sent
each spring to all parents or can be obtained by calling Tuition Management Services at (888) 216­4258.

Financial Aid
Williams has a substantial financial aid program to promote the greatest possible diversity in the social
and economic background of the student population. Students interested in financial aid policies and pro-
cedures should consultWilliams College Prospectus,theStudent Handbook, or the Office of Financial Aid.
Distinctive Undergraduate Scholarships
Williams College, through the Office of Financial Aid, administers over three hundred endowed schol-
arships, all of which are based on demonstrated need. Students who apply for financial assistance are auto-
matically considered for all these and other endowed scholarships. No separate application is required.
Limited space prohibits the complete listing of these, but some deserve special mention because of their

assistance for up to three years of graduate/professional study.
Alumni Funded Tutorials
Tutorials bring a professor and two students together in weekly sessions that epitomize President
James A. Garfield's (Class of 1856) legendary statement: "The ideal college is Mark Hopkins on
one end of the log and a student on the other." They forge student-professor bonds, teach students
about arguments, about arriving at and defending a position, and about responding on the spot to
questions, criticisms, and suggestions. They also promote critical reading, the writing of succinct
analyses, and oral defense.
The College acknowledges the Classes of 1953, 1954, and 1979 with deepest gratitude for support-
ing Tutorials with their generous 25th and 50th Reunion gifts. Williams is also pleased to recognize
the following individuals who have created generous endowments to support Tutorials in honor of
their 25th and 50th Reunions: Hugh Germanetti 1954, David A. Gray 1954, John D. Mabie 1954,
and John H. Simpson 1979.
A member of the Class of 1954 Reunion gift Purpose Committee says, "This is the essence of
education and eminently worthy of the full support of the 50th Reunion Class of 1954. I was always
aware of the benefit we each enjoyed as one student among only fifteen or eighteen in our usual
classes--would that we also could have had the benefit of regular two-on-one sessions with a pro-
fessor. I don't believe we could offer those who follow us anything richer than that experience."

PREPARATIONFORGRADUATEAND PROFESSIONALSTUDY
Although the principle function of Williams is to provide a broad and solid liberal education that will be
of lasting value no matter what the vocation a student may pursue, the College recognizes that no funda-
mental conflict exists between a liberal education and preparation for a professional career; on the contrary,
a foundation of liberal studies increases professional competence in any field. A student should plan his or
her program of study so as to provide as much educational breadth and enrichment as circumstances per-
mit. A student should also give serious consideration to post-college plans early in the college career.
Each departmental major provides the foundation for graduate study in the corresponding field. Stu-
dents should consult the departmental programs listed under "Courses of Instruction" for requirements,
and for special advice regarding preparation for graduate study. Students should also consult with the ap-
propriate departmental chairman or the special faculty advisors as early as possible in their college careers
to make certain they have taken all the necessary factors into consideration.
Particular attention is called to the foreign language requirements of graduate study. Candidates for the
degree of doctor of philosophy at almost all graduate schools are required to have a reading knowledge of
both French and German. Under certain circumstances another language may replace French. Many grad-
uate schools require also a knowledge of Latin for students of English and Romantic Languages. Candi-
dates for the master of arts degree are required to have a reading knowledge of either French or German.
Students should consult departmental chairmen or the faculty advisors for the requirements in specific
fields of study.
Visual Arts
Although requirements set by various art and architectural schools differ, the basic requirements for a
variety of visual arts fields are summarized in the pamphlet "Guide to the Studio Art Major," available
from the Department of Art office in the W.L.S. Spencer Studio Art Building or the Office of Admission. A
summary of the requirements of all art and architecture schools offering Master of Arts and/or Master of
Fine Arts is available in the bulletin of the College Art Association (CAA), "MFA Programs in the Visual
Arts: A Directory." According to the current edition:
Admission to MFA programs should be based on the nature, extent, and quality of undergraduate
preparation, including courses in studio, art history, and other academic subjects. Quality of studio
preparation can best be judged on the basis of careful evaluation of work done at the undergraduate
level; therefore, a portfolio review (usually represented by slides) is regarded as an absolute necessity
in the admission process.
While many institutions consider the BFA to be the standard qualifying degree, the fact that the
applicant has attended a BA- or BS-granting institution does not necessarily rule out acceptance in
most MFA programs. Whatever the undergraduate degree, most entering graduate students tend not
to be completely prepared in one or more of the areas cited above and will require remedial make-up
work...
Some institutions use the MA degree as a qualifying prerequisite for final acceptance into MFA
candidacy, allowing the student to apply the earned credits toward the higher degree. (pp. 139-40)
Students are advised to take into consideration not only current minimum requirements but also recom-
mended courses. A summary of the essential information required for curricular planning may be found in
the "Guide to the Studio Art Major" and in the pamphlet "Choosing First Year Courses."
Business Administration
Williams offers no special course in preparation for a business career for graduate study in business
administration. The qualities which are important to succeed in business, and which graduate business
schools are seeking, are an ability to reason and to express oneself logically and clearly in written and oral
exposition; a good understanding of the physical and social environment in which business operates; a
solid background in quantitative skills; and an appreciation of human motivations and goals. This means
that a broad liberal arts program is preferred over a highly specialized one.
Within this broad prescription it may be desirable to have at least one year of economics and one year of
mathematics (including statistics and calculus). For those interested in production management or opera-
Preparation for Graduate and Professional Study
­ 32 ­
tion research, additional work in any quantitative course and/or a course in computer science would be
helpful.
But there is no particular major at Williams that is designated as preparation for the business profession.
Students interested in futures in business are encouraged to undertake a broad educational program in the
arts, humanities, and sciences. It is important that one gets involved in extra-curricular activities and that
one holds a leadership position.
Students interested in graduate work in business administration should consult with Fatma Kassamali at
the Office of Career Counseling.
Engineering
Many Williams graduates enjoy productive careers in engineering, applied science, or technical man-
agement. Successful engineers need to be able to communicate effectively, reason logically, and under-
stand both the technical and the social dimensions of a problem. A prospective engineer should pursue a
broad liberal arts education at Williams, with a strong grounding in basic science and mathematics. Most
often he or she will complete a Williams B.A. majoring in one of the sciences (usually physics, chemistry,
mathematics, or computer science) and then go to an engineering school for professional training leading
to a master's degree or doctorate in engineering. While it may be necessary to make up a few undergradu-
ate engineering courses, the opportunities at Williams to participate in scientific research and the breadth of
a liberal arts education prepare Williams graduates to succeed in engineering graduate study and in their
careers.
The booklet "Choosing First Year Courses" contains a list of Williams courses recommended to pro-
spective engineers. Students interested in engineering also have the opportunity to take undergraduate en-
gineering courses at other institutions. Williams maintains formal exchange programs with California
Institute of Technology, Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth College, and Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute. Williams students can arrange to study at one of these leading engineering schools for one or two
semesters, typically during the junior year. Individual arrangements may be possible at other engineering
schools. The 3-2 program offers another opportunity to study engineering at the undergraduate level. For
information about these opportunities, please see the sections of this catalog titled "Exchange Programs"
and "Combined Program in Liberal Arts and Engineering."
The pre-engineering advisor, Professor Jefferson Strait, will be happy to help plan course selections
and to discuss the possible paths to a career in engineering. Many more details about pre-engineering
can be found on the Physics department page of the College website.
Law
Williams graduates regularly proceed directly to law schools on the strength of their liberal education.
No special courses are presented for pre-law students.
Students intending to study law should consult with the Pre-Law Advisor, Fatma Kassamali, at the Of-
fice of Career Counseling.
The Health Professions
Many Williams graduates elect to pursue a career in medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine, public
health, or other health-related fields. All are welcome to seek guidance from the Health Professions Office.
Students interested in medicine and related fields should pursue a broad liberal arts education, letting
enthusiasm for subjects be a guide. In most cases, a student should consider volunteer service and field-
specific internship experience in an effort to confirm interest in the chosen field. With careful planning, any
major can be studied.
In order to pursue a career in a health-related field, a student must pay particular attention to the courses
required for graduate school admission. In certain fields, upwards of twelve courses are listed as prerequi-
sites. The general requirements for many programs are outlined in "Choosing First Year Courses," but each
student considering advanced study in the health fields should plan on meeting with the Health Professions
Advisor early in the college career to ensure that planned coursework will meet specific admissions re-
quirements.
Charley Stevenson, the Health Professions Advisor, will be happy to discuss goals and specific steps
which might help a student realize them.
Preparation for Graduate and Professional Study
­ 33 ­
Pre-College and College Teaching/Research
A central qualification for careers in teaching at any level is proficiency in a major. Students interested in
college teaching and research should prepare themselves at Williams for graduate work in the subject of
their choice. Those interested in teaching at the elementary or secondary level should plan to attain state
certification and/or earn an MAT or M.Ed at a good graduate school. There are many opportunities to do
teaching internships and study education as an undergraduate while at Williams.
Students interested in college teaching should consult with the chairs of the departments in which they
intend to major. Those interested in teaching at the elementary and secondary level should consult with the
Director of the Program in Teaching or the Office of Career Counseling.
Teaching After Williams
There are many options for teaching after Williams, including independent and public school teaching.
Many states now offer streamlined programs to certify public school teachers, and many states offer wide
range of options for acquiring certification while you teach. Students who are interested in teaching are
encouraged to contact Susan Engel, the Director of the Program in Teaching at Williams, to find out how
they might participate in the program.
The Office of Career Counseling has a very active on-campus educational recruiting program that in-
cludes many private schools as well as Teach for America and similar programs. The program begins in
the fall and continues through the spring. Students interested in teaching at private elementary- or secon-
dary-level schools or participating in the Teach for America or similar programs directly after graduation
from Williams (certification is not required) should consult with the Office of Career Counseling.
Religious Study
There is no particular path through the Williams curriculum designed or recommended for students in-
tending to prepare for a career as a religious professional, enroll in a seminary or pursue theological educa-
tion. Most undergraduate liberal arts courses can be useful to the prospective minister, priest, rabbi, or
teacher of religion. Ordination requirements vary widely depending on the particular religious community
or tradition; in some cases it may be possible to make progress on certain credentials in academic study or
field experience during the undergraduate years. A basic foundation in the study of religion is certainly
helpful--sacred texts, scriptural languages, history, philosophy, phenomenology and comparative studies,
etc. Students contemplating advanced academic work in religious studies in preparation for a career in
teaching or scholarship should give serious consideration to concentrated undergraduate study in the field.
Students with vocational interests that may include ordination or certification as a religious professional
are urged to make themselves known to one of the chaplains (or, where appropriate, one of the local clergy)
as soon as these interests begin to come into focus. Those interested in graduate academic programs in
religious studies should consult with the faculty advisor in that field.

GRADUATE PROGRAMS AT WILLIAMS
Master of Arts in Development Economics
The Center for Development Economics, which opened at Williams College in 1960 with the support of
a grant from the Ford Foundation, offers an intensive one-year program in economic analysis and quantita-
tive techniques leading to the degree of Master of Arts in Development Economics. The program is specif-
ically designed for economists from developing countries who are already embarked on professional ca-
reers in public agencies. It includes required courses in development economics, international trade and
finance, monetary and fiscal policy, econometrics, and public finance. Center Fellows choose among
seminars in such fields as open-economy macroeconomics, agricultural economics, and economic transi-
tion.
Fellows are normally nominated by the public agencies from which they will be on leave. A candidate
must have a B.A. or B. Sc. degree of honors quality in Economics, have two or more years of relevant
work experience, and have an effective command of spoken and written English. Juniors and seniors ma-
joring in economics or political economy who have special interest in economic development or in a par-
ticular area of the world may, with the consent of the Chairof theCenter and of the individual instructor,
satisfy some of their degree requirements by taking courses at the Center.
All communications relating to the degree of Master of Arts in Development Economics should be ad-
dressed to the CDE, Assistant Director, 1065 Main Street, Williams College, Williamstown, Massachusetts
01267, or e-mail cde@williams.edu.
Master of Arts in the History of Art
In cooperation with the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute, Williams College offers a two-year
course of study leading to the degree of Master of Arts in the History of Art. The objective of the program
is to offer to a small number of students a thorough professional preparation for careers in teaching and
museums, and to enable them to pursue further research whether independently or at other institutions of-
fering higher degrees. The curriculum consists of seminars in art historical subjects and an intensive study
of foreign languages in the context of the general literature of art. Problems of criticism, connoisseurship,
and conservation arising from the study of original works of art are fundamental to the program, and op-
portunities are provided for practical experience in museum work at the Clark Art Institute, the Williams
College Museum of Art, and the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art. The study of primary ma-
terials is further extended by field trips to other collections. The degree is normally awarded after two years
of resident graduate study. To earn the degree, students must take ten courses, of which at least six must be
graduate seminars (including ARTH 504). In connection with the preparation of a paper for the Graduate
Symposium, students will register for an eleventh course (ARTH 509), to be graded pass/fail, in their
fourth semester. A demonstration of proficiency in reading two foreign languages is required. Of these two,
German is required, and French is recommended. In January of the first year, students participate in a Eu-
ropean study trip with selected faculty; in January of the second year, students must complete a Qualifying
Paper. In addition to all course work, students must, at the end of the second year, present a shortened
version of the Qualifying Paper in a graduate symposium to be held on Commencement weekend. To enter
the program a successful applicant must have been awarded the degree of Bachelor of Arts or its equivalent
from an accredited institution. An undergraduate major in art is not required for acceptance to the program.
For further information, write: The Director, Graduate Program in the History of Art, Box 8, Williams-
town, Massachusetts 01267, telephone (413)458-9545, or email gradart@williams.edu.

COURSES OF INSTRUCTION 2004-2005
COURSE NUMBERING SYSTEM
Courses designated by a single number are semester courses.
Year courses are designated by an odd number and an even number joined by a hyphen; the work of
the two semesters constitutes an integral, indivisible course. Therefore, if a student does not pass the
second half of a year-long course, he or she forfeits credit for the first half and incurs a deficiency as a
result of the forfeiture. Students who register for a year course are required to do both semesters of
that course within the same academic year.
In some departments, course numbers have special meanings that are explained in their listings.
The(F) or(S) following a course's number indicates the semester, fall or spring, in which the course

HONORS PROGRAM IN AFRICAN-AMERICAN STUDIES
A candidate for honors in African-American Studies must maintain at least a B+ average in the
concentration and be admitted to candidacy by the program faculty. An honors candidate must com-
plete her/his project in a semester (and Winter Study). A candidate will enroll for either AAS 491 or
492 (and Winter Study) during her/his senior year to write a forty-page thesis or to do an equivalent
project in the performing and studio arts. A faculty advisor, in consultation with the chair, can change
the particulars of an honors project.
An honors project should demonstrate unusual creativity, depth, and intellectual rigor. A candidate
for honors is permitted and encouraged to pursue non-traditional projects, such as presentations in the
performing arts, visual arts, or creative writing, as well as more traditional interdisciplinary studies.
The advisor will evaluate an honors project, and the program faculty will decide whether to confer
honors. A student wishing to become a candidate for honors in African-American Studies should se-
cure a faculty sponsor and inform the program chair in writing before spring registration of her/his
junior year.

the interdisciplinary meaning of 14 chapters in ...Souls... that signal the terms of analysis in the major
disciplines that became standard in the academy during the pivotal twentieth century, including music,
sociology, economics, politics, literature, and public policy. Readings cover the primary text and supple-
mentary commentary to revisit the role of songs, poems, criticism, education, religion, leadership and
other factors in individual and group development as these took form in W. E. B. Du Bois' analysis of
race.
Format: discussion. Requirements: class discussion, three research and writing assignments over the se-
mester.
Prerequisites: Students should have completed a basic or survey course in a relevant discipline. Enroll-
ment limit: 25 (expected 25). Preference given to African-American Studies concentrators, seniors and

AMERICAN STUDIES (Div. II)
Chair, Professor: SCOTT WONG
Faculty 2004-2005: Professors: KUNZEL, REINHARDT. Associate Professor: KENT. Assistant
Professors: AUBERT, BEAN, L. JOHNSON**, RÚA. Senior Lecturer: CLEGHORN.
GENERAL PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The American Studies Program uses interdisciplinary approaches to develop students' understand-
ing of the complexity of the culture(s) usually labeled "American." Examining history, literature,
visual media, performance, and other forms of expression, we explore the processes of cultural defini-
tion as contested by diverse individuals and groups. We ask new questions about aspects of American
life long taken for granted; we also use American culture as a laboratory for testing classic and con-
temporary theories about how cultures work.
NON-MAJORS, FIRST-YEAR STUDENTS, AND SOPHOMORES
American Studies 201 is open to non-majors including first-year students with Advanced Place-
ment credit in American History. All elective courses are open to students who meet the requirements
of the departments that sponsor those courses. Courses designated as junior or senior seminars are
open to non-majors with permission of the instructor.
RATIONALE FOR COURSE NUMBERING
The introductory course is offered at the 200 level to suggest the desirability of some preliminary
training in college-level history, literature, sociology, or political science. The intermediate courses,
designated as Junior Seminars at the 300 level, are offered primarily for juniors, although they are
open to sophomores who have had 201 and will be away from campus during the spring of their junior
year. 400 level courses designated as Senior Seminars are designed for senior majors.
THE MAJOR
Required major courses:
American Studies 201
300 level courses designated Junior Seminar
400 level courses designated Senior Seminar
Elective courses:
Eight courses: five should be chosen from one of thespecialization fields listed below, the other three
chosen from among any of the electives listed. Students are expected to take courses from at least two
disciplines when choosing the courses that make up their specializations. Students are also required
to take at least one course from a list of pre-1900 courses. Advanced Placement credit in appropriate
areas, or departmental courses not listed here, may be substituted for electives in the major, with per-
mission of the program chair.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN AMERICAN STUDIES
Candidates for honors in American Studies will undertake a substantial, year-long independent
project during their Senior year. Applicants should have a consistent record of high achievement in
courses taken for the major, and normally will have done work in the field of study of their proposed
thesis. Students who wish to write or produce an honors project should consult with a prospective
faculty advisor in their junior year. Formal application to pursue honors should be made by the time of
spring registration in the junior year. Students must submit a 1- to 2-page preliminary proposal de-
scribing the proposed project to the Chair of the American Studies Program at this time. Final admis-
sion to the honors thesis program will depend on the AMST advisory committee's assessment of the
qualifications of the student and the merits and feasibility of the project. If the proposal is approved,
they will be permitted to register for AMST 491, W030, and AMST 492 the following year. The com-
pleted project is due in mid-April. Each student will present a short oral presentation of his or her the-
sis at the end of spring semester.
ADVISING
All majors will be assigned a faculty advisor. Majors must meet with their advisor during the first
week of classes during the fall semester and at the time of the spring semester registration period in
order to have their courses and plans for the American Studies major approved. Both majors and non-
majors are encouraged to talk at any time with the program chair or other affiliated faculty about the
major.
AMERICAN STUDIES AND OTHER PROGRAMS
Students majoring in American Studies are encouraged to consider pursuing concentrations in
African-American, Environmental, and Women's and Gender Studies. Many of the courses counted
for those concentrations may also earn credit toward the American Studies major.
STUDY AWAY FROM WILLIAMS
We encourage students to pursue cross-cultural comparative studies. A major in American Studies
can be combined with study away from Williams for a semester or a year if plans are made carefully.
American Studies
­ 49 ­
Many courses that will be approved for College credit may also count toward the American Studies
major if their subject matter is American culture.
Students planning to be away in the junior year should have taken American Studies 201 before
they leave; those away for junior-year spring term should take American Studies 302 in their sopho-
more year. Students should consult as early as possible with the chair or their advisor about their plans
for fulfilling the requirements of the major.
AMST 201(F,S) Introduction to American Studies
To be an "American" means something more than U.S. citizenship. In this course, we focus on the prob-
lems and possibilities of American identity. Access to Americanness is shaped by factors such as class,
race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, religion, and region--categories which themselves change in meaning
over time. Given the geographical, racial, and cultural diversity of the United States, the ways in which
Americans imagine nation inevitably vary over time, according to place, and among different individu-
als and groups. Rather than a survey of any one aspect or period of American history, literature, or popu-
lar culture, this course is an introduction to the interdisciplinary field of American Studies, a field de-
fined both by the range of texts we read (essays, novels, autobiographies, photographs, films, music,
architecture, historical documents, legal texts), and by the questions we ask of them: How have different
Americans imagined what it means to be an American? What ideas about national history, patriotism,
and moral character shape their visions of Americanness? How do the educational system, mass media,
government policies regarding citizenship and immigration shape American identities? How are bound-
aries of inclusion and exclusion in the nation drawn? What uses have been made of the claim to an
American identity, and what is at stake in that claim? How have Americans imagined a national land-
scape, a national culture, and to what ends?
Format: discussion. Evaluation will be based on a series of short critical essays and a group project.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 25 per section (expected: 25 per section). Preference given to sopho-
mores and first-year students with AP 5 in U.S. History. One section in the fall; one section in the spring.

AMST 403(F) Senior Seminar: American Music
One way to write the cultural history of music is to trace the authority with which different people can
say "`You are hurting my ears' at any given historical moment." So writes Carlo Rotella, one of the
historians whose work we will read in this course as we approach American popular music as an object
of cultural studies. We will study particular performers and styles (e.g. Elvis, Selena, punk and hip hop),
but we do so in the context of the histories of labor; social migration; political and economic shifts; ideol-
ogies; and of the culture industry. Moving from the late-nineteenth-century to the present, and through
agrarian to industrial to postindustrial social configurations, we will study music as a means of express-
ing resistance and accommodation and as the basis of community-formation and disruption. We will pay
special attention to the recent recovery by American musicians of folk musics originating outside of
American borders: Celtic, African and Cuban in the context of global capitalism and American hegemo-
ny. Texts include works of history, cultural criticism and ethnomusicology; audio performance recorded
in the field, in the studio, and in concert; and documentary and fiction films. Format: seminar. Evaluation
will be based on a number of written assignments.

SPECIALIZATION FIELDS
To provide focus for work in the major, each student will choose one of the Specialization Fields
listed below and record this choice when registering for the major. (This commitment can be revised,
in consultation with the chair.) At least five electives will be taken from among those designated to
support a specialization field. In extraordinary cases, students who wish to do so may be permitted to
design their own specialization field. Fulfillment of concentrations in African-American Studies, En-
vironmental Studies, and Women's and Gender Studies may be used as the basis for individually de-
signed specialization fields. All such arrangements must be approved by the American Studies Com-
mittee.

ANTHROPOLOGY AND SOCIOLOGY (Div. II)
Chair, Professor MICHAEL F. BROWN
Professors: M. F. BROWN, D. EDWARDS**, JACKALL*, JUST. Associate Professors: FOIAS,
NOLAN*. Assistant Professor: SHEVCHENKO. Distinguished Visiting Professor: ERIKSON§.
Visiting Assistant Professor: STANCZAK.
The Department of Anthropology and Sociology at Williams aims to help students achieve an inte-
grated understanding of biography, history, culture, and social structure in both traditional and mod-
ern societies.
Anthropology explores the full range of human experience by introducing students to the study of
tribal and peasant societies, especially those on the periphery of the West, as well as to the cultural
complexities of stratified, industrial societies such as our own. Integrated with the study of specific
peoples is an examination of the various analytical schemes anthropologists have developed to under-
stand them. Courses offered in the department represent two of Anthropology's major subfields: so-
ciocultural anthropology--that is, the comparative study of human social life, institutions, and be-
liefs--and archaeology, the study of the origins and lifeways of prehistoric peoples.
Sociology studies the social and institutional intricacies of modern industrial societies and the so-
cial psychological dilemmas facing the individual in our epoch. Sociology courses introduce students
to classical and contemporary social thought about men and women and society, to the systematic
analysis of social institutions and social interaction, and to the social analysis of modern culture. The
Sociology major at Williams emphasizes the humanistic tradition of sociology, stressing qualitative
approaches to understanding how social reality is constructed.
MAJORS
The department offers separate majors in both Anthropology and Sociology, with a broad and di-
verse array of courses in both disciplines. The department is committed, however, to the unity of the
social sciences. To this end, Anthropology and Sociology offer joint core courses in methodology and
theory, as well as several elective courses in common. All joint courses are designated "ANSO."
Requirements
For the degree in Anthropology or Sociology, students must complete a minimum of nine courses
as outlined below:
(1) Core Courses. Majors in both disciplines must take a sequence of four core courses. Three of these
are joint (ANSO) courses. The sequences are:
Anthropology Joint (ANSO) Sociology
ANTH 101 The Scope SOC 101 Invitation to
of Anthropology Sociology
ANSO 205
Ways of Knowing
ANSO 305
Social Theory
ANSO 402
Senior Seminar
(2) Elective Courses. Majors in Anthropology or Sociology must take five elective courses from the
course listings of their respective disciplines or from the joint ANSO listings. Two of the courses
chosen are normally at the 300 level or above. In close consultation with their departmental advisors,
Anthropology and Sociology
­ 55 ­
students may take some selected courses from other disciplines to fulfill major requirements in either
Anthropology or Sociology.
(3) Majors in each wing of the department are allowed to count up to two courses in the other wing to-
wards fulfillment of their major requirements.
STATISTICS AND DATA ANALYSIS
In addition to the nine total courses required for the major, it is recommended that Anthropology
and Sociology majors take Statistics 101 or a comparable course in statistics and data analysis.
AREA STUDIES CONCENTRATION
Students who wish to combine a major in Anthropology or Sociology with an Area Studies con-
centration are encouraged to do so. Courses taken to satisfy an Area Studies requirement may be
counted toward the major with prior approval of a student's departmental advisor. The only exception
to this rule is the Area Studies senior seminar, which cannot ordinarily be counted toward the An-
thropology or Sociology degree.
LANGUAGE STUDY, STUDY ABROAD, AND WINTER STUDY
Departmental advisors will help interested students integrate a major with study abroad, foreign
language study, or field research during the winter study period. The department encourages Williams
students to take advantage of established foreign study programs in Egypt, Japan, India, Hong Kong,
and other countries. Because some foreign study programs do not offer courses that can be counted
toward the Anthropology or Sociology degrees, however, sophomores planning to study abroad in
junior year must consult with the departmental advisor before declaring a major.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN ANTHROPOLOGY OR SOCIOLOGY
Honors and highest honors are normally awarded for the completion of a year-long research project
that has resulted in an original thesis of high quality. Students wishing to write an honors thesis should
engage a member of the department faculty as a Thesis Advisor as soon as possible and must submit a
proposal for the thesis for department approval no later than preregistration in the spring of the junior
year. If the proposal is approved, they will be permitted to register for Anthropology and Sociology
493-W031-494, during which they will write and defend a thesis. If their overall work in the major
continues to be of high quality and the thesis is deemed of a similar quality, they may be awarded
honors or highest honors in Anthropology or Sociology.
ANTHROPOLOGY / SOCIOLOGY COURSES
JOINT CORE COURSES
ANSO 205(S) Ways of Knowing
An exploration of how one makes sense of the social world. Some of the key questions of the course are:
What are the philosophical and epistemological underpinnings of social inquiry? How does one frame
intellectual problems and go about collecting, sifting, and assessing field materials? What are the uses
and limits of statistical data? What is the importance of history to sociological and anthropological re-
search? How can one use archival and other documentary materials to enrich ethnographic research?
What are the empirical limits to interpretation? What is the relationship between empirical data and the
generation of social theory? How does the social organization of social research affect one's inquiry?
What are the typical ethical dilemmas of fieldwork and of other kinds of social research? How do re-
searchers' personal biographies and values shape their work? We will approach these problems con-
cretely rather than abstractly through a series of case studies of how men and women in the world of
affairs, ranging from detectives, epidemiologists, and corporate lawyers, make sense of their worlds in
order to act responsibly. We will also draw upon the field experiences of departmental faculty in settings
as diverse as the jungles of Guatemala, the mountains of Sumbawa, Afghan refugee camps, Russian
kitchens, big city police departments and district attorney offices, corporate offices on Wall Street, and
criminal drug courts across America and the United Kingdom. There will also be some practical training
in basic field methods, census and survey interpretation, and archival research.
Requirements: a series of short papers and a final exam.
Prerequisites: Anthropology 101 or Sociology 101 or permission of instructor.Expected enrollment: 20.
Hour: 1:10-3:50 W SHEVCHENKO
ANSO 305(F) Social Theory
An introduction to social theory in anthropology and sociology, with strong emphasis on enduring
works by major thinkers--Marx, Weber, Durkheim, and Freud, among others--who have shaped views
of society in the West and beyond. Several key questions inform exploration of these works: What are
the historical roots and principal attributes of modernity? From the perspective of modernity, how do
social theorists understand "the primitive"? Do society and culture have organizing rules? What role
does human agency play in the unfolding of social life? What are the possibilities and limits of scientific
approaches to the study of human social experience? In considering such questions, we will reconstruct
the intellectual and social histories of both disciplines, examining in particular how they abandoned
Anthropology and Sociology
­ 56 ­
common ground and language, with sociologists gravitating toward paradigms of scientific predictabil-
ity and anthropologists toward relativistic frameworks of interpretation. Finally, we will examine the
migration of ideas from anthropology and sociology to other disciplines and back again. The course
emphasizes major differences between interpretive frameworks as well as common elements that con-
tribute to a deeper understanding of the social world.
Format: seminar. Requirements: three 5- to 7-page essays.
Prerequisites: Anthropology 101 or Sociology 101 and ANSO 205 or permission of instructor. Enroll-
ment limit: 25 (expected: 22).

ANSO 402(S) Senior Seminar (Same as Anthropology 402 and Sociology 402)
This capstone seminar combines intensive discussion and individual research. The first half of the se-
mester will be dedicated to the discussion of a social issue central to the concerns of both anthropology
and sociology. The class will meet with the instructor in fall 2004 to decide on that topic. Then, in the
second half of the semester, students will pursue independent, original projects and produce a major
term paper. Toward the end of the semester, students will present their projects to the seminar. Students
who are not senior majors in anthropology or sociology are admitted to this course only on the instruc-
tor's permission.
Format: seminar. Requirements: full participation, major research project and paper, class presentation.
Prerequisites: senior Anthropology and Sociology majors or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit:

Hour: 11:00-12:15 MWF FOIAS
ANTHROPOLOGY COURSES
ANTH 101(F,S) The Scope of Anthropology*
Is there such a thing as "human nature"? Why have human societies developed such a bewildering range
of customs to deal with problems common to people everywhere? This course addresses these questions
by introducing students to the comparative study of human social life and culture. Topics surveyed in the
course include economics, language and thought, kinship and marriage, law and politics, and the wide
variations in human belief systems, including religions. The course also considers the ways that an-
thropology, a discipline that was until recently practiced almost exclusively by Westerners, approaches
other societies in search of insights on our own customs and values. Ethnographic descriptions of both
"simple" tribal societies and complex modern ones are a prominent part of the readings.
Format: lecture/discussion of case studies and ethnographic films. Requirements: two short essays, a
final examination and class participation.
Enrollment limit: 30 (expected: 30). Preference given to first-year students and sophomores.

From the Opium Warlords of the Golden Triangle to headhunters in Borneo, from the royal courts of
Javanese Sultans to pedicab drivers, Southeast Asia presents a broad spectrum of peoples, cultures, and
polities. This course provides an introduction to the worlds of Southeast Asia by looking at the relation-
ships between people, society and the state. Thematically the course is organized around the ever-shift-
ing relationships between central authority--both colonial and indigenous--and tribal and peasant
communities in the hinterlands. Among other topics, we will examine the "theatre state" in nineteenth-
century Bali, the conversion of the Tagalog to Christianity, history as seen through the eyes of Ilongot
headhunters, and the nightmare of Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge.
Format: seminar. Requirements: take-home midterm and a research paper.

ANTH 214(F) (formerly ANSO 214) The Rise and Fall of Civilizations (Same as Environmental
Studies 224)*
Over the centuries, philosophers and historians have asked how societies evolved from simple hunter-
gatherer bands to complex urban civilizations? Human prehistory and history have shown the repeated
Anthropology and Sociology
­ 57 ­
cycles of the rise, expansion and collapse of early civilizations in both the Old and New World. What do
the similarities and differences in the development of these first civilizations tell us about the nature of
societal change, civilization and the state, and human society itself? The course will examine these is-
sues through an introductory survey of the earliest civilizations in Mesopotamia, Egypt, India, Mesoam-
erica and South America. Classical and modern theories on the nature, origin, and development of the
state will be reviewed in the light of the archaeological evidence.
Format: lecture/film/class discussion. Requirements: midterm, final exam, and short paper.

ANTH 219(F) The Art and Archaeology of Maya Civilization: A Marriage Made in Xibalba
(Same as ArtH 209)*
The ancient Maya civilization was one of the most sophisticated and complex cultures of prehispanic
Central America. Its complex calendrics, astronomy, mathematics and hieroglyphic writing system are
well known worldwide. The course will examine the trajectory and nature of ancient Maya civilization
from the combined perspectives of art history and archaeology. The evolution of the Maya state during
the Preclassic period (1000 B.C.-A.D. 250) will be evaluated by looking at the rich archaeological evi-
dence and at the Preclassic art styles. The Classic Maya civilization (A.D. 250-1000) will then be pre-
sented through a detailed survey of the archaeology and art of this period. Finally, the collapse of Classic
Maya civilization and its transformation and endurance during the Postclassic period and under Spanish
rule (A.D. 1000-1600) will be critically evaluated through a detailed review of the archaeological and
iconographic evidence.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: midterm and final exams, research paper.
No prerequisites, but an introductory Art History or Anthropology course highly recommended.

ANTH 225(S) Visible Culture*
Seeing comes before words, but words quickly exert their dominance, reducing the visible to a subset of
the written. This is as true in anthropology as in most other academic disciplines, in which the visual is
made significant insofar as it is transmitted in print. This course examines the potential of images (partic-
ularly when presented in the form of photographs, video and film) for revealing aspects of culture nor-
mally obscured by the written word and for transmitting different, sometimes undervalued insights and
knowledge of the social world. In the course of the semester, we will examine some of the ways in which
filmmakers have approached the task of documenting and understanding our own society and those of
other peoples. In addition, we will compare print and film representations of the same society to gauge
what is lost and gained through the use of different media, and we will evaluate the success of various
experiments using visual tools to represent cultural phenomena. In the course of the semester, we will
also consider differences between mainstream, independent, academic, and indigenous documentary
filmmakers.

ANTH 268T(S) Rethinking Cultural Relativism (W)
Since the early twentieth century, anthropologists have insisted that to understand alien cultures we must
suspend judgment about social practices that to us may seem absurd, repellent, or immoral. Increasingly,
however, cultural relativism has come under attack by political conservatives, who associate relativism
with moral decline, and by political progressives pushing universalistic ideas of human rights. This tuto-
Anthropology and Sociology

rial explores the past, present, and possible future of cultural relativism as a research methodology and a
point of view. After a review of the doctrine's history, we will assess its various facets and logical
puzzles, drawing on a mix of theoretical and ethnographic sources. Case studies will include infanticide,
male and female circumcision, and a range of less conspicuous practices that inhabit a gray area in West-
ern morality. Additional topics include the possible implications of evolutionary psychology's claim that
elements of human behavior are hard-wired into our genes, the challenges of negotiating moral consen-
sus in multicultural societies, and the arguments for and against the increasingly broad human-rights
protocols promoted by the United Nations and other international bodies.

ANTH 324(S) Empires of Antiquity
Cycles of rise and collapse of civilizations are common in our human past. Among the most fascinating
cases are those of empires, conquest civilizations, or states that encompass a number of different ethnici-
ties, politics and peoples. However, their rise and often rapid collapse begs an important question: how
stable have empires been in human prehistory? Are they intrinsically unstable political forms? The
course will address these questions by examining the major empires of the Old and New World in pre-
modern history; Akkadian; Babylonian; Persian; Assyrian; Mongol; Roman; Chinese; Ottoman; Aztec;
and Inca empires. Using readings by political scientists, historians, epigraphers, archaeologists and
political anthropologists, we will consider the cause of the expansion and collapse of these empires, their
sociopolitical and economic structures as mechanisms for their maintenance to provide a cross-cultural
comparison of the differential success and final decline of all these empires.

ANTH 328T(S) Emotions and the Self (W)*
Everyone everywhere experiences emotions, and everyone everywhere is faced with the task of con-
ceptualizing a self-hood and its place in the social world. This course analyzes a variety of recent at-
tempts in the social sciences to come to grips with topics that have long been avoided: the nature of the
interior experience and an epistemological framework for its cross-cultural comparison. Exploring the
borderlands between anthropology, sociology, and psychology, we will bring the tools of ethnographic
analysis to bear on central pan-human concepts: emotions and the self. By examining these phenomena
as they occur in other cultures, we will be better placed to apprehend and challenge the implicit (and
often unconsciously held) assumptions about emotions and the self in our own culture, both in daily life
and in academic psychological theory. What are emotions? Are they things--neuro-physiological
states--or ideas--sociocultural constructions? How are they to be described; compared? What is the
self? How are selves constructed and constituted? How do various cultures respond to categories of
emotion and self, and how can we develop a sense of the relationship between self and emotion?

ANTH 331(S) Witchcraft, Sorcery, and Magic*
Beliefs in magic, malign and otherwise, have been nearly universal in human experience. This course
examines these beliefs in an attempt to understand their cognitive basis, symbolic effectiveness, and so-
cial consequences. In particular we will approach the question of "magical thinking": is magical thought
"mistaken science" or a universal non-rational way of seeing the world? What does the fact of presum-
ably rational people holding apparently irrational beliefs say about the whole idea of rationality? Are
witches self-aware agents who believe in the malign magic they practice, or are they innocent, marginal-
ized victims of hegemonic powers? To answer these and other questions we will draw on case studies
from a broad range of ethnographic and historic sources, including Aguaruna love magic, Azande
oracles, Voodoo in Brooklyn, and witches in Renaissance Italy and twentieth-century England.

ANTH 342(F) Dispute and Conflict, Settlement and Resolution: The Anthropology of Law*
How does a society define the moral life and by what means does it resolve the internal conflicts that
inevitably arise? These questions are approached through a survey of the anthropology of law in the
broad sense, as concerned not just with codified laws and formal institutions, but with all forms of dis-
pute settlement and conflict resolution, including mediation and arbitration. Taking an ethnographic and
cross-cultural perspective, we will examine the cultural construction of dispute, the nature of evidence,
and the variety of processes by which disputes can be resolved. We will further examine the relationship
between the scale of a community and its legal mechanisms, with particular attention to plural legal sys-
tems and the tension between customary and national law in modernizing nations. Ultimately we will try
to come to grips with the question of justice: its definition and the means by which it may be achieved.

SOC 101(F,S) Invitation to Sociology
An introduction to sociological analysis. The course focuses on the relationship of individual men and
women to the social world and introduces students to systematic institutional analysis. Students will ex-
plore the intersection of biography, history, culture, and social structure as seen in the work of classical
and contemporary social thinkers, including Marx, Durkheim, Weber, Veblen, Simmel, and Goffman.
Special consideration will be given to the social and cultural problems of capitalism, rationality and irra-
tionality in modern institutions and organizations, the psychological dilemmas facing the individual in
modern society, and the problem of social order and conflict.

SOC 204(S) Social Movements
Social movements historically emerged as labor protests with direct material demands. Such collective
behavior was viewed as a form of mass deviance that threatened the status quo. During the second half
of the twentieth century, analyses acknowledged that movements are much more complex social organi-
zations that are deeply affected by the web of social arrangements in which they arise and toward which
they are often directed. Recent work on social movements, as such, takes into account the important role
of technology, media, meaning, culture, and identity. Rather than asking how rash mob mentality can be
contained, we ask how various social movements represent expressions of "identity" and efforts to attain
political power? How do organizational resources, political opportunities, and culture affect movement
"success"? What are the latent communicative functions of public protest around specific goals such as
barring the construction of a nuclear power facility or acquiring the legal right to marry among lesbians?
This course tracks both structural and cultural approaches to movement analysis using James Jasper's
Art of Moral Protest as well as several case studies; including Amy Binder's cultural analysis of afro-
centric versus creation science curricula and Naomi Klein's critique of the global garment industry.

SOC 208(F) Religion in Society
Early social theorists offered a variety of perspectives on the role of religion in modern social life. Anal-
yses ranged from an emphasis on religion's positive function in providing society with a source of cohe-
sive meaning and unity to more critical perspectives, which portrayed religion as an illusory source of
legitimacy for the existing social order. Building on this legacy, more recent sociological assessments
recognize both the function religion serves in sustaining social arrangements as well as its more mobiliz-
ing role in fostering radical social upheaval. This course will focus on the second part of this continuum,
that is, religion's dynamic role in inspiring social mobilization and social change. It begins with an anal-
ysis of the relationship between society and religion found in classic works on the Protestant Ethic and
the growth of American capitalism, and moves to more recent empirical analyses of changes among
immigrant religious communities in the United States. More active religious dynamism, while evident
in American examples such as domestic missionary movements and contemporary Christian Patriots,
has developed worldwide. Comparative cases of "radical religion" across the globe from Liberation
theology in Central America to the role of Islamic networks in the Iranian revolution require a new un-
derstanding of the assumed processes of secularization. The course ends with a consideration of religion
and violence as modes of destructive social change.

SOC 221(F) Social Change
Sociology as a discipline emerged amid the accelerating social changes that marked the modern era, and
can be interpreted as an effort, on the part of the Western intellectual community, to understand and ex-
plain this process. This course will explore a range of theories offered by sociologists in an effort to
comprehend social change in its various manifestations, from the rise of capitalism to secularization, and
from the French Revolution to the demise of socialism in Russia and Eastern Europe. It will address
agendas and visions implicated in sociological analyses of social change, and explore the patterns in
which the theories themselves change over time, with a particular emphasis on the rise and fall of such
key concepts as development and modernization, or progress and evolution. Topics include: develop-
ment of the nation-state and globalization, capitalism and modernity, revolutions and the public sphere,
social movements and collective identities, religion and secularization, long-term and short-term soci-
etal crises and the organization of everyday life in extraordinary times.

This course takes an historical view of photography and social thought by mapping various projects and
their critiques over the past century and a half. These include the photographic reflections of missionary
social hierarchies and Western morality in late nineteenth century global expansion; the photographic
utility in public policy, propaganda and social awareness from image muckrackers such as Jacob Riis
and Lewis Hine to the Farm Security Administration; and the representation of the "other" through the
photojournalism of National Geographic. Beyond ideological influences and cultural bias in image
composition the course examines the ongoing technological developments that affect image manipula-
tion and our presumption of authentic representation. Finally, social documentation and analysis within
sociology is primarily text-based. However, research utilizing photography and video is making signifi-
cant contributions to our empirical and theoretical understanding of the social world. Using an historical
lens of the role and use of photography for social representation, the course will critically survey a wide
sample of contemporary image-based social scientific research projects.

SOC 313(S) Food, Taste, and the Sociology of Production
A classic gastronomical challenge taunts, "Tell me what you eat and I'll tell you who you are." This
implies that food is an indicative medium of local, ethnic, religious, and perhaps most tellingly, class
cultures. This course reexamines these issues and extends the stated challenge to various social arenas
such as immigration, globalization, mass production, and niche marketing. If, in common parlance, we
are what we eat, then what might we learn about a society in which a fish caught in Japan is served the
same evening in New York? What might we learn about the migration and transformation of food cul-
ture by ordering Thai delivery in Massachusetts? Beyond the global patterns of taste, availability, and
modes of consumption, we must additionally ask questions about production. For example, telling us
who we are if we eat fast food hamburgers includes a full account of cattle ranching, feedlots, corporate
meatpacking conglomerates, sanitation, and mass marketing of brands. Finally, the course explores the
gendered patterns that food production and consumption transmit and reproduce.

How do lifestyles, fashions and trends appear and evolve? Are we authors of our own taste? What struc-
tures our choices of goods and activities? What is it that gives meaning to objects and makes them desir-
able? Are there non-consumer societies in the modern world? How has globalization changed the ways
people consume in different parts of the globe? This course will explore the consumption and consumer
practices as products of modernity and will analyze the political, cultural and social agendas that have
transformed consumption over time. Politics of consumption (the way in which seemingly free and in-
dependent consumption choices aggregate into the existing system of global capitalism) will be treated
alongside its symbolic element: the role of consumer practices in creating and articulating identities,
building relationships and creating solidarities. It will look at money, fashion, advertising, arts, tourism,
and shopping in places as varied as nineteenth-century France, socialist Russia, postsocialist Hungary
and in contemporary United States, tracing both the mechanisms that structure patterns of consumption,
and the implications that these patterns have for the larger social order.

and politics of the time, and evolves under an array of influences. This course analyzes discourses of
collective and individual identity and the mechanism involved in the formulation of the individual's
sense of his or her place in the world. Topics include: nations and nationalism, representations of indi-
vidual and collective pasts, collective memory and practices of remembrance, nostalgia and selective
forgetting, narratives of childhood and a "golden age," the invention of tradition, museums and memo-
rials, biography and memoirs, narratives of progression, and the making of national and family histories.

Appalachia, an oil spill in Alaska, a civil war in what was once Yugoslavia; and chronic disasters like the
effects of colonialism on native culture, life in the inner city, and so on.

Parallel courses
Any four additional Art Studio or Art History courses. At least one elective must be taken in each
wing of the department. At least one of the electives must be an Art History course concerned
with a period of Western or non-Western art prior to 1800.
Art History Route: The history of art is different from other historical disciplines in that it is founded
on direct visual confrontation with objects that are both concretely present and yet documents of the
past. We emphasize analysis of images, objects, and built environments as the basis for critical
thought and visual literacy. In addition to formal and iconographic analysis, we use the work of
other disciplines to understand visual images, such as social history, perceptual psychology, engi-
neering, psychoanalysis, cultural studies, and archaeology. Because of its concentration on visual
experience, the Art History major increases one's ability to observe and to use those observations as
analytical tools for understanding history and culture.

ArtH 101-102 introduces students to a series of critical studies of important works selected from the
history of Western art from antiquity to the present. The critical approach of the introductory course is
maintained in all further courses, especially by assigned study of original works in the Williams Col-
lege Museum of Art, Chapin Library, the Clark Art Institute, and Mass MoCA.
An introductory studio course, ArtS 100, in which no artistic talent or prior experience are as-
sumed, provides vital training in what is a visual as well as a verbal discipline. The requirement of a
course in non-Western art expands majors' geographic as well as cultural horizons, and the require-
ment of two courses in art from periods prior to 1800 provides a necessary concentration on earlier
moments in culture. (As the contemporary architect, Philip Johnson, said, "You cannot not know his-
tory.") The junior course (ArtH 301) develops awareness of the theoretical implications, as well as the
possibilities and limitations of different art-historical methods. The requirement of a seminar or grad-
uate course in the senior year enables students to apply that knowledge of methodology to their most
specialized work in the Art History route.
Art Studio Route: The studio division of the Art major has been structured to foster the development of a
critical understanding of making art; to support creative interests and to develop students' perceptions and
imaginations as they investigate a variety of visual media. Drawing I, ArtS 100 serves as an introduc-
tion to the basic drawing and design principles which establish the foundation for the development of
visual expression. ArtH 101-102, an introduction to the history of Western art, provides part of the neces-
sary background in the critical analysis of art. The 200-level ArtS courses provide opportunities to learn the
elements of some of the principal visual arts media: architecture, painting, photography, printmaking,
sculpture, and video. These courses combine technical foundations in the medium with analysis of the
interrelation of visual form and content. The 300- and 400-level courses place a greater emphasis on the
application of appropriate visual skills and strategies to particular thematic concerns, and to the develop-
ment of the student's individual vision. All studio art seniors exhibit their work in the Williams College
Museum of Art as a part of the requirements for the major.
History and Practice Route: This route allows students to study in depth both the history of art and the
making of it. It offers considerable flexibility: students may propose courses of study that emphasize partic-
ular media, themes or methodological issues. To mention just three examples, students may design se-
quences of courses that focus on architecture, gender or narration in both the history of art and contempo-
rary practice. And students may take more courses in one wing of the department than the other, as long as
the minimum requirements in each wing are satisfied. The History and Practice route is especially well-
suited to students interested in arts-related careers outside of higher education, including work in art galler-
ies, art museums, and primary or secondary school education.
Unlike the history or studio routes, acceptance into the History and Practice route is not automatic. The
student must first submit a written application in two copies, one for each advisor from the two wings of the
department, as well as a list of proposed courses; this application must be approved by the art department.
The application must provide a narrative statement of the theme of the major, and why it cannot be accom-
modated in either history or studio. It is not enough to submit a list of courses; the student needs to show the
coherence and integrity of the plan of study, and how it develops the theme of the proposed major.
Some students will be attracted to both wings of the department but will not have a field of study that falls
between the two. In these cases, it is better for the student to choose between history and studio--taking
additional courses from the other wing as desired. In short, the History and Practice route is reserved for
students with a strong record of achievement who cannot be accommodated in the two wings of the depart-
ment.
History and Practice majors do not participate in the senior studio exhibition at the end of the year.
History and Practice Faculty Advisors: Michael Glier, Ann McCallum, and Ben Benedict in stu-
dio; E. J. Johnson, Peter Low and Michael Lewis in history.
COURSE NUMBERS
First Digit
The introductory courses in both Art History and Studio have 100-level numbers and are prerequisites
for most other courses in the department. The distinction between 200- and 300-level offerings is ei-
ther one of difficulty or of the sequence in which material is best taken. Also, lecture courses with no
prerequisite have a 100- or 200-level number. The 400-level seminars and tutorials are intended for
advanced students, usually senior majors.
Middle Digit
Art Studio (ArtS)
Middle digit distinguishes introductory and general courses from those specialized in different media and
arts. 0 = introductory; 1 = general; 2 = architecture; 3 = drawing; 4 = painting; 5 = photography; 6 = print-
making; 7 = sculpture; 8 = video; 9 = independents, honors.

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN ART
Students who wish to become candidates for the degree with honors must show prior evidence of
superior performance in the major as well as research capabilities to carry out the proposed project.
Art History:
In order for a project to be considered, the candidate (1) must have arranged for an advisor, and (in
consultation with the advisor) a second reader to supervise and evaluate the project (2) should normal-
ly have had one course with the advisor. In addition, the topic must be within the advisor's areas of
competence and should normally be related to course work which the student has done previously. In
the case of an interdisciplinary proposal, the second reader should normally come from the other dis-
cipline.
The student submits a 2-page proposal including a statement about the preparation for the project, a
description of the topic and a general bibliography. Following approval by the faculty advisor and
second reader, this proposal is reviewed by the entire Art faculty, who have the option to request revi-
sions and to refuse the proposal. Students should keep in mind that a thesis in Art History is not neces-
sary for admission to graduate study.
It is the responsibility of the candidate to select one of the following routes and to meet all dead-
lines. Students who are not making satisfactory progress on their research and writing will not be al-
lowed to continue with the thesis. The completion of the requirements, however, will not guarantee a
degree with honors. The degree with honors will be awarded for projects demonstrating a high degree
of scholarly achievement and self-motivation. All proposals must be submitted according to the
guidelines set out below. The timetable for submission of work, including specific dates, is available
in the Art Department office.
Students may select one of the following options:
1) Full-Year Thesis: Research and writing will be carried out during both semesters and WSP of the
senior year (students should register for ArtH 493-W031-494). The thesis topic, advisor and sec-
ond reader must be determined by April 15 of junior year. Students who are on overseas programs
junior year are advised to make arrangements prior to their departure, but they may submit a final
proposal two weeks before the fall semester of senior year if they have made the necessary ar-
rangements. After the thesis is submitted, the candidate for honors shall present an oral defense
before faculty and peers.
2) Half-Year Thesis: Research and writing will be carried out during fall term and winter study or dur-
ing winter study and spring term (Students should register for ArtH 493-W031 or W031-ArtH
494). For students who choose to complete the mini-thesis in the fall, proposals must be submitted
by April 15 of the junior year. For those planning to complete the mini-thesis in the spring, propos-
als must be submitted by November 1.
A student's project is judged by two members of the department, the advisor and second reader; in
the case of an interdisciplinary project, a member of the Art Department and a member of the other
relevant department or program function as advisor and second reader. In rare cases, a third reader
may be appointed by the department at the request of the advisor or second reader.
All routes require that one course and one WSP, in addition to the ten required courses for the major,
be dedicated to the honors project.
Art Studio:
Studio art concentrators who wish to be candidates for honors are required to add a 200-level
course, and to take the 400 level senior tutorial. An additional 300 level tutorial or 200 level course
must be added for a total of twelve courses.
Honors candidates enrolled in the senior tutorial must "evidence" prior experience in the media
chosen for the honors work. This "evidence" may consist of one or more 200-level courses in the me-
dium, course work at the 300 level and/or a slide portfolio demonstrating the student's proficiency in
the media chosen for the honors project. This work is presented to the senior tutorial instructor at the
start of the spring semester.
At the end of the spring semester of the senior year, the honors candidate will orally defend his/her
work in the senior exhibition at WCMA. The entire studio faculty will attend the defense. Based on
the work and the oral defense, the studio faculty (as a whole) will designate honors, high honors or no
honors.
History and Practice:
The route to honors is a combination of the Art Studio and Art History honors routes. At the begin-
ning of senior year, a candidate for honors in History and Practice makes a proposal to two faculty
members, one faculty advisor from each wing of the department. If both advisors agree to supervise
the project, the candidate enrolls in independent study and works through the fall semester and winter
study. The progress of the project is assessed by both advisors at the end of winter study; if the project
is not well enough developed, the advisors may end it at that time. If the project is allowed to move
forward, the student enrolls either in ArtS 418T Senior Tutorial, if the project is primarily a matter of
Art
­ 65 ­
making art, or in an Honors Independent Study, if it is primarily a writing project. The final project is
submitted to the two advisors, who will determine whether or not it will receive honors.
ART HISTORY COURSES

ARTH 201(F) American Landscape History (Same as Environmental Studies 201)
This is a survey course stressing the description and historical geography of regional, vernacular Ameri-
can settings, with the goal of discerning a national style of spatial or landscape organization. Among the
human-altered environments to be studied are: forestlands, rangelands, croplands, outdoor recreational
sites, mines and quarries; small towns, milltowns, central business districts, and suburbs; power and uti-
lities; housing, industry, commerce, and institutional uses such as the American college campus; water,
road, and rail corridors as examples of circulation nets. Primary evidence will be visual.
One afternoon meeting each week provides discussion and field- or site-visit opportunities, and enables
classmembers to obtain a first-hand familiarity with a rural-urban gradient of representative land uses
and occupants of the Hoosic-Hudson watershed and Taconic upland region surrounding Williamstown,
as well as experience with interviewing and field study methodologies.
Requirements: several mini-tests, four term paper installments on the documentation of an evolving
landscape site or behavior, short class presentation on research, as its "landscape" or type comes up for

ARTH 205(F) History of Photography
Although based on a set of distinct technical processes, since its disclosure to the world in 1839, photog-
raphy has remained a contested field of study. In this introduction to the history of photography from its
earliest manifestations until the present, we will consider what makes photography's history disputed by
exploring the different and at times conflicting contexts in which photographers have lived and worked
and in which their images have been used and have come to acquire meaning. These include, among
others, the art world, science, entertainment, the print media, advertising, portraiture, and the govern-
ment. The aim of this course is not to be comprehensive but rather to facilitate a broad, chronological
understanding of the major movements and ideas, the influential practitioners and critics, and the impor-
tant social, intellectual, and technological developments that have impacted the production and recep-
tion of photography both within its historical moment and today.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: class discussion, a midterm, a final, and two short papers.

ARTH 207(F) Art and Modern Life in the United States, 1865 to 1962
This course will survey American art between the end of the Civil War and the appearance of Pop Art.
How did this art relate to historical processes of modernization (industrialization, urbanization, the rise
of mass media and mass markets, etc.) and to the economic polarization, social fragmentation, political
conflict, and myriad cultural changes these developments entailed. In other words, what was modern art
in the United States? Thomas Eakins, Mary Cassatt, Marcel Duchamp, Georgia O'Keeffe, Jackson Pol-
lock, and Andy Warhol are among the artists to be discussed.
Format: seminar. Course requirements include informed participation in class discussion (20%), two
short paper assignments (40%), midterm exam (20%), and final exam (20%).
Prerequisites: ArtH 101-102. Enrollment limit: 20 (expected: 15). Preference to Art majors.

(See under Anthropology for full description.)
ARTH 213(F) Greek Art and Myth (Same as Classics 213)
At no other time in the history of art is myth represented with as much immediacy and sophistication as
in Greek art. In this course, we will become familiar with the representation of the figures and the stories
of the gods, goddesses, heroes, and heroines in painting and sculpture of the seventh through first centu-
ries B.C. Of special interest will be: the various techniques developed by Greek artists for representing
narratives visually; the historical, social, and conceptual issues that underlie mythology, such as war,
marriage, sacrifice, and the nature of men, women, and the gods; and the various modern approaches to
the interpretation of Greek myths, including the myth-and-ritual school, psychoanalysis, and structural-
ism. Reading will include selections from ancient authors in translation, such as Homer, Hesiod, Pindar,
Aischylos, Sophocles, and Euripides, as well as from modern scholarship on Greek art, myth, and narra-
tive.
Format: lecture, illustrated with slides. Requirements: two short papers, midterm, and a final exam.

ARTH 220(F) The Mosque*
The mosque (masjid) is the site of communal prayer rituals and other activities of Islam. By definition, it
must simply be a clean space oriented towards Mecca. In actuality, mosques have taken diverse architec-
tural forms ranging from simple hypostyle halls of mud-brick to elaborate complexes of reinforced con-
crete and plate glass. This course will address the stylistic and regional differences from the seventh to
twentieth century, including the columned halls of the central Arab lands, the centralized domed struc-
tures such as monumental calligraphy, glazed tilework and stucco. The course will culminate in a con-
sideration of modern mosque architecture in which tradition and modernism combine to generate new
forms of sacred space.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: paper, midterm, and final exams. Enrollment limit: 40.

ARTH 223(F) Early Medieval Art and Architecture
A survey of the major works of architecture, sculpture, book illumination, monumental mural decora-
tion (mosaic and fresco) and the minor arts (ivory carving, metalwork, etc.) produced from Dura Euro-
pos to Toledo and from the Fayum to the Isle of Iona between approximately 200 and 1050. Lectures
will focus on questions of style, content, function, patronage and audience in an attempt to convey not
only the remarkable diversity and inventiveness of early medieval artistic practice, but also the central
role that buildings, images and fashioned objects played in articulating and even shaping early medieval
life. Aiming to situate these works within their larger social, political, devotional, intellectual as well as
art-historical contexts, the course also hopes to demonstrate the unique power of the visual arts to pro-
vide access into an emerging European world whose values and concerns were radically different from,
and yet fundamental to, those of the modern West.
Requirements: midterm, final exam, three to four short papers.
No prerequisites.

ARTH 247(F) Flemish Art: Bruegel to Rubens
The most admired art in northern Europe during the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries was pro-
duced in Antwerp (in present day Belgium). This city was home to the best known Flemish artists, such
as Pieter Bruegel and his son Jan, Rubens and Van Dyck. In studying their art in this lecture course, we
will also examine their studio practices, especially the collaboration of artists on a single work, their
different narrative approaches, and their religious, political, and social messages conveyed by their
works. We will also discuss official and popular religious practices and the images produced for different
locations, including pilgrimage sites associated with miracle-working images. Evaluation based on mid-
term, 5-page paper, and final (with a prepared essay). Prerequisites: ArtH 101-102.

ics include changing definitions of neoclassicism and romanticism, the impact of the revolutions of
1789, 1830, and 1848, the Napoleonic presence abroad, the shift from history painting to scenes of ev-
eryday life, landscape painting as an autonomous art form and attitudes toward race and sexuality. The
course stresses French artists such as Greuze, Vigée-Lebrun, David, Ingres, Delacroix, Géricault, Corot,

leon III; changing attitudes toward city and country in Impressionist and Symbolist art; the gendering of
public spaces, and the prominent place of women in representations of modern life. The course address-
es vanguard movements such as Impressionism and Post-Impressionism and the styles of individual
artists associated with them, as well as the work of academic painters.

ARTH 302(S) "Specimens of Higher Art": The Strategies and Politics of Collecting
In the 1860-61 Williams Quarterly, the students called for the donation of "specimens of higher art" for
the college's collection in order to enhance their study of art. Using the Williams College Museum of Art
as a case study, this course will look at the phenomenon of collecting, the rise of art museums and their
permanent collections, the controversies surrounding the care and display of non-European art and arti-
facts in American museums, the shifts in philosophical approaches to collecting. We will examine how
its collection evolved; who was responsible; what circumstances encouraged its growth; what are its
strengths, especially in terms of the museum's teaching mission; what directions will it take in the fu-
ture? Lectures, readings, class presentations will explore the history and role of collecting. Direct contact
with galleries and auction houses in New York and elsewhere will be featured. This course will provide
undergraduates with the opportunity to test their research and persuasion skills as they participate in
"mock" Acquisitions meetings.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class participation, oral presentations, and two short re-
search papers (10 pages each).
Prerequisites: ArtH 101-102 or permission of the instructors. Enrollment limit: 12 (expected: 10). Pref-

countryside elements as the small town, tourism, the farm and ranch, woodland and wildland--in a con-
text of private and public ownership, modernization and technological change, scale, density, sentiment,
and the concepts of amenity and environmental quality. Comparisons will be made between American,
Canadian, and British practice. The ideas developed will be tested against specific case studies.

stock. This inquiry will explore such questions as: What has been the role of the civil engineer in Ameri-
can transport? What are the impacts of transport upon land use? How does one transport mode come to
be supplanted by another mode? What perceptual experiences has each mode engendered? How and
when does mobility become recreational or touristic?

ARTH 306(S) Photojournalism/Personal Journalism
This class will investigate the relationship between these two categories of photography through a con-
sideration of the specific set of social and historical conditions and debates under which photojournalism
and personal journalism have been produced and received, the varying contexts in which these types of
images have circulated, as well as those more elusive feelings, attitudes, and values that have influenced
the manner in which such pictures have come to acquire meaning. We will follow this investigation with
a consideration of the usefulness of these categories to studies of contemporary photography. Other
questions that we will address include the role of the photographer as "authentic witness," the use of
photography as a "weapon," the relationship between "art" and "news" photography, and the role of
subjectivity in reportage. Requirements: class discussion, responses to readings, class presentation, and
two short papers that will be developed into a final research paper.

ARTH 312(S) Distant Encounters: Art, Pilgrimage, and Crusade in the Middle Ages
This lecture course investigates the rich artistic consequences--in architecture, manuscript illumination,
mosaic, sculpture, panel painting, fresco, metalwork, and other minor arts--of European contact with
the Eastern Mediterranean between approximately 300 and 1450 AD. From the beginnings of Christian-
ity, pilgrims from Europe made the long journey to sacred sites in the Holy Land (extending across parts
of present-day Egypt, Israel, Syria, and Turkey). When these sites became less accessible with the
spread of Islam in the seventh century, Europeans sought to recreate the sites at home. Later, from 1095
onward, Christian Europeans attempted to reclaim and hold the Holy Land from non-Christians by
force, through an ill-fated series of five major and several lesser "crusades." Over the centuries, before,
during, and after the Crusades, exposure to the peoples, ideas, and cultures of the Eastern Mediterranean
also came through trade and through the travel and settlement of non-Europeans in Europe itself, partic-
ularly in Spain, Sicily, and Venice. The course, in addition to surveying artistic production within each of
these different contexts of East-West encounter, is designed to coincide with an exhibition of Crusader
art and objects at the Williams College Museum of Art entitled "The Book of Kings: Art, War, and the
Morgan Library's Medieval Picture Book." Students will thus have the opportunity to work within a
museum as well as a classroom setting.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: two to three short papers, midterm, and final exam.
No prerequisite, but previous coursework in medieval art helpful (ArtH 101-102, 223, or 224). Enroll-

ARTH 351(F) Topics in Contemporary Art: The 1980s
This course focuses on the art and visual culture of the 1980s, a period of significant transformation in
the field of contemporary art. We will critically examine major developments in the practice and theory
of the visual arts during the period by focusing on social and aesthetic context. As the Cold War came to
an end, the art market boomed and certain artists were granted celebrity status, meanwhile the Culture
Wars loomed, generating controversial debates concerning censorship and public funding for the arts.
Course readings and discussions will also consider the impact of multiculturalism on the visual arts and
media, the burgeoning power of the globalized biennials, and the accompanying increase in critical liter-
ature attentive to the function of museums. Postmodern theories on appropriation, pastiche, irony, simu-
lation, and performativity will be examined in depth and explored through case studies on select artists
and through the medium of music video.
Format: seminar. Requirement: two short papers, final research paper, and class presentation.

ARTH 363(F) The Holocaust Visualized
This seminar will examine how memories of the Holocaust have been conveyed through visual means
and consider what historical, cultural and political circumstances have caused various nations to remem-
ber the Holocaust differently. We will discuss the issues prompted by public memorials, exhibitions and,
as one writer puts it, the "museumification" of concentration camps. How should we define the Holo-
caust? Whose memory should take precedence? What is lost or gained by the inclusion of texts with
images? How might memory be misrepresented by the exhibition of visual materials such as video testi-
mony, photographs and artifacts? In addition, we will study art about the Holocaust, including Art Spie-
gelman's non-comic "comic book" Maus and non-fiction films such as Night and Fog, Shoah and
Schindler's List, to ask whether constructed or simulated images can convey the experience of the Holo-
caust as well as documentary ones.
Requirements: active participation in class discussion and regular participation in a class listserver dis-
cussion group, trip to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, one oral presenta-
tion, and one research paper; no exams.

ARTH 402(S) Monument/Antimonument: The Art of Memorial
The urge to commemorate individuals, heroic acts, historic events whether unspeakable or splendid is
both human and timeless. This seminar will document and explore the concept of what is monumental,
as well the nature of commemorative monuments, from the ancient Mediterranean (Egypt; Mycenae;
Greece of the Archaic, Classical, and Hellenistic Periods; Imperial Rome) and their influence on
monuments in later history, especially those of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The current trend
towards countermonuments, or anti-monuments, such as Maya Lin's Vietnam Veterans Memorial or the
Gerzes' vanishing Monument Against Fascism, War and Violence and For Peace and Human Rights in
Hamburg/Harburg will be discussed in light of the monumental tradition of combining word, image, and
architecture to create memorials that will endure in both spatial and temporal terms. The current
discussion of Holocaust memorials and the problems inherent in the design of a monument for the WTC
will also be addressed. Students will be asked to design a commemorative project for the final class
meeting.
Requirements: participation; presentations and term paper; short design project.

ARTH 448(S) Art about Art: 1400-2000 (W)
This thematic seminar will focus on depictions through which artists referred to their own profession and
its products. Images to be discussed include legends of the origin of art, self-portraits and other portraits
of artists, scenes of contemporary and historical artists in their studios, as well as finished art on display.
While tracking the major changes in imagery from the end of the Middle Ages through the twentieth
century (with some reference to earlier developments) we will analyze specific images, comparing their
implications with both the social conditions and the theoretical positions then current.
Requirements: a 2-page paper, two 12-page papers, and a class presentation.
Prerequisites: ArtH 101-102 or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 15. This course may be taken

ARTH 451(F) Ideal Bodies: The Modern Nude and Its Dilemmas
The nineteenth century is so dominated by the female nude that the very term "nude" has come to stand
for the female body. And yet, the history of the nude during this period is not devoid of male bodies.
How did the female body come to so dominate representations of the nude? And how did the increasing
challenge to the ideal (i.e., Realism, photography, Impressionism) affect the credibility of the nude? Re-
quired readings include Kenneth Clark's classic study The Nude: A Study in Ideal Form (1956) and
Lynda Nead's The Female Nude: Art, Obscenity and Sexuality (1992), with special attention to texts
which show how the nude and the discourse of the ideal function to obscure social issues. We will ex-
plore the ways in which certain types of bodies have been defined in opposition to the ideal, and thereby
exoticized or marginalized. Our prime focus is the work of David, Ingres, Géricault, Courbet, Manet,
and Renoir but more popular nineteenth-century images as well as selected works by artists working
today will also be discussed.
Evaluation will be based on biweekly 1-page papers, short reports, an oral presentation and a 10- to
20-page paper.
Prerequisites: ArtH 101-102. Enrollment limited to 12. Preference given to senior Art majors, Women's

ARTH 472(S) Forbidden Images?*
Islam forbids the depiction of the human figure, right? Wrong. There is actually a long and rich tradition
of figural imagery, particularly in Iran, Afghanistan and India. Many of those images occur in the con-
text of Persian manuscripts, but the introduction of photography generated new possibilities and contro-
versies. This seminar, designed to complement two important exhibitions at WCMA, will explore the
history of Muslim image making and related questions about representation, iconoclasm, and power in
the Islamic world.
Format: seminar. Requirements: students will have access to original materials and they will be expected

ART STUDIO COURSES
ARTS 100(F,S) Drawing I
The process of drawing develops a heightened awareness of the visual world. Your subjective experi-
ences and your objective experiences combine to form a larger perceptual understanding of the environ-
ment in which you live. Drawing allows you an alternative use of these processes and provides a format
for stating what you know about the world. Drawing is an excellent means for improving your skills in
observing, seeing distinctions, and creating new meanings from your perceptions. This is an introducto-
ry course which will investigate the properties of making an image on the two-dimensional page. While
drawing is an essential basis for much of the artmaking process, its use is not limited to artists. Design,
illustration, engineering, and science are among the many fields which incorporate drawing.

ARTS 206(S) Feminist Art Practices (Same as Women's and Gender Studies 206)
Since the 1960s, feminism and visual culture have had a long and complex history together. This class
will look at how multicultural feminists have wrestled with their political and social concerns through
artmaking, and will consider effects of the exposure that comes from exhibiting or performing. Al-
though many important visual pieces cover a broad spectrum of formats, materials, and media, we will
focus on painting, sculpture and sculptural installations, print, performance, photography, and some
public art projects. We will consider broad fundamental questions about art, politics and the artists'
goals. Some of the important questions we will grapple with during the course may include: how is the
female body represented and treated, and how do we read these? how do feminists aim to use self-repre-
sentations to affect social change? how do visuals add to discussion and verbal/written arguments about
women's capacities and power? how might "difference" be portrayed to grapple with stereotyping? how
is freedom imagined by different groupings of women? Artists we may investigate include Joyce Scott,
Yong Soon Min, Kara Walker, Lorraine O'Grady, Adrian Piper, Shirin Neshat, Renee Cox, Amalia
Mesa-Bains, Mona Hatoum, Jaune Quick-to-See Smith, Catherine Opie, Deborah Kass, as well as the
first generation Womanhouse feminist artists.
This will be a reading, viewing, discussion, and studio art course. Assuming a modest visual back-
ground, visual projects will be designed initially as responses to the work of an artist we are studying.
Towards the end of the term, students will design their own projects concerning overarching feminist
issues. Readings: Talking Visions: Multicultural Feminism in a Transnational Age, Ed. Ella Shohat
(New Museum and MIT Press: 1998); and a reading packet.
Requirements: readings, online image study, discussion and response papers; required attendance at a
PhotoShop workshop designed for the class; several hands-on art projects in materials of student's
choice; one final project which can be either written or visual.
Prerequisites: none, although preference given to those who have had Women's and Gender Studies
101, ArtS 100, or ArtH 101-102.
This Course is part of the Critical Reasoning and Analytical Skills initiative.

ARTS 230(S) Drawing II
This drawing course will continue to investigate the techniques, principles of organization, and ideas
which were introduced in the Drawing I course. Having become more familiar with the drawing pro-
cess, students will be encouraged, through selected problems, to expand and challenge the conventions
of markmaking. As with any discipline, familiarity with the rules allows the users to seek alternatives
and develop definitions of how the drawing process can best be suited to their own visual vocabulary.
The range of exercises could include traditional materials on paper as well as combinations of materials
more commonly associated with non-art disciplines, i.e., computers, industrial materials, literature, etc.
Evaluation will be based on evidence of each student's progress, as shown in a portfolio of drawings
made in class and as homework. Attendance and participation in class discussions are also considered as
part of the course evaluation. Lab fee.

ARTS 255(F) Photographic Time and Space
An introduction to the practice of photography with an emphasis on the vision that is unique to the
camera: the particular manner in which three-dimensional reality is rendered on the two dimensional,
light-sensitive plane. The course will concentrate on the study and creation of imagery which is
dependent on the specificity of photographic vision. Students will receive instruction on the workings of
a 4x5 view camera, of a 35mm camera (both provided by the department), development of black and
white film and basic printing technique. Students will be asked to respond to a series of assignments. A
substantial amount of lab time, in addition to the class meetings, is necessary to complete these
assignments. Students' works are evaluated individually and in class critiques throughout the semester.
Evaluation will be based on the level of formal and technical competence of the portfolio as well as the
conceptual strength and sophistication of the work completed. Lab fee.
Prerequisites: ArtS 100. Enrollment limit: 15. Preference given to Art majors who have not completed

ARTS 256(S) Fabricated and Manipulated Photography
Based on the assumption that photography, not unlike painting, is merely a tool for the artist to incorpo-
rate in practice. This is an introduction to the expressive qualities of the medium. Shooting will be pre-
conceived and accidents facilitated by the alchemy inherent in the basic properties of chemical photog-
raphy. Students will use a digital camera (provided by the department), learn to develop b/w film and the
basis of b/w printing technique. Students will be asked to respond to a series of both analogue and digital
assignments. Asubstantial amount of lab time, in addition to the class meetings, is necessary to complete
these assignments. Students' works are evaluated individually and in class critiques throughout the se-
mester.

ARTS 281(F) Sound and Site
"A sound is the material and form of its source manifested in vibration," writes sound artist Justin Ben-
nett. Because sound is created from the physical vibration of things, it has a special relationship to place.
This course examines work by sound, film and video artists who interrogate the way sound reveals and
transforms a site. Readings from Michel Chion, Kaja Silverman, Roland Barthes, Friedrich Kittler, and
others on theories of sound and cinema, audio recording, sound art, and acoustic perception, will form a
basis for class discussion, along with explorations of work by artists. Students will create audio and vid-
eo sketches that engage with the themes of the course.
Evaluation will be based on the quality of work produced and engagement in class discussions and cri-
tiques.

ARTS 313T(S) Art of the Public
"New genre public art [is] visual art that uses both traditional and nontraditional media to communicate
and interact with a broad and diversified audience about issues directly relevant to their lives [and] is
based on engagement." So writes Suzanne Lacy, a long-time practitioner of such work. Engagement
with members of the public is the premise on which this public art tutorial is founded. The hands-on
work of the class will consist in exploring issues directly relevant to our context and the lives of those
around us. Students do three projects--one on Place, one on Memory, and one on Community Con-
cerns; each student does individual projects discussed in the tutorial groups. Artwork of like concerns,
accompanied by readings, will preface the projects.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: readings plus directing one discussion on readings, exercises, three pro-
jects, and full critical participation in discussion of colleagues' work.
Prerequisites: any 100-level course in ArtS or ArtH, and any 200-level course in the Art Department,

ARTS 364T(F) Artists' Books
This coursewillinvestigatethe processes and ideas associated with the making of artists' books, works
that are fine art objects primarily using visual images and/or text. For example, individual projects could
include literary text/visual image combinations, visual diaries, three-dimensional pop-up books, solely
visual narratives, autobiographies, animated "flip" books, or sculptural books. Limited-editioned as well
as one-of-a-kind work will be encouraged. Media options include etching, lithography, relief printing,
hand painting, drawing, some photo processes and bookbinding techniques (from boxes to hard bind-
ing). As a tutorial, this course is designed to meet individual needs, stress student participation and re-
sponsibility for learning, and to examine differing points of view. Students will meet in groups of two for
discussion and critique of individual projects in the tutorial format: i.e., students are expected to give a
half hour presentation weekly regarding their projects and selected readings, and to respond to criticism
and questions by the peer student and the instructor. Students will also meet once a week as a group for
demonstrations, slide presentations, meetings with visiting artists, and discussion of readings.
Evaluation will be based on student participation and conceptual and technical quality of the work.

ARTS 371T(S) Addressing Identity--The Non-Traditional Figure
Images of the human form have long been used to describe, classify, and give context to the human
experience. This tutorial is designed as a way of exploring how non-traditional uses of the figure can
describe our contemporary and personal experiences. Designed for students who have completed a
200-level introductory course, this class will be an opportunity to further explore, through a variety of
media, how the figure can be used to create resonate art. Contemporary artists who work in various
media such as: Lucien Freud, Cindy Sherman, Tracy Moffat, Charles Ray, Jenny Saville, Antonio
Gormley, and Juan Munoz will be used to illustrate particular aspects of identity as it relates to the figure.
This course is structured so that the professor meets with each tutorial pair once a week for one hour.
During this weekly meeting art projects are discussed and critiqued, and presentations are given. This
course will also include several sessions where the entire class meets to accommodate slide
presentations, field trips, critiques, and exhibitions.
Evaluation will be based on the quality of work produced, the depth and quality of the investigative
process, as well as participation and attendance.
Prerequisites: ArtS 100 plus any one of the 200-level courses. Enrollment limit: 10. Preference given to

ARTS 380T(S) Between Art and Cinema
This tutorial will engage visual, kinesthetic, and narrative issues that emerge from new hybrid forms of
contemporary art and cinema. Students will look at recent cinema and gallery-based video installation,
and will read criticism that considers relationships among architecture, landscape, the pictured body, the
body of the viewer, and the phenomenology of the moving image. Some of the topics to be considered
will draw on recent scholarship about traditional cinematic forms: how can the picturing of space and
motion produce feeling? How do the face and the gesture of the body register emotion? How does lan-
guage relate to these visual and kinesthetic properties of the moving image? How does cinema use these
elements in the service of storytelling and story structure? Other topics will pertain specifically to the
ways in which contemporary installation art has brought these questions of space, motion, and narrative
away from the forms and architectures of traditional cinema: How do contemporary video practices re-
late to histories of cinema, sculpture, and theater?
Format: tutorial. Each week, one student in each tutorial pair will produce a short work that responds to a
particular assignment related to that week's screening and reading. Students will each realize five video
projects, both in traditional single-screen formats and in multiple-screen installation formats. The class
will also meet as a group for two critique sessions.

ARTS 383(F) Caméra-Stylo
This video production course will explore the essay-film. Film critic Alexandre Astruce created the term
caméra-stylo in 1948 to suggest a new means of writing through cinema, in which the camera would
serve as a pen, creating arguments, meditations and inquiries. The course will examine the work of sev-
eral film-essayists, including Chris Marker, Harun Farocki, Trinh T. Minh-Ha, Jean-Luc Godard, Wern-
er Herzog, Kidlat Tahimik, Agnes Varda, Errol Morris, and Michael Moore, who deploy documentary
strategies, fictional and staged elements, and reflexivity in exploring their films' themes. Readings,
screenings and discussions will provide a context for students to make their own video-essays. The
course will encourage a creative process that moves back and forth between writing and image-making
as modes of production.
Evaluation will be based on the quality of work produced and engagement in class discussions and cri-
tiques.

The primary emphasis of the senior tutorial is on strengthening the student's skill and sensitivity in using
critical analysis for the creation of visual objects and/or events. At the beginning of the term, studio art
majors, in consultation with the tutor, will determine the individual projects that will serve as the focus of
their work for the semester. During the course, students are expected to refine their creative directions in
a coherent and structured body of work which will be exhibited at the Williams College Museum of Art.
Students are responsible for buying their own materials.
Prerequisites: completion of all other studio courses required for the art studio route. Enrollment limit:

GRADUATE COURSES IN ART HISTORY
Requirements for the Degree of Master of Arts in Art History
The degree is normally awarded upon successful completion of two years of resident graduate study. To
earn the degree the student must earn a grade of at least B- in each of ten courses, at least six of which must
be graduate seminars (including ArtH 504). In connection with the preparation of a paper for the Graduate
Symposium, students will register for an eleventh course (ArtH 509), to be graded pass/fail, in their fourth
semester.
In addition to completing the required courses, students must participate in a group study trip to Europe
during winter study period in the first year, complete a Qualifying Paper in January of the second year, and
satisfy the language requirement in the manner described below (see "Language Courses").
Senior art majors may enroll in graduate seminars, space permitting, with the permission of instructor.
ARTH 501(S) Museums: History and Practice
This course will examine the history of museums in Europe and America, focusing on historical tradi-
tions and current expectations affecting institutional operations today. Historical tradition and current
practice as it relates to museum governance and administration, architecture and installation, acquisi-
tions and collections, cultural property issues as well as the many roles of exhibitions in museum pro-
gramming will be addressed along with museums' social responsibility as scholarly and public institu-
tions in an increasingly market-driven, non-profit environment.
Evaluation will be based on oral presentations as well as two term papers.

ARTH 502(F) Photography and the Graphic Arts During the Second Empire
In this seminar we will pursue an intensive study of French photography during the 1850s and '60s, with
an emphasis on the major technological innovations (the transition from paper negatives to glass, and
salt prints to albumen, as well as photomechanical processes) and the intersections between photogra-
phy, printmaking, and painting. We will examine the roles of government commissions, photographic
societies, public exhibitions, and contemporary criticism, as well as crosscurrents between England and
France. In addition to exploring commercial photography and amateurism, we will undertake in-depth
analyses of the careers of Gustave Le Gray, Edouard Baldus, Nadar, Charles Negre, and Charles Mar-
ville. This seminar meets in the study room of the Department of Prints, Drawings, and Photographs of

ARTH 504(F) Methods of Art History and Criticism
This is a seminar in the intellectual history of the history of art, with some concentration on the ways in
which this disciplinary tradition has been challenged by recent critical theory. It will begin its study with
the "founders" of the field and end with issues and problems that generated the "new art history" twenty
years ago and "visual studies" in the last decade. Topics to be covered include: style, iconography/
iconology, semiotics, identity politics, formalism, deconstruction, phenomenology, psychoanalysis,
feminism, Marxism, and gender studies. Resident Clark Fellows will occasionally talk to us on perspec-
tives of their choice.
Each student will write one short mid-term paper and a longer concluding essay, as well as present a
couple of the readings to the class. Limited to and required of first-year students in the Graduate Program
in the History of Art.

ARTH 508(S) Art and Conservation: An Inquiry into History, Methods, and Materials (Same
as ArtH 408)
This course is designed to acquaint students with observation and examination techniques for works of
art, artifacts, and decorative arts objects; give them an understanding of the history of artist materials and
methods; and familiarize them with the ethics and procedures of conservation. This is not a conservation
training course but is structured to provide a broader awareness for those who are planning careers in-
volving work with cultural objects. Class format will include slide presentations, lectures, gallery talks,
hands-on opportunities, technical examinations, and group discussions. Sessions will be held at the Wil-
liamstown Art Conservation Center, Williams College, Clark Art Institute, and the Governor Nelson A.
Rockefeller Empire State Plaza Art Collection in Albany. Examination questions may be formulated
from exhibitions at these locations. Six exams will be given. Exams scores will be weighed in proportion
to the number of sessions covered by the exam (e.g., the paintings exam, derived from six sessions of the
course, will count as 25% of the final grade). There is no overall final exam. Some exams may be desig-
nated "open book"; however, all work should be a student's individual effort.

ARTH 521(F) Picturing God in the Middle Ages
How did Christians come to depict their God? How did they visualize the deity described in Scripture as
well as such theological subtleties as the Incarnation and the Trinity? And what purposes did pictures of
God serve? Paying particular attention to the rapidly growing body of recent scholarship on these ques-
tions, the seminar will consider a variety of issues concerning the sources and evolution of medieval
Christian images of God, in both Byzantium and Western Europe, and the problems these images often
generated. Among other specific topics, the course will investigate the impact of imperial cult and imag-
es of the dead on the earliest portraits of Christ, theological debates about the nature of spiritual vs. cor-
poreal vision and their relationship to image-making practice, the function of sacred images in public
ritual vs. private devotion, and the pictorial exploration of the sexuality of Christ. Evaluation will be

ARTH 552(F) Art and Class at the Dawn of Mass Culture
In nineteenth-century America a mass visual culture of prints, photographs, advertisements, posters, re-
productive copies, and commercial amusements (including early cinema) increasingly displaced more
traditional, local, and ethnic visual cultures. Did this mass culture help to unify a diverse population? Did
it undermine cultural differences and homogenize audiences? Did it simply displace the grounds of dif-
ference onto new cultural hierarchies? This seminar will seek ways of addressing these questions.
Theoretical examination of the concepts of "class" and "mass culture" will be combined with case stud-
ies focusing on developments in various visual media.
Students will be responsible for informed participation in weekly discussions (15%), preparation of a
research paper of approximately 15 pages (70%), and short biweekly presentations based on primary
research inspired by reading assignments (15%). Enrollment limit: 10.

ARTH 557(F) James McNeill Whistler
The Massachusetts-born, Saint Petersburg-raised, West Point-educated, Paris-trained, London-residing,
Japan-worshipping James McNeill Whistler (1834-1903)--in addition to exemplifying the cosmopoli-
tanism of his age--revolutionized the arts of painting, printmaking, interior decoration, exhibition de-
sign, and artistic self-promotion. We will study his many achievements in part through study of selected
works and in part through considerations of the varied cultural circles in which he moved: French avant-
garde painters of several generations, British Pre-Raphaelites and Aesthetes, American expatriate art-
ists, and a panoply of European poets, industrialists, and celebrities. The considerable archival resources
and substantial bibliography devoted to him will assist us in our investigations and itself be a field of
inquiry.
Requirements and basis for evaluation: synopses of the weekly readings; two short written assignments,
an oral report, to be presented in revised, written form at semester's end; and a five-minute critical com-
mentary on another student's oral report. An overnight field trip to Washington, D.C., is likely.
Hour: 1:10-3:50 M SIMPSON
ARTH 559(S) Romanticism: Visual Art and Culture in Europe, 1780-1848
This course examines the development and impact of Romanticism in Europe, c.1780-1848. With spe-
cial attention to the visual arts but considering a wide variety of literary, philosophical and musical mate-
rial, it will explore the crucial but much disputed concept and phenomenon of Romanticism. What was it
and when was it? How did it relate to political and social upheavals of the period? How did it transform
artistic priorities and cultural identities in the early nineteenth century? Why does it remain significant to
understanding art practice today?
The course will exploit the resources of the Clark's painting and graphic arts collections (Delacroix, Gér-
icault, Goya, Corot, etc) as well as material in the Chapin Library (Blake), and trips will be likely to
collections further afield (New York and/or Boston). Students will be assessed by a short written assign-
ment and a 30-minute presentation which will be presented in revised written form at the end of the
semester.

ARTH 561(S) Ambiguous Icons: Problems of Meaning in Twentieth-Century Imagery
"Our time is indifferent to the content of artistic representations as no time has ever been before. For
today's artist form itself is the content." These remarks of the German critic Paul Westheim, published in
1919, sound strange today, yet they express an attitude that dominated critical and historical writing on
modern art for most of the twentieth century. Although the question of meaning has become more cen-
tral to the writing of the last four decades, often eclipsing questions of form, there remains in the current
phase of intense historiographical self-reflection a surprising dearth of methodological discussion on
this issue. No compelling models, comparable to that offered by Panofsky in his classic introduction to
Studies in Iconology, have established themselves for modern art, and many interpretations proceed on
the basis of anachronistic methodological assumptions. Moreover, the semiotics of twentieth-century
imagery-i. e., the examination of how meaning is generated-still remains relatively little studied. This
seminar will explore the problem of "meaning" in twentieth-century art and examine various models for
Art
­ 79 ­
dealing with the issue, including iconography, semiotics, deconstruction, and reception theory. The first
half of the seminar will be devoted to selected readings on the issue as well as to case studies of individu-
al artists-e.g. Picasso, Hoch, Johns, Kiefer. During the second half of the semester students will present
case studies on topics of their own choosing. Requirements: students will be responsible for leading
class discussion on one set of readings, an oral report, to be presented in revised, written form at semes-
ter's end, and a 10-minute critical commentary on another student's oral report.

ARTH 562(S) Andy Warhol: A Factory
This seminar examines the expansive career and influence of one of the most famous and controversial
artists of the twentieth century, Andy Warhol. The artist who wanted to be a machine has become an icon
of pop culture, the avant-garde, and postmodernism. Nearly twenty years after his death, the extent of
Warhol's influence thrives not only in art, but also in film, music, fashion, and the very concepts of fame
and celebrity. The structure for the seminar will be both thematic and chronological, which will enable
us to explore the range of his activities, from silkscreen to film and installation to publishing, while also
critically examining the recurrent tropes used to evaluate his work and impact. This process will entail
reexamining the critical relations between style, youth culture, appropriation, camp, and resistance.
Requirements: two short papers, final research paper, and class presentation.
Enrollment limit: 10.

ARTH 563(S) Critical Texts in American Art, 1945-1962
As American art began to assert its independence from foreign stylistic inventions in the early to
mid-1940s, the quest to name the new movement ensued in the press. This seminar will examine the
various tracts and essays by writers such as Robert Coates, Clement Greenberg, Thomas Hess, Alfred
Barr and Harold Rosenberg which attempted to define the singularity of American art as it rose to inter-
national prominence, in addition to the fallout and resistance to this nomenclature within the artistic
community. While the terms "abstract expressionism" and "New York School" finally settled into usage
by the late 1950s/early 1960s, a number of labels were floated over a fifteen-year period which reflect
the heated critical debates and vitality of this seminal period.

LANGUAGE COURSES
Reading proficiency in two European languages is required for the M.A. degree in Art History at Wil-
liams, and provision for attainment of this qualification is an integral part of the program of study. Of these
two, German is required, and French is recommended. Elementary and intermediate undergraduate
courses offered by the language departments are open to graduate students, and the graduate program of-
fers advanced, one-semester courses in French and German art-history readings. A student who begins
elementary language study after enrollment in the program should expect to take a sequence of courses.
Details may be obtained from the Graduate Program office. Entering students with some previous lan-
guage background will be asked to take a standard reading examination for purposes of placement. A score
of 500 is required for admission to the advanced course. Students with scores below 500 will be enrolled in
elementary language courses. Students should aim to complete all language work no later than the end of
the third semester.
To satisfy the requirement in each of the two required languages, a student must: (a) score 700 or better
on the SAT II reading examination upon enrollment in the program or, (b) complete punctually and satis-
factorily (B- or better) all assignments and tests in the advanced courses. The same standards and expecta-
tions apply to language courses as to other courses and seminars.
Second-year students who have successfully completed German 511-512 and have independently de-
veloped their German language skills during the summer may, before the commencement of their third
semester of study, arrange to take a two-hour translation examination administered by the Graduate Pro-
gram. Students who pass the examination are exempted from German 513.
Art, Asian Studies

If appropriate to his or her course of study, a student may petition to substitute another language for
French. Instruction in Italian, Spanish, Russian, Latin, and Greek is regularly offered in the undergraduate
curriculum, whereas independent arrangements must be made for Dutch and other languages.

STUDY ABROAD
Students intending to major in Asian Studies are encouraged to study in Asia during one or both
semesters of their junior year. Williams sponsors study abroad programs in China and Japan. Oppor-
tunities to study in India, Indonesia, Korea, Taiwan,Thailand, and other Asian countries are also avail-
able. Prospective Asian Studies majors who are planning to study abroad should discuss their plans
with their advisor as far in advance as possible. Up to eight courses taken overseas can count toward
graduation, and up to four courses taken overseas may be counted toward the major.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS
Students interested in writing an honors thesis in Asian Studies, Chinese, or Japanese should sub-
mit a proposal to the department chair when they register for courses in the spring of their junior year.
The proposal should include a statement of the topic, a general description of the types of materials
available for study and how the study will be carried out, and the name of the faculty member who will
serve as advisor. Admission to the honors thesis program will normally be limited to students who
have maintained at least a B+ average in their courses for the major.
Students admitted to the program should register for ASST 493-W031-494, CHIN 493-W031-494,
or JAPN 493-W031-494. They will be expected to turn in the final draft of their thesis shortly after
spring break and to discuss their results formally with their faculty graders. Their final grades in the
three courses listed above and the award of Honors, Highest Honors, or no honors will be determined
by the quality of the thesis and the student's performance in the oral defense.

COURSES IN CHINESE (Div. I)
The department regularly offers four levels of instruction in Modern Standard Chinese (Mandarin), de-
signed to enable the student to become proficient in aural comprehension, speaking, reading, and writing,
as well as introductory courses in Cantonese, Taiwanese, Classical Chinese, and Chinese linguistics. The
course numbering system for Chinese is sequential. Students move from Chinese 101-102 to 201, 202,
301, 302, 401, and 402. Independent study (Chinese 497, 498) may be offered depending on student needs
and available resources; interested students must contact the Coordinator of the Chinese Program one se-
mester in advance and present a proposal to the Coordinator or the professor with whom they wish to study
by the first day of pre-registration week. Those students entering with proficiency in Chinese should see
the Coordinator concerning placement.
The department also offers courses in English on Chinese literature and culture in translation for stu-
dents who wish to become acquainted with the major achievements in Chinese literary, intellectual and
cultural history. For the purpose of the distribution requirement, all courses in Chinese are considered Divi-
sion I.

throughout much of the world. This course will follow the origins and development of traditional Chi-
nese culture through an examination of the literature it produced from its earliest stages up until the end
of the imperial system in 1911. We will read texts ranging from the Analects of Confucius to the poetry
of the Tang dynasty (618-906), from Buddhist sutras to plays about prostitutes and singing girls. Some
important themes will include: the role of the individual versus that of the community, responses to
chaos, and ways of dealing with the culture's historical and literary legacy. All readings are in English
translation.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: one short paper (5-7 pages), one longer paper (10-12 pages),
a take-home midterm, and a final exam. Participation in class discussions is expected.
No prerequisites. No maximum enrollment (expected: 15). Open to all.

CHIN 234(S) Modern Chinese Literature and Film (Same as Comparative Literature
274)*
Modern China inherited a tradition of over 3000 years of literary history that it both built upon and
reacted against. This course will examine the development and themes of Chinese literature and film as
these two separate but related modes of expression developed during the twentieth century (and early
twenty-first) in mainland China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. Beginning with the end of the imperial period
and continuing on to the present day, we will explore how Chinese authors and film makers have and are
dealing with such issues as their own cultural inheritance, the encounter with Western ideas of moderni-
ty, social upheaval, and the role of China and Chinese culture on the global stage.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: one short paper (5-7 pages), one longer paper (10-12 pages),
a take-home midterm, and a final exam. Participation in class discussions is expected.All readings are in
English translation and all films are subtitled in English.
No prerequisites. No maximum enrollment (expected: 15). Open to all.

CHIN 301(F), 302(S) Upper-Intermediate Chinese*
Although the oral skills will continue to receive attention, there is at this level increased emphasis on
reading and writing. A major goal of the course will be developing students' reading proficiency in stan-
dard written Chinese, the grammar and vocabulary of which differ considerably from the colloquial
written Chinese which was introduced during the first two years of instruction. About half of the course
will be devoted to newspaper reading, with the remainder consisting of several modules that may in-
clude short selections from modern Chinese fiction, films, or other types of performance literature. Both
simplified and traditional character texts will be used. Conducted in Mandarin.
Requirements: three 50-minute classes plus a conversation session; primarily reading and discussion;
students are required to write a short essay every other week. Evaluation will be based on classroom

This course is designed to enhance the Chinese language proficiency of students who are already at rela-
tively advanced levels. A wide assortment of materials is used including (for speaking/comprehension)
audiotapes, videotapes, and films featuring Chinese speakers from various segments of society; and (for
reading) newspaper and magazine articles dealing with Chinese politics and economics as well as selec-
tions from modern Chinese literature. Conducted in Mandarin.

CHIN 412(S) Introduction to Classical Chinese*
Also termed Literary Chinese in English and Wenyan or Gudai Hanyu in Chinese, Classical Chinese
was the standard written language of China from around the fifth century BC until the 1920s and served
for many centuries as the written lingua franca of China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam. Moreover, rem-
nants of Classical Chinese are still used frequently in Modern Chinese, in both writing (e.g., newspaper
and road signs) and speech (e.g., proverbs and aphorisms). After several weeks of study of basic gram-
mar and vocabulary, we will read short texts in literature, history, and philosophy from the works of
authors such as Confucius, Mencius, Laozi, Zhuangzi, Sima Qian, and the Tang poets Li Bai and Du Fu.
While the main objective is to develop reading proficiency in Classical Chinese, the course also serves to
enhance proficiency in Modern Chinese through classroom discussion in Mandarin, translation of Clas-
sical Chinese into Modern Chinese, and comparison of Classical Chinese and Modern Chinese vocabu-
lary and grammar. Conducted primarily in Mandarin.
Evaluation will be based on classroom performance, homework, tests, and a final exam.
Prerequisites: Chinese 301 or permission of instructor.

COURSES IN JAPANESE (Div. I)
The department regularly offers four levels of language instruction in Modern Japanese, designed to
enable the student to become proficient in aural comprehension, speaking, reading, and writing. Courses
on Japanese literature in translation and film are also offered. The course numbering system for Japanese is
sequential. Students move from Japanese 101-102 to 201, 202, 301, 302, 401, and 402. Independent study
(Japanese 497, 498) may be offered for students who have completed 402 or the equivalent, depending on
student needs and available resources. Students interested in pursuing independent study must contact the
Coordinator of the Japanese Program one semester in advance and present a proposal to the professor with
whom they wish to study by the first day of pre-registration week. Those students entering with proficiency
in Japanese should see the Coordinator concerning placement. For the purpose of the distribution require-
ment, all courses in Japanese are considered Division I unless otherwise noted.
JAPN 101(F)-W088-102(S) First-Year Japanese*
An introductionto modern spoken and written Japanese,the course will emphasize oral skillsin thefall
semester, with somewhat more reading and writing in the spring. The relationship between language and
culture and the sociolinguistically appropriate use of language will be stressed throughout. Both video-
tapes and audiotapes will be used extensively. Classes consist ofacombination of "act" classes, con-
ducted exclusivelyin Japanese, where students usethe languagein varioustypes of drills and communi-
cative activities, and "fact" classes, conducted in Japanese and English, where students learn about the
language and culture.

JAPN 254(F) Japanese Literature and The End of the World (Same as Comparative
Literature 264)*
From the endemic warfare of the medieval era to the atomic bombing and the violent explosion of
technology in the twentieth century, the end of the world is an idea which has occupied a central place in
almost every generation of Japanese literature. Paradoxically, the spectacle of destruction has given birth
to some of the most beautiful, most moving, and most powerfully thrilling literature in the Japanese
tradition. This course examines the literature of disaster in order to investigate the link between destruc-
tion and literary creation. Texts may be drawn from medieval war narratives like The Tale of the Heike;
World War II fiction and films by Ibuse Masuji, Imamura Shôhei, and Ichikawa Kon; fantasy and sci-
ence fiction novels by Abe Kôbô, Murakami Haruki and Murakami Ryû; and apocalyptic comics and
animation by Oshii Mamoru, Ôtomo Katsuhiro and Takahata Isao. No knowledge of Japanese is neces-
sary. All texts are translated or subtitled in English.

After more than two centuries of National Seclusion, Japan's modern era began suddenly in the middle
of the nineteenth century, with the unexpected arrival of Commodore Perry, the destabilization of the
250-year old shogunal government, and the violent restoration of Imperial rule. Rapid and radical
changes followed in every aspect of society, from fashion to philosophy. This course will explore how
such changes have been expressed through literature, film and performance. We will trace how the au-
thors of literary and other artistic works perceived, integrated and at times rejected experiences of the
new and the foreign. All readings and discussions will be in English.
Format : lecture/discussion. Requirements: active class participation, presentations, written journals,
two short papers, and one longer paper..

ASTRONOMY (Div. III)
Chair, Professor JAY M. PASACHOFF
Professors: KWITTER*, PASACHOFF. Visiting Professor: DEMIANSKI. Observatory Supervisor/
Instructor: SOUZA.
Why is the sky dark at night? What are those mysterious twinkling lights that dot the nighttime sky?
What is Earth's place in the Universe? Astronomy is the science that asks and tries to answer questions
like these. We have come a long way toward understanding what makes the sky appear as it does and
how the Universe is fashioned. The Astronomy Department offers courses for anyone who is inter-
ested in learning about the Universe, and who would like to be able to follow new astronomical dis-
coveries as they are made. All courses in Astronomy satisfy the Division III requirement. The Astro-
physics major, administered jointly with the Physics Department, and the Astronomy major, are de-
scribed below.
The beginning astronomy courses are offered on two levels. Astronomy 101, 102, 104, and
330-type courses are intended primarily for non-science majors, and have no prerequisite. Astronomy
111 is designed for students with some exposure to or interest in physics. It has a prerequisite of one
year of high school physics or permission of the instructor, and a corequisite of Mathematics 104 or
equivalent background in calculus.
Most of the astronomy courses take advantage of our observational and computational facilities
including a 24" computer-controlled telescope with sensitive electronic detectors, and our own com-
puter network for image processing and data analysis. The Astronomy Department homepage can be
found at http://www.williams.edu/Astronomy.
ASTROPHYSICS MAJOR
The Astrophysics major is designed for students who want a rigorous introduction to the field, and
includes not only those who plan graduate study in astronomy, astrophysics, or a closely related area,
but also those interested in a wide variety of careers. Alumni are not only astronomers but also com-
puter scientists, geologists, teachers, doctors, lawyers, business school professors, and so on. In recent
years, many astrophysics majors have had a second major in fields as wide ranging as mathematics,
geosciences, economics, and art history. This major emphasizes the description of the Universe and
its constituents in terms of physical processes. Potential Astrophysics majors should consult early
with members of the Astronomy and Physics Departments to determine their most appropriate route
to and through the major. An essential ingredient in such students' undergraduate training is experi-
ence in physics and mathematics. Therefore, the major normally will begin in the first year a student is
at Williams with Physics 131, 141, or 151 and Mathematics 104 or 105/106 in the fall. Students with
very good background placing them out of Physics 142 and out of Mathematics 104 may choose to
take Physics 201 and Mathematics 105/106 instead. Astronomy 111 will often be taken in the fall of
Astronomy, Astrophysics
­ 87 ­
the sophomore year; however, many students take it in the fall of their first year at Williams, along
with physics and math. Students who might place out of physics courses should read the section on
placement under Physics. Students who place out of Physics 131 or 141 into Physics 142 or 151
should particularly consider taking Astronomy 111 in the fall of their first year.
In addition to the major courses described below, other courses in geosciences, mathematics, and
computer science may also be appropriate.

The total number of courses required for the Astrophysics major, an interdisciplinary major, is elev-
en. Students entering with Advanced Placement in physics and/or mathematics may obtain credit to-
ward the major for the equivalent of Physics 141 and/or Mathematics 104 and/or 105/106 taken else-
where, but at least 8 courses in astronomy, physics, and mathematics must be taken at Williams. There
are some aspects of astrophysics that are closely related to chemistry or geosciences. In recognition of
this relation, certain advanced courses in those departments can be accepted for credit toward the As-
trophysics major on a two-for-one basis. It is not possible to double major in Astrophysics and Phys-
ics.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN ASTROPHYSICS
The honors degree in Astrophysics will be awarded on the basis of a senior thesis presenting the
results of an original observational, experimental, or theoretical investigation carried out by the stu-
dent under the direction of a faculty member in Astronomy or Physics. There are no specific grade
requirements (other than College-wide requirements for remaining in good academic standing) for
entry into the thesis research program; however, a student wishing to do a thesis should have demon-
strated both ability and motivation for independent work in previous courses and in any earlier re-
search involvement. Students doing theses will normally choose a topic and an advisor early in the
second semester of their junior year and usually begin their thesis work during the summer. During the
senior year, those students whose proposals have been approved will elect two courses and a winter
study project in addition to the minimum requirements for the major. Preparation for the thesis will
occupy at least one course (Astrophysics 493) and the winter study project (Astrophysics 031). At the
end of the winter study period, the departments will decide, in consultation with each student, whether
to admit that student to honors candidacy. Both a written thesis and an oral presentation to faculty and
fellow students are required. The degree with honors will be awarded to those who meet these require-
ments with distinction. The degree with highest honors will be awarded to those who fulfill the re-
quirements with unusually high distinction.
The departments will be flexible with regard to the number and timing of courses devoted to thesis
research within the general guidelines of two courses and a winter study project over and above the
minimum major requirements and the written and oral presentations, especially in cases of students
Astronomy, Astrophysics
­ 88 ­
with advanced standing and/or summer research experience. Students considering unusual requests
are urged to consult with potential advisors or the department chairs as early as possible.
ASTRONOMY MAJOR
The Astronomy major is designed for students with an interest in learning about many aspects of
modern astronomy, but who do not choose to take the advanced physics courses of the astrophysics
major. It is also appropriate as a second major for students concentrating in another field. The Astron-
omy major emphasizes understanding the observed properties of the physical systems that comprise
the known Universe, from the Sun and solar system, to the evolution of stars and star clusters, to the
Milky Way Galaxy, to external galaxies and clusters of galaxies. Because some knowledge of physics
and calculus is necessary to understand many astronomical phenomena, the Astronomy major re-
quires the first two semesters each of the physics and calculus that are also required of Physics majors
and Astrophysics majors.
There are several possible routes through the Astronomy major, depending on preparation and in-
terest. Students considering a major in Astronomy should consult with members of the department
early and often. A first-year student, unsure about choosing between Astronomy and Astrophysics,
may wish to take not only Astronomy 111 but also Physics 131, 141, or 151 and Mathematics 104 (if
necessary) in the fall. Students who might place out of physics courses should read the section on
placement under Physics.

ASTRONOMY COURSES
COURSES FOR NON-MAJORS WITH NO PREREQUISITES
ASTR 101(F) Stars: From Suns to Black Holes
What makes a star shine? For how long will the Sun keep shining? What are black holes and how can
they form? Astronomy 101, a non-major, general introduction to the part of contemporary astronomy
that includes how stars form and how they end their existence, will provide answers to these questions
and more. The course gives special attention to the exciting discoveries of the past few years. Topics
include modern astronomical instruments such as the Hubble Space Telescope, the Spitzer Space Tele-
scope, the Chandra X-ray Observatory, the new generation of 8- and 10-meter mountaintop telescopes,
and results from them; how astronomers interpret the light received from distant celestial objects; the
Sun as a typical star (and how its future will affect ours); and our modern understanding of how stars
work and how they change with time. We will also discuss how pulsars and black holes result from the
evolution of normal, massive stars and how giant black holes are at the center of galaxies and quasars.
We will discuss the discovery of planets around stars other than the Sun. This course is independent of
and on the same level as Astronomy 102 and 104, though students who have taken those courses are
welcome.
Observing sessions will include use of the 24 telescope and other telescopes for observations of stars,
star clusters, planets and their moons, nebulae, and galaxies, as well as daytime observations of the Sun.
Format: lecture (three hours per week), observing sessions (scattered throughout the semester), after-
noon labs (four times per semester), and a planetarium demonstration. Evaluation will be based on two
hour tests, a final exam, an observing portfolio, and laboratory reports.
No prerequisites. No enrollment limit (expected: 30). Non-major course.

ASTR 104(S) The Milky Way Galaxy and the Universe Beyond
It has been only about 85 years since the Sun was discovered not to be at the center of the Milky Way
Galaxy, and only 80 years since our Milky Way Galaxy was determined to be only one of countless
"island Universes" in space. A host of technological advances is enabling us to understand even more
clearly our place in the universe and how the universe began. For example, the Hubble Space Telescope,
the Spitzer Space Telescope, and the Chandra X-ray Observatory bring clearer images and cover a wider
range of the spectrum than have ever been obtainable before; they are speeding up progress on determin-
ing the past and future of the Universe. In addition, the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe space-
craft's study of the early Universe and large-scale mapping programs are giving clues into how the Uni-
verse's currently observed structure arose. They are confirming and enlarging our understanding of the
Big Bang. Astronomy 104, a non-major, general introduction to part of contemporary astronomy com-
prising the study of galaxies and the Universe, explores the answers to questions like: What is the Milky
Way?; Why are quasars so luminous?; Is the Universe made largely of "dark matter" and "dark ener-
gy"?; What determines the ultimate fate of the Universe? This course is independent of, and on the same
level as Astronomy 101 and 102, though students who have taken those courses are welcome.
Observing sessions will include use of the 24" telescope and other telescopes for observations of stars,
star clusters, planets and their moons, nebulae, and galaxies, as well as daytime observations of the Sun.

ASTR 336(S) Science, Pseudoscience, and the Two Cultures (Same as History of Science 336)
(W)
A famous dichotomy between the sciences and the humanities, and public understanding of them, was
laid down by C. P. Snow and has been widely discussed, with ignorance of the second law of thermody-
namics compared with ignorance of Shakespeare. In this seminar, we will consider several aspects of
science and scientific culture, including how scientific thinking challenges the claims of pseudoscience.
We will consider C. P. Snow and his critics as well as the ideas about the Copernican Revolution and
other paradigms invented by Thomas Kuhn. We will discuss the recent "Science Wars" over the validity
of scientific ideas. We will consider the fundamental originators of modern science, including Tycho,
Kepler, Galileo, and Newton, viewing their original works in the Chapin Library of rare books and
comparing their interests in science with what we now call pseudoscience, like alchemy. We will review
Astronomy, Astrophysics
­ 90 ­
the history and psychology of astrology and other pseudosciences. Building on the work of Martin Gar-
dner in "Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science," and using the current journal "The Scientific Re-
view of Alternative Medicine," we consider from a scientific point of view what is now called comple-
mentary or alternative medicine, including both older versions such as chiropractic and newer nonscien-
tific practices. We consider such topics as GM (genetically modified) foods, the safety and regulation of
dietary supplements, and the validity of government and other recommendations relevant to the roles of
dietary salt and fat in health. We consider the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) and reports of
UFO's and aliens. We consider the possible effects that superstitious beliefs have on the general public's
cooperation in vaccination programs and other consequences of superstition. We also consider the re-

Bioinformatics, genomics, and proteomics are rapidly advancing fields that integrate the tools and
knowledge from biology, chemistry, computer science, mathematics, physics, and statistics in re-
search at the intersection of the biological and informational sciences. Inspired by the enormous
amount of biological data that are being generated from the sequencing of genomes, these new fields
will help us pose and answer biological questions that have long been considered too complex to ad-
dress. Research in genomics, proteomics, and bioinformatics will also significantly impact society
affecting medicine, culture, economics, and politics.
The Bioinformatics, Genomics, and Proteomics curriculum involves faculty from the biology,
chemistry, computer science, mathematics/statistics, and physics departments and was designed to
provide students with an understanding of these revolutionary new areas of investigation. The
introductory level courses, Computation and biology and Statistics for Biologists are accessible to all
students interested in gaining familiarity with the power of genomic analysis. Students interested in
graduate work in bioinformatics, genomics, and proteomics should take the core courses and five of
the recommended courses. Interested students are also encouraged to participate in independent re-
search with members of the advisory faculty as they explore the development of these new fields.

Biochemistry and molecular biology are dynamic fields that lie at the forefront of science. Through
elucidation of the structure and function of biologically important molecules (such as nucleic acids,
lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates) these disciplines have provided important insights and advances
in the fields of molecular engineering (recombinant DNA technology, "intelligent" drug design, "in
vitro evolution"), genomics and proteomics, signal transduction, immunology, developmental biolo-
gy, and evolution.
The Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Program is designed to provide students with an oppor-
tunity to explore living systems in molecular terms. Biochemistry and molecular biology are at the
interface between the chemical and biological methods of looking at nature; therefore, the program
draws heavily from these disciplines. While chemistry is concerned with the relationship between
molecular structure and reactions, and biology focuses on cells and organisms, biochemistry and mo-
lecular biology probe the details of the structures and interactions of molecules in living systems in
order to provide the foundation for a better understanding of biological molecules both individually
and as members of more complex structures.
PROGRAM
While aspects of biochemistry and molecular biology can be very diverse, a common set of chemi-
cal and biological principles underlie the more advanced topics. With this in mind, the program has
been structured to provide the necessary background in chemistry and biology and the opportunity to
study the many facets of the modern areas of the biochemical sciences. Students interested in the Bio-
chemistry and Molecular Biology Program should plan their course selection carefully. Since it is ex-
pected that Biochemistry 321 would be taken in the junior year, students are advised to take the pre-
requisites for this course in both chemistry and biology during their first two years at Williams. While
the program is open to all students, it is expected that it will appeal primarily to majors in biology and
chemistry because of the number of courses required in those fields. In addition to taking the required
courses, students planning to complete the Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Program are strong-
ly encouraged to elect courses in mathematics and physics. In addition, students contemplating at-
tending graduate school in biochemistry or a related field are strongly encouraged to take BIOL/
CHEM 322.
The following interdepartmental courses serve as the core of the Biochemistry and Molecular Biol-
ogy Program.
BIMO 321 provides an introduction to biochemistry and molecular biology. BIMO 401, the cap-
stone course for the concentration, provides students the opportunity to examine the current scientific
literature in a wide variety of BIMO-related research areas.
BIMO 321(F) Biochemistry I--Structure and Function of Biological Molecules (Same as
Biology 321 and Chemistry 321)
This course introduces the basic concepts of biochemistry with an emphasis on the structure and func-
tion of biological macromolecules. Specifically, the structure of proteins and nucleic acids are examined
in detail in order to determine how their chemical properties and their biological behavior result from
those structures. Other topics covered include enzyme kinetics, mechanism and catalysis and regu-
lation; the molecular organization of biomembranes and the flow of information from nucleic acids to
proteins. In addition, the principles and applications of the methods used to characterize macromole-
cules in solution and the interactions between macromolecules are discussed.
The laboratory provides an opportunity to study the structure of macromolecules and to learn the funda-
mental experimental techniques of biochemistry including electrophoresis, chromatography, and prin-
ciples of enzymatic assays.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, four hours per week. Evaluation will be based on
quizzes, amidterm, a final exam, problem sets and performance in the laboratories including lab reports.
Prerequisites: Chemistry 251 and Biology 101. No enrollment limit (expected: 25).

to illustrate the importance of a wide range of both biological and chemical approaches to address-
ing important questions in the biochemical and molecular biological fields.
Format: seminar, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on class discussions and presenta-
tions, several short papers, and a final paper.
Prerequisites: Biology 202 and BIMO 321. Enrollment limit: 12 (expected: 8). Preference given to
those completing the BIMO program; open to others with permission of instructors.

To complete the concentration in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, a student must complete all of the
required courses listed below, take two electives from the list below (one must have a laboratory compo-
nent), and attend at least eight Biology and/or Chemistry Department colloquia. Since the Chemistry De-
partment counts two biology courses and the Biology Department counts two chemistry courses toward
the majors (each of which can be completed with only eight other courses), a student majoring in either
chemistry or biology would have to take only two or three additional courses to complete the program.

The Biology curriculum has been designed to provide students with a broad base for understanding
principles governing life processes at all levels, from biochemistry and cell biology to physiology to
ecology and behavior. Courses emphasize fundamentals common to all subdisciplines including the
coupling of structure to function, the transfer of energy in living systems, communication, and the
molding of diversity by the evolutionary process. In upper-level courses and in independent and hon-
ors research, students have the opportunity to investigate areas at the frontiers of modern biology.
Although the Biology major is specifically designed to provide a balanced curriculum in the broad-
er context of the liberal arts, it is also excellent preparation for graduate studies in the life sciences and
in the health professions.
MAJOR REQUIREMENTS
In order to make the major accessible to students with diverse interests, required courses are kept to
a minimum. The Biology major is satisfied by nine courses, as follows:
Biology 101 The Cell
Biology 102 The Organism
Biology 202 Genetics
Any two 300-level courses, one of which must have a laboratory associated with it.
Any one 400-level course other than 493-494.
Any other three courses or any other two courses and two semesters of Organic Chemistry.
NOTE: Independent study courses and AMS 311 (Same as Biology 231) do not fulfill the 300-level
or 400-level course requirements. Both WIOX 215, Biology: Ecology of Flowering Plants, and
WIOX 216, Biology: Evolution, in the Williams Oxford Program qualify for major credit.
Distribution Requirement
In order to ensure that majors broaden their knowledge of biology, one of the elective courses for
the major must include an upper-level course covering biological processes at levels of organization
above the cell. Courses that satisfy this distribution requirement are indicated in the individual course
description.
COURSE SELECTION AND PLACEMENT
It is preferable for students who plan to major in biology, or think they may be interested in doing
so, to take Biology 101, 102 during their first year at Williams. It is also possible to begin the Biology
major during the sophomore year, although students should understand that it may require taking two
or more biology courses during several semesters.
Students interested in biology, whether or not they intend to major in it, are encouraged to take Biol-
ogy 101, 102. It is also possible, with permission of the instructor, to take Biology 203 Ecology, Biolo-
gy 204 Animal Behavior, and Biology 220 Field Botany without prerequisite. Other biology courses
designed specifically for students who do not intend to take additional upper-level courses in biology
include Biology 132 Human Biology and Social Issues, Biology 134 The Tropics: Biology and Social
Issues, and Biology 133 Biology of Exercise and Nutrition. All of these courses satisfy the Division III
distribution requirement; in addition, Biology 134 satisfies the Peoples and Cultures distribution re-
quirement.
Beginning students should normally enroll in Biology 101 and 102. Students with unusually strong
backgrounds in biology, such as those with outstanding performance on the College Board Biology
Advanced Placement Test, may be permitted to elect a sophomore-level course in lieu of Biology 101
and/or Biology 102 upon successful completion of a departmental qualifying exam, administered
during First Days.
COURSES RELATED TO THE BIOLOGY MAJOR
Students planning to pursue their interest in biology and related fields after completing their under-
graduate degrees are strongly encouraged to take one year of chemistry, at least one semester of math-
ematics (a course in statistics is recommended), and one semester of physics. Students may wish to
check the requirements for graduate admission at relevant universities, and are also encouraged to
consult with the Biology Department's graduate school advisor about prerequisites for admission to
graduate programs.
Biology
­ 95 ­
BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
Students interested in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (BIMO) should consult the general
statement under Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.
BIOINFORMATICS, GENOMICS AND PROTEOMICS
Students interested in Bioinformatics, Genomics and Proteomics (BIGP) should consult the gener-
al statement under Bioinformatics, Genomics and Proteomics. Biology majors interested in this field
are strongly encouraged to enroll in Life as an Algorithm (Computer Science 106/Biology 106) in the
Spring of 2005. The capstone course for the BIGP program will be offered in the Fall of 2005, and will
have prerequisites of Genetics (Biology 202) and Life as an Algorithm (Computer Science 106/Biolo-
gy 106).
NEUROSCIENCE
Students interested in Neuroscience (NSCI) should consult the general statement under Neurosci-
ence.
ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
Students interested in Environmental Studies (ENVI) should consult the general statement under
Environmental Studies.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN BIOLOGY
In order to be recommended for the degree with honors, a Biology major is normally expected to
have completed the equivalent of two semesters and a winter study (031) of independent research
culminating in a thesis which demonstrates outstanding achievement of an original and innovative
nature. Although the presentation of a thesis and associated oral presentation in the fall and poster
defense in the spring are required for consideration for a degree with honors, their completion should
not be interpreted as a guarantee of a degree with honors. The principal considerations in admitting a
student to the program of independent honors research will be mastery of fundamental material and
skills, ability to pursue independent study successfully, and demonstrated interest and motivation.
Students interested in participating in the honors program should consult with the department early in
the spring semester of the junior year; approval must be received before spring registration in the ju-
nior year.
The minimum course requirements for a degree with honors in Biology are Biology 101, Biology
102, Biology 202, two 300-level biology courses (one of which must have a laboratory associated
with it), one 400-level biology course, Biology 493, Biology 494, WSP 031, and any other two
courses in biology (or any other one course and two semesters of Organic Chemistry).
In addition to the normal honors route, which includes two semesters (Biology 493-494) and a win-
ter study of research (WSP 031) during senior year, students have the option,subject to the approval of
their thesis advisor, to begin the honors research during winter study junior year or during the second
semester junior year. Students beginning honors in winter study of junior year would take Biology
494 in the spring of their junior year followed by Biology 493 in the fall of their senior year; students
beginning honors during the second semester of junior year would take Biology 494 that semester,
followed by Biology 493 in the fall of senior year and winter study research in the winter of the senior
year.
CREDIT FOR COURSES AT OTHER INSTITUTIONS
Students who enroll in study away programs may receive credit for up to two 200-level electives
towards the biology major upon approval of the course syllabi by the Biology Department's study
abroad coordinator.
Students wishing to satisfy prerequisites for courses offered by the Biology Department with
courses taken at other institutions should consult, in person, with a member of the Biology Depart-
ment, prior to registering for the course that requires a prerequisite. Such consultations will include a
review of the course syllabi and the transcripts of the relevant previous college work, and students
should bring these materials with them.
BIOL 101(F) The Cell
This course provides an introduction to the cellular aspects of modern biology. It explains the develop-
ment of cell structure and function as a consequence of evolutionary processes, and it stresses the dy-
namic properties of living systems. Topics considered include biological molecules and enzyme action,

BIOL 132(S) Human Biology and Social Issues
From reading the headlines in newspapers and magazines one gets the impression that human society is
on the verge of a wondrous transformation to be brought about by the application of new biological
knowledge. Can science really provide us with a future that is free of disease and social problems? Is
biology the important underlying dictator of who we are and how we live our lives? Or are we more than
the sum of our biological parts?
In lectures, we'll examine recent scientific advances and/or setbacks in understanding and manipulating
human reproduction, development, inheritance, and health. In particular, research in the areas of the Hu-
man Genome Project, gene therapy, cloning and cancer will be explored. In addition, in discussion sec-
tions we will address the implications of this current research for individuals and for society as a whole.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on hour exams, a final exam, a short paper, and
participation on a discussion panel.

While determining the complete DNA sequences of organisms continues at an impressive pace, a suffi-
cient number of eukaryotic and prokaryotic genomes have been sequenced to consider what has been
learned, and, more importantly, what do we hope to learn in the post-genomic era. This tutorial course,
intended for sophomores, examines the progress and limitations of genome analyses in enhancing our
understanding of biology, as well as more recent investigations employing DNA, RNA and protein se-
quence information to gain insights into fundamental biological processes. Initially in the course, the
experimental approaches and tools used to obtain and analyze DNA sequences are considered. Subse-
quently, topics based on recent articles exploring (i) comparative genomic analyses, (ii) genome-wide
changes in expression and mRNA levels (transcriptomes), and (iii) efforts to analyze proteomes and
protein-protein interactions in cells are examined.
The format includes two meetings per week, one general group meeting and one tutorial meeting be-
tween two students and the instructor. Evaluation is based on five tutorial papers (4-5 pages each), five
critiques, tutorial presentations and general participation.

BIOL 308(F) Integrative Plant Biology: Fundamentals and New Frontiers
Plants are one of the most successful groups of organisms on Earth and have a profound impact on all
life. Successful use of plants in addressing global problems and understanding their role in natural eco-
systems depends on fundamental knowledge of the molecular mechanisms by which they grow, devel-
op, and respond to their environment. This course will examine the molecular physiology of plants using
an integrative approach that considers plants as dynamic, functional units in their environment. Major
emphasis will be on understanding fundamental plant processes, such as photosynthesis, growth and
development, water transport, hormone physiology, and flowering, from the molecular to the organis-
mal level. Environmental effects on these processes will be addressed in topics including photomorpho-
genesis, stress physiology, mineral nutrition, and plant-microbe interactions. Frequent discussions of
original research papers will examine the mechanisms plants use to perform these processes and explore
advances in the genetic engineering of plants for agricultural, environmental, and medical purposes.
Laboratory activities stress modern approaches and techniques used in investigating plant physiological
processes.
Format: lecture/discussion/laboratory, six hours per week. Evaluation will be based on lab reports, a
term paper, and exams.

Bioterrorism and the alarming spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria are but two of the reasons for the
renewed emphasis on the biology of microorganisms. This course will examine microbes from the
perspectives of cell structure and function, genetics, and evolution. A major theme will be the adaptation
of bacteria as they evolve to fill specific ecological niches, with an emphasis on microbe: host
interactions that lead to pathogenesis. We will consider communication among bacteria as well as
between bacteria and their environment. Topics include: microbial development, stress response,
bioremediation, bacteriophages, subversion of the immune defenses, and genomics. In the lab, students
will examine the regulation of bacterial gene expression, horizontal gene transfer, the isolation and
characterization of bacteria from natural environment, and carry out independent projects. Readings will
be supplemented by articles from the primary literature.

tral to life. Emphasis is placed on the biological flow of energy including alternative modes of energy
generation (aerobic, anaerobic, photosynthetic); the regulation and integration of the metabolic path-
ways including compartmentalization and the transport of metabolites; and biochemical reaction mech-
anisms including the structures and mechanisms of coenzymes. This comprehensive study also includes
the biosynthesis and catabolism of small molecules (carbohydrates, lipids, amino acids, and nucleo-
tides). Laboratory experiments introduce the principles and procedures used to study enzymatic reac-
tions, bioenergetics, and metabolic pathways.

A tutorial course investigating the patterns and processes in human-dominated ecosystems, especially
those that produce food and fiber, process wastes, or provide a context for human activities such as rec-
reation. The course will draw heavily upon the experiences that students have had in other biology
courses. Topics will include: the relationships among diversity, ecosystem function, sustainability, resil-
ience, and stability of biological resource systems, nutrient pools and processing in human-dominated
ecosystems. Four field trips will be taken to biological resource sites in the region. These experiences
will serve as introductions to readings and the topics of papers to be written by student participants. Each
student will write four papers that deal with questions requiring extensive reading of primary resources.
Paper presentations will alternate with serving as a critic of other student papers. Students will be given
the opportunity to revise and rewrite two of the four papers in the week following their tutorial presenta-
tion thereby being able to respond to the criticism and discussion of the tutorial group.

BIOL 413(F) Molecular Basis of Biological Clocks
Circadian rhythms have been described in all organisms studied, including humans, a wide range of
other eukaryotes and several prokaryotes. With periods of about 24 hours, these rhythms regulate
biochemical, cellular, physiological and behavioral activities. Circadian rhythms are generated by cellu-
lar clocks--genetically determined internal pacemakers that maintain their oscillations in the absence of
environmental cues but may be reset by periodicities in the environment, especially the light-dark cycle.
Only recently have we begun to understand how circadian rhythms are generated and controlled at the
cellular level. This course will explore the basic biochemical features of biological clocks with the aim
of understanding their crucial role in regulating key biological parameters, such as enzyme levels, levels
of hormones and other regulatory molecules, and activity and sleep cycles. Class discussions will focus
on readings in the original literature. Format: discussion, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based
on class participation and several short papers.
Prerequisites: Biology 202. Enrollment limit: 2 sections of 12 (expected: 2 sections of 12 ). Open to jun-

MAJOR
Through a variety of individual courses and sequential programs, the department provides an op-
portunity for students to explore the nature and significance of chemistry, an area of important
achievement in our quest for knowledge about ourselves and the world around us. The student of
chemistry is able to become aware of the special viewpoint of chemists, the general nature of chemical
investigation, some of its important results, how these results are expressed, and something of their
significance within the fields of science and in the area of human endeavor as a whole.
A major in chemistry can be achieved in several ways, preferably beginning in the student's first
year at Williams, but also beginning in the sophomore year. Building on a foundation in general chem-
istry, organic chemistry, and physical chemistry, a student elects additional advanced courses to com-
plete a major that is consistent with his or her background in other sciences, interests, and goals. A
student's program might emphasize biochemistry, organic chemistry, physical chemistry, or inorganic
chemistry, with additional courses available in analytical chemistry, environmental science, and ma-
terials science. Students considering a major in chemistry should consult with a member of the depart-
ment as early as possible in order to plan a program which best suits their interests and abilities and
which makes full use of their previous preparation.
Usually the requirements for the major are fulfilled by completing "Required Courses" and the ap-
propriate number of "Elective Courses." Starting at the 300 level, at least three of the courses taken
must have a laboratory component. In addition, the department has a number of "Independent Re-
search Courses" which, while they do not count toward completion of the major, provide a unique
opportunity to pursue an independent research project under the direction of a faculty member.

aAll students begin their study in the department with either Chemistry 151, 153, or 155. Placement
at the introductory level is based upon performance on the departmental placement test results and
consultation with the chair; results of the College Board Advanced Placement Test or the Interna-
tional Baccalaureate Exam are also taken into account. The first year is completed with Chemistry
156. In the second year at the introductory level, students take Chemistry 251 (or 255) and Chemis-
try 256 (those students who complete 155 are exempted from 256).
Chemistry
­ 102 ­
bStudents wishing to pursue a research-based version of the laboratory program in Chemistry 251
may elect 255 after consultation with the chair.
cChemistry 256 is the fourth course in the Department's Introductory-level sequence. This course is
a prerequisite (or co-requisite) for all Quantitative and Advanced-level electives.
dTo complete the major in Chemistry, students must elect any one of Chemistry 361, 364, 366, or
367. The course elected, in consultation with the chair or major advisor, will depend on the stu-
dent's future plans.
eChemistry 361 and 366 are strongly recommended for anyone considering graduate school in
chemistry.
fChemistry 367 and 324 are strongly recommended for anyone considering graduate school in bio-
chemistry.
gThe Chemistry major requires either nine semester chemistry courses or eight semester chemistry
courses plus two approved courses from among the following: Biology 101, 102; Computer Sci-
ence 134; Mathematics 103, 104, 105; Physics 131, 132; or any courses in these departments for
which the approved courses are prerequisites. No more than two advanced-level organic courses
may be counted toward completion of the major.
Completion of any one of the advanced-level elective courses will satisfy the College requirement
that a student complete a major seminar.
For the purpose of assisting students in selecting a program consistent with their interests, the fol-
lowing groupings of electives and faculty advisors are suggested. However, a case can be made for
selecting courses from the different groups.
Biochemistry: Chemistry 321, Chemistry 322, Chemistry 324, Chemistry 341, Chemistry 342, Chemis-
try 344, Chemistry 367, Chemistry 436T, Chemistry 464T (Students interested in biochemistry should
consult with Ms. Gehring, Mr. Kaplan, or Mr. Lovett.)
Organic Chemistry: Chemistry 324, Chemistry 341, Chemistry 342, Chemistry 344, Chemistry 346
(Students interested in organic chemistry should consult with Ms. Goh, Mr. Markgraf, Mr. Richardson,
or Mr. Smith.)
Physical and Inorganic Chemistry: Chemistry 332, Chemistry 335, Chemistry 361, Chemistry 364,
Chemistry 366, Chemistry 368, Chemistry 436T, Chemistry 464T (Students interested in physical
chemistry should consult with Mr. Bingemann, Mr. Chang, Mr. Peacock-López, or Mr. Thoman. Stu-
dents interested in inorganic chemistry should consult with Ms. Park or Mr. Schofield. Students inter-
ested in materials science should consult with Ms. Goh or Ms. Park.)
The Chemistry major provides excellent preparation for graduate study in chemistry, biochemistry,
chemical engineering, environmental science, medicine, and the medical sciences. The major can
also be useful to those whose later professional or business careers may be related to chemical materi-
als or processes. While any accepted route through the major would permit a student to proceed to
graduate study in chemistry, three electives should be considered a minimum, and the particular im-
portance of Chemistry 321, 335, 361, 364, and 366 as preparation for advanced study should be noted.
In addition, at least a semester of research and courses in computer science are strongly recom-
mended.
Students with principal interests outside of the sciences may extend a secondary school foundation
in chemistry by electing a basic two-semester introductory course of a general nature or they may
elect semester courses designed for non-majors. All courses in chemistry satisfy the distribution re-
quirement.
The department is accredited by the American Chemical Society (A.C.S.), a professional body of
academic, industrial, and research chemists. The A.C.S. suggests the following courses for someone
considering graduate study or work in chemistry or a related area. Students completing these courses
are designated Certified A.C.S. Majors: 151 (153 or 155), 156, 251 (255), 256, 335, 361, 364, 366,
493-494; and at least two courses from 321, 322, 342, 344, 368, BIMO 401.
BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
Students interested in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology should consult with the general state-
ment under Biochemistry and Molecular Biology in the Courses of Instruction. Students interested in
biochemistry are also encouraged to complete the biochemistry courses within the chemistry major
by taking 367, 324, 321, and 322 in addition to the first and second year required courses.
BIOINFORMATICS, GENOMICS, AND PROTEOMICS
Students interested in Bioinformatics, Genomics, and Proteomics should consult the general state-
ment under Bioinformatics, Genomics, and Proteomics in the Courses of Instruction. Students inter-
ested in these areas are also encouraged to complete the biochemistry courses within the chemistry
major by taking 367, 324, 321, and 322 in addition to the first and second year required courses.

MATERIALS SCIENCE
Students interested in Materials Science are encouraged to elect courses from the Materials Science
program offered jointly with the Physics Department, and should consult the information on page 221
describing this option.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN CHEMISTRY
The degree with honors in Chemistry provides students with an opportunity to undertake an inde-
pendent research project under the supervision of a faculty member, and to report on the nature of the
work in two short oral presentations and in a written thesis.
Chemistry majors who are candidates for the degree with honors take the following in addition to a
major listed above:
Chemistry 493-W31-494 Senior Research and Thesis
The principal considerations in admitting a student to a program of independent research are mas-
tery of fundamental materials and skills, ability to pursue independent study successfully, and demon-
strated student interest and motivation. In addition, to enroll in these courses leading to a degree with
honors, a student must have a B- average in all chemistry courses or the permission of the chair. At the
end of the first semester, the department reviews the student's progress and determines whether the
student is a candidate for a degree with honors. The designation of a degree with honors in Chemistry
or a degree with highest honors in Chemistry is based primarily on a departmental evaluation of the
accomplishments in these courses and on the quality of the thesis. Completion of the research project
in a satisfactory manner and preparation of a well-written thesis usually results in a degree with hon-
ors. In cases where a student has demonstrated unusual commitment and initiative resulting in an out-
standing thesis based on original experimental results, combined with a strong record in all of his or
her chemistry courses, the department may elect to award a degree with highest honors in Chemistry.
EXCHANGE AND TRANSFER STUDENTS
Students from other institutions wishing to register for courses in chemistry involving college-level
prerequisites should do so in person with a member of the Chemistry Department. Registration should
take place by appointment during the spring semester prior to the academic year in which courses are
to be taken. Students are requested to have with them transcripts of the relevant previous college
work.
COURSES FOR NON-MAJORS WITH NO PREREQUISITES
CHEM 111(F) Fighting Disease: The Evolution and Operation of Human Medicines
The past decade has seen an explosion in the number of pharmaceuticals available to doctors and their
patients. Pills are now available to treat conditions as varied as depression and baldness, and a cure for
the common cold is in development. A visit to the doctor now seems incomplete without a prescription.
Changes in Food and Drug Administration and health insurance policies combined with the tremendous
increase in advertisement of prescription drugs have also placed a larger burden on consumers in decid-
ing which drugs to take, as well as in paying for the medication.
This course focuses on understanding, at a biochemical level, how several drugs work their curative
magic as well as how they may lead to undesired side effects. We examine the processes through which
drugs are discovered or created and how they are then brought to consumers. Topics range from the
discovery of aspirin and the effect of World War II on the discovery of cheap treatments for malaria to
advances in protease inhibitors and combination therapies which have dramatically extended the lives of
AIDS patients. The main focus of the course is basic concepts in medicinal chemistry and biology which
underlie the action of any drug. We also explore the connections between basic research, biotechnology
companies, multinational pharmaceutical firms, patent attorneys, regulatory agencies, doctors, and in-
surers which eventually lead to the availability of a given drug.
This course is designed for the non-science major who does not intend to pursue a career in the natural
sciences. Principles in organic chemistry and biochemistry will be developed as needed.
Format: lecture, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on problem sets, class participation, a
quiz, a midterm, and a final project.
No prerequisites; students who have taken Chemistry 156 are not eligible. No enrollment limit (ex-
pected: 40).

CHEM 113(S) Chemistry and Crime: From Sherlock Holmes to Modern Forensic Science
In this course, designed for students who do not plan to major in the natural sciences, we use a case-ori-
ented approach to explore selected topics of forensic science. These include: (1) the scientific and tech-
nological foundation for the examination of physical, chemical, and biological items of evidence, and
(2) the scope of expert qualifications and testimony, the legal status of scientific techniques, and the ad-
missibility of the results in evidence. The analysis of trace evidence, including glass, soil, gunpowder
residues and bullet fragments, and inorganic and heavy metal poisons are discussed through an under-
standing of the basic concepts of chemistry and analytical chemistry. Forensic toxicology and phar-
macology are applied to the analysis of alcohol, poisons, and drugs based upon the principles of organic
Chemistry

chemistry and biochemistry. The characterization of blood and other body fluids necessitate an under-
standing of serology and molecular genetics. The cases which stimulate the exploration of these areas
include: the John and Robert Kennedy assassinations, the Jeffrey MacDonald case (Fatal Vision), the
Wayne Williams case, the deaths of celebrities Marilyn Monroe, John Belushi, and Janis Joplin, the au-
thenticity of the Shroud of Turin, the Lindberg baby kidnapping, the Tylenol poisonings, and the identity
of Anastasia.

CHEM 115(S) AIDS: The Disease and Search for a Cure
Since the discovery of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) in 1983, modern techniques of mo-
lecular biology have revealed much about its structure and life cycle. The intensity of the scientific in-
vestigation directed at HIV-1 is unprecedented in history. We now know more about this virus than any
other known pathogen. However, the early optimism concerning the prospects for an effective AIDS
vaccine has now waned and HIV strains that are resistant to drug therapies are common. We are now
nearly two decades into the AIDS pandemic and the World Health Organization estimates that there are
more than 50 million HIV-infected persons worldwide.
After an introduction to chemical structure, we examine the molecular biology of the HIV virus, the
molecular targets of anti-HIV drugs, and the prospects for a cure. We discuss the origin, epidemiology
and modes of transmission of HIV-1 and HIV-2, and look at how HIV-1 interacts with the human im-
mune system. We also discuss both old and new methods of vaccine development and the prospects for
making an effective AIDS vaccine.
This course is designed for the non-science major who does not intend to pursue a career in the natural
sciences.
Format: lecture, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on problem sets, two hour tests, quizzes,
and a final exam.
No prerequisites. No enrollment limit (expected: 50).

CHEM 341(S) Toxicology and Cancer (Same as Environmental Studies 341)
What is a poison and what makes it poisonous? Paracelcus commented in 1537: "What is not a poison?
All things are poisons (and nothing is without poison). The dose alone keeps a thing from being a poi-
son." Is the picture really this bleak; is modern technology-based society truly swimming in a sea of
toxic materials? How are the nature and severity of toxicity established, measured and expressed? Do all
toxic materials exert their effect in the same manner, or can materials be poisonous in a variety of differ-
ent ways? Are the safety levels set by regulatory agencies low enough for a range of common toxic
materials, such as mercury, lead, and certain pesticides? How are poisons metabolized and how do they
lead to the development of cancer? What is cancer and what does it take to cause it? What biochemical
defense mechanisms exist to counteract the effects of poisons?
This course attempts to answer these questions by surveying the fundamentals of modern chemical tox-
icology and the induction and progression of cancer. Topics will range from description and quantitation
of the toxic response, including risk assessment, to the basic mechanisms underlying toxicity, mutagene-
sis, carcinogenesis, and DNA repair. A basic understanding of organic chemistry will be required.

The course offerings in Classics enable students to explore the ancient Greek, Roman, and Greco-
Roman worlds from various perspectives: art, archaeology, philosophy, religion, and especially litera-
ture and history. Courses are of two types: language (Greek and Latin) and translation (Classical Civi-
lization). The 100-level language courses are intensive introductions to Greek and Latin grammar; the
200-level language courses combine comprehensive grammar review with readings from Greek or
Latin texts of pivotal historical periods; the 400-level language courses explore in depth selected au-
thors or topics and the methods of analysis appropriate to each of them. Courses in which texts are
read in translation provide both introductory surveys and opportunities for more specialized study of
the ancient Greco-Roman world from earliest historical times through late antiquity.
MAJOR
Majors and prospective majors are encouraged to consult with the department's faculty to ensure a
well-balanced and comprehensive selection of Classics courses appropriate to their individual inter-
ests. A course or courses in ancient history are strongly recommended. Majors may also benefit from
advice on courses offered in other departments which would complement their particular interests in
Classics. A reading knowledge of French, German, and Italian is useful for any study in Classics and
is required in at least two of these modern languages by graduate programs in classics, ancient history,
classical art and archaeology, and medieval studies.
The department offers two routes to the major: Classics and Classical Civilization.
Classics: (1) Six courses in Greek and/or Latin, with at least two 400-level courses in one language;
(2) Three additional courses, elected from the offerings in Greek, Latin, or Classical Civilization or
from approved courses in other departments.
Classical Civilization: (1) Either Classics 101 or 102, and either Classics 222 or 223; (2) Three
additional courses from the offerings in Classical Civilization or from approved courses in other de-
partments. (3) Three courses in Greek or Latin with at least one at the 400 level, or four courses in
Latin at any level. (4) A senior independent study is normally required to complete the Classical Civi-
lization major. Several of the courses elected, including the independent study, should relate to each
other in such a way as to reflect a concentration on a particular genre, period, or problem of Greek and
Roman civilization, including topics in ancient art and archaeology, religion in the Greco-Roman
world, and ancient philosophy.
In addition to the courses in Classical Civilization, appropriate courses from other departments or
from approved study abroad programs may be elected for the major. Examples of such courses, which
may vary from year to year, are ArtH 412 (Monsters and Narrative: Greek Architectural Sculpture),
Classics
­ 110 ­
ArtH 511 (Dionysos in Greek Art, Poetry, and Ritual), Political Science/Philosophy 231 (Ancient
Political Theory), and appropriate courses at the Intercollegiate Center for Classical Studies in Rome
or at another approved overseas program.
Senior Colloquium: In lieu of a semester-long major seminar, majors will participate in the Senior
Colloquium, a student-faculty discussion group that meets twice each semester during the senior year.
The meetings focus on critical readings in Classics, often in conjunction with a guest lecturer's visit.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN CLASSICS
Students who wish to be considered for the degree with honors will normally present a thesis or
pursue appropriate independent study in the fall and winter study of their senior year. This thesis or
independent study offers students an opportunity to work in depth on a topic of their choosing and to
apply and develop the techniques and critical methods with which they have become acquainted dur-
ing their regular course work. It may also include relevant work with members of other departments.
In order to write a thesis, students normally must have a minimum GPA of 3.3 in their major courses
and must submit a thesis proposal before the end of the spring semester of their junior year that earns
departmental approval. To be awarded the degree with honors in Classics, the student is required to
have taken a minimum of ten semester courses in the department (not including the thesis or indepen-
dent study) and to have demonstrated original or superior ability in studies in the field both through
course work and through the thesis or equivalent independent study.
COURSE NUMBERING SYSTEM
Language Courses: The numbering of these courses through the 200 level reflects the prerequisites
involved; the only prerequisite for any 400-level course is Greek 201 or Latin 202, or equivalent lan-
guage preparation. The numbering of the 400-level courses partially reflects the order in which they
are offered over a two-year period for Greek and a three-year period for Latin. It also indicates a good
order in which to take the 400-level courses but not an essential order, and individual students may
enter the sequence at any point. While not every student will take every course, the rotation of
400-level courses is arranged to permit exposure, in a three- to four-year period, to most of the impor-
tant periods and genres of classical studies.
Classical Civilization Courses: The numbering of these courses often suggests a recommended but
rarely necessary sequence of study within a given area of classical studies. Most of the translation
courses do not assume prior experience in Classics or a cross-listed field.

CLAS 102(F) Roman Literature (Same as Comparative Literature 108)
Modern fascination with the ancient Romans may be due in no small measure to modern assumptions
about the enduring influence of their civilization on our own. The very real continuities between our
distant cultures are certainly due in large part to the enormous impact of Roman on European literature.
Yet continuity is counterbalanced by significant cultural differences that are often overlooked in repre-
sentations of ancient Rome in today's literature, film, and television. We will read a variety of Roman
literary works in translation--epic, satire, lyric poetry, oratory, philosophy, historiography, and drama--
with an aim to both appreciating them as literature and gaining a deeper understanding of Roman culture
and society. Since a number of Roman authors were also important figures in Roman political life, we
are in an unusually good position to analyze how Roman literature delineates and deploys cultural
ideals, power structures, class hierarchies, political ideology, religious beliefs, categories of sex, gender
and difference, and the relationship between the individual and the state. Readings from Plautus, Ter-
ence, Lucretius, Cicero, Caesar, Catullus, Vergil, Horace, Ovid, Seneca, Tacitus, Suetonius, and Apu-
leius will be supplemented by critical essays and by movies (e.g., A Funny Thing Happened on the Way
to the Forum, Gladiator).
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on classroom participation, one or two short essays,
and midterm and final exams.
No prerequisities. Enrollment limit: 35 (expected: 35). Open to first-year students.

CLAS 224(S) Helen, Desire and Language (Same as Comparative Literature 244 and
Women's and Gender Studies 224) (W)
When Homer's Iliad introduces us to "Helen of Troy," she is a perfectly beautiful and baleful cause of
the Trojan War and, simultaneously, among its most sympathetic and innocent victims. In her struggle to
be a desiring agent and not simply the passive screen onto which others project their own desires, Helen
stands both inside the narrative, as a character created by it, and outside, as a commentator on the story
and her own role in it. Through Helen as much as any other character, the Iliad explores the relation
between logos and eros. Because Helen remains a key figure in Greek discourse of language and desire,
and of death, loss, memory, repetition and substitution, we will focus on texts in which Helen figures
prominently, including the Iliad and Odyssey, lyric poems by Sappho, Alcaeus, and Steisichorus, Aes-
chylus's Oresteia, Euripides's Helen, and Gorgias' Encomium of Helen, and we will consider Helen in
the graphic arts and religious cults. We will also venture into texts and arenas where Helen herself is not
prominent or even mentioned but where thematics familiar from stories involving her are at play, e.g.
Hesiod on the Muses, Pandora, Aphrodite, and Metis, several tragedies by Sophocles and Euripides, the
Athenian cult of Persuasion, women's roles in familial and communal cults, and (if time permits) Plato's
Symposium or Phaedrus.
Among the questions we will ask: Why do discussions of logos regularly become discussions of eros,
and vice-versa? Why do "feminine" activities--weaving, storing and preparing food, bearing children,
caring for the dead--and why do traits particularly associated in Greek culture with females--lying and
seductiveness, for instance--figure prominently in the discourse of logos and eros? Does this discourse
engender as "feminine" poets, texts, and characters who, like Achilles and Odysseus as well as Helen,
become "poets" within the texts that have created them? Where is "masculinity" located in this dis-
course?
Format: discussion with some short lectures. Requirements: active participation in class discussion, one
or two oral presentations, several shorter papers and a longer final paper (more than 20 pages total).
Students may devise a final paper involving later literature either about Helen or otherwise relevant to
the issues in this course.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 10). Preference will be given to students who have
previously studied some of the literature being read and to majors in Classics, Comparative Literature,
Literary Studies, English and other literatures and in Women's and Gender Studies.

CLAS 239(S) The Construction of Gender in Ancient Greece and Rome (Same as History
322 and Women's and Gender Studies 239)
The inferior political status and heavily circumscribed lives of women in ancient Greek and Roman so-
cieties have received extensive study in recent decades. Yet it is nearly impossible to understand
women's lives without also studying the often stringent cultural norms that governed men's lives as well.
This course seeks to understand these aspects of Greek and Roman societies over time as expectations
for the behaviors, priorities, and activities of both women and men evolved. While the impact of these
gendered expectations on the lives of men and women often varied considerably in kind and degree,
their interplay was at the same time often intricate, and many that constructed women's lives could only
be articulated with reference to corresponding expectations for men. Others emerged only during times
of crisis and could even involve a reversal of the usual roles of men and women. Some norms gave men
and women a shared experience that is rare in other societies.
We will explore these and related issues by reading widely in such ancient authors as Homer, Sappho,
Herodotus, the Greek tragedians, Greek and Roman philosophers, Vergil and other Latin poets, and Ro-
man didactic writers. We will also read modern scholarship on such subjects as the family, prostitution,
Classics

the exposure of unwanted infants, demography, and the anthropology of gender in both Greek and Ro-
man societies.

GREEK
CLGR 101(F)-102(S) Introduction to Greek
This full-year, intensive course presents the fundamentals of Greek grammar, syntax, and vocabulary
and introduces students, in the second semester, to works of the classical period (usually by Xenophon
and Euripides).
This course is designed for students who are beginning Greek or have studied less than two years of
Greek in secondary school. Credit is granted for the first semester only if the second semester is taken as
well. Students with some previous experience in Greek may want to enroll in CLGR 102 only. (Consult
the department.)

CLGR 201(F) Intermediate Greek
Reading of selections from Hesiod and from Plato, combined with grammar review. The primary goal of
this course is to develop fluency in reading Greek. We will also read the texts closely to explore impor-
tant continuities and changes in Greek culture between the archaic and classical periods. The emphasis
will vary from year to year, but possible subjects to be explored include: the education and socialization
of the community's children and young adults; religion and cult practices; the performative aspects of
epic (and choral) poetry and of prose genres like oratory and the philosophical dialogue; traditional oral
poetry and storytelling and the growth of literacy; the construction of woman, of man; the development
of the classical polis.

CLGR 406T(S) Coming of Age in the Polis (Same as Women's and Gender Studies 406T) (W)
Studying asociety's modes of rearing its young, and especially the ways it prepares and tests adolescents
for their "coming of age" into their adult roles, provides an excellent approach to exploring its funda-
mental values and institutional practices. Archaic and classical Greek literature not only reflects but ac-
tively reflects upon the socialization of boys and girls in the Greek polis. In this course we will read in
Greek selections from the Homeric Hymns to Demeter and Apollo and, in its entirety, a tragedy (e.g.,
Classics
­ 113 ­
Sophocles' Philoctetes), examining these texts through the lens of "coming of age." We will read in
English brief selections from Homeric epic and from elegiac and lyric poetry (monodic and choral), and
several Athenian tragedies and perhaps a comedy. We will also read critical literature on childrearing,
religious cults for boys and girls of different ages, and the role of dance, song and poetry in preparing the
young for their adult roles, particularly in fifth-century Athens.
Students will be divided into tutorial pairs chiefly according to their previous experience in Greek
courses. Students will meet with the instructor once a week either individually or in pairs to present their
translations of the Greek assigned for that week, and they will also meet once a week in pairs for the oral
presentation of written 5-page reports. At the latter meeting, each student will alternate between making
a formal presentation one week and, in the next week, offering an oral critique of the other student's
presentation.
Format: recitation/discussion. Evaluation will be based on the translations, reports, and critiques pre-
sented in the tutorial sessions.
Prerequisites: Greek 201 or permission of instructor. Enrollment: 10 (expected: 6-8).
Hour: 12:00-12:50 MWF HOPPIN
CLGR 407(F) The Sophists
This course considers the nature of the sophistic movement and its impact on Athens and Athenian au-
thors in the second half of the fifth century B.C.E. We will devote the first half of the term to developing
an understanding of the movement through selected readings, both in Greek and in translation, from the
extant fragments of Protagoras, Gorgias, Antiphon, and other sophistic thinkers; from those dialogues of
Plato (e.g., Protagoras, Symposium, Gorgias) and Xenophon (e.g., Memorabilia) that focus on the so-
phists and their relationship to Socrates; and from Thucydides ("Melian Dialogue") and Euripides (e.g.,
Hecuba), both of whom were profoundly influenced by the sophists. During the second half of the
course we will read, in Greek and in its entirety, Aristophanes' Clouds, with a focus on trying to under-
stand both the play itself and the complex relationship of its playwright to Socrates and the sophists. We
will also read, in translation, one or two other plays of Aristophanes (e.g., Birds, Frogs).
Format: seminar, with classes devoted primarily to translation and discussion of the texts we are reading.
Evaluation will be based on 75-minute midterm and final exams consisting primarily of translation of
assigned Greek texts, and above all on participation in class, presentation of oral reports, and a substan-
tial final paper.
Prerequisites: Greek 202 or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 7).

LATIN
CLLA 101(F)-102(S) Introduction to Latin
This is a full-year course on the fundamentals of the Latin language. The first semester and part of the
second emphasize learning basic grammar; the rest of the second semester is devoted to reading selec-
tions from Latin poetry (including Vergil's Aeneid and some Medieval Latin poetry, e.g., the Carmina
Burana) and from Latin prose (e.g., Pliny's Letters and/or the Vulgate Bible). This course is designed for
the student with no previous preparation in Latin or who has had only a little Latin and wishes a refresh-
er. Credit is granted for the first semester only if the second semester is taken as well. Students with some
previous experience in Latin may want to enroll in CLLA 102 only: consult the department.

ily at developing fluency in reading Latin. At the same time it acquaints students with one of the most
turbulent and important periods in Roman history and attends to the development of their interpretative
and analytic skills.
Format: recitation/discussion. Evaluation will be based on classroom performance, quizzes, a midterm,

this course attends to the development of students' analytic and interpretive skills. We will read selec-
tions from Ovid's Metamorphoses and from such early imperial prose as Livy's account of the early
republic or Petronius' Satyricon.

CLLA 405(F) Myth, Scandal, and Morality in Ancient Rome
Mythical stories of Rome's founding, which were formulated by many generations of Roman authors
and public figures, simultaneously served as a framework for these very thinkers to analyze and articu-
late Roman self-image in rich and creative ways; one who stands out among these figures is the Augus-
tan historian Livy. The "second founding" of the Republic by Augustus, and the careers of his succes-
sors, in turn gave later Roman writers like Tacitus fresh inspiration for Roman self-imagining and self-
analysis.
We will begin the semester in mythical Rome, reading selections from Book 1 of Livy's history which
present figures like Aeneas, the Trojan refugee whose arrival in Italy was conceptually crucial to Rome's
development and position in Italy and the Mediterranean; Romulus, by whom Rome was founded in an
act of fratricide; the Sabine women, whose nobility prevented a deadly war between their fathers and
their Roman kidnappers; and Lucretia, whose virtue and self-sacrifice led to the liberation of Rome from
a decadent and violent monarchy and to the founding of the Roman Republic. We will examine how
Livy deploys the storyteller's art to excite his readers' pathos, indignation, and sympathy; we will ex-
amine as well how Livy often filters his account of mythical Rome through the lens of his own time,
thereby constructing Rome's past through the Augustan present.
Writing more than a century after Livy, Tacitus offers a different view of Augustus, and his account of
the rude and dissolute Tiberius, the unscrupulous Livia, Rome's craven and dispirited senators, and the
many scandals attached to the imperial family, figures a Rome once again suffering under a decadent
monarchy. Tacitus's compressed, fastidious, inimitable prose is the vehicle for his stern yet often sardon-
ic psychological insights, which subtly manage to combine moral judgment with prurient pleasure in the
scandals of others.
Format: discussion. Evaluation will be based on class preparation and participation, an oral presentation,
one medium-length 8- to 10-page paper, a midterm, and a final exam.

CLLA 407(S) The Rhetoric of Cruelty
In no other period did the tensions and ambiguities inherent in Roman society manifest themselves more
acutely than in the first and early second century C.E., Rome's "Silver Age." It was frequently a violent
and cruel period in which absolute power could be exercised with a malignancy rarely plied since. Yet
this age also produced a literature often marked by profound humanity and by an inventiveness compa-
rable to that of the "Golden Age" a century before. The goal of this course is to gain some insight into the
paradoxes of this period. Reading selections in Latin and sometimes English from authors like Pliny the
Younger, Seneca, Petronius, Lucan, Persius, Juvenal, Martial, Statius, and Tacitus, we will examine the
social and political conditions of writing in this period, and we will consider the degree to which these
authors were aware of, and indeed played with, the hierarchies created by literary canons and reflected in
epithets like "golden" and "silver."
Format: recitation/discussion. Evaluation will be based on preparation for each class, classroom perfor-
mance, a midterm, several short essays and/or a final paper, and a final exam. Oral presentations may be

COGNITIVE SCIENCE (Div. II)
Chair, Associate Professor KRIS N. KIRBY
Advisory Committee: Professors: GERRARD, H. WILLIAMS*. Associate Professors: DANY-
LUK***, KIRBY. Assistant Professors: CRUZ, ZAKI.
Cognitive science is concerned with how humans, non-human animals, and computers acquire,
represent, manipulate, and use information. As an interdisciplinary field it combines research and
theory from computer science (e.g., artificial intelligence), cognitive psychology, philosophy, linguis-
tics, and neuroscience, and to some extent evolutionary biology, math, and anthropology. Complex
issues of cognition are not easily addressed using traditional intra-disciplinary tools. Cognitive re-
searchers in any discipline typically employ a collection of analytic and modeling tools from across
traditional disciplinary boundaries. Thus, the methods and research agenda of cognitive science is
broader than those of any of the fields that have traditionally contributed to cognitive science. The
Cognitive Science Program is designed to provide students with the broad interdisciplinary founda-
tion needed to approach issues of cognition.
THE CONCENTRATION
The concentration in Cognitive Science consists of six courses, including an introductory course,
four electives, and a senior research project.
Minds, Brains, and Intelligent Behavior (COGS 222) is the entry-point into the concentration,
and provides an interdisciplinary perspective on issues of cognition. Ideally, it should be taken before
the end of the sophomore year. Emphasizing the highly interdisciplinary nature of the field, the four
electives must be distributed over at least three course prefixes. In the fall of the senior year, concen-
trators will conduct interdisciplinary Research in Cognitive Science (COGS 493), supervised by
members of the advisory committee from at least two departments.
REQUIRED COURSES
Cognitive Science 222 Minds, Brains, and Intelligent Behavior: An Introduction to Cognitive Science

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN COGNITIVE SCIENCE
Formal admission to candidacy for honors will occur at the end of the fall semester of the senior
year and will be based on promising performance in COGS 493. This program will consist of COGS
Cognitive Science, Comparative Literature
­ 116 ­
W031-494(S), and will be supervised by members of the advisory committee from at least two depart-
ments. Presentation of a thesis, however, should not be interpreted as a guarantee of a degree with honors.
COGS 222(S) Minds, Brains, and Intelligent Behavior: An Introduction to Cognitive Science
(Same as INTR 222, Philosophy 222 and Psychology 222) (Q)
This course will emphasize interdisciplinary approaches to the study of intelligent systems, both natural
and artificial. Cognitive science synthesizes research from cognitive psychology, computer science, lin-
guistics, neuroscience, and contemporary philosophy. Special attention will be given to the philosophi-
cal foundations of cognitive science, information theory, symbolic and connectionist architectures, the
neural basis of cognition, perception, learning and memory, language, action, reasoning, expert systems,
and artificial intelligence.
Requirements: several short papers and self-paced weekly lab exercises.
Prerequisites: Psychology 101 or Philosophy 102 or Computer Science 134 or permission of instruc-
tors. Background in more than one of these is recommended. Enrollment limit: 25 (expected: 25).
Satisfies one semester of the Division II requirement.

scholarly paper, empirical research, computer or mathematical modeling, or any combination of the
above. Students will meet biweekly to discuss their projects, and give oral presentations of their pro-
jects at the end of the fall semester.

COMPARATIVE LITERATURE (Div. I)
Chair, Professor GAIL M. NEWMAN
Professors: DRUXES, GOLDSTEIN, B. KIEFFER, LIMON, NEWMAN, ROUHI*, STAMEL-

Students motivated by a desire to study literature in the broadest terms, as well as those interested in
particular examples of literary comparison, will find an intellectual home in the Program in Compara-
tive Literature. The Program in Comparative Literature gives students the opportunity to develop their
critical faculties through the analysis of literature in its international and multicultural context. By
crossing national, linguistic, historical, and disciplinary boundaries, students of Comparative Litera-
ture learn to read texts for the ways they make meaning, the assumptions that underlie that meaning,
and the aesthetic elements evinced in the making. Students of Comparative Literature are encouraged
to examine the widest possible range of literary communication, including the metamorphosis of
genres, forms, and themes.
Whereas specific literature programs allow the student to trace the development of one literature in
a particular culture over a period of time, Comparative Literature juxtaposes the writings of different
cultures and epochs in a variety of ways. The rubrics of the Program's core courses--Literary Genres,
Literary Movements, Literature and Theory, and Cultural Studies--introduce the student to a variety
of critical methods. Because interpretive methods from other disciplines play a crucial role in investi-
gating literature's larger context, the Program offers courses intended for students in all divisions of
the college and of all interests. These include courses that introduce students to the comparative study
of world literature and courses designed to enhance any foreign language major in the Williams cur-
riculum. In addition, the English Department allows students to count one course with a COMP prefix
as an elective within the English major.
The Program supports two distinct majors in Comparative Literatureand Literary Studies. The ma-
jor in Comparative Literature requires advanced work in at least one language other than English and
is strongly recommended for students contemplating graduate study in the discipline. Both majors
provide a strong basis for any career demanding analytical, interpretive, and evaluative skills and al-
low the student, within a framework of general requirements, to create a program of study primarily
shaped by the student's own interests.
MAJORS
Comparative Literature
The Comparative Literature major combines the focused study of a single national-language litera-
ture with a wide-ranging exploration of literary forms across national, linguistic, and historical bound-
Comparative Literature
­ 117 ­
aries. Each student declaring the major must select a single foreign language as his or her specialty,
although the serious study of literature in foreign languages other than the student's specialty is
strongly encouraged. The languages currently available are French, German, Ancient Greek, Latin,
Russian, and Spanish. Each student will also be paired with a faculty advisor with whom the student
will meet each semester to discuss how best to fulfill the requirements for the major.
Eleven courses are required for the major:

Three courses in which most of the course work concerns literature other than that of the stu-
dent's specialty language or literary theory. These courses may be selected from Comparative
Literature offerings or from other departments and must be approved by the student's major
advisor. Only one may be in English or American literature. Among the offerings of other de-
partments that are possible, the following employ readings in English translation and are espe-
cially appropriate to the major:

Comparative Literature 402 Senior Seminar (variable topics)
Students who are considering a major in Comparative Literature should aim to acquire intermedi-
ate-level proficiency in their specialty language by the end of the sophomore year. They should also
complete core course requirements by the end of their junior year. Students pursuing the Comparative
Literature major are strongly encouraged to study abroad during their junior year and may receive
major credit for up to 4 courses taken during study abroad. At least three courses towards the major
must be at the 300 level or above. Students are expected to take the version of 402 offered in their
senior year, even if they have previously taken 402.
Literary Studies
The Literary Studies major allows for a wide-ranging exploration of literary forms across national,
linguistic, and historical boundaries. Unlike the major in Comparative Literature, the Literary Studies
major does not require the student to choose a specialty language, although the serious study of litera-
ture in one or more foreign languages is strongly encouraged. Each student will be paired with a facul-
ty advisor, with whom the student will meet each semester to discuss how best to fulfill the require-
ments for the major.
Eleven courses are required for the major:
Comparative Literature 111 The Nature of Narrative (Literary Genres)
Any four of the following core courses:
Comparative Literature 221 The Poetry of Everyday Life: Twentieth-Century European Poets (Liter-
ary Genres)

al traditions. The courses may be selected from Comparative Literature offerings or from other de-
partments and must be approved by the student's major advisor. Of the courses taken outside of the
Program in Comparative Literature, no more than two may have the same course prefix. Students
are strongly encouraged to include courses in a foreign language among these five. Among the of-
ferings of other departments that are possible, the following employ readings in English translation
and are especially appropriate to the major:

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN COMPARATIVE LITERATURE OR LITERARY STUDIES
To achieve honors in Comparative Literature or Literary Studies, a student must prepare a thesis,
usually 50-75 pages long, during the senior year (COMP 493-W031-494 or LIT 493-W031-494). The
topic of the thesis must be comparative and/or theoretical in approach. Those majoring in Compara-
tive Literature must include a significant amount of material in the literature of the student's specialty
language. Students must apply to the Program's advisory committee for permission to pursue an hon-
ors thesis during the spring semester of the junior year.

COMP 213(F) Migrants at the Borders: Contemporary Arabic and Latin American
Literature and Film (Same as International Studies 213)*
Why do the peoples and cultures of Latin America and the Middle East often elicit such passionate re-
sponses in the United States and Europe? Some feel threatened, while others are intrigued, but responses
to these world regions are seldom neutral. Often seen as exotic and erotic, or as a danger to the way of
life of Americans and Europeans, Islam, Arabs and Latin Americans are at the forefront of socio-politi-
cal debates in the United States and Europe. This is largely due to migration and world politics. After
characterizing Islam as the greatest contemporary threat to "Western" civilization in his infamous essay
titled "The Clash of Civilizations," Samuel Huntington now sees Latinos as the greatest threat to Ameri-
can civilization. By examining literature and film from the Middle East and Latin America, and from
these immigrant communities in the United States and Europe, we will go beyond superficial images
and inflammatory rhetoric to explore the cultures behind the passions. Among other things, the texts of
this course examine the ties between the Arab world and Latin America, and between these two regions
and their neighbors to the north. At the heart of this course are the ideas of borders and margins. What
does it mean to cross borders or to live on the margins of society? The borders we will discuss will be
geographic borders, but also cultural borders that will permit the exploration of the territories between
life and death, civilization and barbarism, wealth and poverty, war and peace and other dichotomies that
some employ to classify the world but that rarely allow for human sensibilities and the subtle experi-
ences of being. Our texts include works by writers such as Gloria Anzaldua, Juan Rulfo, Clarice Lispec-
tor, Milton Hatoum, Mohamad Choukri, Hoda Barakat, Naguib Mahfouz and Tayyib Saleh that treat the
human condition at the borders/margins of society. Films include El Norte, The Mission, Pixote, Midaq
Alley,City of God,Battle of Algiers,A Door to the Sky,Y tu mamá también,Summer in La Goulette,Hate
and Ali Zaoua. There will also be a course reader. All readings are in English translation and films have

COMP 219(S) Venice: City of Stone, Water, and Dreams (Same as Italian 219)
The course will examine the "imaginary" that Venice has generated in art, architecture, literature, and
film from the early Renaissance to the end of the millennium. This "imaginary"--a combination of
image, myth, symbol, ideology, history, culture, aesthetics, reality, fantasy, and fascination--has envel-
oped Venice in an aura of paradoxes. The city is touched by mystery and melancholy, mist and clarity,
water and sky, light and gloom, transparence and opacity, wonder and fear, decadence and spirituality,
mirror and mask, carnival and sobriety, labyrinth and horizon, sensuality and artifice, wave and stone,
movement and immobility, and commerce and art. Why has this watery city--this "ship of stone," this
"serenissima," this "most stupendous . . . most far-reaching of humanist creations" (Adrian Stokes) at
the intersection of East and West, this "unquenchable flame burning through a veil of water" (D'Annun-
zio)--so fascinated writers, artists, travelers, and traders for so many centuries? In what different ways
and through what different images has it been represented (in painting, photography, novel, mystery,
poem, travel narrative, film, etc.) over time and how have these aesthetic and cultural representations
differed and yet remained the same? All readings in English.

COMP 221(F) The Poetry of Everyday Life: Twentieth-Century European Poets (W)
The course will be a comparative study of modern poetry as written in the twentieth century, and espe-
cially since World War II, by European poets of various national backgrounds as they have come to
confront different historical events, lyrical traditions, and personal experiences and as they have medi-
tated poetically on the reality of everyday things, on the nature of perception and language, on the insta-
bility of the poetic self, and on poetry's unique power to understand and give meaning to the mysteries of
human life. From England, we will study the postcolonial writings of the West-Indian poet Derek Wal-
cott and the Darwinian atavism of Ted Hughes; from France, the celebration of trivial phenomena
(oranges, shells, insects, blackberries) of Francis Ponge and the machine-age poetry of Guillaume Apol-
linaire; from Germany, the mystical works of Rainer Maria Rilke and the post-Holocaust and dialogical
poems of Paul Celan; from Ireland, the poetry of political, feminist, and domestic struggle of Eavan
Boland and Seamus Heaney; from Italy, the crystalline lyrics of Eugenio Montale; from Portugal, the
heteronymic poetry of Fernando Pessoa; and from Russia, the acmeist work of Osip Mandelstam. Stu-
dents will also read theoretical and critical essays on poetry and poetics by these poets and others. All
readings in English.

COMP 232(S) European Modernism
This seminar will explore literary and cultural modernism as an international phenomenon from 1860 to
the 1970s. In the context of the profound social and historical transformations of Western culture in this
period, we will examine the works of literary, cinematic, and theoretical creators who have shaped our
"modernity": namely, the consciousness we have of ourselves, of the worlds we live in, and of the tem-
poral rhythms that determined the cadence of late nineteenth and twentieth-century life. Readings will
include: Baudelaire, Rimbaud, Dostoevsky, Ibsen, Freud, Proust, Kafka, Apollinaire, Marinetti, Rilke,
Pirandello, Breton, Mann, Woolf, Joyce, Beckett, Celan, Calvino, and Duchamp among others.
Theoretical essays by Benjamin, Bataille, and Barthes will be considered as well. We will investigate the
imaginative and aesthetic response of modernism (in its cubist, futurist, surrealist, existentialist, and
feminist forms) to urban alienation and the rise of the machine. Attention will be given as well to mod-
ernism's attack against religion and other forms of traditional spirituality, its revolt against rationality
and social convention, its reaction to the horror and despair of world war, its attempt to empower the
female voice, its acceptance of a fragmented notion of self, its privileging of multiple perspectives of
perception and narration, its rejection of the past, its embracing of the present, and its metamorphosis
into postmodernism. All readings in English.

(See under English for full description.)
COMP 242(S) Science and Literature (Same as History of Science 242)
What is the difference between science and fiction? The answer may seem intuitive to you, but this is a
question that has inspired fierce debate since the Renaissance, when critics first tried to define this
strange new thing called science and separate it from poetry. The controversy continues into the twen-
tieth century: while some literary critics have struggled to turn literature into an objective science like
physics, at the same time radical philosophers of science have asserted that scientific discourse itself is a
kind of fiction. This course investigates the blurry boundary between science and literature from the
perspective of critical theory, by examining some of the aesthetic philosophies that have tried to separate
or relate the two. Texts will be drawn from several of the following areas: classical criticism (Plato, Aris-
totle), Empiricism (Locke, Reynolds), theories of the sublime (Longinus, Addison, Burke, Kant, Schil-
ler, Nietzsche), American New Criticism, critiques of modernism and postmodernism (Baudrillard, Ly-
otard, Jameson, Karatani, Hayles), and/or philosophy of science (Kuhn, Feyerabend). As our test cases,
we will also look at a sampling of fiction that seeks to cross or confuse the line between literature and
science, by authors like Abe Kôbô, Philip K. Dick, Don DeLillo, William Gibson, Mark Leyner, and/or
Thomas Pynchon. All readings in English.

COMP 251T(F) War in Modern Literature (W)
This tutorial considers literary representations of war, with emphasis on wars fought by Europe and the
U.S. from the nineteenth century to the present: the Napoleonic Wars, the Crimean War, the U.S. Civil
War, World Wars I and II, the Vietnam War, and the War on Terror. Despite this contemporary focus, we
begin our readings with Homer's Iliad, as the foundational text for exploring the relationships among
warfare, representation and cultural memory in the West. Topics to be explored throughout the semester
include: the textualization of violence (including psychoanalytical approaches to the writing of trauma),
the place of war in national imaginaries (including the cultural, political, and spiritual functions that me-
morials to the war dead perform), the ethics of representing violence and suffering from various perspec-
tives and degrees of direct participation, the ideology of military mobilization and the cultural changes it
produces, and the implications of war for gendered relationships, including sexual violence and the
sexualization of violence. Readings may include the work of Homer, Stendhal, Tolstoy, Conrad, Roa
Bastos, Woolf,Greene, Heller, and Sontag. All readings in English.

COMP 258T(S) Reading Family Stories (W)
The sort of family we now regard as natural and eternal-two loving parents focused on nurturing a few
children toward personal independence-is in fact thoroughly grounded in a particular sociohistorical sit-
uation. The nuclear family emerged in Europe in the mid- to late-eighteenth century, as the household
economy, with its extended "family" of apprentices, farm hands, or servants and its combined work/
family living space, gave way to the separation of work and home, production and (emotional as well as
biological) reproduction. This tutorial will be concerned with how the family writes and "reads" or inter-
prets its own stories. First, we will explore these issues in general, examining closely some of the charac-
teristic plots and character configurations that form the bedrock of familial self-definition, focusing on
the nineteenth century, including literature by Lessing, Mary Shelley, Kleist, Hawthorne, Hoffmann,
Comparative Literature
­ 122 ­
Austen, Flaubert, Turgenev, Maupassant, Hauptmann, and Tolstoy. Then, we will turn to our own era as
another transitional time in the development of the family, discussing narratives that enact experimenta-
tion with other forms of family relationship. Readings for the last part of the course will be chosen by
students together with the instructor; in addition, students might write one paper in which they explore
the ways in which they or other members of their families engage with reading their own family. All
readings in English.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: Students meet weekly with a tutorial partner and the instructor to dis-
cuss one student's paper and the other student's response. Each student writes five 5-page arguments and

To bring the all too familiar everyday to our attention, artists and writers have made it strange. What
happens when we view everyday life from elsewhere? While everyday culture has often been experi-
enced as repressive and alienating in modern Western societies, a new importance assigned to everyday
life was seen as liberating in Japan during the twenties and in contemporary China. The contours of the
everyday are delightfully vague, and it always exceeds theorizing. For instance, is its privileged place
the street or the home? Is it lived largely in institutions that regulate our daily lives, or is it lived between
and outside them? Everyday commodities like sugar, the car, standardized housing, and the postcard
will be analyzed. Fiction by Flaubert, Tolstoy, Kafka, Woolf, Perec, Saramago, Suri, Ha Jin, and Yoshi-
moto. Several films will also be discussed. Theory may include excerpts from Freud, Kracauer, Gof-
fman, Lefebvre, de Beauvoir, Friedan, Barthes, Foucault, and Bourdieu. All readings in English.

Computers play an enormously important role in our society. General-purpose computers are used
widely in business and industry and are found in an increasing number of homes. Special-purpose
computers are found in everything from automobile engines to microwave ovens. Understanding and
exploiting the great potential of computers is the goal of research in computer science. Among the
many fascinating research projects in progress in computer science today are investigations of: ways
to focus more computational power on a problem through the simultaneous use of many processors in
parallel; revolutionary computer languages designed to simplify the process of constructing complex
programs for computers; the use of computer-generated graphic images in the arts and as a tool for
visualization in the natural sciences; and the use of digital methods in global communications. The
Computer Science Department at Williams seeks to provide students with an understanding of the
principles underlying computer science that will enable them to understand and participate in these
exciting developments.
The department recognizes that students' interests in computer science will vary widely. The de-
partment attempts to meet these varying interests through: (1) its major; (2) a selection of courses in-
tended primarily for those who are interested in a brief introduction to computer science or who seek
to develop some specific expertise in computing for application in some other discipline; and (3) rec-
ommendations for possible sequences of courses for the non-major who wants a more extensive
introduction to computer science. These offerings are discussed in detail below.
MAJOR
The goal of the major is to provide an understanding of algorithmic problem-solving as well as the
conceptual organization of computers and complex programs running on them. Emphasis is placed on
Computer Science
­ 124 ­
the fundamental principles of computer science, building upon the mathematical and theoretical ideas
underlying these principles. The introductory and core courses build a broad and solid base for under-
standing computer science. The more advanced courses allow students to sample a variety of special-
ized areas of computer science including graphics, artificial intelligence, computer networks, soft-
ware engineering, compiler design, and operating systems. Independent study and honors work pro-
vide opportunities for students to study and conduct research on topics of special interest.
The major in Computer Science equips students to take advantage of awide variety of career oppor-
tunities. Thus the major can be used as a preparation for a career in computing, for graduate school, or
simply to provide an in-depth study of computer science for the student whosefuturecareerwillonly
tangentially be related to computer science.
MAJOR REQUIREMENTS
Required Courses in Computer Science
A minimum of 8 courses is required in Computer Science, including the following:
Introductory Courses
Computer Science 134 Introduction to Computer Science
Computer Science 136 Data Structures and Advanced Programming
Core Courses
Computer Science 237 Computer Organization
Computer Science 256 Algorithm Design and Analysis
Computer Science 334 Principles of Programming Languages
Computer Science 361 Theory of Computation
Electives
Two or more electives (bringing the total number of Computer Science courses to at least 8) chosen
from 300- or 400-level courses in Computer Science. At least one of these must be a course designated
as a PROJECT COURSE. Computer Science courses with 9 as the middle digit (reading, research, and
thesis courses) will normally not be used to satisfy the elective requirements. Students may petition the
department to waive this restriction with good reasons.
Required Courses in Mathematics
Mathematics 211 Linear Algebra
Mathematics 251 Discrete Mathematics
Students considering pursuing a major in Computer Science are urged to take Computer Science
134 and to begin satisfying their mathematics requirements early. Note in particular that Mathematic
251 covers material complementing that in the introductory courses (Computer Science 134 and 136)
and is a prerequisite for many advanced courses.
Students who take Computer Science 105, 106, 108 or 109 may use that course as one of the two
electives required for the major in Computer Science. Those who count Computer Science 109 to-
ward the major must select an elective different from Computer Science 371 (Computer Graphics) for
their project course. Similarly, students who count Computer Science 108 as an elective cannot select
Computer Science 373 as their second elective, and Computer Science 315 may not be used as a sec-
ond elective in conjunction with Computer Science 106. Computer Science 105, 106, 108, 109, and
134 are not open to students who have taken a Computer Science course numbered 136 or higher.
To be eligible for admission to the major, a student must normally have completed Computer Sci-
ence 136 as well as Mathematics 251 by the end of the sophomore year. Mathematics 211 must be
completed by the end of the junior year. Students are urged to have completed two of the four core
courses (Computer Science 237, 256, 334, and 361) by the end of the sophomore year and must nor-
mally have completed at least three out of the four core courses by the end of the junior year.
Satisfactory participation is required in the Computer Science Colloquium by all senior majors.
With the advance permission of the department, two appropriate mathematics courses numbered 240
or above may be substituted for one Computer Science elective. Other variations in the required
courses, adapting the requirements to the special needs and interests of the individual student, may be
arranged in consultation with the department.
Potential majors are strongly encouraged to pick up the latest copy of the Informal Guide to
Courses in Computer Science, which can be obtained from the departmental office or on the World
Wide Web at http://www.cs.williams.edu. This document contains much more information on the ma-
jor, including suggested patterns of course selection and advice on courses relevant to different stu-
dent goals.
LABORATORY FACILITIES
The Computer Science Department maintains two departmental computer laboratories for students
taking Computer Science courses. The Macintosh laboratory (used in Computer Science 105, 106,
108, 109, 134, 136, and 237) consists of an electronic classroom containing Macintosh G4 computers.
This laboratory also contains projection facilities enabling the instructor to display the computer
screen during lectures and demonstrations.
Computer Science
­ 125 ­
The Unix laboratory (used in courses numbered 136 and above) consists of a network of worksta-
tions that are available exclusively to students taking advanced Computer Science courses. These
workstations also support student and faculty research in computer science.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE
The degree with honors in Computer Science is awarded to a student who has demonstrated out-
standing intellectual achievement in a program of study which extends beyond the requirements of
the regular major. The principal considerations in recommending a student for the degree with honors
will be: mastery of core material, ability to pursue independent study of computer science, originality
in methods of investigation, and creativity in research. Honors study is highly recommended for those
students with strong academic records in computer science who wish to attend graduate school, pur-
sue high-level industrial positions in computing, or who would simply like to experience research in
computer science.
Prospective honors students are urged to consult with their departmental advisor at the time of reg-
istration in the spring of the sophomore or at the beginning of the junior year to arrange a program of
study that could lead to the degree with honors. Such a program normally consists of Computer Sci-
ence 493 and 494 and a WSP of independent research under the guidance of a Computer Science fac-
ulty member, culminating in a thesis which is judged acceptable by the department. The program pro-
duces a significant piece of written work. The written work often includes a major computer program,
depending on the nature of the honors work. All honors candidates are required to give an oral presen-
tation of their work in the Computer Science Colloquium in early spring semester.
Students considering honors work should obtain permission from the department before register-
ing in the fall of the senior year. Formal admission to candidacy occurs at the beginning of the spring
semester of the senior year and is based on promising performance in the fall semester and winter
study units of honors work. Recommendations for the degree with honors will be made for outstand-
ing performance in the three honors courses. Highest honors will be recommended for students who
have displayed exceptional ability, achievement, or originality.
INTRODUCTORY COURSES
The department offers a choice of five introductory courses--Computer Science 105:Understand-
ing the Web: Technologies and Techniques, Computer Science 106: Life as an Algorithm, Computer
Science 108: Artificial Intelligence: Image and Reality, Computer Science 109: The Art and Science
of Computer Graphics, and Computer Science 134: Introduction to Computer Science.
Computer Science 134 provides an introduction to computer science with a focus on developing
computer programming skills. These skills are essential to most upper-level courses in the depart-
ment. As a result, Computer Science 134 together with Computer Science 136 are required as a pre-
requisite to most advanced courses in the department. Those students intending to take several Com-
puter Science courses are urged to take Computer Science 134 early.
Those students interested in learning more about important new ideas and developments in Com-
puter Science, but not necessarily interested in developing extensive programming skills, should con-
sider Computer Science 105: Understanding the Web: Technologies and Techniques, Computer Sci-
ence 106: Life as an Algorithm, Computer Science 108: Artificial Intelligence: Image and Reality, or
Computer Science 109: The Art and Science of Computer Graphics. Computer Science 105 explores
the computing technology that underlies the internet. Computer Science 106 explores models and
theories shared between computer science and biology. Computer Science 108 discusses the tech-
niques used to construct computer systems that exhibit intelligent behavior from learning to planning
and problem-solving. Computer Science 109 introduces students to the techniques of computer
graphics used for the creation of artistic images. In addition, all four of these courses provide an
introduction to the techniques of computer programming.
Although none of our introductory courses assume prior programming skills, some students plan-
ning to take Computer Science 134 who have no prior programming experience may find it useful to
gain some programming experience together with a broader understanding of our field by taking one
of the department's other introductory courses before enrolling in Computer Science 134. On the oth-
er hand, students with significant programming experience should consider electing Computer Sci-
ence 136 (see "Advanced Placement" below). Students in either of these categories are encouraged to
contact a member of the department for guidance is selecting a first course.
ADVANCED PLACEMENT
Students with an extensive background in computer science are urged to take the Advanced Place-
ment AB Examination in Computer Science. A score of 4 or better on the AB exam is normally re-
quired for advanced placement in Computer Science 136. Students scoring 3 or lower on that exam or
who have taken the Advanced Placement A Examination in Computer Science should consider enrol-
ling in Computer Science 134.
Students who wish to be placed in Computer Science 136 but who have not taken the Advanced
Placement Examination should consult with the department. Such students should have had a good
course in computer science using a structured language such as C++ or Java, and should have covered
such topics as recursion, arrays, files, and have some exposure to object-orientation.

PLANS OF STUDY FOR NON-MAJORS
The faculty in Computer Science believes that students can substantially enrich their academic ex-
perience by completing a coherent plan of study in one or more disciplines outside of their majors.
With this in mind, we have attempted to provide students majoring in other departments with options
in our department's curriculum ranging fromtwo-coursesequences to collections of courses equiva-
lent to what would constitute a minor at institutions that recognize such a concentration. Students in-
terested in designing such a plan of study in any department should discuss their plans in detail with a
member of thefaculty.Wewelcomesuchinquiriesfromstudents.Toassiststudents making such plans,
however, we include some suggestions below.
Students seeking to develop an extensive knowledge of computer science without majoring in the
department are encouraged to use the major requirements as a guide. In particular, the four core
courses required of majors are intended to provide a broad knowledge of topics underlying all of com-
puter science. Students seeking a concentration in Computer Science are urged to complete at least
two of these courses followed by one of our upper-level electives. Such a program would typically
require the completion of a total of five computer science courses and one course in mathematics
(MATH 251).
There are several sequences of courses appropriate for those primarily interested in developing
skills in programming for use in other areas. For general programming, Computer Science 134 fol-
lowed by Computer Science 136 and 237 will provide students with a strong background in algorithm
and data structure design together with an understanding of issues of correctness and efficiency. Com-
puter Science 323 provides valuable exposure to the techniques and tools needed for the development
and maintenance of large software systems. Students of the program are encouraged to take Computer
Science 106 and 134 at a minimum, and should consider Computer Science 136 and 256. The se-
quence of courses Computer Science 109 and 134 would provide sufficient competence in computer
graphics for many students interested in applying such knowledge either in the arts or sciences. For
students requiring more expertise in the techniques of computer graphics, Computer Science 136 and
371 could be added to form a four-course sequence.
There are, of course, many other alternatives. We encourage interested students to consult with the
department chair or other members of the department's faculty.
GENERAL REMARKS
Divisional Requirements
All Computer Science courses listed may be used to satisfy the Division III distribution require-
ment.
Alternate Year Courses
Computer Science 106, 108, 109, 315, 323, 336, 337T, 338T, 371, 373, 432, and 434 are each nor-
mally offered every other year. All other Computer Science courses are normally offered every year.
Course Numbering
The increase from 100, through 200 and 300, to 400 indicates in most instances an increasing level
of maturity in the subject that is expected of students. Within a series, numeric order does not indicate
the relative level of difficulty of courses. Rather, the middle digit of the course number (particularly in
upper-level courses) generally indicates the area of computer science covered by the course.
Course Descriptions
Brief descriptions of the courses in Computer Science can be found below. More detailed informa-
tion on the offerings in the department is available in the Informal Guide to Courses in Computer Sci-
ence.
Courses Open on a Pass-Fail Basis
Students taking a computer science course on a pass-fail basis must meet all the requirements set
for students taking the course on a graded basis.
With the permission of the department, any course offered by the department may be taken on a
pass-fail basis. Courses graded with the pass-fail option may not be used to satisfy any of the major or
honors requirements. However, with the permission of the department, courses taken in the depart-
ment beyond those requirements may be taken on a pass-fail basis.
COURSES INTENDED PRIMARILY FOR NON-MAJORS
CSCI 105(F, S) Understanding the Web: Technologies and Techniques (Q)
This course will enable students to understand the technology that underlies the World Wide Web and
provide them with the skills needed to effectively use this new medium. The course introduces tech-
niques for creating hypermedia documents on the web. Students will learn the basics of HTML, the for-
matting language used to author World Wide Web documents, and a subset of Java, a language that can
be used to add interactive elements to web pages. The technology that makes the Web possible is devel-
oping as rapidly as its use is growing. New facilities are introduced frequently. Web "standards" are
evolving in several directions simultaneously as vendors introduce competing proposals. Accordingly,
Computer Science
­ 127 ­
rather than simply learning how to use the Web as it is today, we will also examine the fundamental
technologies that make the Web possible. These include digital encoding techniques, computer network
organization, communication protocols and encryption systems. This material will leave students pre-
pared to understand future possibilities for, and obstacles to, the development of the Internet.
Format: lecture/laboratory. Evaluation will be based on homework, laboratory work and examinations.
55% of a student's final grade will be determined by performance on examinations.
Prerequisites: Mathematics 100/101/102 (or demonstrating proficiency in the Quantitative Studies diag-
nostic test--see catalog under Mathematics). This course is not open to students who have successfully
completed a Computer Science course numbered 136 or above. Enrollment limit: 60 (expected: 40).

CSCI 106(S) Life as an Algorithm (Same as Biology 106) (Q)
Can computers reproduce? Can DNA compute? Can evolution give us hints on solving big problems? Is
life's blueprint inefficient? This course looks at the way computers are shaped by biological thinking,
and the way that biologists make use of computational theories. Topics range from artificial life to identi-
fication of genes to the susceptibility of machines to viruses. Lectures investigate new and novel ways of
thinking about computers and biology. Labs experiment with parameters of problems of common inter-
est to computer scientists and biologists. Students will learn to use common programming tools to aid in
the manipulation and analysis of basic biological data.
Format: lecture/laboratory. Evaluation will be based on performance on problem sets, laboratory assign-
ments, and examinations.

CSCI 108(F) Artificial Intelligence: Image and Reality (Q)
Over 50 years ago, scientists began to envision a world where computers and humans could converse. In
1956 the field of "Artificial Intelligence" was officially born, and the work on "AI" began in earnest.
Walking and talking robots are still mostly the stuff of science fiction, but AI is close to making them
reality. In this course, we will explore the field of Artificial Intelligence. We will try to answer the ques-
tion "what makes a machine intelligent?" Among the systems we will explore in lecture will be game-
playing systems, systems that learn from their environments, and systems that create plans for complex
tasks. Underlying all the topics addressed in this course will be two fundamental issues: How can infor-
mation be represented in a computer so that the machine is able to make use of it? How can the system
manipulate that information so that it is able to perform a task that requires intelligence? This course will
emphasize hands-on laboratory experience. Laboratory projects will focus on the building and program-
ming of simple robots.
Format: lecture/laboratory. Evaluation will be based on weekly laboratory programming assignments,
four problem sets, short papers, and a final examination having similar format to the problem sets.
This course does not assume any programming experience, but assumes that the student is comfortable
working with a computer. This course is not open to students who have successfully completed a Com-
puter Science course numbered 136 or above. Enrollment limit: 18 (expected: 18). Preference given to
first-year students and sophomores.
Hour: 10:00-10:50 MWF Lab: 1-2:30 R DANYLUK
COURSES INTENDED FOR BOTH NON-MAJORS AND MAJORS
CSCI 134(F,S) Introduction to Computer Science (Q)
More than the processor inside, it is the software running on a computer that determines the machine's
behavior and usefulness. In this course, students will learn principles of design, implementation, and
testing of object-oriented programs. Using the Java programming language, we will cover fundamental
concepts including classes, objects, message sending, control structures, arrays, files, and event-driven
programming, as well as providing an introduction to concurrency. Through the study of these topics,
students will learn both to construct programs of their own and to understand the capabilities and limita-
tions of existing software.
Format: lecture/laboratory. Evaluation will be based on weekly programming assignments, two test pro-
grams, and midterm and final examinations.
Prerequisites: Mathematics 100/101/102 (or demonstrating proficiency in the Quantitative Studies diag-
nostic test--see catalog under Mathematics). Previous programming experience is not required. Stu-
dents with prior experience with object-oriented programming should discuss appropriate course place-
ment with members of the department. Enrollment limit: 30 per section (expected: 25 per section).

CSCI 223(S) Software Development (Q)
Building large software systems introduces new challenges to software development. Large software is
built in teams over a period of several years. Typically, no individual on the team understands the entire
system. In this setting, how can we build software that we are certain will work? How can we build
software that is easy to understand and modify so that we can produce new versions of software with
confidence that we will not break it? In this course, students will learn techniques and tools to help them
address these problems and develop larger software projects, improving their skills in designing, writ-
ing, debugging and testing software. Topics include design patterns, UML, designing for maintainabil-
ity, software architecture, rigorous testing, version control, project management and advanced coding
techniques, including concurrency and fault tolerance.
Evaluation will be based primarily on lab assignments, examinations, and a software project developed
by a small team.
Prerequisite: Computer Science 136. Includes a 1 1/2 hour weekly lab. Enrollment limit: 30 (expected:
15).

the semester the student learns the fundamentals of translating of higher level languages into assembly
language, and the interpretation of machine languages by hardware. At the same time, a model of com-
puter hardware organization is developed from the gate level upward. Final projects focus on the design
of a complex control system in hardware or firmware.
Evaluation will be based primarily on weekly labs, final design project, two exams.
Prerequisites: Computer Science 134, or both experience in programming and permission of instructor.
Enrollment limit: 40 (expected: 25).
Hour: 11:00-11:50 MWF Lab: 1-2:30 M,T BAILEY
CSCI 256(S) Algorithm Design and Analysis (Q)
This course is concerned with investigating methods of designing efficient and reliable algorithms. By
carefully analyzing the underlying structure of the problem to be solved it is often possible to dramatical-
ly decrease the computational resources needed to find a solution. Through such analysis one can also
verify that an algorithm will perform correctly, as well as accurately estimate its running time and space
requirements. We will present several algorithm design strategies that build on data structures and pro-
gramming techniques introduced in Computer Science 136, including induction, divide-and-conquer,
dynamic programming, and greedy algorithms. Particular topics to be considered will include algo-
rithms in graph theory, computational geometry, string processing, and advanced data structures. In
addition, an introduction to complexity theory and the complexity classes P and NP will be provided.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based on problem sets and programming assignments, and midterm
and final examinations.

In this course, we study the principles underlying the design of computer networks. We will examine
techniques for transmitting information efficiently and reliably over a variety of communication media.
We will look at the addressing and routing problems that must be solved to ensure that transmitted data
gets to the desired destination. We will come to understand the impact that the distributed nature of all
network problems has on their difficulty. We will examine the ways in which these issues are addressed
by current networking protocols such as TCP/IP and Ethernet. This course will be taught in the tutorial
format. Students will meet weekly with the instructor in pairs to present solutions to problem sets and
reports evaluating the technical merit of current solutions to various networking problems. In addition,
students will be asked to complete several programming assignments involving the implementation of
simple communication protocols. There will be a midterm and a final examination.
Format: tutorial. Evaluation will be based on problem sets, programming assignments, and examina-
tions; 60% of a student's final grade will be based on examinations, 40% on problem sets and program-
ming assignments.

CONTRACT MAJOR
Contract Major Advisor: PETER D. GRUDIN
Students with the talent and energy for working independently and with the strong support of two
faculty advisors may undertake a Contract Major: a coherent study of an interdisciplinary subject not
covered by a regularly offered major. Such a major must be in an area suitable to the talents of the
faculty in residence and cannot consist of minor modifications to an existing major. A Contract Major
also must conform to the structure and have the coherence of a departmental or program major--i.e.,
it must embody a disciplined cumulative study that moves from an elementary to an advanced level
and culminates in a synthesis similar to a senior major course. Hence a Contract Major usually con-
sists of a program of existing courses, sometimes supplemented by courses of independent study and
the senior course.
The process of constructing a proposal for a Contract Major is both interesting and demanding. As
part of that process, students should consider carefully the advantage of working within existing ma-
jors or programs, taking note of the considerable intellectual pleasures involved in sharing similar
educational experiences with other students working within the same field. Students might also con-
sider whether their interests could be met by completing a regular major and coordinate program, or a
double major, or simply by working outside a major field in courses of special interest. Because the
Contract Major represents an exceptional opportunity provided for students whose interests cannot be
met through existing departmental and interdepartmental majors and programs, it cannot be pursued
in conjunction with another major.
Students who wish to explore or propose a Contract Major should consult with the Contract Major
advisor and with potential faculty sponsors as early as possible in the fall semester of the sophomore
year, and then--during the sophomore year--follow these procedures:
1) The student must initiate discussion with at least two members of the faculty from differing de-
partments who expect to be in residence during the student's senior year and who are willing to en-
dorse the Contract Major and undertake a central role in supervising its implementation, criticism,
evaluation, and ultimate validation. Since in essence faculty sponsors substitute for the student's ma-
jor department, they are expected to play an important role in the Contract Major.
The student must develop, in conjunction with the faculty sponsors, a written proposal (forms and
guidelines are available in the Dean's Office) which should contain:
a) a description of the proposed major area of study and an explanation of the reasons for proposing
the Contract Major. A sound and persuasive rationale for the major is crucial for obtaining ap-
proval from the Committee on Educational Policy (C.E.P.).
b) a list of all courses in the proposed major and an explanation for each course choice. A minimum
of nine semester courses, one of which must be designated the senior major course (and taken
during the senior year), must be completed for a Contract Major. Normal rules governing course
grades and grade point average apply for entry into and continuation in a Contract Major.
c) a list of other courses taken or anticipated to meet College distribution requirements, including
grades received in courses already completed.
Contract Major, Critical Languages

2) By mid-January, the student must meet with the Contract Major Advisor to discuss and further
develop the proposal.
3) By the first day of spring semester classes, the student must submit a complete draft of the pro-
posal to the Contract Major Advisor for feedback.
4) By the end of the fourth week of the spring semester, the student must submit the final proposal to
the Contract Major Advisor. By this date also, the faculty sponsors must submit their endorsement
forms to the Contract Major Advisor. If the student is essentially proposing to transform an existing
coordinate program (e.g., African-American Studies, area studies programs, Environmental Studies,
Women's and Gender Studies, etc.), into a Contract Major, the chair of that program should also sub-
mit to the Contract Major Advisor a statement attesting to the validity of the proposal by the end of the
fourth week of the spring semester.
5) The Contract Major Advisor then conveys the proposal, a copy of the student's most recent aca-
demic progress report, the faculty sponsors' endorsement forms, and recommendations regarding the
feasibility and substance of the proposal, for approval by the Committee on Educational Policy. The
C.E.P., after consultation with departments and programs substantially affected by a proposal, will
vote on each proposal individually and will report the decision to the Contract Major Advisor, who
will notify students and sponsors before the spring registration deadline. If the time needed for C.E.P.
review demands it, the Contract Major Advisor may postpone notification to students and permit
them to register late without penalty. In making its decisions, the C.E.P. considers the student's aca-
demic record, the coherence and feasibility of the plan of study, and the degree of support expressed
by the faculty sponsors and, if appropriate, program chairs.
Subsequent changes in a Contract Major must be requested in writing by the student and approved
by the faculty sponsors as well as by the Contract Major Advisor. Where there has been substantial
alteration of the original program, the Contract Major Advisor will forward the student's written re-
quest to the C.E.P. for reconsideration.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN THE CONTRACT MAJOR
The route to the degree with honors in the Contract Major will normally be a senior thesis requiring
two semesters and a winter study of work. In special circumstances a student may propose to substi-
tute a one-semester course or a winter study course for one of his or her thesis courses and write a
mini-thesis. The Contract Major with honors shall comprise a minimum of eleven semester courses or
ten semester courses plus one winter study. One semester of independent study undertaken for the
thesis may be allowed to fulfill the requirement for a senior major course.
The faculty sponsors shall determine by the end of winter study whether the student is to be ad-
mitted to honors candidacy. If not admitted to honors candidacy, the student may elect not to continue
further independent study. If admitted to honors candidacy, the student shall submit a written thesis or
minithesis to three faculty readers, at least one of whom shall be a faculty sponsor and at least one of
whom shall not be a faculty sponsor. The outside reader or readers shall be selected by the Contract
Major Advisor in consultation with the faculty sponsors. There will be a one-hour oral exam by the
readers, and they shall make a final decision regarding honors.

CRITICAL LANGUAGES (Div. I)
Coordinator, JANE CANOVA
The Critical Languages Program enables students to study important foreign languages not taught
in regular courses at Williams. The languages offered are Arabic, Hebrew, Hindi, Korean, and Swahi-
li. Each may be studied for one year at the elementary level.
All courses adhere to the guidelines of the National Association of Self-Instructional Language
Programs (NASILP). Students work independently with standard language textbooks and individual
cassette tapes for roughly ten hours per week and attend two one-hour group review sessions per week
with native-speaking tutors. Language faculty from other institutions conduct the midterm and final
exams and determine the final grades.
To be eligible for a Critical Languages course, the student must:
z demonstrate proven capability for independent work and previous success in foreign language study;
z explain how study of the language will integrate with his or her major or other academic interests;
z present a letter of recommendation from a Williams faculty member;
z in some cases take a pretest for placement;
z have attained sophomore standing or higher;
z have at least a 3.00 Grade Point Average.
Interested students should obtain an application form for the desired course in early April. Forms
are available at the Center for Foreign Languages, Literatures, and Cultures in Weston Hall. Students
must meet with the program coordinator and hand in the completed application forms no later than
one week before preregistration. The application must be approved before registering for the course.
Critical Languages, Economics
­ 132 ­
Students should note that Critical Languages courses are hyphenated, meaning no credit is given
for the first semester until the second semester is successfully completed. Students must normally be-
gin a course in the fall semester. It cannot be taken Pass/Fail.
A Critical Languages course will be scheduled only if and when at least two students are accepted
into the course. Students planning to register for the course must attend an organizational meeting the
first week of each semester.

MAJOR
Students who are beginning their sequence with Economics 110 or Economics 120 should fol-
low the following sequence:
Economics 110 Principles of Microeconomics
Economics 120 Principles of Macroeconomics
(Economics 110 and 120 may be taken separately and in any order)
Economics 251 Price and Allocation Theory
or Economics 251M Price and Allocation Theory (This section of the Price and Allocation
Theory course will employ a somewhat more mathematical exposition of microtheory.)
Economics 252 Macroeconomics
One statistical methods course, Economics 253 or 255, or Statistics 201 and 346. (The statisti-
cal methods course should be taken before 401.)
Three Economics electives, of which at least two must be selected from advanced electives
numbered 350 to 394
Economics 401 Senior Seminar
To complete the major, economics students must receive a passing grade on the oral examination
given in the course of Economics 401. A student who fails the oral examination must re-take the exam
and receive a passing grade.
The primary objectives of the major are to develop an understanding of economic aspects of con-
temporary life and to equip the student to analyze economic issues of social policy. The introductory
courses stress use of the basic elements of economic analysis for understanding and resolving such
issues. The two required intermediate theory courses then provide a more thorough grounding in eco-
nomics as a discipline by examining the strengths and weaknesses of the price system in allocating
economics resources and by examining the aggregate processes which determine employment, infla-
tion, and growth. A course in statistical methods (253 or 255, or alternatively, Statistics 201 plus Sta-
tistics 346) equips the major to understand and apply the basic tools of quantitative empirical analysis.
Majors must take three electives, in at least two of which they apply parts of the theory learned in the
required intermediate theory courses. In the senior seminar, the student studies a series of current
theoretical or policy problems, applying analysis and research methods.
For students who have already taken Economics 101, your course sequence should be Economics
101, any Economics course numbered 201 to 240 prior to taking Economics 251 or 251M, 252, and a
statistical methods course (either 253 or 255, or Statistics 201 and 346) which should be taken before
401, plus any three economics electives of which at least two must be selected from advanced elec-
tives numbered 350 to 394, and Economics 401.
(Please note that students who have taken Economics 101 cannot take Economics 110 or 120.
Note that students cannot take Economics 110 or 120 without having passed the quantitative
studies exam or the equivalent.)
Economics
­ 133 ­
The normal requirement that nine economics courses be taken at Williams will usually be waived
only on the basis of transferred credit deemed acceptable by the department. Credit is granted based
on grades consistent with college policy on various examinations:
z Students who receive a 5 on the Microeconomics AP or Macroeconomics AP exam, or a 5 on each,
may place out of Economics 110 or 120, or both, respectively, but major credit will be given for only
one course.
z The Department will grant major credit for both Economics 110 and 120 to a student who receives a
6 or 7 on the higher-level Economics IB examination, and that student can place into any 200-level
course or intermediate-level micro or macro course.
z For A levels credit, the Department will grant major credit for both Economics 110 and 120 to a
student who receives a grade of A or B.
Prospective majors please note that instructors in all sections of Economics 251, 252, 253, and 255
feel free to use elementary calculus in assigned readings, lectures, problem sets, and examinations;
therefore, Economics 110 and 120 and Mathematics 103 or its equivalent are required as prerequisites
for these courses except for 251 which only requires Economics 110 and Mathematics 103 as a pre-
requisite. By elementary calculus is meant differentiation of single variable polynomial functions and
conditions for a maximum or minimum; it does not include integration or multivariable calculus.
Instructors in advanced electives (courses numbered 350-394) may also use elementary calculus in
assigned readings, lectures, problem sets, and examinations. Students interested in graduate study in
economics should consider studying more advanced mathematics; see your advisor for specific
suggestions. Students are also reminded that some courses now have specific mathematics require-
ments; see course descriptions.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN ECONOMICS
We encourage all majors who have at least a 3.5 GPA in economics courses to consider honors. To
be admitted to candidacy for honors in economics a student must complete a substantial piece of inde-
pendent research. Two routes to honors are open: the Specialization Route and the Thesis Route.
1) Specialization Route, consisting of these three units:
a. Development of a thesis proposal in the second module of Economics 401;
b. An honors winter study project (W030) in January of the senior year;
c. Economics 404 Honors Seminar.
Students who have notified the department of their interest in writing an honors thesis will use the
second module of Economics 401 to develop a thesis proposal. Such proposals frequently build on
research papers completed for advanced electives, but this is not a requirement. If the proposal is ac-
cepted, the student will be admitted to W030. The department provides a memorandum to majors with
more details every spring and fall.
2) Thesis Route (Economics 493-W031-494):
A few students each year will be accepted for year-long thesis research on a subject closely related
to the scholarly interests of a faculty member. A student who hopes to do such independent and ad-
vanced research in close association with a faculty member should begin to work out a mutually satis-
factory topic early in the second semester of his or her junior year. Application to the department must
be made before the end of the junior year by submitting a detailed proposal for work under the super-
vision of the faculty member. The WSP of the senior year is also spent on the thesis.
TheCollege Bulletin states that students who wish to receive honors must take at least one course in
addition to the minimum number required for the major. Students who pursue a year-long thesis and
therefore take both Economics 493 and 494 may substitute Economics 493foranupper-levelelective
iftheywishto.StudentswhopursuetheSpecializationRouteto Honors may not substitute Economics
404 for an upper- (or lower-) level elective requirement.
AFRICAN-AMERICAN STUDIES AND AREA STUDIES
A major in economics who concentrates in African-American or Area Studies may substitute the
non-economics courses in the concentration for one lower-level elective in the Economics major, but
not for an advanced elective (350-394).
Note on Course Numbers: Courses between 201 and 240 are lower-level electives and are open to
first-year students who have taken 110 or 120 (or 101). Courses between 260 and 349 are intermedi-
ate electives which do not build on specific prior experience, but do require some maturity, so they
have any two economics courses or permission of instructor as prerequisites. Courses 350 and
above are advanced electives primarily designed for Economics and Political Economy majors and
have intermediate theory prerequisites.
ECON 110(F,S) Principles of Microeconomics (Q)
This course is an introduction to the study of the forces of supply and demand that determine prices and
the allocation of resources in markets for goods and services, markets for labor, and markets for natural
resources. The focus is on how and why markets work, why they may fail to work, and the policy im-
Economics
­ 134 ­
plications of both their successes and failures. The course focuses on developing the basic tools of mi-
croeconomic analysis and then applying those tools to topics of popular or policy interest such as mini-
mum wage legislation, pollution control, competition policy, international trade policy, discrimination,
tax policy, and the role of government in a market economy. This course is required of Economics ma-
jors and highly recommended for those non-majors interested in Environmental Studies, Women's and
Gender Studies and Political Economy. The department recommends that students follow this course
with Principles of Macroeconomics or with a lower-level elective that has Economics 110 as its prereq-
uisite. Students may alternatively proceed directly to Intermediate Microeconomics after taking this
introductory course.

An introduction to the study of the aggregate national economy. Develops the basic theories of macroe-
conomics and applies them to topics of current interest. Explores issues such as: the causes of inflation,
unemployment, recessions, and depressions; the role of government fiscal and monetary policy in stabi-
lizing the economy; the determinants of long-run economic growth; the long- and short-run effects of
taxes, budget deficits, and other government policies on the national economy; and the workings of ex-
change rates and international trade. Economics 110 and 120 may be taken in either order.

ECON 203(S) Gender and Economics (Same as Women's and Gender Studies 203)
This course uses economic analysis to explore how gender differences can lead to differences in eco-
nomic outcomes, in both households and the labor market. Questions to be covered include: How does
the family function as an economic unit? How do individuals allocate time between the labor market and
the household? How have changes in family structure affected women's employment, and vice-versa?
What are possible explanations for gender differences in labor force participation, occupational choice,
and earnings? What is the role of government in addressing gender issues in the home and the work-
place? How successful are government policies that primarily affect women (e.g., comparable worth
policies, AFDC/TANF, subsidization of child care)? The course will focus on the current experience of
women in the United States, but will place these gender differences in a historical and cross-cultural
context.

This is an introduction to the economies and development problems of the poorer countries in Africa,
Asia, and Latin America. We shall discover both the roots and the extent of these problems, and explore
possible solutions. The course begins by investigating how different socio-historical environments have
shaped various third world economies. Then, keeping this in context, it attempts to get an idea of the best
feasible policies to tackle a whole range of critical development issues. These issues include poverty and
its alleviation, the population explosion, employment and migration patterns, raising education and
health standards, and making agriculture and industry more efficient. Finally, we will consider some
broader international issues--like patterns of trade, foreign aid, and the international debt crisis.
Each student will be expected to study these issues for an individual country or region, attempting to get
an idea of the socio-economic context from reading examples of relevant third world literature.
Format: lecture. Requirements: exams.
Prerequisites: Economics 110. Enrollment limit: 40 (expected: 35).
Hour: 2:35-3:50 MR SWAMY
ECON 205(F) Public Finance
This course examines the role of the government in a market economy. Three broad issues are consid-
ered: when is government intervention in the economy appropriate? What is the most effective form of
intervention? What effects do government policies have on individual incentives? The course will cover
issues in both taxation and spending. Specific programs will be considered such as Social Security,
Medicare, education, and public assistance for the poor. We will also discuss rationales and strategies for
reforming the U.S. tax system.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: two short policy memos, a midterm and a final.

ECON 207(F) China's Economic Transformation Since 1980 (Same as Asian Studies 207)*
Over the past twenty years, China has undergone an unprecedented economic turnaround. Since open-
ing the economy, average incomes in China have quadrupled and over 250 million people have been
lifted out of poverty. In this course, we will study the transformation of China's economy from several
perspectives. First, we will study the wildly successful transition of China from a commune-based econ-
omy to ``market socialism.'' Within this study, we will discuss the ways that institutions and organiza-
tional structures in China have led to and have been changed by the economy in transition. We will then
discuss the effects of trade on China's economy, and conclude by exploring the effect of China's rapid
economic expansion on the environment. Throughout the course, we will consider ways China's econo-
my will continue to change over the next ten to twenty years.
Requirements: at least one research paper and exam(s).

What do we lose when monopoly exists? How does market structure affect advertising and technologi-
cal progress? Why regulate corporate behavior in the areas of advertising, product safety, pollution, and
occupational safety? Do we regulate effectively? What is the appropriate role of business in public poli-
cymaking?
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: one short paper, a midterm, and a final exam.

ECON 211(F) Women in Development (Same as Women's and Gender Studies 211)
The processes of economic development in poor countries have affected women differently than men.
This is because of their different cultural and economic roles, and their substantial exclusion from re-
sources and decision-making. Understanding these processes requires economic tools while also casting
light on some of their shortcomings. We will look at accounts by feminist economists of the significance
of unpaid `caring' labor, and bargaining processes within the household. We will also consider issues
such as women's access to credit; the informal sector; and women's relation to the current global HIV/
AIDS pandemic. Students will also be expected to read literature by Third World writers to improve
their sense of the texture of people's lives in poor countries.

attention is given to situations where the free market fails to provide optimal outcomes. The theory in-
cludes externalities, public goods, common property resources, taxes, standards, tradable pollution per-
mits, and inter-temporal discounting. Topics include benefit-cost analysis, non-market valuation, choice
of different policy instruments (i.e., command-and-control versus market-based), renewable and non-
renewable resource management, economic growth and the environment, and international environ-
mental treaties.

ECON 353(S) Decision-making and Judgment (Q)
Studies of decision-making suggest that most people substantially violate even undemanding models of
rationality. Are people truly irrational, and, if so, can anything be done about it? This course focuses on
normative decision-making (how we should make decisions under general conditions), descriptive deci-
sion-making (how we do make decisions under actual conditions), and the contrast between the two. We
proceed to a view of prescriptive decision-making, or how we might combine normative and descriptive
insights to improve decision-making and judgment. Topics include decision-analytic methods for im-
proving decision-making rigor (e.g., decision trees); microeconomic concepts and tools for optimization
problems; game theory as appropriate; insights from cognitive psychology on heuristics (short cuts) that
sometimes help, but often distort, decision-making; integrated models of judgment that call for both
analysis and intuition; insights from the newly-emerging studies of judgment and wisdom. Until a few
years ago, this topic was given normative treatment in departments of engineering, statistics and eco-
nomics, and was separately taught as a descriptive science in departments of psychology. The apparent
value of combining the two into a single, prescriptive analysis of decision-making and judgment has led
to a recent wave of interdisciplinary approaches such as the one adopted in this course.
Requirements: multiple problems and case analyses, one project, final exam.

ECON 357T(F,S) The Strange Economics of College (W)
This tutorial applies economic theory and econometric techniques in analyzing selected topics relating
to the economics of higher education. The intent is not to try to expose you to all aspects of higher educa-
tion economics. Instead, we will focus on issues of college access and choice, pricing policy, productiv-
ity, economic and non-economic educational returns, academic tenure, selective admission, peer effects,
and merit aid.
Format: tutorial; will meet in groups of 3. Evaluation will be based on the economic substance and writ-
ing effectiveness of revised drafts of four 8-page papers along with eight 4-page critiques, as well as the
quality of the oral presentations and the contribution to tutorial discussions.
Prerequisites: Economics 251. Enrollment limit: 6 (expected: 6). Preference given to juniors and se-
niors.

ECON 359(F) The Economics of Higher Education
This seminar explores the economics and financing of colleges and universities, with a particular focus
on contemporary policy issues. A structured sequence of readings and case studies serve as the
backbone of the course. Course materials will apply economic theory to selected policy issues, including
tuition and financial aid, the individual and societal returns of higher education, and academic labor
markets. The course will also introduce students to the financial structure and management of colleges,
including funding sources, budget processes, and policies and issues regarding the finance of higher
education.
Evaluation will be based on several written case studies, a student research project, a final exam, and
class discussion/participation.
Prerequisites: Economics 251, Economics 253 or 255 (or Statistics 101--formerly Mathematics 143).
Enrollment limit: 15.--While significant background in Economic Theory and Econometrics is
preferred, non-Economics majors are encouraged to contact the instructor to discuss their interest in the
course. Such students should be willing to devote the extra time necessary to master the technical
vocabulary and economic concepts included in some of the readings.

This course is an introduction to the economic analysis of demographic behavior and the economic con-
sequences of demographic change. An important aim is to familiarize students with historical and con-
temporary trends in fertility, mortality, migration, and family composition, and the implications of these
trends for the economy. The course demonstrates the application of microeconomic theory to demo-
graphic behavior, including fertility, marriage, and migration. Students are introduced to basic tech-
niques of demographic measurement and mathematical demography. Selected topics include the eco-
nomic consequences of population growth in developing countries, the economics of fertility and fe-
male labor force participation, the effects of an older age structure on the social security system, and the
relationship between population growth and natural resources.

course may substitute for an advanced elective in the major with permission of the chair of the department.
ECON 501(F) Development Economics I*
The course examines concepts, tools, and models in contemporary economic theory that have proved
relevant to development problems, and their application in economic policymaking. Topics include
growth processes and structural change; investment and sources of saving; capital, labor, and technolog-
ical progress; policies for public, private, and foreign enterprises; policymaking and negotiation in gov-
ernments; and policies for reducing poverty and inequality.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: short papers, two midterms, and a final exam.
Prerequisites: Economics 251 and 252. Undergraduate enrollment limited and only accepted with

ECON 503(F) Public Finance
Public finance is the branch of economics concerned with government expenditure and taxation, focus-
ing primarily on microeconomic aspects of these activities. It provides tools for understanding the ef-
fects of government policies, as well as a useful conceptual framework for analyzing normative ques-
tions such as "what is a good policy?" This seminar will present the basic principles for public finance,
and apply them to topics of particular importance in developing countries. The course will begin by con-
sidering the efficiency of market economics, and rationales for government intervention in the market,
such as public goods, externalities, information-based market failures, and equity. Applications include
environmental policy, education, health care, aid to the poor, and social security. We then move on to the
economics of taxation, considering what kinds of taxes are used in developing countries, the economic
and distributional effects of taxation, questions of administration and evasion, and options for reform
such as the value added tax. Time permitting, we may also address topics such as pubic enterprises,
political economy, and decentralization.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: problem sets, two short papers, 10-page final paper, midterm,
and a final exam.
Prerequisites: Economics 251 and 252. Undergraduate enrollment limited and only accepted with
instructor's permission.
Hour: 11:00-12:15 MWF BAKIJA
ECON 507(S) International Trade and Development

ECON 509(F) Developing Country Macroeconomics
This course focuses on the relationship between macroeconomic policies and economic growth in de-
veloping countries. After examining the links between macroeconomic stability and long-run growth,
the rest of the course is divided into three parts. The first part is devoted to the construction of an analyti-
cal model that is suitable for analyzing a wide variety of macroeconomic issues in developing countries.
This model provides the general framework for a more specific analysis of fiscal and monetary policies
in the two remaining parts. In analyzing fiscal policy, the course will consider in particular the require-
ments of fiscal solvency and the contribution that fiscal policy can make to macroeconomic stability. It
will also examine alternative methods for achieving fiscal credibility, including the design of fiscal insti-
tutions. The final part of the course will turn to an analysis of central banking, focusing on central bank
independence, time consistency of monetary policy, and the design of monetary policy rules in small
open economies.

oped in the first semester, this course explores issues of capital mobility, financial liberalization, and
exchange rate policy. The first part of the course will analyze the financial sector's role in promoting
economic growth and welfare, with topics that focus on financial repression and liberalization, the se-
quencing of financial reform, and the composition of capital flows. The second part of the course ex-
amines appropriate exchange rate frameworks, with topics that include the equilibrium real exchange
rate, the choice of regime, exchange rate management, and currency crises in developing countries.

COURSES AND COURSE-NUMBERING
The course offerings in English enable students, whether majors or non-majors, to explore litera-
ture in a variety of ways, and to satisfy their interests in particular authors, literary periods, and genres.
They emphasize interpretive skills, systematic and critical thinking, and careful attention to the gener-
ic, cultural, and historical contexts of literature written in English.
100-LEVEL COURSES
At the introductory level, the department offers a range of writing-intensive 100-level courses
which focus on interpretive skills--techniques of reading--as well as skills in writing and argumenta-
tion. The department also offers English 150, Expository Writing, a course focusing on rudimentary
writing skills. All 100-level courses are designed primarily for first-year students, although they are
open to interested sophomores, juniors, and seniors. A 100-level course other than 150 is required for
admission to most upper-level English courses, except in the case of students who have placed out of
the introductory courses by receiving a score of 5 on the Advanced Placement examination in English
Literature or of 6 or 7 on the International Baccalaureate.
200-LEVEL COURSES
Most 200-level courses are designed primarily for qualified first-year students, sophomores, and
junior and senior non-majors, but they are open to junior and senior majors and count as major
courses. Several 200-level courses have no prerequisites; see individual descriptions for details.
200-level Gateway courses are designed for first- and second-year students who are considering be-
coming English Majors, or who are interested in pursuing upper-level course work in the department.
All Gateway courses are writing-intensive. Completion of a Gateway course is a requirement for the
major.
300-LEVEL COURSES
The majority of English Department courses are at the 300 level. 300-level courses are open to
sophomores, juniors, and seniors. They are normally not open to first-year students, although in ex-
ceptional cases first-year students may enroll in a 300-level course with consent of the instructor.
English
­ 143 ­
400-LEVEL COURSES
400-level courses are intensive, discussion-oriented classes that place a premium on independent,
student-initiated work. Such classes can be structured in a variety of ways. A course might alternate
tutorial sessions with seminar meetings, or it might take the form of a colloquium, with discussions
organized around individual or group presentations on different aspects of a topic. Or a class might be
oriented around a long final paper on a topic of the student's devising and involve conferences focused
on the progress of that project. Limited to 15 students, 400-level courses are open to students who
have completed at least one 300-level English course; they should be attractive to any student inter-
ested in a course that emphasizes intensive discussion and independent work.
ADVISING
All junior and senior English majors are assigned a departmental faculty member as an advisor.
Students' preferences for advisors are solicited during the preregistration period in April, and assign-
ments are announced at the start of the school year.
Non-majors who wish to discuss English Department offerings are invited to see any faculty mem-
ber or the department chair.
MAJOR
Majors are urged to select a balance of intermediate and advanced courses, and to choose classes
from both the American and British traditions. Each student can fashion his or her own sequence of
study within a basic pattern that insures coherence and variety. This pattern comprises at least nine
courses.
They are also urged to elect collateral courses in subjects such as art, music, history, comparative
literature, philosophy, religion, theatre, and foreign languages with a view to supporting and broaden-
ing their studies in literature. In particular, the study of classical and modern languages, as well as of
foreign literatures, is strongly recommended.
Requirements
The nine courses required for the major must include the following:
1) Any 100-level English class except English 150. Students exempted by the department from
100-level courses will substitute an elective course.
2) At least two courses dealing primarily with literature written before 1700 (identified in paren-
theses at the end of the course description).
3) At least two courses dealing primarily with literature written between 1700 and 1900 (identified
in parentheses at the end of the course description).
4) At least one course dealing primarily with literature written after 1900 (identified in parentheses
at the end of the course description).
5) At least one "criticism" course (identified in parentheses at the end of course description). A
course fulfilling the criticism requirement entails a sustained and explicit reflection on problems of
critical method, whether by engaging a range of critical approaches and their implications or by ex-
ploring a particular method, theorist, or critic in depth. Please note that when a criticism course also
deals with literature satisfying a historical distribution requirement (pre-1700, 1700-1900, etc.), the
course may be used to satisfy either the criticism or the chronological requirement, but not both.
6) At least one 200-level Gateway course (listed at the end of the 200-level course descriptions).
Gateway courses are designed for first- and second-year students contemplating the major or intend-
ing to pursue more advanced work in the department; these courses focus on analytical writing skills
while introducing students to critical methods and historical approaches that will prove fruitful as they
pursue the major. (Note: a Gateway course can fulfill a Period or Criticism requirement as well as a
Gateway requirement.)
The department will now give one elective course credit toward the major for a course taken in
literature of a foreign language, whether the course is taught in the original language or in transla-
tion. Such a course may not be used to satisfy the department's historical distribution, criticism, or
gateway requirements.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN ENGLISH
The English Department offers three different routes toward honors: a creative writing thesis, a crit-
ical thesis, and a critical specialization. The requirements of each are described below. Candidates for
the program should normally have at least a 3.5 average in courses taken in English, but admission
will not depend solely on course grades. Formal application to pursue honors must be made to the
director of honors by April of the junior year. For the Class of 2005, the Director of Honors is Profes-
sor Anita Sokolsky.
All routes require honors students to take a minimum of TEN regular-semester courses (rather than
the nine otherwise required for the major), and to devote their senior year winter study course to their
honors projects. More specifically:
Students doing a creative writing thesis must, by graduation, take at least nine regular-semester
courses, and, in addition, take English 497 (Honors Independent Study, fall) and English 031 (Honors
Thesis, winter study) during senior year.
English
­ 144 ­
Students writing a critical thesis must, by graduation, take at least eight regular-semester courses,
and, in addition, take English 497 and English 498 (Honors Independent Study, fall and spring) and
English 031 (Senior Thesis, winter study) during senior year.
Students pursuing a critical specialization must, by graduation, take at least eight regular-semester
courses, and in addition, take English 497 and English 498 (Honors Independent Study, fall and
spring) and English 030 (Honors Colloquium: Specialization Route, winter study) during senior year.
A student who is highly-qualified to pursue honors, but who, for compelling reasons, is unable to
pursue a year-long project, may petition the department for permission to pursue a critical thesis or
critical specialization over one semester and the winter study term. Since the norm for these projects is
a full year, such permission will be granted only in exceptional circumstances. If granted, the stan-
dards for admission and for evaluating the final project would be identical to those that apply to year-
long honors projects.
All students who wish to apply to the honors program are required to consult with a prospective
faculty advisor, as well as with the director of honors, before April of the junior year. In early April,
candidates submit a 1-page preliminary proposal that provides as specific a description as possible of
the proposed project. The director of honors reviews proposals with the faculty advisor, and then
makes a recommendation to the whole department. Students whose proposals are accepted receive
provisional admission to the program at this time. Students not admitted to the honors program are
advised, when appropriate, about other possible ways of pursuing their interests (e.g., independent
studies, regular departmental courses).
Admitted students must consult with their advisors before the end of the spring semester of junior
year to discuss reading or work pertinent to writing the formal honors prospectus. This prospectus is a
decisive factor in final admission to the program. A draft of the prospectus must be submitted to the
student's advisor by the end of the first week of July, and the final version to the Director of Honors
and the advisor (two copies) by July 30 before the fall of senior year. After reviewing the prospectuses
and consulting with advisors, the department's honors committee determines final admission to the
program. Applicants are notified during the first week of the fall term.
While grades for the fall and winter study terms are deferred until both the honors project and re-
view process are completed, students must do the equivalent of at least B+ work to continue in the
program. Should the student's work in the fall semester not meet this minimal standard, the course
will convert to a standard independent study (English 397), and the student will register for a regular
winter study project. A student engaged in a year-long project must likewise perform satisfactorily in
winter study (English 030 or 031) to enroll in English 498 in the spring semester. When such is not the
case, the winter study course will be converted to an independent study "99."
Students are required to submit to their advisor, on the due dates specified below, three final copies
of their written work. While letter grades for honors courses are assigned by the faculty advisor, the
recommendation about honors is made by two other faculty members, who serve as readers of the
student's work. These readers, after consulting with the faculty advisor, report their recommendation
to the whole department, which awards either Highest Honors, Honors, or no honors. Honors of any
kind are contingent upon satisfactory completion of courses in the major during the spring semester of
the senior year. Highest honors are normally awarded only to students whose performance in both the
honors program and regular courses in the major has been exceptional. All students who are awarded
honors participate in a series of informal presentations at the end of the spring term in senior year.
Creative Writing Thesis
The creative writing thesis involves the completion of a significant body of fiction or poetry during
the fall semester and winter study of the senior year. (With permission of the honors committee, the
thesis may be undertaken during the winter study period and the spring semester of the senior year.)
Since a student will most likely include in the thesis writing done in earlier semesters, a creative writ-
ing thesis usually involves only the fall semester and the winter study period, rather than the full year
allotted to complete the critical essay.
Requirements for admission include outstanding work in an introductory and an advanced work-
shop, a recommendation from one of the creative writing teachers (who will then act as thesis advi-
sor), a brief preliminary proposal, and the approval of the departmental honors committee. The formal
prospectus consists of a 1-page description of the project, including its relation to work completed and
in-progress. Students must also submit a writing sample. A creative writing thesis begun in the fall is
due on the last day of winter study. The methods of evaluation are identical to those for critical projects
(but their page limits do not apply).
Critical Thesis
The critical thesis involves writing a substantial scholarly and/or critical essay during both semes-
ters as well as the winter study period of the senior year. The formal prospectus, a 2- to 3-page descrip-
tion of the thesis project, should present a coherent proposal indicating the range of the thesis, the
questions to be investigated, the methods to be used, and the arguments likely to be considered, along
with a brief bibliography.
Significant progress on the thesis, including a substantial amount of writing (to be determined by
student and advisor), is required by the end of the fall semester. A first draft of the thesis must be com-
English
­ 145 ­
pleted by the end of the winter study period. The spring semester is to be devoted to revising and refin-
ing the work and to shaping its several chapters into a unified argument. Ideally, the length of the hon-
ors essay will be about 15,000 words (roughly 45 pages). In no case should the thesis be longer than
25,000 words, including notes. The finished thesis is due on the second Friday following spring break.
Critical Specialization
The critical specialization route is intended to provide students with an opportunity for making a
series of forays into an area of interest that is both broad in scope and related to work undertaken in at
least two courses. At least one of these courses must be in the English Department, and both need to
have been taken by the end of fall term in senior year. The critical specialization must be united by a
common area of interest, such as a given literary form or historical period, a topic that cuts across
several periods, an issue in literary theory, a topic that connects literary and cultural issues, a compara-
tive literature or interdisciplinary topic. Students are encouraged to propose specialization topics of
their own devising. The following examples are meant only to suggest the kinds of topics appropriate
to a critical specialization: lyric traditions, postmodern narrative, magic realism, Dante and modern
literature, Freud and literature, the poet as citizen, new historicist approaches to literature, feminist
film criticism.
In addition to reading primary works, the student is expected to read secondary sources, which de-
scribe or define issues critical to the area of specialization. The formal prospectus, a 2- to 3-page de-
scription of the project, should specify the area and range of the study, the issues likely to be explored,
and the methods to be used for their investigation. This prospectus should also describe the relation
between previous course work and the proposed specialization, and include a brief bibliography of
secondary works. The pursuit of the specialization route requires the following: (1) writing a set of
three essays, each about 10 pages long (a page being approximately 250 words), which together ad-
vance a flexibly-related set of arguments. The first two essays are due by the end of the fall semester,
and the third by the end of winter study; (2) developing an extended annotated bibliography (about
4-5 pages long) of selected secondary sources, explaining their importance to the area of specializa-
tion (due mid-February); (3) meeting with the three faculty evaluators (one of whom is the advisor)
during the last two weeks in February to discuss the trio of essays and the annotated bibliography; (4)
writing a fourth essay of 10-12 pages, the purpose of which is to consider matters that arose during the
faculty-student discussion and to reflect on the evolution and outcome of the intellectual journey un-
dertaken by the student. This final essay is due on the second Friday after spring break.
The same three faculty members are involved throughout the assessment process, and the standards
and methods of evaluation are the same as for other kinds of honors projects, with the following ex-
ception: For the specialization route, the evaluation will also include the student's performance in the
discussion with the three faculty readers, and that discussion will include not only the student's writ-
ing but also secondary sources.
COURSES
100-LEVEL COURSES (except English 150)
Through small class discussions (limited in size to 19 students per section) and frequent writing
assignments, 100-level English courses ask students to develop their skills as readers and as analyti-
cal writers. Each course assigns 20 pages of writing in various forms. These courses are prerequi-
sites for taking most other English courses. Students who receive a 5 on the AP English Literature
exam may take upper-level courses without first taking a 100-level. All 100-level English courses
are writing intensive.
ENGL 106(F) Modern Poetry (W)
This introductory course focuses on twentieth century poetry by William Butler Yeats, T. S. Eliot, Wal-
lace Stevens, Robert Frost, W. H. Auden, Marianne Moore, Robert Lowell, Elizabeth Bishop, and Rich-
ard Wilbur. Our primary concerns are learning to read better and discuss thoughtfully the poems them-
selves: how does this poem work and play? What are its strategies? How do poetic uses of language
convey meanings and suggest implications? Exploring individual poems carefully, we will work toward
a richer understanding of the nature of Modernism generally.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: 20 pages of writing in the form of weekly exercises, alter-
nating journal entries and short formal essays, along with some memorization.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference given to first-year students.
Hour: 8:30-9:45 MWF R. BELL
ENGL 108(S) Forms of Revenge (W)
Even in its most brutal expression, revenge lies close to art. Writers in almost every period have ex-
ploited this affinity and vengeance is as basic to the detective novel and the suburban sitcom as it is to
ancient epic and the medieval fabliau. In this course, we will consider the representation of revenge in a
range of genres. Works by Homer, Shakespeare, Poe, Nabokov, Neil Jordan and Lucille Ball.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: 20 pages of writing in the form of short papers.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference given to first-year students.

ENGL 110(F) The Age of the Short Story (W)
This class will emphasize the development of critical reading skills through its focus on American short
fiction of the nineteenth century. What a story is, and what a story does are key questions for the class
and for the authors we will examine. What does it mean for a story to be simply funny, or simply horrify-
ing? What formal features allow a story to intervene into political problems in its day? How do stories
define the United States, and how do they define the relationship of literature to the nation? Are some
stories meant only as aesthetic productions? Readings include Washington Irving, Nathaniel Haw-
thorne, Edgar Allan Poe, Bret Harte, Victor Séjour, Charles Chesnutt, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, and
Sarah Orne Jewett.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: class participation and 20 pages of writing in the form of
frequent short papers.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference given to first-year students.
Hour: 2:35-3:50 MR T. DAVIS
ENGL 111(F) Poetry and Politics (W)
"Poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the world" wrote Shelley in his 1821 "Defence of Poetry,"
countering the widely held view of poetry's airy irrelevance to the material progress of humanity. His
claims are echoed a century and a half later in Audre Lorde's "Poetry is Not a Luxury," in which she
argues that poetry is a vital and essential part of her own political struggle as a Black lesbian feminist.
But when W.B. Yeats--himself a very politically involved poet--writes in 1917 that "from the quarrel
with others comes rhetoric; from the quarrel with ourselves comes poetry," he implies that poetry would
suffer from too much involvement with the "quarrel with others" that is politics, becoming, perhaps,
something more like advertising jingles for political dogma. And when W. H. Auden writes in 1939 that
"poetry makes nothing happen" he appears to locate poetry's value precisely in its irrelevance to politics
as such. This course will focus on the vexed relationship between poetry and political struggle, reading
predominantly poetry and poetics (writings about poetry) of the last two centuries in an effort to answer
the questions: what can poetry do for politics? what does politics do for (or to) poetry? Is poetry essential
to political struggle, or do poetry and politics mix only to the detriment of both, producing, on the one
hand, bad poetry, and on the other, mere distractions from the "real" work of politics? The primary goal
of the course is to make students better readers of poetry, and better readers and writers of argumentative
prose. No prior experience with poetry (or politics!) is expected.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: active class participation and 20 pages of writing in the form
of frequent short papers.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference given to first-year students.
Hour: 1:10-2:25 MR CASE
ENGL 114(F) Literary Speakers (W)
The general purpose of this course is to develop students' skills as interpreters of poetry and short fiction.
Its particular focus is on how--and with what effects--poets create the voices of their poems, and fic-
tion writers create their narrators. We'll consider the ways in which literary speakers inform and entice,
persuade and sometimes deceive, their audiences. Readings will include texts from various historical
periods, with particular emphasis on the twentieth century (including works by James Joyce, Henry
James, Vladimir Nabokov, Robert Frost, Toni Cade Bambara, Raymond Carver, and Seamus Heaney).
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: a discussion class with emphasis on close reading and fre-
quent, careful writing (about 20 pages, in the form of short papers).
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference given to first-year students.
Hour: 10:00-10:50 MWF FIX
ENGL 117(F) Introduction to Cultural Theory (W)
This course has a clear purpose. If you had signed up for a course in biology, you would know that you
were about to embark on the systematic study of living organisms. If you were registered for a course on
the American Civil War, you would know that there had been an armed conflict between the northern
and southern states in the 1860s. But if you decide you want to study "culture," what exactly is it that you
are studying? The aim of this course is not to come up with handy and reassuring definitions for this
word, but to show you why it is so hard to come up with such definitions. People fight about what the
word "culture" means, and our main business will be to get an overview of that conceptual brawl. We
will pay special attention to the conflict between those thinkers who see culture as a realm of freedom or
equality or independence or critical thought and those thinkers who see culture as a special form of
bondage, a prison without walls. The course will be organized around short theoretical readings by au-
thors ranging from Matthew Arnold to Constance Penley, but we will also, in order to put our new ideas
to the test, watch several films (Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Silence of the Lambs, The Lord of the Rings)
and listen to a lot of rock & roll. Why do you think culture matters? Once you stop to pose that question,
there's no turning back.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: five short papers totaling about 20 pages, class attendance
and participation.

ENGL 120(F,S) The Nature of Narrative (Same as Comparative Literature 111) (W)
(See under Comparative Literature for full description.)
Note: English 120 may be used as the prerequisite for other English courses.
ENGL 121(S) Precocity (W)
Precocity--knowing too much too early and without understanding the implications of what you
know--is often the subject of literary texts, perhaps because it dramatizes the stakes of interpreting. Pre-
cocity can emerge in a character, in narrative posture, or in the very texture of the writing. It can produce
highly charged dramatic situations, comic or ruinous; it can precipitate crises of character and of narra-
tive. We will read Nabokov's Lolita, James' The Turn of the Screw, Stoppard's play Arcadia, and a range
of poems and stories.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: students will write four short papers totaling 15-20 pages.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference given to first-year students.

ENGL 124(F) Family Matters (W)
"Anyone who has survived childhood has enough material to write for the rest of his or her life" (Flan-
nery O'Connor). A course designed to explore the representations of family in recent American litera-
ture. Family is our first community, and in the literature of family one commonly accepted and undis-
puted convention emerges: parents and children are morally bound to one another. These bonds of
blood, both liberating and limiting, have always been a literary convention. In this course, we will ex-
amine recent American fiction that explores such bonds. What do such narratives claim we want from
our families? What do such narratives claim we're willing to do to get it? Have recent narratives devel-
oped particular and characteristic strategies for approaching this topic? And are there importantly partic-
ularizing aspects of the American family? The emphasis here will be on developing analytical skills. To
that end, class members will produce: short written responses to published fiction; biographical presen-
tations on the authors to be discussed; four longer essays which will involve extensive peer-editing, revi-
sion and one-on-one meetings with the professor. Students will also be responsible for teaching one class
on a work of their choice. The emphasis will be on exploring the reading and writing processes, and on
coherently communicating that exploration to each other. Authors to be considered may include: Rick
Moody, Junot Diaz, Andre Dubus, Lorrie Moore, Gish Jen, Adam Haslett, Grace Paley, and Jonathan
Franzen.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: active class participation and 20 pages of writing in the form
of frequent short papers.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference given to first-year students.
This Course is part of the Critical Reasoning and Analytical Skills initiative.

ENGL 126(F,S) Stupidity and Intelligence (W)
Stupidity fascinates authors, and they do not merely despise it--they feel it and make us feel it. Why?
Around the same time that psychologists began measuring and ranking intelligence--and stupidity, un-
der various names, of course occupied the space below (average) intelligence--literary authors were
finding types of stupidity within intelligence. What is stupidity? Why can't it stay sequestered from in-
telligence? Is there such a thing as literary stupidity? (Can one be specifically a bad reader not only of
books but of life?) What are the problems of intelligence? We shall be reading stories, novellas, novels,
and plays by Melville, Poe, Henry James, Kafka, Borges, Stoppard, Faulkner, Flaubert, and others.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: active class participation, and five papers totaling 20 pages.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 per section (expected: 19 per section). Preference given to first-

ENGL 127(F) The Celtic Other World: From Myth to Romance and Beyond (W)
Written down between the twelfth and fifteenth centuries in manuscripts like the Book of the Dun Cow
(Irish) and the White Book of Rhydderch (Welsh), stories about the Celtic Other World sparkle even in
translation. With delicate description, whimsical humor, exuberant excess, and heroic energy, they con-
jure up a world in which the boundaries between magic and reality collapse in unexpected, thought-pro-
voking ways. In the Irish story "Da Derga's Hostel," a bird flies through a skylight to father the hero
Conare Mar. In "The Wooing of Etain," a woman turns her rival into a scarlet fly. In the Welsh story
"Culhwch and Olwen," the warrior Clust, though "buried seven fathoms in the earth," can still "hear an
ant stirring from its bed in the morning fifty miles away." The magic of Arthurian romance is almost
English
­ 148 ­
exclusively Celtic in origin. By Chretien de Troyes (twelfth-century France), we will read Yvain, The
Knight with the Lion and Perceval, the Story of the Grail and from fourteenth-century England we will
read Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. From medieval romance, we will follow the influence of the
Celtic Other World in Shakespearean comedy (Midsummer Night's Dream), and in romantic, Victorian,
and early modern poetry by Keats, Tennyson, and Yeats. The goal of the course, in addition to its particu-
lar subject matter, is to develop effective reading and writing strategies for works of different genres and
time periods.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: weekly writing assignments, both formal and informal, in-
cluding required electronic journal postings. Students will do 20 pages of writing in the form of frequent
short papers and will be evaluated on writing and class participation.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference to first-year students.

ENGL 129(S) Twentieth-Century Black Poets (W)*
From Langston Hughes to contemporary poets such as Amiri Baraka and Angela Jackson, African
American poets have been preoccupied with the relations of poetry to other traditions. Vernacular
speech, English poetry, jazz and other musical forms, folk humor and African mythology have all been
seen as essential sources for black poetry. This course will survey major poets such as Hughes, James
Weldon Johnson, Countee Cullen, Robert Hayden, Gwendolyn Brooks, Baraka, Jackson, and Yusef Ko-
munyakaa, reading their poems and their essays and interviews about poetic craft. We will ask how
black poetry has been defined and whether there is a single black poetic tradition or several.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: twenty pages of writing in the form of a journal on the read-
ings and several short papers.

ENGL 131(F) Women's Voices: Sappho to Riot Grrrls (Same as Women's and Gender
Studies 131) (W)
This course will consider texts from a broad sampling of genres written by woman who raise their voices
in opposition to, and often in outright protest of, social norms and literary conventions. We will situate
central issues of class, race, sexuality, and political ideology raised by these texts within broader themes
of coming of age, finding a voice of one's own, resisting social and literary limitations, and the price of
artistic freedom. Readings will include works by Sappho, Aphra Behn, Mary Wollestonecraft, Christina
Rossetti, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Virginia Woolf, Zora Neale Hurston, Caryl Churchill, and others,
including works by selected contemporary poets and spoken word texts by award-winning female
poetry slammers.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: four 5-page papers, and active class participation.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference given to first-year students.
Hour: 2:35-3:50 TF ROSS
ENGL 137(F) Shakespeare's Warriors and Politicians (W)
From history, legend, and his own imaginative powers, Shakespeare has fashioned superlative warriors:
Hotspur, Othello, Macbeth, Antony, and Coriolanus are larger-than-life soldiers on the battlefield. They
are, however, frequently undone by love and politics. Hotspur is no match for the shrewd political ma-
neuvering of Prince Hal; Othello's love for Desdemona turns to hate through the machinations of the
Machiavellian Iago; Macbeth is pushed to regicide by his wife; and Antony is twice undone--made "a
strumpet's fool" by Cleopatra and defeated by a mere "boy" in the supreme politician Octavius Caesar.
This course will examine seven plays by Shakespeare, where the virtues and weaknesses of the warrior
and the politician are seen to be in tension: Richard III, Henry IV, Part I, Julius Caesar, Othello, Mac-
beth, Antony and Cleopatra, and Coriolanus. In the last play, Shakespeare portrays the convergence of
sex, war, and politics with a new cynicism that leaves no character unscathed.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: 20 pages of writing in the form of four essays, ranging in
length from 3-7 pages, and several short journal-style writing assignments, as well as active participation
in class.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference given to first-year students.

ENGL 142(F,S) Radio, Radio (W)
Radio, Radio is a seminar devoted to making and interpreting non-fiction audio. Using unobtrusive re-
cording technology we will learn to do field recording, interviews, and post-production editing. We will
use this process to ask fundamental questions about the media, the functions of stories, and our relation
to the world. How do we identify worthwhile stories? When does an editor's manipulation become un-
ethical or untrue? We will aim to vest our answers to these questions in the form and content of our audio
work. We will also spend considerable time critiquing student work. Critical readings in media theory,
radio history, and cultural history will be assigned.
Format: seminar. Requirements: students must attend three specially arranged evening labs in audio ac-
quisition and editing. Assignments will include several short written exercises; an editing assignment
English

ENGL 145(S) Reading and Writing Science Fiction (W)
This course will explore some of the themes and techniques of modern science fiction by examining a
range of published stories, while at the same time making some new stories of our own. Writers of fic-
tion and non-fiction often watch each other with suspicion, as if from opposing sides of an obvious fron-
tier. Though the goals of both forms of writing--the disciplined articulation of brainy thoughts and
mighty feelings--are similar, there is a tendency in both camps to think their methods different and ex-
clusive. The conceit of this class is to imagine that constructing a plot and constructing an argument, say,
are complementary skills, and that the tricks and techniques of one type of writing can profitably be
applied to the other. With this in mind, the class is made of two strands twisted together--a creative
writing workshop and a course in critical analysis. There will be short weekly assignments
in both types of writing, as well as two larger projects: an original science fiction short story and a critical
essay. Assigned readings will include stories and essays by Terry Bisson, Octavia Butler, Rachel Pol-
lack, Samuel R. Delaney, Karen Joy Fowler, Carol Emshwiller, and John Crowley.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: active participation in class and a minimum of 20 pages of
writing, both critical and creative.

addition, we will consider aspects of film history, including the role of genre and the contrasting narra-
tive and visual conventions prevailing in Hollywood and in strikingly different national traditions, such
as the silent cinema of the Soviet montage and the German expressionist movements and the French
New Wave cinema of the 1960s. Critical readings will be assigned, and we will examine films by such
directors as Eisenstein, Keaton, Murnau, Renoir, Hawks, Welles, Kurosowa, Hitchcock, Amodovar and
Jonze.

ENGL 209(F) American Literature: Origins to 1865 (Same as American Studies 209)
What is American literature? This course will examine the variety of answers that have been made to
this question, and the way that those answers differently articulate both what counts as "America" and
what counts as literature. In the nineteenth century, we will read major voices of the American Renais-
sance (Emerson, Hawthorne, Thoreau) and voices coming out of the abolitionist movement and the
popular press (Stowe, Douglass, Jacobs). In the eighteenth century, we will read the autobiographical
and political writings of figures including Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson, and both the popu-
lar female novelist Susanna Rowson and the latter-day Puritan Jonathan Edwards. In the colonial era we
will contrast the Puritan history of William Bradford with the pell-mell pillaging of John Smith in his
accounts of Virginia. Working through the differences among different figures, eras, and genres we will
be asking what makes a literary tradition: temporal progression, thematic consistency, national identity,
etc.? And consider, too, what the way we construct American literature means for our understanding of
the nation today.

ENGL 210(S) American Literature: 1865-Present (Same as American Studies 210)
This course is designed to provide an introduction to American literature from the post-Civil War period
to the present. Beginning with Walt Whitman and Emily Dickinson, we will read a series of influential
American texts--both fiction and poetry. We will situate these works not only within the literary move-
ments of the time (e.g., realism, modernism, and postmodernism), but also within other important histor-
ical and cultural occurrences (e.g., immigration and migration, civil rights, commodity culture).
Throughout, the emphasis will be on the diverse, sometimes conflicting traditions that make up the
American literary canon. Readings may include works by such authors as Twain, Chopin, Chesnutt,
Hemingway, Hughes, Hurston, Faulkner, Ellison, Ginsberg, Pynchon, Morrison, and Cisneros.

This course will consider literary works by women in English as occasions where women acknowledge
and confront both each other and a literary culture which has traditionally defined feminine identity and
excluded female voices. Among the issues we will explore are: Are there significant intertextualities
amongst women writers, enough that we might argue for women's literary "traditions," either in terms of
form or content? What are the unique difficulties women face as creators, as opposed to just subjects, of
literature? Can writing serve as aform of resistance, and if so, how? How is femininity articulated along-
side and/or intertwined with other identities and identifications, such as race, ethnicity, class, and sexual-
ity? While including a wide range of women, the course may study in greater depth such writers as Kate
Chopin, Virginia Woolf, Adrienne Rich, Sylvia Plath, Toni Morrison, Audre Lorde, Maxine Hong
Kingston, and Margaret Atwood.

ENGL 239T(S) The Brontës (W)
As children, the Brontë sisters collaboratively created a rich imaginary world, and thus began, in their
earliest years, their grand experimentations in fiction. As adults, each pursued her own course, produc-
ing highly original novels and poems, but the three sisters also often read or listened to each other's
work. This tutorial will compare the mature writings of Charlotte, Emily, and Anne Brontë, exploring
both their similar and distinctive qualities. Students will write on such topics as the following: the
Brontës' revolutionary fictive choices and artistic evolution; their approaches to character and point of
view; their treatment of nature, colonialism, and the "Woman Question;' their use of the supernatural,
the gothic, and the Byronic. Readings will include Charlotte's first and last novels, Jane Eyre and Vil-
lette, Anne Brontë's Tenant of Wildfell Hall, and Emily's Wuthering Heights, as well as selected poems.
Some historical and critical readings will also be required.
Format: tutorial, with occasional group meetings. Mostly, however, students will meet weekly with a
tutorial partner and the instructor to discuss one student's paper and the other student's response. Five
5-page arguments and five 2-page critiques are required.

ENGL 241(S) The African Novel (Same as Comparative Literature 241)*
Is there such a thing as "the African novel?" In this class we will attempt to construct--and decon-
struct--such an idea. We will begin with the era of independence movements, when writers were defin-
ing themselves as proudly African against a European tradition, and were appropriating the novel to do
so. In the context of repressive regimes, however, post-independence novelists have opposed the state,
creatively forging "imagined communities" that complicate both nationalism and pan-Africanism.
From feminism to Marxism, from allegiances to local indigenous groups and their traditions to transna-
tional identifications, these writers give us a glimpse of how rich and complex "African writing" has
become. These novels range from magical realism to postmodern allegory, from elegiac prose poetry to
comedy, and from historical romance to stark prison memoir; the class is an introduction to inventive
and lyrical writing that deserves a global audience.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: The class will involve a lot of discussion, and a weekly jour-
nal of critical writing experiments of your own--different ways to read closely, or analyze texts with
attention to detail, or to connect the novels to the history they take on--that will lead to three longer
papers.

ENGL 285T(F) Lying About the Truth (W)
All readers fall prey to it: the autobiographical fallacy--the conflation of author and narrator. Writers
know readers are susceptible to it. A tutorial designed to explore the uses and abuses of the autobio-
graphical fallacy by contemporary American authors. How do writers of autobiographical fiction take
advantage of this tendency? What role does the autobiographical fallacy play in a writer's authority?
What's the relationship between reader and writer in autobiographical fiction? What do writers of such
fiction want from a reader, and how does encouraging the autobiographical fallacy get them what they
want? Reading list may include work by Tim O'Brien, Lorrie Moore, Junot Diaz, Dorothy Allison, Amy
Hempel, Jhumpa Lahiri, Mary Yukari Waters, and Edwidge Danticat, among others.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: In keeping with tutorial format, students will meet in pairs with the
instructor once a week; during these meetings, one student will present a short analytical paper on the
texts being covered that week. The other student will join the instructor in responding to that paper.

GATEWAY COURSES
200-level "Gateway" courses are designed for first- and second-year students contemplating the
major or intending to pursue more advanced work in the department; these courses focus on analyti-
cal writing skills while introducing students to critical and historical approaches that will prove
fruitful in later courses. (Note: a Gateway course can fulfill a Period or Criticism requirement as
well as a Gateway requirement.)
ENGL 217(S) Shakespearean Comedy (Gateway) (Same as Theatre 225) (W)
This course studies Shakespeare's comic art and explores the nature of comedy. Our texts are A Midsum-
mer Night's Dream, The Taming of the Shrew, Henry the Fourth, part one, Twelfth Night, As You Like It,
and Much Ado About Nothing, along with some comic theory by Hobbes, Bergson, Meredith, Freud,
Bakhtin, Frye, and others. We will view and discuss several films and the Williams theater spring semes-
ter production, As You Like It. Our main concerns are practical criticism, focused on Shakespeare's lan-
guage and dramatic art: why and how is this comical? What does this humorous character or that comic
scene contribute to the play? What are some larger patterns of comedy? How does this play apply, re-
vise, or complicate the traditional patterns? How central is comedy to the play's vision?
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: written exercises every week, alternating journal entries and
short formal essays.

ENGL 226(S) Irish Revivals (Gateway) (W)
This course will focus on Irish literature of the last two centuries as a case study in the way history, cul-
ture and politics interact in the formation of a distinctive literary tradition. We will begin with a overview
English
­ 153 ­
of the literature of the Gaelic and early colonial periods, and briefly consider texts from the Irish "Reviv-
al" of 1800-1830, during which the problems of Irish cultural, literary and political self-definition in a
colonial context-the effort to construct or assert "Irishness" as an identity distinct from Englishness-be-
came sharply outlined. Our principal focus will be on the "Irish Renaissance" of c.1890-1925, during
which Irish writing in the English language became firmly identified as a canon distinct from the English
tradition, and writers such as Yeats and Joyce achieved international status. Readings will include dra-
ma, poetry, fiction, and non-fiction prose by Yeats, Synge, Somerville and Ross, Joyce, George Moore,
George Bernard Shaw, Lady Gregory and Sean O'Casey. We will foreground key fault-lines of the peri-
od: competing visions of Irish identity and of the role of literature in promoting cultural and/or political
change; debate over the propriety of writing in English, drawing on English literary traditions, or seek-
ing an English audience; the work of "self-exiles" like Shaw and Joyce, versus that of writers who stayed
in Ireland; and the long-entrenched ideological and political tensions between Catholics and Protestants,
and landowners and tenants, in Ireland. The course will conclude with consideration of post-indepen-
dence literature, and of the extraordinary current vitality of Irish literary culture, with reading of works
by Brendan Behan, Seamus Heaney, Martin McDonagh, and discussion of Neil Jordan's film "The Cry-
ing Game." Key considerations here will be the ways traditional Nationalist concerns have recently been
reinflected by contemporary sexual politics, and by the effort to reconceive both Ireland's literary past
and its present in terms of post-colonial theory.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: four papers (3-4 pages for the first, rising to 6-8 pages for
the last), several short journal-style writing assignments, and active participation in discussion.

ENGL 227(S) Contesting American Poetics (Gateway) (W)
How do poems come to assume their particular forms? What is a poem's horizon of possibilities? To
answer these questions, we will engage in comparative poetics, focussing on nineteenth- and twentieth-
century American work. Beginning with an extended consideration of Whitman and Dickinson, we will
learn to identify a poet's poetic program (however loosely defined) as it changes over time and circum-
stance. In addition to poems, we will consider letters, journals, essays and taped performances. We will
pay special attention to the social and political contexts of "schools" or "movements," listening for each
poet's underlying sense of her or his place in the world. The course will be organized around pairings
selected from the following list: Hart Crane; Marianne Moore; William Carlos Williams; Langston
Hughes; Robinson Jeffers; Imiri Baraka; Adrienne Rich; Gary Snyder; the Black Mountain School (e.g.,
Olson, Creeley, Levertov); the Beats (e.g., Ginsberg, Corso, Ferlinghetti); the New York School (e.g.,
Ashbery, O'Hara). Students should emerge from this course with a solid sense of the varieties of modern
American poetry, but also, and perhaps more importantly, an immediate understanding of how to handle
poems as readers.
Format: discussion/seminar.
Requirements: Students will be asked to write frequently and to revise steadily, producing a total of 20
pages of writing over the course of the semester.

In this course we will engage with the major arguments in the field of literary theory. Yet it is important
that this is not a catch-all survey class; rather, we will be conducting a continuing debate about the nature
of literary meaning and the relationship of such meaning to politics and ethics. What determines the
meaning of a text? How can an interpretation of a literary work be deemed true or false? Is the relation-
ship of literature to politics foundational or peripheral? Is criticism an ethical practice? Readings include
W. K. Wimsatt and Monroe Beardsley, Paul De Man, Stanley Fish, Judith Butler, Jacques, Derrida, Mi-
chel, Foucalt, and Henry Louis Gates, Jr.

ENGL 233(F) Great Big Books (Gateway) (Same as Comparative Literature 283) (W)
Some of the greatest novels are really, really long - so long that they are too seldom read and taught. This
course takes time to enjoy the special pleasures of novels of epic scope: the opportunity to immerse one-
English
­ 154 ­
self in a wide and teeming fictional world; to focus sustained attention on the changeable fortunes of
characters and societies over a long span of time; to appreciate the detailed grounding of lives in their
social environment and historical moment; to experience the leisurely and urgent rhythms, with their
elaborate patterning of build-ups and climaxes, that are possible in such works. We will read but two
novels, both preoccupied with the disruption and evolution of lives and loves at moments of historic
upheaval: War and Peace (1869), Leo Tolstoy's epic of the Napoleonic Wars, and Parade's End
(1924-28), Ford Madox Ford's modernist masterpiece about World War I and its traumatic impact on
English social life. Set a century apart, the novels are distinguished by vivid and scrupulous representa-
tion of their respective wars, by their shrewd accounts of political and social pressures informing the
crises, and by their insight into the struggles of those whose lives are engulfed in global crisis. Tolstoy's
and Ford's approaches to fictional representation, however, provide intriguing contrasts: one favors the
lucidity of classic realism, the other the challenges of modernist innovation; one deploys a single multi-
plot novel, the other a tretralogy of shorter novels developing a single plot. We will discuss the differing
strategies and effects of these two approaches, as well as the more general difficulties of reading and
interpreting long fiction.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: four short essays, as well as a revision and extension of one
of these.

The dual acts of remembering and forgetting slavery have become central to the constitution of Ameri-

has been produced through the visual and literary material on the subject of slavery. Our readings will
move from nineteenth-and eighteenth -century accounts of slavery, poems by Phillis Wheatley, fiction
and non-fiction by Frederick Douglass and Martin Delany to twentieth century re-writings and remem-
brances of slavery. Here we will be examining both visual and literary texts that include works by Wil-
liam Faulkner, Octavia Butler, Sherley Anne Williams, Toni Morrison and visual productions by Kara
Walker and Bill T. Jones. Finally, we will consider how television melodramas--Roots, North and
South, Sally Hemmings: An American Scandal--have shaped the function of slavery in contemporary
popular culture.

the tenth through the fifteenth centuries. The writers we will consider are among the finest storytellers,
lyric poets, playwrights, composers, and social commentators of the middle ages. Their work employs
surprising degrees of boldness and wit to interrogate issues of identity, power, desire, and artistic vision,
while pushing against the limitations of gender, religion, and literary convention. Readings for the
course include fin'amors lyrics by the female troubadors, the letters of Heloise to Abelard, the Lais of
Marie de France, Christine de Pisan's Book of the City of Ladies, The Book of Margery Kempe, and
selections from the works of Hrosvitha of Gandersheim, Hildegard of Bingen and others.

aters by parliamentary decree in 1642. We will focus on the sensational aspects of these works--their
preoccupation with revenge, black magic, sexual ambiguity and grotesque violence--and also on their
technical virtuosity. Authors will include Christopher Marlowe, Thomas Kyd, William Shakespeare,
Ben Jonson, John Webster and Cyril Tourneur.

ENGL 321(S) Samuel Johnson and the Literary Tradition
Johnson has been exceptionally influential not only because he was a distinguished writer of poems,
essays, criticism, and biographies, but also because he was the first true historian of English literature,
the first who sought to define its "tradition." We will read Johnson's own works and Boswell's Life of
Johnson to discover Johnson's talents, tastes, and standards as an artist, as a moral and literary critic, and
as a man. We next will use Johnson's Preface to Shakespeare and Lives of the English Poets to examine
how this great intelligence assessed writers from the Renaissance through the eighteenth century. While
reading his commentary on Shakespeare and his critical biographies of Milton, Dryden, Pope, Swift,
and Gray, we will analyze selected works by these writers so as to evaluate Johnson's views and to
sharpen our understanding of the relationships between his standards and our own.

ENGL 323T(S) A Novel Education (W)
All novels are conscious of their readers; eighteenth-century novels are obsessed with them. In the cen-
tury when the genre first flourished, readers are the ultimate objects of novelists' plots. We are ad-
dressed, teased, pleaded with, embarrassed, flattered, made fun of, praised, chided, solicited, warned,
reminded, rebuked, asked for sympathy, and-always--closely watched. Eighteenth-century novelists--
and their narrators--aggressively educate their readers, not only teaching us how to interpret the novel
itself, but also demanding that we self-consciously question the powers of mind and habits of heart we
bring to the process of interpreting a book, ourselves, and our world.
In this tutorial course, we will explore the narrative and rhetorical strategies two of the century's greatest
novelists use in creating, shaping, and finally educating their readers. We will focus principally on Henry
Fielding's Tom Jones (1749) and Laurence Sterne's Tristram Shandy (1760-67)--long, brilliantly intri-
cate novels that go about their work in very different ways, but that are equally committed to the project
of giving their readers a novel education. We'll consider--much more briefly-Fielding's Joseph An-
drews, Sterne's A Sentimental Journey, and Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress. We will also read criticism by
such "reader response" theorists as Stanley Fish and Wolfgang Iser, and--in the individualized setting of
a tutorial--students will be asked to develop and articulate their own theories of reading by examining
critically the ways in which texts affect and educate them.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: Students will meet with the instructor in pairs for an hour each week;
they will write a 5- to 7-page paper every other week (five in all), and comment on their partners' papers
in alternate weeks. Emphasis will be placed on developing skills not only in reading and interpretation,
but also in constructing critical arguments and responding to them in written and oral critiques.

ENGL 324(S) Introduction to Eighteenth-Century Literature
Why study the eighteenth century? To the unaccustomed reader, the period can seem to be all petticoats
and pettifoggery. The prose clatters out in clumsy periods, the poetry proceeds in clockwork couplets.
The thrill of studying the century, however, is that our most massively modern institutions come into
being within its confines: the press, party politics, and the administrative state; the domestic family and
the gender regime appropriate to it; and the advanced capitalist marketplace, the stock exchange, public
credit, global trade, industrialization. So here's an interesting question: How does literature get en-
tangled in such fundamental social changes? Is literature transformed by political, economic, and social
changes? Does literature itself help bring such changes about? Our strategy will be to survey eighteenth-
century Britain's characteristic literary modes, forms of writing that took shape or took on newfound
significance between 1700 and 1800. In each case, we will begin by reading a well-known eighteenth-
century text and then compare that text with an accomplished recent example from the same genre. Thus
we will read Tory satire such as Jonathan Swift's madcap Tale of a Tub alongside Oliver Stone's Natural
Born Killers, the Gothic novel such as Matthew Lewis's lurid Monk alongside Kubrick's Shining, and so
on. This comparative perspective should help us get a handle on the eighteenth century in two ways:
First, it will demonstrate that the eighteenth century was historically significant, because it changed the
culture utterly. It changed what and how people read in ways that still affect us. But these similarities can
be deceptive: The course should also help us articulate with greater precision everything that is particular
to the eighteenth century. All the eighteenth-century genres we will be considering are still around, but
all of them have changed substantially over time. None of them do the same cultural work today that
they did 300 years ago. It will be our primary task, then, to determine as carefully as possible the many
important ways in which eighteenth-century texts differ from their contemporary counterparts.

ENGL 328(S) Jane Austen and George Eliot (Same as Women's and Gender Studies 328)
Austen and Eliot profoundly influenced the course of the novel by making internal consciousness cru-
cial to narrative form. In this course we will explore Austen's innovative aesthetic strategies and the
ways in which Eliot assimilated and transformed them. By placing each writer's work in its political and
philosophical context--in Austen's case, reactions to the aftermath of the French Revolution, in Eliot's,
to the failed mid-century European revolutions and the pressures of British imperialism--we will con-
sider how each writer conceives social exigencies to shape dramas of consciousness. Readings will in-
clude Austen's Pride and Prejudice, Emma, Mansfield Park, and Persuasion; Eliot's The Mill on the
Floss, The Lifted Veil, and Daniel Deronda; selected letters and prose; essays by Burke and Marx; and
recent criticism.

ENGL 331(S) Romantic Poetry
An intensive study of the important poetry of the Romantic period (roughly 1785-1830), one of the great
watersheds in the history of poetry in English. Poets likely to be studied include Wordsworth, Blake,
Coleridge, Smith, Robinson, Byron, Shelley, Hemans, and Keats. We will also pay some attention to the
historical developments of the period, especially the consequences of the French Revolution and the
subsequent rise of Napoleon.

ism as a method, but we will also look at alternative strains in fiction of the period, such as the Gothic and
"sensation" novels. Probable texts will include Austen's Persuasion, Brontë's Wuthering Heights, Dick-
ens's Bleak House, Trollope's The Warden, Braddon's Lady Audley's Secret, Eliot's Middlemarch, and
Forster's A Room With a View.

ENGL 339(S) Magic Realism (Same as Comparative Literature 319)
If you look back over the great successes in world literature over the last forty years or so--if you look,
that is, at the books that have been read widely, in translation, throughout the world and not just in their
countries of origin-you'll notice a pattern: Novel after novel after novel belongs to a genre usually
known as "magical realism," full of miraculous children and ghosts who dance the bachata and cooks
who can transform their feelings into soup. These novels make for splendid reading--and we will read
some ten or twelve of them--but they also raise some tough questions, beginning with the term itself.
"Magical realism," we must keep reminding ourselves, lest the phrase sediment itself on our tongues, is
an oxymoron. How can a novel be "magical" and "realist" at the same time? How can a novel still be
recognized as "realist" once it has filled its pages with hocus-pocus and hoodoo? Other questions
emerge when you start reading the novels: Most of these books describe major historical events--World
War II, say, or the decolonization of Nigeria--and so the question becomes: What is the relationship
between magical realism and the historical novel? What happens when you try to recount history as
though it were a fairy tale? And why has this genre been so popular among novelists in such widely
scattered parts of the world, and especially in the world's former colonies--India, West Africa, Latin
America? And how is it that magical realism has become the model for what gets to count as good litera-
ture on the world scene, as world literature proper? Why does magical realism seem like a free pass into
the contemporary canon?
Readings will include: Alejo Carpentier, The Lost Steps; Günter Grass, The Tin Drum; Gabriel Garcia
Márquez, One Hundred Years of Solitude; Salman Rushdie, Midnight's Children; Ben Okri, The Fam-
ished Road; Jeffrey Eugenides, Middlesex; and others.

ENGL 342(S) Representing Sexualities: U.S. Traditions (Same as Women's and Gender
Studies 342) (W)
In this course we will explore the way literary and other cultural texts produced in the U.S. represent and
construct queer sexualities. We will start with works considered to be some of the "first" definitively
and/or openly queer writings in America, and consider how they set the terms and tropes for represent-
ing queer identities, identifications and desires. From the outset, we will also consider how sexuality and
race, as well as gender and ethnicity, intersect in these texts. We will then move to study two rich cultural
spaces: Harlem and Paris of American expatriates. Baldwin's Giovanni's Room will serve as a bridge to
fifties culture. In this section we may discuss pulp fiction, queer subcultures, and the emergence of open-
ly lesbian and gay writings. Finally the course will focus on cultural texts from the last twenty years that
represent the racial, ethnic, and class diversity of queer communities, as well as the richness of its literary
and cultural forms. Some of the main questions we will consider are: What historical shifts and social
conditions enable the formation of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered identities? How is the emer-
gence of these identities tied to shifts in conceptualizing race in the U.S.? How is desire itself racialized?
What role does the literary and/or reading play in the constitution of identity and community? What are
the rewards and limits of established literary genres (such as the novel) when called upon to represent
queer lives? When do such lives need new literary and cultural forms? To what degree do queer litera-
tures constitute a canon, or multiple canons, with identifiable relations between older and more recent
texts? Readings may include works by authors and theorists such as Whitman, Dickinson, James,
Hughes, Nugent, Grimké, Larsen, Stein, Barnes, Baldwin, Bannon, Isherwood, Highsmith, Rich,
Delany, Lourde, Moraga, Troyana, Kushner, Fisher, Cuadros, Chee, Zamorra, Sedgwick, Eng, Harper,
Somerville, Foucault, Muñoz, and Rupp.

ENGL 345(F) The Black Arts (Same as American Studies 345)*
During the period from 1965-1976, many writers attempted to develop a literary art based on new
emerging conceptions of "blackness." This course will examine what they understood a "black aesthet-
ic" to be, and how this understanding affected their writing. With a careful eye to their political and cul-
tural contexts, this course will consider poetry, drama, essays, and fiction by such writers as Amiri Bara-
ka, Sonia Sanchez, Nikki Giovanni, Ishmael Reed, and Toni Cade Bambara.

ENGL 348(F) Faulkner and His Influence
William Faulkner was a great writer in two ways. First, he was the most interesting formal innovator of
all the novelists of American modernism (as in The Sound and the Fury and As I Lay Dying). Second, he
was astrange and provocative theorist of race (as in Go Down, Moses and Absalom, Absalom!). We shall
consider both of these dimensions of Faulkner, and what they have to do with each other. Then we shall
take up one or more novelists in the Faulkner tradition.

ENGL 351(F) Reading Africa: Gender and Sexuality (Same as Comparative Literature 351
and Women's and Gender Studies 351)*
In this class we will explore some of the ways that gender and sexuality are understood, performed, and
transformed in Africa. We will begin by thinking about predominant ways of looking at the continent
which we must work through: the legacy of colonial conceptions of Africa, the debates over the validity
of feminism in Africa, and contemporary Western journalism's "afro-pessimism"--imagining Africa as
the site of inevitable horror and disaster, usually figured through the image of the young black man with
a gun. How can Africans negotiate these frameworks while also writing honestly about the urgent prob-
lems facing contemporary society? We cannot attempt to cover everything going on across this vast con-
tinent, but we will analyze some African texts from different locations-novels, short stories, films,
photographs, journalism, and music--that offer their own perspectives on women and men, marriage,
tradition, and modernity, war, Aids and the city, as well as the emergent structures of feeling produced by
new sexual identities, musical forms, and the popular institution of the beauty pageant.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: The class will involve a lot of discussion, email responses to
the reading, and three papers totaling approximately 20 pages.
Prerequisites: one Writing-Intensive course. Enrollment limit: 25 (expected: 15).

ENGL 353(F) Modern Poetry
We will explore the effects of two of the most influential poets of this century, William Butler Yeats and
Wallace Stevens, on the work of two recent poets: James Merrill and John Ashbery. We will examine the
tangled and controversial means by which Yeats and Stevens, writing chiefly between the two World
Wars, tied the political, social, and intellectual ferment of the era to the fate of poetry. Considering such
issues as occultism, nationalism, and unrequited love in the poetry of Yeats, we will explore the ways in
which they are transmuted in Merrill's gay epic, The Changing Light at Sandover. We will further ex-
amine the roles of aristocratic bias and proto-fascism in Yeat's and Merrill's work, as well as critics'
tendencies to equate these impulses. Tracing themes such as cosmopolitanism, isolationism, and insur-
ance in Stevens' work, we will consider how they inform Ashbery's meditations on the roles of the city,
of accident, and of awakenings from political numbness in shaping contemporary American conscious-
ness. We will consider the ways in which all four poets' work both invites and eludes accusations of
self-reflexive lyricizing.

ENGL 360(F) Joyce's Ulysses
This course will explore in depth the demanding and exhilarating work widely regarded as the most
important novel of the twentieth century, James Joyce's Ulysses, which both dismantled the traditional
novel and revitalized the genre by opening up new possibilities for fiction. We will discuss the ways in
which compelling issues of character and theme (e.g., questions of heroism and betrayal, oedipal dy-
namics, sexuality and the politics of gender, civic engagement and artistic isolation, British imperialism
and Irish nationalism), are placed in counterpoint with patterns drawn from myth, theology, philosophy,
and other literature, and will consider the convergence of such themes in an unorthodox form of comedy.
In assessing Ulysses as the outstanding paradigm of modernist fiction, we will be equally attentive to its
radical and often funny innovations of structure, style, and narrative perspective. In addition to Joyce's
novel, readings will include its epic precursor, Homer's Odyssey, as well as biographical and critical
essays. (Students unfamiliar with Joyce's short novel A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, which
introduces characters later followed in Ulysses, are urged to read it in advance of the course.)

Two of the most powerful, celebrated American novelists in the last forty years are John Barth and Da-
vid Foster Wallace. Barth's fictions and meta-fictions define postmodernism, while Wallace's writing
contests postmodern assumptions and techniques. Barth and Wallace write encyclopedic fiction: long,
exhaustive, hilarious, disturbing, and complicated narratives. We'll study Barth's novels, The Floating
Opera, The End of the Road, The Sot-Weed Factor, among others. Our main texts by Wallace are a
collection of essays, A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again and the massive (and infinitely re-
warding) Infinite Jest.

ENGL 369T(F) The Australian New Wave (Same as Comparative Literature 369T) (W)
Until the mid-1970's, as far as the international film community was concerned, Australian film was no
more notable than Icelandic film. Ten years later, Australia's national cinema was considered so striking,
original, and vital that its filmmakers were working all over the globe, and having a particularly decisive
effect on American film. This course will consider the meteoric rise of Australian filmmaking to interna-
tional prominence and influence, with an emphasis on stylistic innovations and thematic preoccupa-
tions. Films to be studied will include Peter Weir's Picnic at Hanging Rock, The Last Wave and Gallipo-
li, Bruce Beresford's Breaker Morant, Gillian Armstrong's My Brilliant Career, and George Miller's
Mad Max and The Road Warrior.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: In keeping with tutorial format, students will meet in pairs with the

ENGL 371(F) Feminist Theory and the Representation of Women in Film (Same as Women's
and Gender Studies 371)
Woman's position as the "object of the gaze" is the focus of much recent critical film theory. Central to
these theoretical writings is a psychoanalytically-based (Lacanian) perspective that endows men with
access to subjectivity as viewers and agency within narrative, and assigns woman a role as fantasized
object within a male economy of desire. This perspective, which we find in the work of Laura Mulvey,
Jacqueline Rose, Stephen Heath, and Mary Ann Doane, is complemented by a more socio-ideological
approach in the work of E. Ann Kaplan, Tania Modleski, and Teresa de Lauretis. We will attempt first to
understand the theoretical texts in which the feminine figures as a central term for aesthetic discourse
and ideological controversy. Second, we will analyze films, applying and testing these critical perspec-
tives. Questions concerning the problematic subjectivity of the female spectator will be primary, and we
will be especially concerned with the ways in which various kinds of works--from those considered to
English
­ 160 ­
be highly conventionalized or "classical" to those deemed "avant-garde" or subversive in the way they
treat convention--address themselves to a male versus a female spectator. Finally, we will evaluate the
interpretive possibilities afforded by psychoanalytic and socio-ideological methods both separately and
together. In addition to reading selections from film theorists and critics, we will look at such films as
Aliens, Now, Voyager, Thelma and Louise, Vertigo, Chicago, Moulin Rouge, and Lost in Translation.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: active participation in class discussions, one 4- to 5-page

American literature. We will be reading a mixture of fiction and non-fiction by writers such as James
Weldon Johnson, Alain Locke, W.E.B. Du Bois, Zora Neale Hurston, Richard Wright, Ralph Ellison,
Toni Morrison and Patricia Williams. In doing so, we will be asking a set of practical questions: What is
the relationship between sociopolitical criticism and literary history? Should Afrocentric ideology gov-
ern the theoretical and critical examination of African American literature? What role does literature
play in shaping contemporary debates about the social construction or political realities of race and gen-
der? What is the nature of the relationship between American and African-American literary history?
How has the formation of African-American literature challenged or affirmed other literary and national
paradigms?

ENGL 391(F) Imagining Scientists
Scientists tell one kind of story about themselves and their work; biographers, historians of science, and
science writers, looking in from the outside, tell another; imaginative writers who use scientists' lives as
subject matter yet another. In this discussion class, we'll explore stories about scientist's lives (both real
and invented) told from many different perspectives. No formal training in science is required, although
an interest in science would be helpful; we'll be looking primarily at how genre and language shape our
perceptions of scientists and their work. Texts will range from nineteenth-century visions of scientists
(Frankenstein and an early H.G. Wells story) through more recent portraits, including stories by Joanna
Scott, A.S. Byatt, and others; memoirs such as James Watson's The Double Helix and Oliver Sacks's
Uncle Tungsten; novels such as Alan Lightman's Einstein's Dreams, Ellen Ullman's The Bug, and Si-
mon Mawar's Mendel's Dwarf; and Michael Frayn's play Copenhagen. Where possible, we'll parallel
imaginative and nonfiction accounts to see how and why they differ. Writing assignments will be both
critical and, for those who choose, creative: the final paper may be either a discussion of a novel, story, or
play and some supporting nonfiction materials-or, for those interested in imaginative writing, a "life in
science." The subject might be someone known to the student (even a self-portrait), an historical figure,
or an imaginary figure; the form might be a story, a scene from a play, a memoir, or a biographical essay.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: active class participation; several short critical papers (2 to 3

ENGL 402(S) Inventing English Literature 800-1642: An Advanced Survey
Survey: introductory, boring. Right? Wrong. Surveys are in fact most exciting to those who already know
something--for whom the survey is a chance to step back, reflect, take stock, make connections, contem-
plate the larger picture. You asked for it--you got it. This is a team-taught survey for the serious English
major--a course conceived in response to a suggestion from the Majors Committee of 2004-05. How did
English literature become a major presence in a tradition dominated above all by classical Latin and Greek
literature and secondarily by French and Italian? We start with Augustine's indictment of Virgil and its
influence on the Middle Ages, and we end with the Puritan closure of the theaters in 1642. We will look at
the evolution of epic and romance from Beowulf to the Faerie Queene, the rise of drama from medieval
mystery plays to Marlowe, Shakespeare, and Jonson, and the development of the lyric from medieval love
poetry to John Donne. We will also look at prose writers, like Boethius, Machiavelli, and Sidney, who
helped define culture, politics, and style.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: student oral reports will initiate discussion for each class. In
consultation with the instructors students will have a choice of writing three 5- to 7-page papers or one 15-
to 20-page paper.

ENGL 412(S) Transcendentalism
Does Emerson have the right to tell us how to live? Is the heart ofWalden the writing or the time Thoreau
spent at the pond? Is there a danger in basing antislavery views on a conviction that one has direct
knowledge of the divine? Does Transcendentalism's literary value depend upon its spiritual value? We
will be grappling with the paradoxes, assaults, and inspirations of Transcendentalism through readings
of Emerson's major prose writing, from Nature to "Illusions"; Thoreau's "Civil Disobedience," Walden,
and A Week on the Concord and Merrimack River; Margaret Fuller's Summer on the Lakes and Woman
in the Nineteenth-Century; and a range of minor writings, a number of them on the projects in communi-
ty living at Brook Farm and Fruitlands. We will also examine the skeptical analysis of Transcendental-
ism offered in Nathaniel Hawthorne's Blithedale Romance and Louisa May Alcott's story, "Transcen-
dental Wild Oats." In addition we will be reading a range of modern criticism on the Transcendentalists,
including Barbara Packer, Stanley Cavell, and Christopher Newfield. Because Transcendentalism in-
cludes elements of philosophy, literature, and social movement, the question of critical methodology is
particularly pertinent to its study. Can philosophical, literary, and political strands be disentangled, or
must Transcendentalism be studied as a single cultural formation? Through a series of short projects
students will build toward a significant final paper combining research and close reading. This discus-
sion seminar is designed to develop skills in researching criticism and argument development, with
work over the semester leading toward a significant final paper of twenty pages.

The 1930's and 1940's have come to be known as the "Golden Age" of Hollywood cinema, because
during this era Hollywood set the stylistic and narrative norms for mainstream cinema and turned out
more films, of an arguably higher general quality, than at any other time in its history. This seminar,
intended primarily for majors with some experience of film and upper-level literature courses, offers the
opportunity for intensive study of one of the crucial genres of classical Hollywood cinema: comedy,
whose varied resources inspired Hollywood's foremost directors and stars to make many of the finest
films of the classical era. The diversity of these works--ranging from the brilliantly anarchic slapstick of
the Marx Brothers, through the resonant social and cultural allegories of Hawks's and Capra's screwball
comedy, to the witty urbanity of Lubitsch and the zany subversiveness of Sturges--will permit us to
engage a wide array of questions. We will be concerned with issues of mechanism and victimization in
slapstick comedy; with the social conflicts arising from class and gender difference and their possible
conciliations; with travesties and rediscoveries of one's identity; with the nature of romantic fidelity and
betrayal; with a newly emerging type of female protagonist, bemusing yet strangely powerful; and with
the volatile comic rapport between reason and the unconscious, sexuality and moral constraint. The
course, which will normally function as a small seminar but will occasionally change to a tutorial and/or
workshop mode, will culminate in a final paper based in part on research into theory and criticism in this
field.
Format: seminar/tutorial. Requirements: active participation in class discussions, two short papers, some
bibliographic work, and a long final paper incorporating the earlier writing and research.
Prerequisite: English 203 or 204 and one 300-level English course, or permission of instructor. Enroll-
ment limit: 15 (expected: 15).

ENGL 450(F) Herman Melville and Mark Twain
Despite their profound differences in literary style and personal temperament, Heman Melville and
Mark Twain had much in common. Both gained national popularity through their travel writings, both
were acute and critical observers of American Political life, and both were adventurous innovators in the
craft of prose fiction. Melville, however, spurned his own success and alienated his readers with a series
of complex, difficult, and unsettling novels. Mark Twain, on the other hand, expanded his popularity
with astonishing effectiveness. This course will examine and compare the works and careers of these
writers. A comparative approach to works such as Benito Cereno and Puddn'head Wilson, satirical
works addressing slavery and racial attitudes, should be illuminating. On the other hand, we will also
attend to the traits that make these writers such singular literary artists.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: one short paper of 5 to 7 pages and a final paper of about
fifteen pages.
Prerequisites: a 300-level English course, or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 15 (expected:
15).

ENGL 385(F) Advanced Fiction Workshop: Form and Technique
An advanced class for students with experience writing fiction and some understanding of the basics of
plot, character, setting, and scene. We'll look closely at underlying structures and techniques--how a
story's significant elements are chosen, ordered, and arranged; how the story is shaped; how, by whom, and
to what purpose it's told. First we'll study published work, largely by contemporary North American writ-
ers and including stories in both traditional and unusual forms. In informal work journals, we'll investigate
those stories by writing annotations (short, informal analyses of a story's structure and narrative strategies)
and imitations (stories or fragments that mimic the forms and techniques of other stories). Then we'll use
those forms and techniques to write complete stories, which we'll discuss in workshop and then revise.
Format: discussion class/workshop. Requirements: active participation in workshop; weekly brief written
responses in a work journal; one polished annotation (2-3 pp); one revised complete story.

CONCENTRATION IN ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
The Environmental Studies Program, within the liberal arts mission of Williams College, provides
students with an opportunity to explore how humans interact with the environment, including physi-
cal, biological, philosophical, and social elements. The program is designed so that students will un-
derstand the complexity of issues and perspectives and to appreciate that most environmental issues
lack distinct disciplinary boundaries. Our goal is to aid students in becoming well-informed, environ-
mentally-literate citizens of the planet who have the capacity to become active participants in the local
and global community. To this end, the program is designed to develop abilities to think in interdisci-
plinary ways and to use synthetic approaches in solving problems while incorporating the knowledge
and experiences gained from majoring in other departments at the College.
The concentration in Environmental Studies allows students to pursue an interdisciplinary study of
the environment by taking elective courses in the natural sciences, the social sciences, and the human-
ities and the arts. The purpose of the program is to provide the tools and ideas needed to engage con-
structively with the environmental and social issues brought about by changes in population, econom-
ic activity, and values. Environmental controversies typically call upon citizens and organizations to
grasp complex, uncertain science, contending human values, and ethical choices--in short, to grapple
with matters for which the liberal arts are a necessary but not sufficient preparation. Environmental
Studies accordingly includes courses in natural sciences, social sciences, humanities, and the arts, in
order to equip students with the broad educational background needed to analyze complex environ-
mental matters and to fashion pragmatic, feasible solutions.
The program is administered by the Center for Environmental Studies (CES), located in Kellogg
House. Founded in 1967, CES was one of the first environmental studies programs at a liberal arts
college. In addition to the academic program, CES is the focus of a varied set of activities in which
students lead and participate, often with other members of the Williams community. The Matt Cole
Memorial Library at Kellogg House holds a substantial collection of books, periodicals, unpublished
documents, maps, and electronic media. Kellogg House also houses a new Geographic Information
System laboratory as well as study and meeting facilities available to students and student groups. The
Center administers the Hopkins Memorial Forest, a 2500-acre natural area northwest of campus,
where field-study sites, a laboratory, and passive-recreation opportunities may be found in all seasons.
CES also operates an environmental analysis laboratory at the Science Center.
The Environmental Studies Program has three overlapping components:
Environmental Studies
­ 165 ­
 The concentration in Environmental Studies, which consists of a set of seven courses.
 The Four Places goal. (See below.)
 Honors in Environmental Studies; a senior thesis is encouraged but not required.
Concentration Requirements
Seven courses are required: four are core courses to be taken by all students earning the concentration;
three are distribution courses to be selected from the lists below.
Core courses
101 Humans in the Landscape
203 Ecology
302 Environmental Planning and Design Workshop
402 Senior Seminar
The core courses are intended to be taken in sequence, although there is some flexibility allowed.
Environmental Studies (ENVI) 101 is a broad introduction to the field, emphasizing the humanities
and social sciences. ENVI 203 is a course in ecology (offered in Biology) that provides a unified con-
ceptual approach to the behavior of living things in the natural world. ENVI 302 puts teams of stu-
dents to work on planning projects of immediate importance in the Berkshires. ENVI 402, the senior
seminar, is an opportunity for concentrators majoring in a wide variety of disciplines to draw together
their educational experiences and provide a personal accounting of how they understand the interdis-
ciplinary character of environmental studies and its connections to their future lives and careers. The
core course structure affords students freedom to explore and to specialize in diverse fields of study,
while sustaining a focus on environmental questions throughout their time at Williams.
An interdisciplinary course emphasizing field science, ENVI 102 (Introduction to Environmental
Science), is strongly recommended for all students interested in the concentration.
Distribution Courses
In order to earn the concentration a student must take one course from each of the following three
groups. Courses may be counted both toward the concentration in Environmental Studies and toward
a disciplinary major.

Variations from the requirements of the concentration must be approved in writing by the director of
the program. Students are urged to consult with program faculty and the director as soon as they devel-
op an interest in the concentration or if they intend to participate in study away opportunities.
In addition to courses fulfilling the concentration requirements, the following electives and related
electives are offered:
Environmental Studies 397, 398 Independent Study of Environmental Problems
Environmental Studies 493-W031-494 Senior Research and Thesis
Winter study courses play an important role in the program, offering opportunities to experiment in
fields unfamiliar to the student, and for interdisciplinary topics to be developed by faculty working
alone and in teams. Students are urged to review each year's winter study offerings bearing in mind
their interests in the environment.
Rationale for Course Numbering
The numbering sequence of the four required courses reflects the order in which they should be
taken, although Environmental Studies 302 may be taken in the senior or sophomore year if a student
is away junior year. Cross-listed courses are assigned the same number as the departmental number
whenever possible.
Four Places--A Goal
The human place in natural landscapes is intrinsically geographic, and learning about humans in
particular places is an essential part of environmental studies. By the time each student in Environ-
mental Studies graduates, she or he should have developed intellectual insight into and personal expe-
rience of four places: "Home"; "Here"--the Berkshires; "There"--an alien place; and "The
World"--a global perspective. For practical purposes, "There" is a place where the geography is un-
usual in the student's experience (e.g., developing country, inner city, arctic), so are the socioeconom-
ic circumstances (for example, per capita income might be a small fraction of a year's tuition at Wil-
liams), and the working language is not standard English. Although this goal is not a requirement for
the concentration, it is a significant aspect of the program, and CES resources are aimed in part at
enabling all students to meet this goal. For example, students are encouraged to pursue summer in-
ternships in their "Home" communities, or to do semester or winter study courses at locations outside
the temperate zones ("There"); field courses in natural science or history courses emphasizing New
England can deepen familiarity with "Here." Students concentrating in Environmental Studies should
plan winter study courses and summer work or study experiences with the Four Places goal in mind,
Environmental Studies
­ 167 ­
particularly the experiences "There" and at "Home." Courses not in the list of electives for the con-
centration may be considered as substitutes, on a case-by-case basis, if they also meet the Four Places
goal in a way not otherwise available in the program. Students should see the program director for
further information.
Honors in Environmental Studies
A student earns honors in Environmental Studies by successfully completing a rigorous, original
independent research project under the supervision of two or more members of the faculty, including
at least one member of the CES faculty. The research project should be reported and defended both in
a thesis and orally. A student may undertake an honors thesis and submit it to both his or her major
department and Environmental Studies; petitions for a joint honors project should be approved by the
department chair and the director of the program no later than the beginning of the student's senior
year. Students who pursue honors in Environmental Studies alone should enroll in Environmental
Studies 493-W031-494, Senior Research and Thesis, in addition to completing the requirements for
the concentration.
Because most research requires sustained field, laboratory, or library work that is difficult to com-
bine with conventional coursework, students are strongly encouraged to spend the summer before
senior year doing honors research. Funds to support student research are available from restricted en-
dowments of the Center, and an open competition is held each spring, to allocate the limited resources.
Some departments also provide limited support for summer thesis research. Students and their faculty
sponsors should plan the thesis with the possibility of summer research in mind.
Honors in Environmental Studies will be awarded on the basis of the academic rigor, interdisciplin-
ary synthesis, independence, and originality demonstrated by the student and in the completed thesis.
ENVI 101(F) Humans in the Landscape: An Introduction to Environmental Studies
This course introduces environmental studies in the context of the liberal arts--natural and social sci-
ence and the arts and humanities. By the end of the semester, a student should be able to recognize and to
investigate the natural, economic, and industrial bases of daily life, and to analyze the social challenges
of altering humans' imprint on nature. These skills are necessary but not sufficient for developing a
stance toward environmental quality as an element of civilized life.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on two quizzes (testing detailed recall), written ex-
ercises (testing ability to grasp and make use of ideas important to the course), and a final exam; attentive
participation in class and conference discussions also counts.
No enrollment limit (expected: 30-40). Required course for students wishing to complete the Environ-
mental Studies concentration.
Satisfies one semester of the Division II requirement.
Hour: 10:00-10:50 MWF Conference: TBA K. LEE
ENVI 102(S) Introduction to Environmental Science
Introduction to Environmental Science introduces students to current scientific methods used to assess
environmental quality, rectify impaired systems, and limit future detriment. Through hands-on study of
several local sites, we probe five global themes: alteration of the greenhouse effect and carbon cycle;
acid deposition; toxic metals in the environment; water quality; and prospects in waste treatment and
remediation.
Discussions of case studies from other parts of the world illustrate the global analogues of these local
studies. Following these group projects, students design and complete independent projects in subjects
of particular interest to them.
Format: two, 75-minute workshop/discussion sessions, and one, 4-hour field/laboratory session each
week. Evaluation will be based on reports of field and laboratory projects, participation in discussion,
and an independent research project.
Enrollment limit: 36 (expected: 25). Preference given to first-year students. This course is designed for
students who have a strong interest in Environmental Science.
Satisfies one semester of the Division III requirement. This course also satisfies "The Natural World"
requirement for the Environmental Studies concentration.

"We are witnessing not the end of history, as a certain professor in the United States has claimed, but a
rebeginning. The resurrection of buried realities, the reappearance of what was forgotten and repressed,
which can lead, as it has in other times in history, to regeneration." These lines by the Mexican Octavio
Paz, published in 1990, identify our focus for reading recent world poetry and fiction, represented in
recent Nobel Prize winners, as well as in international and American films. Laureates such as Pablo Ner-
uda (Chile), Odysseus Elytis (Greece), Octavio Paz (Mexico), Derek Walcott (Saint Lucia), Kenzaburo
Oe (Japan), Seamus Heaney (Ireland), Wislawa Szymborska (Poland), Gao Xingjian (China), V. S.
Naipual (Trinidad), J. M. Coetzee (South Africa). The adulteration, demise, and disintegration of the
great utopias of the twentieth century; and the dehumanization and environmental crisis brought by
modernization and colonialism ask for a conception of life that is no longer distorted, for a culture of life
instead of a culture of death. Human life, for instance, has become, again, a "more-than-human" experi-
ence, "grounded" in the environment and the body as well as in the social, deserving a holistic, trans-dis-
ciplinary approach. In recent world literature, the attack on life, social, cultural or biological, is resisted

analysis and discussion of case studies. In the second section of the course students apply their skills to
the study of an actual planning problem. Small teams of students, working in conjunction with a client in
the community, research and propose solutions to a local environmental planning problem. The project
work draws on students' academic training, extracurricular activities, and applies interdisciplinary
knowledge and methodologies. The course culminates in public presentations of each team's planning
study. This course also includes field trips and computer labs.
Format: discussion/project lab. Requirements: midterm exam, short written exercises, class presenta-
tions, public presentations, final group report.
Prerequisites: Environmental Studies 101 and Biology/Environmental Studies 203, or permission of
instructors. No enrollment limit (expected: 25). Open to juniors and seniors only.

ENVI 307(S) Environmental Law (Same as Political Science 317)
In the past twenty years, environmental law has emerged as an important aspect of how we govern the
use of public and private property. This course introduces students to the study of law from the perspec-
tive of a litigator and legislator, and takes up both the common law of nuisance, which is the foundation
for environmental governance in the Anglo-American tradition, and an array of statutory law, which has
profound implications for our ideas about property and how we put those ideas into practice. In our soci-
ety, and increasingly around the world, these ideas are central to civil order and to our efforts to maintain
a balance between our individual wishes and our commitment to our communities.

ENVI 311(F) America's Nature, and Nature in the Americas (Same as Comparative
Literature 311) (W)*
American and Latin American literatures offer a case study on the dissemination of environmental val-
ues through transnational networks, and on the role of those very environmental values in defining na-
tional or local identity against colonialism. Where do Euro-American attitudes end, and others' begin?
When Euro-American environmental attitudes are imposed to others, and when are they appropriated by
others? Our focus, in this case, is the presence of the American environmental imagination in Latin
American literature and culture. US authors included are: James Fenimore Cooper, Ralph Waldo Emer-
son, Henry Thoreau, Walt Whitman, and William Faulkner. From Latin America: Andrés Bello (Vene-
zuela), Domingo F. Sarmiento (Argentina), José Martí (Cuba), Pablo Neruda (Chile), Alejo Carpentier
(Cuba), and Rosario Castellanos (Mexico). In addition, we will test the critical value of this approach by
following current environmental struggles taking place in Latin America where American environmen-
talism is involved. All readings in English.
Format: seminar/discussion. Requirements: Active participation in class discussions. Oral presentation.
Two short papers of 5 pages each comparing two texts from both traditions in light of the theoretical

ENVI 314(S) The Ecology of Ideas of Nature (Same as Comparative Literature 314) (W)*
Contemporary societies across the world are experiencing a "crisis of nature," or rather the crisis of na-
ture's identity when such identity is thought in opposition to "society," "culture," "artificial," etc. The
collapse of this split is brought to us by the consequences of environmental destruction or degradation,
or by scientific changes such as biotechnology and genetic engineering, among others. Challenging this
dualism has also been a major concern in the Social Sciences and the Humanities. This course is an
introduction to current debates on nature/culture across disciplines: post-structuralism, cultural studies,
environmental history, political ecology, Marxism, literary ecocriticism, bio-cultural studies, liberation
theology, and cognitive studies. Against essentialist ideas of nature, the theory of the social construction
of nature argues that our ideas, representations, values and practices regarding nature are originated in
culture and the social rather than in nature itself. The opposition nature/culture, goes the argument, is a
"mental representation" or "construct" transmitted through social interaction. In recent years, however,
this model has been under revision. What we usually call nature is a site of biological, environmental,
social, and cultural relations. "Ecology" means in this case attempts to relocate the theory of the cultural
construction and social production of nature within the interaction of the subject and society, the body
and the environment. The course includes readings from David Abram, Giorgio Agamben, Leonardo
Boff, Lawrence Buell, William Cronon, Arturo Escobar, Felix Guattari, Donna Haraway, David Harvey,
Environmental Studies

Enrique Leff, Carolyn Merchant, Kay Milton, Edgar Morin, Dana Phillips, Vandana Shiva, Reuven
Tsur, Raymond Williams, and Donald Worster. The theoretical readings will be accompanied by mov-
ies, short stories, poems, and literary essays.
Format: seminar. Requirements: Active participation in class discussions. Oral presentations. Each stu-
dent completes, in stages, a research project on the controversy of the social construction of nature. A
12-page background paper at mid-semester will review and integrate the theory read until then. The sub-
sequent research paper incorporates the background paper, with revisions, into a 20-page analysis of the
controversy. This paper will include the remaining readings in the course as well as an interpretation of
the meaning of the controversy itself.

FIRST-YEAR RESIDENTIAL SEMINAR
The First-Year Residential Seminar is part of a program designed to help students explore new
ways of integrating their social and intellectual lives. Students who elect this seminar live together in
the same residential unit. They take the seminar together during the fall semester, and enrollment in
the seminar is restricted to students in the program. The seminar explores topics and issues that can be
expected to promote lively discussions both in and out of class. It may be team-taught and may con-
tain interdisciplinary subject matter.
All entering first-year students have the opportunity to express interest in participating in this pro-
gram; if more students are interested than there are spaces available (usually 18-24), selection is done
randomly. Participants must commit themselves to taking FRS 101.
FRS 101(F) Interpreting Human Experience (W)
How we make sense of the world, and of our lives, depends to a considerable degree on the intellectual
methodologies we apply to the task of interpretation. Freud, for instance, saw selfhood and perception as
fundamentally determined by the structures of the psyche itself; Marx, by contrast, argued that our sense
of reality is conditioned primarily by our material and social circumstances; more recently, historian of
science Thomas Kuhn has emphasized that the underlying assumptions which shape the very questions
we pose as thinkers significantly influence and limit what data, and thus what reality, we are most likely
to observe. This course aims to provide a foundational experience for the liberal arts education, by en-
gaging with key religious, political, literary, anthropological, philosophical and psychoanalytic texts
with a view to complicating our sense of the purposes and possibilities of intellectual life and confront-
ing the challenges of epistemology. Readings will include works by Plato, Rousseau, John Stuart Mill,
Marx, Kuhn, Chinua Achebe, Freud, E.M.Forster, Naguib Mahfouz and extracts from the Bible and the
Koran. In keeping with the aims of the FRS program, the course is intended to foster productive connec-
tions between what we discuss and debate in class and your broader experiences as students. The course
will invite and promote interdisciplinary connections between core ways of seeing and interpreting the
world, with a strong emphasis on improving your critical skills.
Format: seminar. Requirements: regular short writing assignments designed to hone your reading skills;
four papers ranging from 3-5 pages; participation in one or two tutorial sessions; and active contribution
to discussion.

MAJOR
The Geosciences major is designed (1) to provide an understanding of the physical and biological
evolution of our planet and its interacting global systems, (2) to help us learn to live in harmony with
our environment, and (3) to appreciate our place within the vastness of Earth history. Forces within the
Earth are responsible for the development of mountain ranges and ocean basins. Waves, running wa-
ter, and glaciers have shaped the surface of the Earth, providing the landscapes we see today. Fossils
encased in sedimentaryrockssupplyevidencefortheevolutionoflifeand help to record the history of
the Earth.
Students who graduate with a major in Geosciences from Williams can enter several different fields
of geoscience or can use their background in other careers. Students who have continued in the geo-
sciences are involved today, especially after graduate training, in environmental fields ranging from
hydrology to earthquake prediction, in the petroleum and mining industries, federal and state geologi-
cal surveys, geological consulting firms, and teaching and research in universities, colleges, and sec-
ondary schools. Graduates who have entered business or law have also found many applications for
their geoscience background. Other graduates now in fields as diverse as art and medicine pursue their
interest in the out-of-doors with a deeper appreciation for the natural world around them.
Geosciences
­ 173 ­
The Geosciences major sequence includes, after any 100-level course, six designated advanced
courses, and two elective courses.
Sequence Courses (required of majors)
201 Geomorphology
202 Mineralogy and Geochemistry
215 Climate Changes
301 Structural Geology
302 Sedimentation
401 Stratigraphy
Elective courses may be clustered to provide concentrations in selected fields. Suggested group-
ings are listed below as guidelines for course selections, but other groups are possible according to the
interests of the students. Departmental advisors are given for the different fields of Geosciences.
I Environmental Geoscience. For students interested in surface processes and the application of
geology to environmental problems such as land use planning, resource planning, environmental im-
pact analysis, and environmental law. Such students should also consider enrollingin the coordinate
program of the Center for Environmental Studies.
103 Environmental Geology and the Earth's Surface
104 Oceanography
206 Geological Sources of Energy or
208 Water and the Environment
214 Remote Sensing and Geographic Information Systems
215 Climate Changes
(Students interested in Environmental Geosciences should consult with Professors Dethier or Stoll.)
II Oceanography, Stratigraphy and Sedimentation. For students interested in the study of mod-
ern and ancient sedimentary environments and the marine organisms that inhabited them.
101 Biodiversity in Geologic Time
104 Oceanography
206 Geological Sources of Energy
212 Invertebrate Paleobiology
(Students interested in Oceanography, Stratigraphy, and Sedimentation should consult with Professors
M. Johnson or Cox.)
III The Solid Earth. For students interested in plate tectonics, the processes active within the
Earth, the origin and deformation of rocks and minerals, and mineral exploration.
102 An Unfinished Planet
105 Geology Outdoors
303 Igneous and Metamorphic Petrology
(Students interested in The Solid Earth should consult with Professors Wobus or Karabinos.)
With the consent of the department, certain courses at the 200 level or higher in Biology, Chemistry,
Mathematics and Statistics, or Physics may be substituted for elective courses in the major. Credit
may be granted in the Geosciences major for American Maritime Studies 211/Geosciences 210
(Oceanographic Processes) or American Maritime Studies 311/Biology 231 (Marine Ecology) taken
at Mystic Seaport.
Students considering graduate work in geosciences should also take courses in the allied sciences
and mathematics in addition to the requirements of the Geosciences major. The selection of outside
courses will depend on the field in which a student intends to specialize. Most geoscience graduate
schools require a year of Chemistry and Mathematics through 105. For those going into Environmen-
tal Geoscience, courses in computer science or statistics are recommended. For those considering
Oceanography, Stratigraphy, and Sedimentation, Biology 102 and Biology 203 are suggested. For
students entering Solid-Earth fields, Physics 131 and 132 are recommended.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN GEOSCIENCES
In order to be recommended for the degree with honors, a student is expected to have completed at
least two semesters and a winter study project (031) of independent research culminating in a thesis
which demonstrates outstanding achievement of an original and innovative nature. The principal con-
siderations in admitting a student to a program of independent research are mastery of fundamental
material and skills, ability to pursue independent study successfully, and demonstrated student inter-
est and motivation.
Further advice on the major can be obtained from the department chair.
GEOS 101(F) Biodiversity in Geologic Time (Same as Environmental Studies 105)
Is planet Earth now undergoing the most severe mass extinction of species ever to have occurred during
its 4.5-billion-year history? By some calculations, the expanding population of a single species is re-
sponsible for the demise of 74 species per day. This provocative question is addressed by way of the rock
and fossil record as it relates to changes in biodiversity through deep geologic time before the appear-
Geosciences
­ 174 ­
ance of Homo sapiens only 250,000 years ago. Long before human interaction, nature conducted its
own experiments on the complex relationship between evolving life and changes in the physical world.
This course examines ways in which wandering continents, shifting ocean basins, the rise and fall of
mountains, the wax and wane of ice sheets, fluctuating sea level, and even crashing asteroids all shaped
major changes in global biodiversity. Particular attention is drawn to the half dozen most extensive mass
extinctions and what factors may have triggered them. Equal consideration is given to how the develop-
ment of new ecosystems forever altered the physical world. How and when did the earliest microbes
oxygenate the atmosphere? Do the earliest multicellular animals from the late Precambrian portray an
architectural experiment doomed to failure? What factors contributed to the explosive rise in biodivers-
ity at the start of the Cambrian Period? What explanation is there for the sudden appearance of verte-
brates? How and when did plants colonize the land? What caused the demise of the dinosaurs? Is the
present dominance of mammals an accident of nature? The answers to these and other questions are
elusive, but our wise stewardship of the planet and its present biodiversity may depend on our under-
standing of the past. Concepts of plate tectonics and island biogeography are applied to many aspects of
the puzzle.
Format: lecture; one laboratory per week (some involving field work); plus one all-day field trip to the
Helderberg Plateau and Catskill Mountains of New York, and a half-day trip to the Geology Museum at
Amherst College. Evaluation will be based on weekly quizzes and lab work, a midterm exam, and a final
exam.

GEOS 102(S) An Unfinished Planet
The Earth is a work-in-progress, an evolving planet whose vital signs--as expressed by earthquakes,
volcanic eruptions, and shifting plates--are still strong. In a geological time frame, nothing on Earth is
permanent: ocean basins open and close, mountains rise and fall, continental masses accrete and sepa-
rate. There is a message here for all who live, for an infinitesimally brief time, on the moving surface of
the globe. This course uses the plate tectonics model--one of the fundamental scientific accomplish-
ments of this century--to interpret the processes and products of a changing Earth. The emphasis will be
on mountain systems (on land and beneath the oceans) as expressions of plate interactions. Specific top-
ics include the rocks and structures of modern and ancient mountain belts, the patterns of global seismic-
ity and volcanism, the nature of the Earth's interior, the changing configurations of continents and ocean
basins through time, and, in some detail, the formation of the Appalachian Mountain system and the
geological assembly of New England. Readings will be from a physical geology textbook and primary
source supplement, selected writings of John McPhee, and references about the geology of the North-
east.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; lab (several involving field work), two hours per week; one re-
quired all-day field trip during the last week of the semester to the Connecticut Valley and the highlands
of western Massachusetts. Evaluation will be based on two hour-tests, weekly lab work, and a scheduled
final exam.

GEOS 103(F) Environmental Geology and the Earth's Surface (Same as Environmental
Studies 103)
Limitations imposed by the physical environment have become increasingly important as population
expands. Geologic materials such as soil, sediment, and bedrock, and geologic processes involving
earthquakes, volcanic activity, and running water often pose constraints on land use. This course ex-
amines the nature of geologic materials, the physical processes that continuously change the surface of
the Earth, and how these processes affect human activity. Topics include volcanic and earthquake haz-
ards, surface-water erosion and flooding, landslides, groundwater, solid waste disposal, resource issues,
global climate change, and the importance of geologic information to land-use planning. Laboratories
emphasize field and classroom studies of surface processes and discussion of their application to plan-
ning.
Format: lecture/discussion, three hours per week; laboratory, two hours per week; local field trips. Eval-
uation will be based on two hour exams, weekly labs, and a final exam.

and history of the ocean basins; ocean chemistry; oceans through time; currents, tides, and waves;
oceans and climate; coastal processes and ecology; productivity in the oceans; and resources and pollu-
tion. Coastal oceanography will be investigated on an all-day field trip to the New England coast.

GEOS 105(F) Geology Outdoors (W)
An introduction to geology through student field projects. The mountains, lakes, rivers, and valleys of
the Williamstown area provide unusual opportunities for learning geology in the field. Student projects
will include the study of streams as active agents of erosion and deposition, the effects of glaciation on
the New England landscape, and the history of mountain building in the Appalachians. Following sever-
al group projects introducing the techniques of field geology, students will pursue independent projects
on subjects of particular interest to them. This course departs from the standard science course format
with three lectures and a required lab each week. Instead, emphasis is placed on learning through active
participation in field projects and presentation of results through high quality writing. The class will
meet two afternoons each week from 1:00 to 3:45 p.m. There will be two all day field trips. This course
is designed for students who have a serious interest in geology or other natural and environmental
sciences, the outdoors, and writing.
Format: discussion/field laboratory, six hours per week. Evaluation will be based on participation in
field work and discussions, five 8-page papers based on field projects, and an oral presentation of inde-
pendent projects. Students will use detailed comments on their papers to improve their writing style in
successive assignments.
No prerequisites; no previous knowledge of geology required. Open only to first-year students. Enroll-
ment limit: 12 (expected:12).
Hour: 1:10-3:50 TF KARABINOS
GEOS 201(F) Geomorphology (Same as Environmental Studies 205)
This course is designed for geosciences majors and for environmental studies students interested in sur-
ficial geologic processes and their importance in shaping the physical environment. The course empha-
sizes the nature and rates of constructional, weathering, and erosional processes and the influence of
climatic, tectonic, and volcanic forces on landform evolution. Labs focus on field measurements of
hydrologic and geomorphic processes in the Williamstown area as well as on the analysis of topographic
maps and stereo air photos.

tion and crystal chemistry to the phase relations, compositional variation, and mineral associations with-
in major rock-forming mineral systems.
Laboratory work includes the determination of crystal symmetry; mineral separation; the principles and
applications of optical emission spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction and x-ray fluorescence analysis; the use
of the petrographic microscope; and the identification of important minerals in hand specimen and thin

environmental conflicts that result from human intervention in hydrologic processes. Lectures and use
of computer models about hydrology (surface water and groundwater) introduce discussion of topics
such as dams and flooding, pollution of water with nutrients or toxic chemicals, and water-borne dis-
ease. Technical reports and readings in American prose are used to study attitudes about irrigation, water
depletion and salinization, water law and economics, and aspects of the hydraulic empire of the Ameri-
can West.

GEOS 212(S) Invertebrate Paleobiology (Same as Biology 211)
This course offers an introduction to the study of prehistoric life. The fossils of marine invertebrates
provide an excellent foundation for this purpose, because they are widespread and abundant, they are
often well-preserved, and they have a record that reaches back in time over 600 million years. The intel-
lectual discovery of fossils as organic relics and the ways in which fossils were used by earlier genera-
tions to support conflicting views on nature are briefly surveyed. The lecture topics that follow are orga-
nized to illustrate the various directions explored by paleontologists today to solve a broad range of
questions. These include: biological and paleontological views on the species concept relevant to taxon-
omy; ongoing debate over the timing and mechanisms of evolution; biostratigraphy as a means to corre-
late sedimentary rocks; functional morphology as a means to reconstruct the biomechanics of extinct
species; analysis of fossil assemblages to interpret the ecology of ancient environments; paleogeography
as related to patterns in biodiversity, and the possible causes of mass extinctions. Laboratory exercises
utilize superb fossil collections to study the processes of fossilization and to survey the biology and tax-
onomy of the major invertebrate phyla.
Format: lecture/laboratory; field trip to the Lower Devonian Helderbergs of New York State. Evaluation
will be based on weekly lab reports, a midterm paper, a midterm exam, a lab practicum, and a final

GEOS 214(S) Remote Sensing and Geographic Information Systems (Same as Environmental
Studies 214)
Remote sensing involves the collection and processing of data from satellite and airborne sensors to
yield environmental information about the Earth's surface and lower atmosphere. Remote sensing en-
hances regional mapping of rock types and faults and analysis of vegetation cover and land-use changes
over time. A Geographic Information System (GIS) links satellite-based environmental measurements
with spatial data such as topography, transportation networks, and political boundaries, allowing display
and quantitative analysis at the same scale using the same geographic reference. This course covers the
principles and practice of remote-data capture and geographic rectification using a Global Positioning
System (GPS), as well as the concepts of Remote Sensing, including linear and non-linear image en-
hancements, convolution filtering, principle components analysis, and classification. Principles of GIS
include display and classification, spatial buffers, and logical overlays. Weekly labs focus on practical
applications of these techniques to data from Hopkins Memorial Forest, the Berkshire region, and other
areas of North America.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, weekly.
Prerequisites: at least one introductory course in Biology, Environmental Studies, or Geosciences. En-

GEOS 215(F) Climate Changes (Same as Environmental Studies 215) (Q)
In recent years, there has been a growing public and scientific interest in the Earth's climate and its vari-
ability. This interest reflects both concern over future climate changes that may result from anthropogen-
ic increases in atmospheric greenhouse gases and growing recognition of the economic impact of "natu-
ral" climate variability (for example, El Niño events), especially in the developing world. Efforts to un-
derstand the Earth's climate system and predict future climate changes require both study of parameters
controlling present day climate and detailed studies of climate changes in the past. In this course, we will
review the processes that control the Earth's climate, like insolation, distribution of heat, ocean circula-
tion, and the greenhouse effect. At the same time, we will review the geological record of climate
changes in the past, examining their causes, positive and negative feedback effects, and indicators of the
stability or instability of the climate system.
Format: lecture/discussion, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on weekly problems (25%),
two hour exams (50%), and a final project (25%) where students will collect, analyze, and interpret data.
Weekly exercises will emphasize developing problem solving skills and using quantitative analyses to
assess if a given explanation is possible and reasonable. These exercises will include developing and
applying numerical models of the carbon cycle and basic radiative balance models.

GEOS 251T(F) Gulf and Peninsula: The Geology and Ecology of Baja California (W)
This course explores the geological and biological history of the Baja California Peninsula and the adja-
cent Gulf of California from the late Cretaceous to the present. Home to the strange "Boojum" tree, the
Peninsula and adjacent Sea of Cortez are one of the world's hotspots for bio-diversity and geologic re-
search. Part of Mexico's rugged western frontier, much of the Baja Peninsula is geologically and biolog-
ically unexplored. Rocks of the western peninsula record the history of Baja California before the open-
ing of the Gulf of California, while the geology of the Gulf coastal region traces the more recent rifting of
the peninsula away from the Mexican mainland. Originally part of the North American Plate, the Baja
Peninsula now rides along the edge of the Pacific Plate. Biologically, the largely Sonoran desert flora of
the Baja Peninsula provides a sharp contrast with the rich, marine ecosystems on either side. The Cali-
fornia current pushes cold nutrient-rich water along the Pacific coast of the peninsula, while the injection
of these same waters into the incubator of the Gulf of California creates a subtropical marine oasis of
unusual richness that has existed for at least 4.5 million years. Weekly readings from recent journal ar-
ticles will emphasize the tectonic and biological history related to the opening of the Gulf of California.
Format: tutorial. After an initial meeting with all participants, students will meet in pairs with the instruc-
tor for one hour each week. During each session, one student will orally present a written paper for criti-
cism by their partner. Evaluation is based on five written papers and the student's effectiveness as a crit-
ic.
The course will be linked to a Geosciences 025 winter-study fieldtrip to Baja California in 2005. Partici-
pation in the fieldtrip is not required. However, participation in the tutorial is a prerequisite for Geosci-
ences 025.

GEOS 301(F) Structural Geology (Q)
The structure of the Earth's crust is constantly changing and the rocks making up the crust must deform
to accommodate these changes. Rock deformation occurs over many scales ranging from individual
mineral grains to mountain belts. This course deals with the geometric description of structures, stress
and strain analysis, deformation mechanisms in rocks, and the large scale forces responsible for crustal
deformation. The laboratories cover geologic maps and cross sections, folds and faults, stereonet analy-
sis, field techniques, strain, and stress.
Format: lecture/discussion, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours per week. Evaluation will be
based on weekly laboratory exercises, problem sets, a midterm exam, and a final exam. Many of the
laboratories and problem sets use geometry, algebra, and several projection techniques to solve common
problems in structural geology.
Prerequisites: Geosciences 101, 102, 103, or 105 or permission of instructor. No enrollment limit (ex-
pected: 12).

GEOS 302(S) Sedimentation (W)
The composition and architecture of sediments and sedimentary rocks preserve information about the
rocks that were eroded to form them, the fluids and forces that transported them, the mechanisms by
which they were deposited, and the processes by which they were lithified. This course will provide an
introduction to the principles of sedimentology, including sedimentary petrology, fluid mechanics, bed-
form analysis, and facies architecture.
Format: lecture/discussion, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours per week; one half-day and one
all-day field trip. Evaluation will be based on laboratory work, writing assignments, an hour exam, and a
final exam. Ten written critiques (each 1000 words) of specific assigned papers from the sedimentolog-
ical literature are designed to teach clear written expression and careful analytical reading. Papers will be
thoroughly edited for style, grammar and syntax. Students will improve their writing by integrating edi-
torial comments into successive papers. Each student will compile his/her papers as a growing body of
work, and each new paper will be read and edited in the context of the previous submissions.

GEOS 401(F) Stratigraphy
Study of the composition, sequence, and correlation of layered sedimentary rocks is traditionally applied
to geologic mapping and the reconstruction of ancient environments. Through the use of various time
scales, stratigraphy is the unifier of historical geology while also at the heart of conceptual debates over
the uniformism or episodicity of geological processes. During the first half of the course, emphasis will
be placed on the various methods of correlation based on physical means and the use of fossils. The
second half of the course will focus on plate migrations and the relationships between climate and de-
positional environments as a model for the broad scale interpretation of sedimentary sequences. This
part of the course will be conducted as a seminar, with students responsible for topics on the paleogeo-
graphic linkage of climate-sensitive facies and natural resources. As a final project, students working
individually or in pairs will present a detailed analysis of North-American stratigraphic relationships
during a specific interval of Cambrian to Cretaceous time. In sequence, these class reports will provide
highlights of the geologic history of the North-American continent through Paleozoic and Mesozoic
time.
Format: lecture, three hours a week; one three-hour lab per week during the first half of the course (in-
cluding field problems); independent projects during the second half of the course; one major field trip.
Evaluation will be based on weekly lab assignments during the first half of the semester, seminar partici-
pation, and the completion of a final project during the second half of the semester, as well as a midterm
and a final exam.

LANGUAGE STUDY
The department provides language instruction to enable the student to acquire all four linguistic
skills: understanding, speaking, reading, and writing. German 101-W-102 stresses communicative
competence and covers German grammar in full. German 103 combines a review of grammar with
extensive practice in reading and conversation. German 104 aims to develop facility in speaking, writ-
ing, and reading. German 111-112 offers an alternative introduction to German with a focus on read-
ing competence. German 201 emphasizes accuracy and idiomatic expression in speaking and writing.
German 202 combines advanced language study with the examination of topics in German-speaking
cultures. Students who have studied German in secondary school should take the placement test given
during First Days in September to determine which course to take.
STUDY ABROAD
The department strongly encourages students who wish to attain fluency in German to spend a se-
mester or year studying in Germany, Austria, or Switzerland, either independently or in one of several
approved foreign study programs. German 104 or the equivalent is the minimum requirement for ju-
nior-year abroad programs sponsored by American institutions. Students who wish to enroll directly
in a German-speaking university should complete at least 201 or the equivalent. In any case, all stu-
dents considering study-abroad should discuss their language preparation with a member of the de-
partment.
LITERATURE IN TRANSLATION
The department regularly offers courses on German literature in translation for students who have
little or no knowledge of German, but who wish to become acquainted with the major achievements in
German literary and intellectual history.
ADVANCED STUDIES
The department offers a variety of advanced courses for students who wish to investigate German
literature, thought, and culture in the original. German 202 is given each year and is recommended as
preparation for upper-level courses.
THE CERTIFICATE IN GERMAN
To enhance a student's educational and professional profiles, the department offers the Certificate
in German. It requires seven courses--two fewer than the major--and is especially appropriate for
students who begin study of the language at Williams.

Students interested in honors should consult with the department chair no later than April 15 of
their junior year. The usual qualifications for pursuing honors are: (1) an overall GPA of 3.33 or better,
(2) a departmental GPA of 3.67 or better, (3) a strong interest in a specific topic for which an appropri-
ate faculty advisor will be available in the senior year.
GERM 101(F)-W088-102(S) Elementary German
German 101-102 is for students with no previous study of German whose ultimate aim is to gain com-
prehensive fluency in the language. The course employs a communicative approach involving all four
language skills: listening comprehension, speaking, reading, and writing. We focus initially on practice
in understanding the spoken language and then move rapidly to basic forms of dialogue and self-expres-
sion. In the second semester, reading and especially writing come increasingly into play. The course
meets five days a week. Credit granted only on successful completion of 102. Students are required to
attend and pass the sustaining program in Winter Study Period.

GERM 111(F)-112(S) Reading German for Beginners
German 111-112 is for students whose principal reason for acquiring German is to work with written
materials. It is particularly appropriate for students majoring in fields in which the ability to read primary
and secondary texts in German can be crucial, such as Art History, Classics, Comparative Literature,
History, Music, Philosophy, Political Science, and Theatre. In the first semester students learn the ele-
ments of grammar and acquire a core vocabulary. In the second semester, while covering advanced
grammatical topics, they practice reading in a variety of textual genres in the humanities and social
sciences. They also learn how to work with dictionaries, encyclopedias, and other reference works, in
both printed and online forms. By the end of the course they will have a solid foundation for building
proficiency in German, whether through self-study or further course work. Credit granted only on suc-
cessful completion of 112.
Format: lecture and discussion. Principle requirements: written homework, quizzes, tests, active class
participation.

GERM 202(S) Vienna
Once the center of a vast empire, Austria has tended to be overlooked since the demise of that empire. In
fact, though, its trajectory can usefully serve as a guide to the complex developments in Europe before,
during, and after the Second World War. Contemporary Austria is indeed a laboratory of post-Cold War
Europe: Its population is remarkably multicultural, in spite of resistances; its language is rich and dy-
namic, yet increasingly dominated by its more powerful neighbor to the north; its political attitudes en-
compass extreme nationalism, pan-Europeanism, and much in between. Austria's capital, Vienna, will
form the lens through which we examine the origins and quirks of this fascinating, sometimes paradoxi-
cal, culture. The course will employ a variety of written, video, audio and cyber-materials to explore
some of the issues facing contemporary Austria, and to continue the development of advanced reading,
writing, and speaking skills begun in German 107. Conducted in German. Requirements: active class
participation, several 1-2 page writing assignments, final project. Prerequisite: German 107 or the equiv-
alent. Expected enrollment: 8.

GERM 210(S) From Voltaire to Nietzsche (Same as Comparative Literature 211)
The 130 years from Voltaire's Candide to Nietzsche's Anti-Christ were a period of astounding literary
and philosophical development in Europe, with French and German writers not only playing leading
roles but also intensely influencing one another. The course will examine French-German intellectual
achievements and relations against the backdrop of the political and social metamorphoses of France
and Germany from the reign of Louis XV to Bismarck's creation of the Second Reich. Readings will be
drawn from the works of Voltaire, Lessing, Rousseau, Kant, Goethe, Condorcet, Schiller, Madame de
Staël, Novalis, Nerval, Büchner, Baudelaire, Marx, George Sand, and Nietzsche. All readings in English
translation, but students with competence in French and/or German will have the opportunity to read
some works in the original.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: active class participation, two take-home essay exams.

GENERAL STATEMENT OF GOALS
The core objectives of the History department are the cultivation of a critical understanding and
awareness of the past and the development of our students' intellectual, analytical, and rhetorical abil-
ities. In pursuit of the first objective, through its curricular offerings the department seeks both to ex-
pose students to the richness, diversity, and complexities of human history over long periods of time
and in different geographic regions and to provide students with the opportunity to explore aspects of
the past in depth. At the same time, the department endeavors to develop students' ability to think
historically and to foster in them an appreciation of the contested nature and the value of historical
knowledge by confronting them with the variety of ways in which historians have approached and
interpreted the past, engaging them in issues that provoke historical debate, and familiarizing them
with the nature and uses of historical evidence. By engaging students in the critical study of the past,
finally, the department seeks to develop their ability to formulate historically informed opinions and
their analytical and rhetorical skills generally. While members of the department attempt to accom-
plish these multiple objectives individually through their particular courses and their other contacts
with students, the department seeks to do so collectively through the structure of the History curricu-
lum and the requirements of the History major.
COURSE NUMBERS
The course numbering system used by the History Department reflects the different types and ob-
jectives of courses offered at each level. The different course levels are distinguished less by degree of
difficulty than by the purposes that the courses at each level are intended to serve and the background
knowledge they presume.
First-Year Seminars and Tutorials (102-199): These writing intensive courses introduce stu-
dents to the richness of historical approaches to the past and to the contested subjects on which
historians focus. They emphasize the acquisition of skills needed in the advanced study of his-
tory and are ideal for students contemplating a major in History. Each seminar is limited to
nineteen students, and each tutorial, to ten students. In the case of seminars, Preference given to
first-year students and then to sophomores. First-year students and sophomores will be given
equal preference in the case of tutorials, to which the writing of five or six essays and the oral
presentation of five or six critiques of another student's essays are central. In any case, first-
year students will not normally be permitted to enroll in a tutorial during their first semester.
Because first-year seminars and tutorials serve as an introduction to the study of history, only
one course of each type may count toward the History major; these courses can also be used to
meet the department's group and concentration requirements.
Introductory Survey Courses (202-299): These courses are open to all students and are intended to
provide a basic understanding of the history of peoples, countries, and geographic regions over rel-
atively long time-spans. Most of all, they will provide students with the background necessary for
more advanced study in history at the 300 and 400 level. They are offered in either small or large
formats, depending on the individual course.
Junior Seminars (301): Junior seminars offer a series of "reflections on history," are required for the
degree in History, and are normally restricted to junior History majors. Each seminar focuses in
depth on questions of methodology, historiography, and/or epistemology and is intended to
introduce students to various ways of thinking about and "doing" history, both in the present and in
the past. Each year several junior seminars will be offered; prospective majors must select two ju-
nior seminars at the end of their sophomore year and will then be assigned to one of their two
choices. If students are studying away from Williams during their junior year, they must enroll in a
junior seminar during their senior year.
History
­ 183 ­
Advanced Electives (302-399): These advanced, topical courses are more specialized in focus than are the
introductory survey courses (202-299) and are intended to follow such courses. Enrollment is often limit-
ed. Because these courses may presume some background knowledge, the instructor may recommend that
students enroll in an appropriate introductory course before registering for an advanced elective.
Advanced Seminars (402-479): These are advanced courses normally limited in enrollment to fif-
teen students. Each seminar will investigate a topic in depth and will require students to engage in
research that leads to a substantial piece of historical writing. All History majors are required to
complete either an advanced seminar (402-479) or a tutorial (480-492). Instructors may recom-
mend prior coursework in the area of the seminar. Preference given to senior History majors, fol-
lowed by junior History majors.
Advanced Tutorials (480-492): These are advanced reading and writing courses that offer an in-
depth analysis of a topic in tutorial format. Tutorials are limited in enrollment to ten students and
Preference given to senior History majors. All History majors are required to complete either an
advanced seminar (402-479) or a tutorial (480-492). Instructors may recommend prior coursework
in the area of the tutorial. The writing of five or six essays and the oral presentation of five or six
critiques of another student's essays are central to tutorials.
Within each of these levels, courses are further divided by geographical area:
Africa and the Middle East 102-111 202-211 302-311 402-411
Asia 112-121 212-221 312-321 412-421

ADVISING
Both majors and non-majors are encouraged to talk at any time with Professor Wagner, the depart-
ment chair, Mrs. Swift, the department administrative assistant, or any other member of the depart-
ment about the History major.
All majors will be assigned a faculty advisor. All majors must meet with their advisor, or the depart-
ment chair, during the first week of classes during the fall semester and at the time of the spring semes-
ter registration period in order to have their courses and plans for the History major approved. Stu-
dents who are interested in the senior honors program or graduate school should contact Professor
Wong. Prospective study abroad students should contact Mrs. Swift.
ADVANCED PLACEMENT
Students receiving a score of 5 on any AP history examination will be guaranteed a place in the
100-level History seminar of their choice.

At least one Advanced Seminar (History 402-479) or Tutorial (History 480-492)
Elective Courses
Seven (or more) additional semester courses in History, at least one of these to be chosen from each
of the following three groups:
Group A: History of the United States
Group B: European History (including Russian History)
Group C: History of Asia, Africa and the Middle East, and/or Latin-American and the Caribbean
In addition, students must take at least one course dealing with the premodern period (designated
Group D in the catalog); this may be one of the courses used to fulfill the group requirement (Groups
A-C).
A single course can meet the requirement for no more than one of Groups A through C. Only one
First-year seminar and one First-year tutorial (102-199) may be used to meet the group requirements.
Concentration in the Major
All students are required to adopt a concentration within the History major. The concentration
should be selected in consultation with a faculty advisor at spring registration during the sophomore
year. A list of concentrations is appended below and a list of the courses that fall within each con-
centration is available from the History Department office and can also be found on the department's
website. Students must choose to concentrate in one of these eighteen broad areas unless they petition
History
­ 184 ­
the department's Curriculum Committee to substitute a concentration of their own design. A con-
centration will consist of at least three courses linked by common themes, geography, or time period;
only one of those courses can be a 100-level seminar while at least one must be a 300- or 400-level
course. Courses in the concentration may be used to fulfill the group requirements. In selecting
courses to meet their concentration requirement, students should be aware that not every course is
offered every year. Courses taken abroad may be included in the concentration with the approval of
the chair.
Concentrations:
1. Africa and the African Diaspora
2. Asia and the Asian Diaspora
3. Comparative Slavery
4. Ancient, Medieval, and Renaissance Europe
5. Early Modern Europe
6. Modern Europe
7. Gender and Sexuality
8. History of Ideas

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN HISTORY
The History Department offers a thesis route to the degree with honors in History. This involves a
ten-course major as well as an independent WSP. Students wishing to undertake independent research
or considering graduate study are encouraged to participate in the thesis program and honors seminar.
Application to enter the honors program should be made by spring registration in the junior year
and should be based on a solid record of work of honors caliber, normally defined as maintaining at
least a B+ average in courses taken for the major. Students who intend to write an honors thesis must
submit a proposal to the History Department at this time. Students who will be away during the spring
semester of their junior year should make arrangements to apply before leaving. Normally, it is the
responsibility of the individual student to procure the agreement of a member of the department to act
as his or her thesis advisor, and the student must therefore consult with a member of the department
about a thesis topic and a possible thesis advisor prior to submitting a proposal to the department. A
student who is uncertain of which member of the department might be an appropriate advisor, or who
otherwise is unable to find an advisor, should contact the chair of the honors committee. An honors
thesis proposal must be signed by a member of the History Department. Normally, the thesis topic
should be related to course work which the student has previously done. Students should be aware,
however, that while the department will try to accommodate all students who qualify to pursue hon-
ors, particular topics may be deemed unfeasible and students may have to revise their topics accord-
ingly. Final admission to the honors thesis program will depend on the department's assessment of the
qualifications of the student and the feasibility of the project.
Once the student has been notified of admission to the honors thesis program, he or she should reg-
ister for History 493, Senior Honors Thesis Research Seminar, in the fall semester, for History 031
during winter study, and for History 494, Senior Honors Thesis Writing Seminar, in the spring. In
addition to doing the research for and writing a thesis of approximately 75-100 pages, students will
attend special presentations under the History Department's Class of 1960 Scholars Program.
During the fall, students should work regularly on their research and consult frequently with their
advisors. Throughout the semester, honors candidates will also present written progress reports for
group discussion to the seminar (History 493). Performance in the seminar will be evaluated on the
basis of class participation and completed written work and will determine if a student will continue in
the thesis program. For students proceeding to History 031 and History 494, performance in the fall
semester will figure into the thesis grade calculated at the end of the year.
Students who are deemed to be making satisfactory progress on their research and writing at this
point will be allowed to continue with the thesis. They will devote the entire winter study period to
thesis work. They should conclude their research during winter study and complete at least one chap-
ter of their thesis for submission to their advisor before the end of winter study. At the end of winter
study, the honors committee will formally consult with advisors and make recommendations to the
department concerning which students should be allowed to proceed with the thesis. During the early
History
­ 185 ­
weeks of the second semester, students will present a draft chapter of their thesis to the honors semi-
nar.
Completed theses will be due in mid-April, after which each student will prepare and present a
short oral presentation of his or her thesis for delivery at the departmental Honors Colloquium. Anoth-
er student who has read the thesis will then offer a critique of it, after which the two faculty readers of
the thesis will offer their own comments and questions. Finally, there will be a general discussion of
the thesis by students and other members of the department.
LANGUAGE
Study of a foreign language is basic to the understanding of other cultures. Particularly those stu-
dents who might wish to do graduate work in History are encouraged to enroll in language courses at
Williams.
COURSES
FIRST-YEAR SEMINARS AND TUTORIALS (102-199)
These writing intensive courses introduce students to the richness of historical approaches to the
past and to the contested subjects on which historians focus. They emphasize the acquisition of skills
needed in the advanced study of history and are ideal for students contemplating a major in History.
Each seminar is limited to nineteen students, and each tutorial, to ten students. In the case of seminars,
Preference given to first-year students and then to sophomores. First-year students and sophomores
will be given equal preference in the case of tutorials, to which the writing of five or six essays and the
oral presentation of five or six critiques of another student's essays are central. In any case, first-year
students will not normally be permitted to enroll in a tutorial during their first semester. Because first-
year seminars and tutorials serve as an introduction to the study of history, only one course of each
type may count toward the History major; these courses can also be used to meet the department's
group and concentration requirements.
FIRST-YEAR SEMINARS AND TUTORIALS: Africa and the Middle East (111-121)
HIST 111(S) Movers and Shakers in the Middle East (Same as Leadership Studies 150)
(W)*
This course examines the careers, ideas, and impact of leading politicians, religious leaders, intellectu-
als, and artists in the Middle East in the twentieth century. Utilizing biographical studies and the general
literature on the political and cultural history of the period, this course will analyze how these individuals
achieved prominence in Middle Eastern society and how they addressed the pertinent problems of their
day, such as war and peace, relations with Western powers, the role of religion in society, and the status
of women. A range of significant individuals will be studied, including Gamal Abd al-Nasser, Mustafa
Kemal Ataturk, Ayatollah Khomeini, Muhammad Mussadiq, Umm Khulthum, Sayyid Qutb, Anwar
Sadat, Naghuib Mahfouz, and Huda Shaarawi.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class participation, short essays, and a final paper.

HIST 114(S) Slavery in Africa (W)*
This course explores contentious debates in African history, about the nature of slavery in Africa. What
do we understand by 'African slavery'? Was slavery indigenous to Africa, or did foreigners impose it on
the continent? Was slavery in Africa so different from slavery in the Americas that we need to refer to it
by a different name? Was slavery in Africa the same for women and for men? Can we speak of 'African
slavery' at all, or were there different kinds of slavery in different regions? How did slavery change over
time? Does slavery exist in Africa today? We will explore these, and other, questions via analysis of both
secondary resources--what historians have argued--and primary resources, sources generated in the
contexts of slavery. Through such discussions, we will come to a better understanding of slavery, Afri-
can history, and the craft of history itself.
Format: discussion. Evaluation will be based on pop quizzes, class participation, a series of critical dis-
cussion pieces, and two essays.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit:19 (expected: 12-15). Open to all.

HIST 135T(S) The Great War, 1914-1918 (W)
During the nineteenth and early twentieth century Europeans and their immediate offspring created the
modern world. European industry, science, trade, weapons, and culture dominated the globe. After a
century of general peace the continual "progress" of Western Civilization seemed assured. Then, in Au-
gust, 1914, the major European powers went to war with one another. After four years of unprecedented
carnage, violence, and destruction, Europe was left exhausted and bitter, its previous optimism replaced
by pessimism, its world position undermined, and its future clouded by a deeply flawed peace settle-
ment.
What were the fundamental causes of the Great War? How and why did it break out when it did and who
was responsible? Why was it so long, ferocious, wasteful, and, until the very end, indecisive? Why did
the Allies, rather than the Central Powers, emerge victorious? What did the peace settlement settle? How
was Europe changed? What is the historical significance of the conflict?
Format: tutorial.

HIST 136(F) Before the Deluge: Paris and Berlin in the Interwar Years (W)
Paris and Berlin were the two poles of Europe in the 1920s, rival capital cities of two historically hostile
nations that had only just put an end to the carnage of World War I. Paris was the grande dame; Berlin the
upstart. In the 1920s, these two pulsating metropolises became the sites of political and cultural move-
ments that would leave a lasting imprint on European society until the present day. This course focuses
on the politics, society, and culture of these two cities in their heyday in the 1920s. We will also consider
their fate in the 1930s, first as depression set in, and then as the Nazis came to power. Devoting half the
semester to Paris and the other half to Berlin, we will examine a range of parallel topics in both contexts,
including the impact of World War I, the growing popularity of right-wing political movements and the
increase in political violence, shifting gender norms and sexual mores, and new developments in the
realms of art, film, theatre, cabaret, and literature.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class attendance and participation, several short papers,
and a final research paper.

HIST 148(S) (formerly 102) The Mexican Revolution: 1910 to NAFTA (W)*
The first great revolution in the twentieth century, the Mexican Revolution was as dramatic and compel-
ling as later episodes in Russia, China and Cuba. Using a wide variety of sources--from films, murals,
and comic books to classic works of political and social history--this seminar will examine the forces
that exploded in over a decade of violence and produced the peculiar "institutional revolutionary" gov-
ernment that ruled Mexico from the 1920s to the crises of the late 1990s. Was the Revolution a true
social revolution or just a "palace coup"? Did workers, women, peasants, or indigenous peoples make
real gains in social or political power during the after the Revolution? How democratic or authoritarian is
the Mexico that emerged from the brutal decade of the 1910s? Finally, in light of globalization, the polit-
ical scandals of the 1990s, and ongoing peasant rebellion in Chiapas, is the Revolution dead or is its
promise only now to be fulfilled?
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class participation, a series of short written assignments,
and a research paper.

HIST 152(F) "New Worlds for All": European-Indian Encounters in Colonial North America
(W)*
This course focuses on the interactions between Indians and Europeans in the contexts of Spanish,
French, Dutch, and British exploration and colonization of North America. Drawing upon our critical
reading of secondary and primary sources, we will explore the political, economic, social, and cultural
transformations visited upon both Indian and Euro-American societies as a result of European attempts
to control vast North American territories from the Saint Lawrence valley to Florida and from the Lower
Mississippi valley to California. Because of the large scope of our inquiry we will proceed both chrono-
logically and thematically. Our themes will include: Indian resistance and adaptation to European inva-
History
­ 187 ­
sions and evangelizing efforts; diplomacy, warfare, and the evolution of North American geopolitics;
Frontier exchange economies and the transformation of material cultures; the transformation and
construction of colonial identities (Euro-American and Indian concepts of "self," the racialization of
Euro-American perceptions of Indians and Indians' perceptions of Europeans).
Over the course of the semester, students will write several response papers based on secondary readings
to help them assess how historians have addressed these themes. These papers will serve as the basis for
our discussion of the methodologies, theories, and sources historians use to reconstruct the history of
European-Indian encounters. Short response papers will also familiarize students with some of the most
important historiographical debates of colonial North American history and will help them conceptual-
ize and write an original research paper based upon a combination of primary and secondary sources.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class attendance and participation, weekly response pa-
pers and the final research paper.

HIST 166(F) The Age of Washington and DuBois (W)*
The beginning of the twentieth century saw the rise of two influential African American thinkers, W. E.
B. DuBois and Booker T. Washington. The intellectual and social programs that the two offered as solu-
tions to the "race problem" are often seen as diametrically opposed to one another. This course will be-
gin with an examination of the writings and intellectual production of these two men. Did they share a
common ground? What were their responses and solutions to "the Negro question"? How did their ideas
take effect? We will also set their work into an African American historical context, examining concur-
rent social developments such as the mass migration of African Americans to northern cities, the work-
ings of the sharecropping system, and the cultural production of African American film and music artists
in the first decades of the twentieth century. Readings will include works by Washington and DuBois,
autobiographies of lesser-known Black figures in this era, and works by and about Black women at this
time. We will also listen to early blues music and view films.

INTRODUCTORY SURVEY COURSES (201-299)
These courses are open to all students and are intended to provide a basic understanding of the his-
tory of peoples, countries, and geographic regions over relatively long time-spans. Most of all, they
will provide students with the background necessary for more advanced study in history at the 300
and 400 level. They are offered in either small or large formats, depending on the individual course.
INTRODUCTORY SURVEY COURSES: AFRICA AND THE MIDDLE EAST (201-209)
HIST 201(F) Modern African History*
Historian Ali Mazrui has proposed that there are four "African denials": denials of African history, Afri-
can science African poetry and African philosophy. This course explores these aspects of modern Afri-
can history and other denials or points of contention, including African sexualities. We examine the eco-
nomic, political, social and cultural forces that shaped Africa in the modern era, and continue to influ-
ence the lives of people into the new millennium. We trace the incorporation of Africa into the expand-
ing world economy with the shift from the transatlantic slave trade to "legitimate commerce," through
colonial rule to and through independence--including the ways in which Africans resisted, or tried to
harness, colonialism for their own purposes. We explore the rise of nationalism, pan-Africanism, and
challenges and achievements of post-colonial societies.

The ascension of powerful warlords in the late 1500s brought to an end a century of constant warfare and
laid the foundation for the Tokugawa bakufu, the military government headed by the Tokugawa shogun
that would rule Japan for almost three hundred years. This course will introduce students to the extraor-
dinary changes of the years between the establishment of the Tokugawa bakufu in 1603 and its collapse
in 1868, a period characterized by the growth of cities and towns, the flourishing of urban culture, and
the decline of the samurai. We will focus on the political and social history of early modern Japan, in-
cluding topics such as the establishment of the Tokugawa order, the roles and everyday lives of samurai
and commoners, class and status, gender and sexuality, religion, education, and culture. Assigned mate-
rials will include literature, films, and primary sources in translation.

various "ordinary people" have lived through the extraordinary changes of the past century and a half.
Through the perspectives of ordinary people, from a young girl working in a cotton textile factory in the
1920s to a salaryman in the post-World War II period, issues of class and status, gender, family, educa-
tion, and work will be addressed. Reading materials will include autobiographies, oral histories, and an-

INTRODUCTORY SURVEY COURSES: EUROPE AND RUSSIA (222-241)
HIST 222(F) (formerly 216) Greek History (Same as Classics 222)
Ancient Greece has been thought to embody the origins of Western civilization in its institutions, values,
and thought; it has been seen as the infancy of modern society, with the attributes of innocence, purity,
and the infant's staggering capacity for exploration and learning; it has been interpreted as an essentially
primitive, violent culture with a thin veneer of rationality; and it has been celebrated as the rational cul-
ture par excellence. The study of ancient Greece indeed requires an interpretive framework, yet Greek
culture and history have defied most attempts to articulate one. We will make our attempt in this course
by investigating ancient Greece as a set of cultures surprisingly foreign to us, as it so often was to its own
intellectual elite. But we will also come to appreciate the rich and very real connections between ancient
Greek and modern Western civilization. The course will begin with Bronze Age-Greece and the earliest
developments in Greek culture, and will conclude with the spread of Greek influence into Asia through
the conquests of Alexander the Great. We will explore topics such as the aristocratic heritage of the city-
state, the effects of pervasive war on Greek society, the competitive spirit in political and religious life,
the confrontations with the East, the relationship of intellectual culture to Greek culture as a whole,
Greek dependence on slavery, and the diversity of political and social forms in the Greek world. The
readings will concentrate on original sources, including historical writings, philosophy, poetry, and ora-
tory. The class will meet once a week for a lecture, and will divide into two discussion sections for the
second meeting of the week.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on contributions to class discussions, a midterm, a

HIST 228(S) Europe in the Twentieth Century
This survey course has two goals: to introduce students to the fundamental issues and experiences of the
last century of European history, from the eve of World War One to the present, and to teach students to
be historians. Toward that end, students will be required, in class and in written assignments, to use pri-
mary sources in conjunction with secondary source readings to pose questions and suggest interpreta-
tions about the past. Wars, depression, political changeovers, urbanization, technological advancements
all have a profound impact on the lives of ordinary people; so, too, ordinary people shape those historical
developments. We will focus on learning how to empathize with people from the past and to understand
their experiences on their terms. What was it like to return to civilian life after fighting in the First World
War? What were the experiences of Europeans between the wars? Why did so many Germans support
History
­ 190 ­
Hitler and what was it like for different segments of European society to live through World War II? In a
divided postwar Europe, what hopes and betrayals did Europeans on different sides of the Iron Curtain
experience in the realms of social, economic, and legal justice? How have Europeans since the fall of the
Berlin Wall attempted to confront their pasts? By the end of this course, students will be familiar with the
central themes of the history of twentieth-century Europe and understand how to analyze historical doc-
uments, which students can replicate in their future research and writing.

Scramble for Africa. Issues to be explored include imperialism and its relationship to Christianity, gen-
der, racism, and economic profit. In the second half of the course, we will examine some of the most
dramatic cases of decolonization, including Gandhi and Nehru's independence movement in India, Ho
Chi Minh's victory at Dien Bien Phu, and the torturous struggle for independence in the Belgian Congo.

HIST 239(F) Modern German History: From Unification to Reunification, 1871-1990
This course will introduce students to the turbulent and often vexing history of German politics, society,
and culture in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries. At the start of our period, Germany became a
unified nation-state for the first time in its history under the iron fist of Bismarck. Two world wars and
several political regimes later, Germany was again united but this time as a European-oriented demo-
cratic state. Throughout the intervening period, the questions of what it meant to be German and how
Germany should fit into Europe and the world were vigorously debated. The different answers that sub-
sequent generations of Germans arrived at have had tremendous implications for people throughout the
world. This survey will be guided by the question of German identity and by the issue of what problems
the German past poses for today. We will study modern Germany in its various forms, from the Empire
through the Weimar Republic and the Third Reich, to post-war division and reunification. Our primary
focus will be the continuities and discontinuities of German history, particularly with regard to Nazism
and the issue of how far the two postwar Germanies broke with the past.
Format: mostly discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, three papers, and a final
exam.

HIST 281(F) African-American History, 1619-1865*
This course provides an introduction to the history of the first two and a half centuries of the experience
of African Americans in colonial America and the United States. Economically, culturally, and politi-
cally, African Americans had a profound effect on the historical landscape of this nation. The experience
of slavery necessarily dominates this history and it is the contours and nuances of slavery that give this
course its focus. We will explore the influence of African culture on early America, the role of gender in
the American slave labor system, the development of racial classification in North America, and the
cultural and intellectual significance of the abolitionist movement. Our readings will include primary
sources and secondary literature. Class meetings will combine lecture and discussion. Informed partici-
pation in class discussion is essential.

JUNIOR SEMINARS (301)
Junior Seminars offer a series of "reflections" on history, are required for the degree in History, and
are normally restricted to junior History majors. Each seminar focuses in depth on questions of meth-
odology, historiography, and/or epistemology and is intended to introduce students to various ways of
thinking about and "doing" history, both in the present and in the past. Each year several junior semi-
nars will be offered; prospective majors must select two junior seminars at the end of the sophomore
year and will then be assigned to one of their two choices. If students are studying away from Williams
during their junior year, they must enroll in a junior seminar during their senior year.

HIST 301D(F,S) Is History Eurocentric?
The modern historical profession is very much a European creation, originating in the Age of Enlighten-
ment. Championing reason and challenging religious views of the past, the Philosophes linked the new
secular study of man and his society to a view of historical progress. Some have argued that the very
nature of the historical discipline is Eurocentric, based as it is on Western concepts of reason, science,
and historical evolution which privilege European history at the expense of its non-Western counter-
parts. In this course, we will study some of the important spokesmen for historical progress (Voltaire,
Condorcet, Marx, von Ranke) as well as some of their important critics. The first half of the course will
survey the history of the historical profession from the Enlightenment to the present. In the second half
of the course, we will read some of the great works of history which have attempted to explain the rise of
the west, grappling with how and to what extent these interpretations are Eurocentric.
Format? Evaluation will be based on class participation, class debates, two short papers (5 pages), one
long paper (10 pages) and a self-scheduled final exam.
Restricted to History majors.

HIST 301E(S) Barbarians, Saints, and Emperors: The Fall of Rome Reconsidered (W)
The fall of Rome has long fascinated historians. In his monumental Decline and Fall of the Roman Em-
pire (1776), Edward Gibbon argued that classical civilization collapsed under the weight of "barbarism
History
­ 193 ­
and superstition" (i.e., Germanic invasions and Christianity), thus giving rise to the European "Dark
Ages." But in recent years scholars have reconsidered this period of "Late Antiquity" (roughly AD
150-750), seeing continuity, complexity, and transformation where Gibbon saw only decline and fall.
This course explores how historians have tried to interpret this foundational period of European civiliza-
tion from political, military, economic, cultural, and social perspectives. We will consider such topics as
the rise of Christianity and Islam, relations between Romans and "barbarians," the function of saints and
relics, the formation of Germanic kingdoms and the Byzantine Empire, and changes in early European
economy and society. Throughout, we will pay particular attention to the topics, evidence, methodolo-
gies, and assumptions historians use to recreate the history of the distant past.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class participation, bi-weekly book reviews, and a longer
paper.
Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 10-18). Restricted to History majors.

HIST 301F(F) Remembering American History
Much of what we know and understand about American history is rooted in the received narrative of our
national history, a history that is constructed of individual, collective, and a national memory of the past
and its meanings. This course will examine some forms through which American historical memory is
presented and (re)presented, such as monuments, museums, novels, film, photographs, and scholarly
historical writing, by considering a number of pivotal events, institutions, or eras in American history:
slavery, race, and the Civil War; the Great Depression; World War II; the Sixties and the war in Viet
Nam; and the events and aftermath of September 11, 2001.
Format: seminar. Assignments will include weekly response papers, critical essays, a museum exercise,
and a final project to be completed in consultation with the instructor.

These advanced, topical courses are more specialized in focus than are the introductory survey

courses may presume some background knowledge, the instructor may recommend that students en-
roll in an appropriate introductory course before registering for an advanced elective.
ADVANCED ELECTIVES: AFRICA AND THE MIDDLE EAST (302-311)
HIST 302(F) Apartheid South Africa*
The system of apartheid was built on segregation, which was itself built on colonialism. This course,
therefore, begins with an introduction to southern Africa before 1948. Our focus, however, is on the
construction and deconstruction of the apartheid state between 1948 and 1994. Economic, political, so-
cial and cultural transformations are traced, with the key narrative being, firstly, the attempts of the apart-
heid state to shape South Africa in specific ways. Intersecting with and shaping this narrative is the pres-
sure from the majority of South Africans for social justice. We explore the apartheid government's sys-
tem of racial classification, group areas, sexual and racial engineering, migrant labor, "influx control,"
political repression and the use of state violence, ideological control, and Bantu Education. The second
strand of the narrative is the rise of mass politics under the banner of the Congress movement in the
1950s through the rise of Africanist vs. non-racial politics and Black Consciousness, to the Mass Demo-
cratic Movement and the unbanning of the ANC and other parties in 1990, through the transition to de-
mocracy in 1994. In addition to political resistance, the course examines the rise of Black Consciousness
and cultural forms of resistance, and how ordinary people survived the massive onslaught of the apart-
heid state. The course ends with the triumph of 1994, and the challenges facing the "new South Africa."
Format: discussion. Evaluation based on two essays, quizzes, class participation including presentation
and peer review.

HIST 303(S) Post-Apartheid South Africa*
In April 2004, South Africans celebrated ten years of democracy. In 1994, the country's first democratic
elections signaled the death of apartheid; the South African Bill of Rights is perhaps the most progres-
sive in the world. However, the new South Africa had to be built on the old South Africa, which was
never completely dismantled. This course explores the legacies of apartheid, and how South Africans set
about righting the wrongs of the past and constructing a non-racial society. After a brief analysis of the
transition from apartheid to democracy under the auspices of CODESA (The Congress for a Democratic
South Africa) before 1994, we examine the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and other aspects of
History
­ 194 ­
the nation-building process. We then explore the challenges facing South Africa as the legacies of apart-
heid continue to haunt the country--poverty and socio-economic dislocation, intersecting with issues
around land, housing, water, electricity, health (including HIV/AIDS), education, unemployment, rac-
ism, xenophobia, gender-based violence, sexuality, and crime--and how people face these challenges
on a daily basis. We also examine the ways in which ordinary people, as well as those in government,
work to construct a society that, while still wedded to the past, builds a future.

From the ancient world to the twentieth century, war has always played an important part in European
history. Europeans have not only constantly been at war with other Europeans, but also with neighboring
cultures and, indeed, most peoples around the globe. This course will introduce students to the history of
European warfare from its origins in the classical and medieval periods to its maturation in the early
modern period (1450-1815), and its disastrous culmination in the nationalist struggles of the nineteenth
and twentieth centuries. Has there been a distinctively "European Way of War" from the beginning?
How do we explain failure and success in European wars? What exactly happened at the strategic, op-
erational, and tactical levels of war? And what caused changes in the organization and waging of Euro-
pean war from one period to the next?

In twenty-first century America, the murder of approximately six million European Jews by Nazi Ger-

still confounds historians' efforts to understand both the motivations of the perpetrators and the suffering
of the victims. In this course, we will study the origins and implementation of the Holocaust from the
divergent perspectives of perpetrators and victims. Our goal will be to investigate deeply the interaction
of individual lives and world historical events. We will also examine the Holocaust within the larger
context of the history of World War II in Europe and the historians' debates about Germany's extermina-
tory war aims. Course materials will include diaries, bureaucratic documents, memoirs, films, and his-
torical scholarship.

This course examines the U.S.-Mexican Borderlands both as a culturally coherent region and as one
divided by a geopolitical boundary, as well as other social, economic, and cultural borders. A central
concern of the class will be to study the cross-border movement of people, ideas, and culture in the cre-
History
­ 197 ­
ation of this border region. In order to establish historical background, we will begin by addressing en-
counters among indigenous peoples and Europeans and examine the significance of the Spanish colo-
nial system in the formation of the borderlands. The larger part of the class will focus on the social, cul-
tural, and political development of the border region from nineteenth-century U.S. expansionism to the
second Bracero Program during World War II. Though we will concentrate primarily on the U.S.-Mexi-
can Borderlands, the class will also draw links with other border zones around the world. We will ex-
amine theories of borders and borderlands. Class materials will include secondary readings, primary
documents, oral histories, novels, and films.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, three response papers (1
page), a short midterm essay (5 pages), and a final paper (10-12 pages) and presentation to the class. In
this paper, students will examine a borderlands theme of their choice, either from the period covered in
class or the more recent past.

HIST 392(S) Comparative Slavery: The Origins and Development of North American and
Caribbean Slavery*
This course explores the history of Atlantic Slavery in the contexts of the Spanish, French, Dutch, and
British colonizations of the Caribbean and North America from the early sixteenth century to the late
eighteenth century. Based on our reading of primary and secondary material, we will seek to understand
the origins and transformation of the various forms of enslavement that emerged in association with the
rise of Euro-American empires. Why did racial slavery become an institution in all the European em-
pires of the North Atlantic? How did different European colonial powers justify the enslavement of Na-
tive peoples and Africans? How can we account for the diverse forms that slavery assumed in the re-
gion? To what extent can we talk of a typically Spanish, French, British, or Dutch form of colonial slav-
ery? What were the factors shaping the individual experiences of slaves in Euro-American colonies?
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, a series of short response
papers, a final exam, and a research paper of moderate length based on primary and secondary sources.

HIST 395(S) Comparative History of Organized Crime*
Inextricably embedded in political systems, economies, civil societies, and cultures, organized crime
groups are a powerful and expansive phenomena fueled by businesses from the international drug trade
to human trafficking and protected by their violent and extortionate methods. This course examines the
rise and expansion of organized crime in Italy and the United States, as well as Japan and Russia, to
explore how and why organized crime emerges in certain societies, what shapes its development into
sophisticated and powerful enterprises, and how it continues to exist. We will also address how orga-
nized crime has inspired popular imaginations with ideas of a vast underworld empire distinctly modern
in business operations yet traditional in structure and codes of behavior. Topics will include the transition
from disorganized gangsterism to organized crime, its structure and business enterprises, its influence on
politics and economics, how certain organized crime groups rise in certain cities, the impact of global-
ization on organized crime, myths about organized crime and its history, and how portrayals of orga-
nized crime in popular cultures have changed over time.

HIST 408(F) Archaeology, Politics, and Heritage in the Middle East*
Archaeological sites and artifacts are not merely relics of the past; they can also be potent and conspicu-
ous symbols of national identity for the modern nation-state. In the Middle East, with its rich archaeolog-
ical heritage, the relationship among politics, nationalism, and archeology has been particularly strong
and interesting. Nevertheless, this is a topic that has only recently attracted the attention of historians. In
this seminar, we will analyze the experience of several Middle Eastern countries, including Iraq, Israel,
Turkey, Egypt, Lebanon, and Iran, and how they utilized archaeology for state-building purposes. We
will discuss how archaeology entered the political discourse, the creation of regional and national mu-
seums, the interpretation of archaeological artifacts in the arts and literature, and archaeology's role in
contested terrains and political disputes. We will also explore the function of archaeology in the region's
important tourism industry. Finally, the issue of cultural patrimony and the emotional impact of archae-
ology in the region will be addressed.

ADVANCED SEMINARS: LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN (442-451)
HIST 443(S) (formerly 355) Slavery, Race and Ethnicity in Latin America*
At times in this century African Americans have looked to Brazil and other Latin-American countries as
a sort of racial paradise, where people of color did not suffer the same brutal prejudice and violence that
they faced in the U.S. Especially since the 1930s, on the other hand, some Latin Americans of African
descent have admired the force, consciousness, and independence of Black movements in the U.S.,
wishing they could construct similar organizations in their own countries. Although they might at first
seem contradictory, these attitudes are rather reflections of the complex and subtle differences in the
systems of race relations that have developed historically in the Americas. Instead of wondering which
group of observers was more correct in its analysis of the other's country, we will in this seminar try to
see how each group was both right and wrong in its judgment and how the history of their home society
shaped their attitudes toward other countries. To do this, we will explore the historical roots of race rela-
tions and politics in Latin America from the beginnings of slavery through its abolition; the changing
constructions of indigenous ethnicities; and on to the emergence of new Black Movements and other
race-based political currents in Colombia, Brazil, and throughout the region.

HIST 452(S) Antebellum American Women's History (Same as Women's and Gender
Studies 452)*
Women have always been mothers, wives and daughters; and through much of their history in North
America, their relationship to the state has been mediated through men. However, they have always
been valuable producers. Their labor, be it in the household, as free wage laborers, farm hands, or slaves,
was important both to the development of the American market economy and to the ideology and rheto-
ric of nationhood. This seminar will explore the significance of the experiences of American women
from the colonial era through the Civil War. We will address the impact of slavery on all American
women, the role of women during intense urbanization and industrialization, and the ways in which lit-
eracy and artistic culture shaped the way American women portrayed their own lives. Throughout the
semester we will read primary documents. Our inquiry will encompass women in New England, the
South and the Hispanic Southwest. As we study works of history, we will also read twentieth century
feminist and race theory to understand connections between practice and theory, between narrative and
argument.
Format: seminar. Requirements include a research paper (20-25 pages) based on reading and analysis of
a set of primary sources, a literature review, class participation, and a reading journal.

itself and homefront conditions: military, naval, political, economic, and especially social aspects will be
examined in some detail. Our study of Reconstruction will concentrate on the evolution of federal policy
toward the Southern states and the workings out of that policy in the South, particularly as it relates to the

This course will explore the social, economic, and cultural lives of three cities, each of which at its zenith
seemed to contemporaries to represent definitive aspects of "American" development. We will begin
with Boston--the country's first "big" city and the nominal capital of Puritan New England--in the
colonial and early national periods. From there we will move to Chicago, the transportation and com-
mercial hub of the emerging national economy in the nineteenth century. Finally we will turn to Los
Angeles, "The City of Dreams" and the center of the popular entertainment industry in the twentieth
century. In each case, drawing on a variety of sources, we will examine the city's origins, the factors that
promoted its growth, and the distinctive society it engendered. Then we will consider some of the city's
cultural expressions--expressions that seem to characterize not only changing the nature of urban life,
but the particular meanings each city gave to the nation's experience at the time. What made these cities
seem simultaneously, as they did, so alluring and so threatening to the fabric of national community and
identity?

Between the early sixteenth and late eighteenth centuries, the ongoing encounters between peoples of

colonial protagonists constantly redefined themselves and "others." In this seminar, we will explore how
sexual encounters between colonizing and colonized populations in the various contexts of the Spanish,

­ 200 ­
French, British, and Dutch colonization of North America shaped the redefinition of colonial identities.
Based on our examination of contemporary representations of gender relations and sexuality found in
colonial legislation, court records, travel accounts, and missionary literature, we will attempt to untangle
the ways in which racial categories were being both constructed and negotiated in colonial North Ameri-
ca. Our analysis of primary documents will be informed by our close reading of some of the most recent
scholarship examining the intersection of sex and race during the early modern period.

Over half a century after Japan's surrender, the issue of how to remember the Pacific War continues to
raise controversy both within Japan and between Japan, Korea, and China. This tutorial will consider
how individuals, groups of individuals, and nations construct and reconstruct historical memories by
examining how various Japanese have sought to remember the Pacific War. The course will begin with a
discussion of theoretical writings on the social and political construction of historical memory and the
distinctions between official, collective, and historical memory. Then we will consider Japanese histori-
cal memory of the Pacific War, focusing on how the Occupation and the Tokyo war crimes trial shaped
how the war has been remembered. We will also deal with how the war has been portrayed in literature,
film and other media. Finally, the course will explore how Japan's unique position as both wartime ag-
gressor and victim has influenced its relationships within East Asia. We will examine the mnemonic
sites contested by Chinese, Korean, and Japanese memories by discussing issues pertaining to military
comfort women, the Nanking massacre, Unit 731, history textbooks, and Yasukuni shrine. Themes will
include how the construction of memory is linked to the nation, how the passage of time influences the
construction of historical memory, and the dilemmas of coming to terms with pasts contested both with-
in and between countries.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: students will meet with the instructor in pairs for an hour each week.
Each student will write and present orally a 5- to 7-page essay every other week on the readings assigned

HIST 487T(F) (formerly 374T) The Second World War: Origins, Course, Outcomes, and
Meaning (W)
1991 marked the fiftieth anniversaries of the Nazi invasion of Russia and the Japanese attack on Pearl
Harbor. Though war had come to Europe as early as 1939, when Germany invaded Poland, after 1941
the war became a truly global conflict of unprecedented extent, ferocity, and destructiveness. As late as
1943 it still appeared that the Axis powers might win the war. But, by the end of the 1945, the bombed-
out ruins of Germany and Japan were occupied by the Allies, who were preparing to put the surviving
Axis leaders and generals on trial for war crimes.
This tutorial will concentrate on a number of important questions and issues which arise from a study of
World War II. What were the origins of this central event of the twentieth century? How and why did the
war begin? Why did the war take the course it did? What were the most crucial or decisive episodes or
events? How did the Allies win? Why did the Axis lose? Could the outcome have been different?
Many of the topics examined will also have to deal with important questions of human responsibility
and with the moral or ethical dimensions of the war. Why did France, Britain, and the Soviet Union not
stop Hitler earlier? Who was to blame for the fall of France and the Pearl Harbor fiasco? Why did the
Allies adopt a policy of extensive firebombing of civilian targets? How could the Holocaust have hap-
pened? Could it have been stopped? Did the Atomic bomb have to be dropped? Were the war crime
trials justified?
By the end of the tutorial, students will have become thoroughly familiar with the general course the war
followed as well as acquiring in-depth knowledge of the most decisive and important aspects of the con-
flict. Students will also have grappled with the task of systematically assessing what combinations of
material and human factors can best explain the outcomes of the major turning points of the war. Stu-
dents will also have dealt with the problem of assessing the moral and ethical responsibility of those
persons, organizations, and institutions involved in the war.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: each student will write and present orally an essay of approximately
seven double-spaced pages every other week on a topic assigned by the instructor. Students not present-
ing an essay have the responsibility of critiquing the work of their colleague. The tutorial will culminate
in a final written exercise.

HISTORY OF SCIENCE
(Div. II & III, see course descriptions)
Chair, Professor DONALD deB. BEAVER
Professor: D. BEAVER**. Advisory Committee: Professors: D. BEAVER**, V. HILL**.
A major in the History of Science is not offered, but the occasional Contract Major in it or a related
interdisciplinary field is possible. Courses in the History of Science are designed primarily to comple-
ment and strengthen work in other major fields. Although any of the courses may be taken separately,
studying related courses in other departments will enhance their value, because by nature, History of
Science is interdisciplinary.
The following will serve as examples: the 101 course is an introduction to science and technology
studies, and concentrates on key aspects of contemporary science and technology relevant to many
issues of living in a technological society. Scientific Revolutions (HSCI 224) deals with the emergence
of modern science in the 1600s and 1700s, and with subsequent revolutions in scientific thought; as
such it complements courses related to modern European history. History of Science 240 traces the
influential role of science and invention in the shaping of American culture, and complements offer-
ings in American Studies and American History. HSCI 320, an historical overview of the ideas, prac-
tice, and organization of medicine, provides context for related coursework in History, Philosophy,
and the Premed Program.
HSCI 101(S) Science, Technology, and Human Values (Same as Science and Technology
Studies 101)
A study of the natures and roles of science and technology in today's society, and of the problems which
technical advances pose for human values. An introduction to science-technology studies. Topics in-
clude: scientific creativity, the Two Cultures, the norms and values of science, the Manhattan Project and
Big Science, the ethics and social responsibility of science, appropriate technology, technology assess-
ment, and various problems which spring from dependencies engendered by living in a technological
society, e.g., computers and privacy, automation and dehumanization, biomedical engineering.
Format: seminar. Requirements: two or three short exercises, two papers (3-5 pages and 5-10 pages),
and a final exam.
Enrollment limit: 25.
Satisfies one semester of the Division II requirement.
Hour: 10:00-10:50 MWF D. BEAVER
HSCI 224(S) Scientific Revolutions: 1543-1927 (Same as History 294)
How much does science create the sensibilities and values of the modern world? How much, if any,
technical detail is it necessary to know in order to understand the difference between propaganda and
fact?
This course investigates four major changes of world view, associated with Copernicus (1543); Newton
(1687); Darwin (1859); and Planck (1900) and Einstein (1905). It also treats briefly the emergence of
modern cosmogony, geology, and chemistry as additional reorganizations of belief about our origins,
our past, and our material structure.
We first acquire a basic familiarity with the scientific use and meaning of the new paradigms, as they
emerged in historical context. We then ask how those ideas fit together to form a new framework, and
ask what their trans-scientific legacy has been, that is, how they have affected ideas and values in other
sciences, other fields or thought, and in society. Knowledge of high-school algebra is presupposed.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on five problem sets, four short papers (3-5 pages),
and two hour exams.
Enrollment limit: 45. Open to first-year students.

INTR 107(F) Interpreting Human Experience (W)
How we make sense of the world, and of our lives, depends to a considerable degree on the intellectual
methodologies we apply to the task of interpretation. Freud, for instance, saw selfhood and perception as
fundamentally determined by the structures of the psyche itself; Marx, by contrast, argued that our sense
of reality is conditioned primarily by our material and social circumstances; more recently, historian of
science Thomas Kuhn has emphasized that the underlying assumptions which shape the very questions
we pose as thinkers significantly influence and limit what data, and thus what reality, we are most likely
to observe. This course aims to provide a foundational experience for the liberal arts education, by en-
gaging with key religious, political, literary, anthropological, philosophical and psychoanalytic texts
with a view to complicating our sense of the purposes and possibilities of intellectual life and confront-
ing the challenges of epistemology. Readings will include works by Plato, Rousseau, John Stuart Mill,
Marx, Kuhn, Chinua Achebe, Freud, E.M.Forster, Naguib Mahfouz and extracts from the Bible and the
Koran. In keeping with the aims of the FRS program, the course is intended to foster productive connec-
tions between what we discuss and debate in class and your broader experiences as students. The course
will invite and promote interdisciplinary connections between core ways of seeing and interpreting the
world, with a strong emphasis on improving your critical skills.
Format: seminar. Requirements: regular short writing assignments designed to hone your reading skills;
four papers ranging from 3-5 pages; participation in one or two tutorial sessions; and active contribution
to discussion.
Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). (The earlier section of this course is being offered as FRS 101.)

Who should have won the 2000 Presidential Election? Do any two senators really have equal power in
passing legislation? How can marital assets be divided fairly? While these questions are of interest to
many social scientists, a mathematical perspective can offer a quantitative analysis of issues like these
and more. In this course, we will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of various types of voting
systems and show that, in fact, any such system is flawed. We will also examine a quantitative definition
of power and the principles behind fair division. Along the way, we will enhance the critical reasoning
skills necessary to tackle any type of problem mathematical or otherwise.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based primarily on projects, homework assignments, and
exams.

This course examines African music from an interdisciplinary perspective that may include musical,
historical, religious, sociological, dance, or psychological studies. It also integrates music (or dance) per-
formance with academic study. The goals of the course are to understand music within an African cul-
tural context, to examine the synergy between African music and other art forms, and to integrate aca-
demic study with music or dance performance. Themes and geographical focus may change from year
to year, and the course may be taken more than once. In 2004-05 we will explore a case study, the inter-
relationship of religion, music, and dance in Zimbabwe. Students will meet for class discussions during
usual class hours as well as participating in separate labs/rehearsals and a concert with the Zambezi Ma-
rimba Band. Students will have the opportunity to sing, play mbira dza vadzimu (the mbira of the ances-
tor spirits), marimba, and hosho (rattle) with guest artists who are masters of Zimbabwean music.
Evaluation will be based on papers, participation, and the improvement of performance skills. No ex-
ams.
Prerequisites: This course is open to all students with an intermediate level of skill in music or dance.
Labs: Tuesdays and Thursdays 4-6:30 PM; additional rehearsals to be arranged.

INTERNATIONAL STUDIES
Chair, Professor WILLIAM R. DARROW
Steering Committee: Professors: DARROW, C. KUBLER, K. LEE, MAHON, MONTIEL. Associate
Professors: CASSIDAY*, M. LYNCH, MUTONGI*.
In this era of cultural, technological and economic globalization and also of pressing international
crises including environmental degradation, poverty and underdevelopment, terrorism and pandem-
ics, knowledge of the world beyond the United States is an essential part of the liberal education that is
the goal of the Williams experience. Both within and outside the classroom the College provides a rich
array of opportunities to pursue that goal. The International Studies Program is designed to increase
awareness of those opportunities and to provide a centralizing mechanism to encourage gaining such
knowledge with perspectives that are cross disciplinary and comparative.
The program administers a number of tracks that provide students with the opportunity to pursue
study of one area of the world or theme as a way of complementing the work they have done in their
majors. Students will be expected to take courses in at least two departments to fulfill the requirements
of a track. In addition to completing International Studies 101, they will be expected to do five courses
in a track and an approved senior exercise. Students may not count a course toward more than one
track in the program. They may pursue two tracks but will need to meet the course requirements for
each track with a full complement of courses.
TRACKS
Tracks are of two kinds. The first type focuses either on a particular region of the world or a contact
zone where several cultural traditions encounter each other. The second type is organized thematically
and will explore a cultural, political, economic or technological issue globally. Each track will be
administered by faculty teaching in that track in consultation with the steering committee. Each track
may set an additional requirement of a level of language competency for its concentrators. Each track
may also require one of the elective courses to be comparative, i.e. course that might not cover materi-
al directly dealing with their area, but would enrich the student's experience with tools for compara-
tive inquiry. At present the program consists of the following tracks:
Area Tracks Thematic Tracks
African Studies Economic Development Studies
East Asian Studies
Latin American Studies
Middle Eastern Studies
Russian and Eurasian Studies
To complete a track, students must take a section of International Studies 101, complete five addi-
tional approved courses within the track, attend the weekly International Studies colloquium and
complete a senior exercise. Credit for work done on study abroad will likely provide one or more of
the electives for many concentrators.
International Studies 101
All students wishing to pursue the program should take a section of International Studies 101 early
in their careers. These courses will always be team taught. The topics and regions covered will of
International Studies
­ 206 ­
course vary and be selective, but all will be designed to place cultural, political, economic and techno-
logical issues in conversation with one another to illustrate the necessity of having a broad range of
disciplinary tools available to pursue an individual track.
Study Abroad and Internships
Study abroad and/or overseas internships are an essential component of International Studies. The
program in coordination with the Study Abroad Advisor and the Office of Career Counseling will
advise students on opportunities in these areas. One or more courses completed on an approved study
abroad program can be counted toward the five elective courses requirement.
Colloquium
Concentrators will be expected to attend fifteen sessions of the International Studies colloquia in
their senior year, and are urged to do so throughout their careers at Williams. We hope that it will be-
come a regular event for all concentrators. The colloquium meets weekly at the Center for Develop-
ment Economics and is designed to feature faculty, students, CDE fellows and outside speakers ad-
dressing issues of wide interest to those in International Studies.
Senior Exercise
All concentrators must also complete a senior exercise. This will be a substantial piece of writing
(20-25 pages) that would allow a student to draw together both their disciplinary skills and expertise in
a particular area. It might be work done either in the context of a senior capstone course in a relevant
department or in the context of a shared seminar sponsored by the International Studies program. In
both cases it would culminate in a public presentation by each concentrator of his/her work in class or
in the context of the International Studies Colloquium.
Honors
A candidate for honors in International Studies must maintain at least a B+ average in the con-
centration and be admitted to candidacy by the program faculty. An honors candidate must complete
her/his project in a semester (and Winter Study). An honors candidate will prepare a forty page thesis
or its equivalent while enrolled in the senior thesis course, 491 or 492 (and Winter Study). This course
will be in addition to the courses required to fulfill the concentration.
A student wishing to become a candidate for honors in International Studies should secure a faculty
sponsor and inform the program chair in writing before spring registration of her/his junior year.
INST 101(S) Order, Disorder and Political Culture in the Islamic World (Same as INTR 295
and Political Science 241)*
Southwest Asia, the swath of territory that extends west and south from the Chinese border to east Africa
is not usually treated as a single entity, though it is united together by two important features: culturally it
was the heart of Islamic civilization and Islam continues to provide a common identity to the area in the
face of remarkable ethnic and historical differences; geologically it is the site of the preponderance of the
earth's oil and natural gas reserves. This course will bring to bear some of the theories of comparative
politics and international relations to better understand the region. Naturally terrorism and the obses-
sions with the war on terrorism will be important themes in the course, but we will attempt to both con-
textualize and judge the significance of those phenomena with a deeper investigation of the relation be-
tween Islam and violence, Islamic political theory and the tendency towards authoritarianism, the politi-
cal economy of the region and the character of the processes of modernization and globalization. Special
emphasis will be given to the transitions from authoritarianism and the prospects for democratization in
the region in comparative conversations with developments in Eastern Europe and Latin America in the
last two decades.
Format: discussion/lecture. Requirements: one midterm paper (4-6 pages) based on class materials and a
final research paper (12-15 pages).
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 40 (expected: 20-30.) Preference given to first-year students and
sophomores. Satisfies one semester of Division II requirement.

to explore issues in the field of International Studies. This will be followed by four weeks of individual
research developed in consultation with appropriate faculty followed in the last four weeks by the pre-
sentation of that research.

THE PROGRAM IN JEWISH STUDIES
Jewish Studies describes the academic field concerned with the experience and culture of the Jew-
ish people. Covering a wide temporal and geographical range, Jewish Studies embraces both the wa-
ters of Babylon and the tenements of the Lower East Side. The subject cuts across numerous fields
including Ancient Near Eastern Studies, Religion, Classics, History, Anthropology, Sociology, Art
History, English, Middle Eastern Studies, Hebrew, Women's and Gender Studies, American Studies,
Comparative Literature, Romance Languages and Literature, German and Russian Studies, and Polit-
ical Science. Jewish Studies as a subject and object of scholarly inquiry is more than 100 years old,
emerging, as did the study of religion in general, in the context of nineteenth century efforts to make
religious texts open to scientific and especially historical forms of investigation.
Williams offers a variety of courses specifically directed to students interested in Jewish Studies. In
addition, many other courses incorporate topics relevant to the study of Judaism. Students are encour-
aged to integrate courses from diverse disciplines with a focus in Jewish history, religion, literature,
language, and thought. Thus, rather than emphasizing a particular method of inquiry, Jewish Studies
courses bring together students from different departments who share an interest in a common topic.
As a result, Jewish subjects are analyzed from a multitude of perspectives (religious, philosophical,
political, historical, psychological, literary, etc.). Williams offers two types of courses related to Jew-
ish Studies: Courses directly focusing on Jewish topics and courses partially devoted to some aspect
of Judaism. Most courses in Jewish Studies are open to all students without prerequisites. The specific
catalogue entry for each course should be checked for details. The concentration in Jewish Studies is
recommended for students interested in a sustained intellectual experience in the field.
CONCENTRATION IN JEWISH STUDIES
The concentration in Jewish Studies serves two primary functions. First, it provides a formal struc-
ture enabling students to develop knowledge of the history, thought, texts, and practices of the Jewish
people. Second, students will learn to apply this competency to the analysis of issues related to Jewish
Studies emerging from disciplinary perspectives. Through the Jewish Studies concentration, students
will be able to examine topics according to the methods particular to majors as well as in comparison
with other disciplinary approaches. Thus, Jewish Studies enhances one's specific knowledge of Ju-
daica and the general capacity to think interdisciplinarily.
Students wishing to concentrate in Jewish Studies must take 5 courses with at least 2 different pre-
fixes: 1 core course, 2 required courses, 1 elective, and 1 capstone course.

Required Courses
Students must take two required courses, one from Group I and one from Group II. There will be
offerings from the visiting Croghan Professor and other visiting professors. These may fulfill the core
requirements with approval from the Jewish Studies Advisory Committee. Only one Winter Study
course may be used to satisfy this requirement.

Elective
Students may meet the elective requirement with one of the courses partially related to Jewish Stud-
ies or another course from Group I or II. Since the elective requirement enables students to situate
issues in Jewish Studies within a broader disciplinary context, the elective must be taken after REL/
CLAS 203 and simultaneously with or after at least one core course. In a course partially related to
Jewish Studies, a student will normally focus at least one of the major writing assignments on a topic
relevant to Jewish Studies or approximately one-third of the course will be devoted to Jewish subjects.
The list of relevant electives changes constantly so the course catalogue should be checked for details.
Listed below are examples of courses partially related to Jewish Studies. Students may meet the elec-

Croghan Professorship
Each year, in addition to the regular course offerings listed above, Williams sponsors the Croghan
Bicentennial Visiting Professor in Religion who offers one course in Judaism and/or Christianity. Past
Croghan Professors have taught courses on the Mishnah (Shaye Cohen), the historical Jesus (John
Dominic Crossan), and Ancient Mediterranean Religions (Ross Kraemer).
Overseas Studies
Studying in Israel is highly recommended for students interested in Jewish Studies. Many students
have spent a semester or year at Hebrew University. With the approval of the Jewish Studies coordina-
tor, students may count a study-abroad program towards one core requirement.
Funding
The Bronfman Fund for Judaic Studies was established in 1980 by Edgar M. Bronfman `50, Samu-
el Bronfman II `75, and Matthew Bronfman `80. The Bronfman Fund provides opportunities for the
Williams community to learn about Jewish history and culture, both within the College's formal cur-
riculum and through the planning of major events on Jewish themes.
The Morris Wiener and Stephen R. Wiener `56 Fund for Jewish Studies was established in 1997
through the estate of Stephen R. Wiener `56. The Wiener gifts have provided an endowment to sup-
port a faculty position in modern Jewish thought, and are used to underwrite an annual lecture, forum
or event relevant to contemporary Jewish life.
JWST 101(S) Introduction to Judaism (Same as Religion 203) (W)
A proselyte once asked both Rabbi Shammai and Rabbi Hillel to explain Judaism while standing on one
foot. Shammai drove the person off with a stick while Hillel gently reduced Judaism to one principle.
The difficulty of defining such a complex religious system explains Shammai's anger and renders Hil-
lel's over-simplification suspect. This course seeks to provide a more sure-footed understanding of the
Jewish religion. While recognizing the value of an essentialist approach, the course also conveys the
multifaceted, indefinable character of Judaism. Therefore we will examine Judaism from four different
yet complementary aspects: history, theology, text, and ritual. The examination of Jewish ritual and
practice will especially help to integrate our understanding of Jewish history, theology, and text just as
Jewish ritual itself incorporates these elements into Jewish life.
Format: lecture/discussion, and students will be required to engage in "fieldwork" involving the ob-
servation of a communal as well as a home ritual.
Evaluation will be based on four 3-page papers, a 6- to 8-page final paper, a 2-page write-up of the field-
work, and 2 major quizzes.
Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 16).
Hour: 11:00-12:15 MW LEVITT
JWST 491(F) Jewish Studies Interdisciplinary Seminar
Open to students who have completed (or are completing) the four required courses for the Jewish Stud-
ies concentration, this course enables students to integrate their background in Jewish Studies with the
disciplinarity normally associated with a departmental major. Team-taught by members of the JWST
advisory committee, the course consists of three parts. 1) Introductory sessions on methodological is-
sues in Jewish Studies. 2) 4-6 week period of individual meeting with faculty member while working on
a 15- to 20-page research project. 3) Final month devoted to seminar style presentation and discussion of
papers. Students participating in the seminar must sign up for an approved independent study. A student
writing a thesis relevant to Jewish Studies for a departmental major may petition the chair of Jewish
Studies to allow the thesis to meet the capstone requirement in place of JWST 491.
Evaluation will be based on participation in discussions and final paper and presentation.
Prerequisites: fulfillment of requirements of Jewish Studies concentration.No enrollment limit, however,
chair of Jewish Studies must approve participation in the course (expected: 8).

LATINA/O STUDIES (Div. II)
Co-chairs, ROGER KITTLESON and CARMEN WHALEN*
Advisory Committee: Associate Professors: KITTLESON, WHALEN. Assistant Professors: CHA-
VOYA, JOTTAR, RÚA
Latina/o Studies is an interdisciplinary and comparative field of study that explores the histories
and experiences of Latinas and Latinos in the United States. Latinas and Latinos include peoples who
come from or whose ancestors come from Latin America and the Spanish-speaking Caribbean. The
program seeks to cover the widest range of experiences, encompassing Mexican-Americans, Puerto
Ricans, Cubans, and Dominicans, as well as more recent migrations from a wide variety of Central
and South American countries. Courses, most of which use a comparative approach, seek to provide
students with the tools to continue their work in areas of their particular interest. Focusing on a diverse
group with a long history in the United States, which is also one of the fastest growing populations in
the contemporary era, provides an opportunity to explore complex dynamics globally and within the
context of the United States. The program examines topics such as the political and economic causes
of migration, the impact of globalization, economic incorporation, racialization, the formation and
reformulations of identities and communities, the uses of urban spaces, inter-ethnic relations, artistic
expression, aesthetics, and visual and popular culture.
THE CONCENTRATION
The concentration in Latina/o Studies requires five courses. Students are required to take the
introductory course (LATS 105), one 400-level Latina/o Studies seminar, and three electives. Two
electives must be core electives, and one elective can be a related course in Comparative Ethnic Stud-
ies or in Countries of Origin and Transnationalism. The three electives must include two different dis-
ciplines, and at least one elective must be at the 300 or 400 level. Additional courses may be approved
by the Chair. Students, especially those considering graduate work or professional careers in the field,
are encouraged to enroll in Spanish language courses at Williams.

LATS 105(F) Latina/o Identities: Constructions, Contestations, and Expressions (Same as
INTR 105)*
What, or who, is a Hispanic or Latina/o? This course examines this question by exploring the diversity of
the populations referred to by these terms, as well as the complex nature of "identity." Viewing identities
as historically and socially constructed, we begin with a brief assessment of how racial, ethnic, class, and
gendered identities take shape in the Hispanic Caribbean and Latin America. We then examine the im-
pact of migration and the rearticulation of identities in the United States. Identity is also a contested ter-
rain. As immigrants and migrants arrive, United States' policymakers, the media, and others seek to
define the "newcomers" along with long-term Latina/o citizens. At the same time, Latinas/os rearticu-
late, live, assert, and express their own sense of identities. We conclude the course with an exploration of
those many and diverse expressions.
Format: discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, several short writing assignments
(1-2 pages), and three short papers (5-7 pages).
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit : 25. Preference given to senior Latina/o Studies concentrators and
then first-year students and sophomores.

LATS 203(F) Chicana/o Film and Video (Same as ArtH 203)*
Hollywood cinema has long been fascinated with the border between the United States and Mexico.
This course will examine representations of the U.S.-Mexico border, Mexican Americans, and Chicana/
os in both Hollywood film and independent media. We will consider how positions on nationalism, race,
gender, identity, migration, and history are represented and negotiated through film. We will begin by
analyzing Hollywood "border" and gang films before approaching Chicana/o-produced features, inde-
pendent narratives, and experimental work. This course will explore issues of film and ideology, genre
and representation, nationalist resistance and feminist critiques, queer theory and the performative as-
pects of identity. Film screenings will be scheduled as a lab.
Evaluation will be based on one short paper, mid-term exam, final exam and take home essays.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 30 (expected: 20).

LATS 310(S) Latino Cityscapes: Mapping Place, Community, and Latinidad in U.S. Urban
Centers (Same as American Studies 310)*
This interdisciplinary course examines the emergence of Latino cities in the U.S. We begin by exploring
urban centers that came to be identified with certain Latino groups-Puerto Ricans in New York, Mexi-
cans in Los Angeles, and Cubans in Miami. We then turn to other Latino cities that have been historically
overlooked given the popular and scholarly attention placed on New York, Los Angeles, and Miami. We
will analyze the diverse histories of migration and settlement, inter-ethnic and inter-racial relations,
community building and identity formation, and the racialization of urban spaces. Finally, we will con-
sider the situatedness of latinidad in these urban environments, contemplating how Latinos are shaped
by and in turn shape the experience of the city in the US.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class participation, field research, two short essays, and a
final paper.

students who have taken Latino/a Studies courses.

LATS 331(F) Sound and Movement in the Diaspora: Afro-Latin Identities (Same as American
Studies 331, Theatre 331 and Women's and Gender Studies 331)*
This course focuses on in the production of music and dance in the Afro-Latino Diaspora. Afro-Latino
identities are manifested through various forms of expressive culture. We will explore the notions of
transculturation and mestizaje as theoretical tools to understand the production of race as representation-
al discourse, particularly through music and dance practices. We will pay particular attention to the inter-
Latina/o Studies
­ 214 ­
sections of class, race, gender and sexuality. Our focus will be on Cuba, Brazil, and Puerto Rico, as well
as on the U.S. based Diaspora.

This course explores Latino/a theatre and performance from the 1960's to the present. We will study
Latino/a theatre and performance in its broadest U.S. articulations, from mainstream Broadway produc-
tions to grass roots community carpas, from oppositional site-specific interventions to disembodied per-
formance in cyber space. We will pay particular attention to the intrinsic connections between social
movements and popular culture in the articulation of a counter-hegemonic Latino/a imaginary. What is
the relationship between migration, memory, Aztlan, border culture, the "Spirit Republic of Puerto
Rico," and exilic and diasporic subjectivities?
Format: seminar. Requirements: class participation and two presentations, one short essay (5-7 pages)
and two longer essays (7-10 pages).

LATS 405(F) Home and Belonging: Comparative Explorations of Displacements, Relocations,
and Place-making (Same as American Studies 405) (W)*
The metaphor of "home" and idea of "belonging" bring insight to theories and investigations centered
on community building and identity formation within and across national borders. These constructions
give us an indication of what people value, what is worth fighting for, as well as what is considered
expendable. Our objective in this course is to interrogate constructions of home and belonging by study-
ing how individuals, communities, and nations are transformed by experiences of dislocation, migra-
tion, and renewed place-making. What are the ways a sense of belonging shapes these identities and the
investments made in these formations? Working with ethnography, history, memoir, literature, critical
essays, and documentary film, we will consider the personal and political uses and meanings of
memory, nostalgia, and imagination in "rooting" migrating subjects in place and time. Among the many
case studies we will examine are the politics of homeland among Cuban-Americans, Native American
and West Indian festive forms, and place-claiming and performativity among African Americans.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class participation, class presentations, research proposal,
and a final research paper.
Prerequisites: Prior work in American Studies, Latino Studies, or permission of instructor. Enrollment

LEADERSHIP STUDIES (Div. II)
Chair, Associate Professor JAMES MCALLISTER
Advisory Committee: Professors: ART, BUCKY, DUNN, GOETHALS, HOPPIN**, JACKALL*,
K. LEE, MACDONALD, MAHON, PASACHOFF. Associate Professor: MCALLISTER. Assis-
tant Professor: MELLOW. Lecturer: ENGEL. Visiting Professor: CHANDLER.
Leadership Studies focuses on the universal phenomenon of leadership in human groups. Leader-
ship Studies asks what leadership means within a wide variety of social contexts-whether in a family,
a team, a theatre company, a philanthropy, a university, a multinational corporation, or a nation state
waging war. It seeks to understand the dynamics of the relationships between leaders and followers. It
studies authority, power, and influence. It seeks to grasp the bases of legitimacy that leaders claim, and
followers grant, in all of these relationships.
Through a wide range of courses in the social sciences and the humanities, a number of questions
are addressed through the curriculum. How have men and women defined leadership and what are the
bases of leaders' legitimacy in different historical contexts? How do leaders in different contexts
emerge? Through tradition, charisma, or legal sanction? How do different types of leaders exercise
and maintain their domination? What are the distinctive habits of mind of leaders in different histori-
cal contexts? What are the moral dilemmas that leaders in different contexts face? What are the typical
challenges to established leadership in different historical contexts? How does one analyze the experi-
ences of leaders in widely disparate contexts to generate systematic comparative understandings of
why history judges some leaders great and others failures. How and why do these evaluations about
the efficacy of leaders shift over time?
To meet the requirements of the concentration, students must complete the sequence outlined be-
low (6 courses total). Students must take their two core courses from different departments. At least
one of the core courses must be at the 300 or 400 level.

LEAD 125(S) Power, Leadership and Legitimacy: An Introduction to Leadership Studies
(Same as Political Science 125)
Leadership has long been a central concept in the study of politics. Philosophers from Plato to Machiavelli
have struggled with the question of what qualities and methods are necessary for effective leadership. So-
cial scientists throughout the twentieth century have struggled to refine and advance hypotheses about
leadership in the areas of economics, psychology, and sociology. Nevertheless, despite all of this impres-
sive intellectual effort, the study of leadership remains a contested field of study precisely because univer-
sal answers to the major questions in leadership studies have proven to be elusive. This course is designed
to introduce students to many of the central issues and debates in the area of leadership studies.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: a midterm and final exam and 2 short papers.

these presidents developed as leaders before as well as after their election to the presidency. How did
they determine their goals, assemble their leadership teams, and mobilize followers? What challenges
did they face and what principles guided them? What failures did they meet and why? Can we relate
these historical examples to the American presidency today? Readings will include correspondence,

LEAD 295(S) Leadership and Management
What are the differences between effective leaders and effective managers of complex organizations, or
are they one and the same? If different, what are the key elements making each successful, and are there
any critical dynamics or interdependencies between these elements? Finally, are there important distinc-
tions between the factors required for success by leaders/managers in different domains, in different cul-
tures, or of different genders? In this course, we will wrestle with these questions by examining both
successful and unsuccessful leadership and management of complex organizations in a number of do-
mains, potentially including business, non-profit, higher education, government agencies, and others.
Our primary means of doing so will be through case studies, supplemented by reading Ronald Heifetz,
Peter Drucker, Warren Bennis, and several noted leadership and management thinkers.
Format: seminar. Course requirements will include active class participation, several brief (1 page or
less) response papers, a short mid-term paper, and a longer final paper, which develops and analyzes a
case of the student's choice. This latter paper can be done individually or in groups of two.

LEGAL STUDIES (Div. II)
Chair, Professor LAWRENCE KAPLAN
Advisory Committee: Professors: JACKALL*, JUST, KAPLAN, KASSIN**. Associate Professor:
NOLAN*. Assistant Professor: MARUKO. Visiting Assistant Professor: A. HIRSCH.
Legal Studies is an interdisciplinary program designed to give students a background and frame-
works for understanding the law as a means of regulating human behavior and resolving disputes
among individuals, groups, and governments. Emanating from a liberal arts tradition, and not specifi-
cally aimed at preparing students for law school, this program provides the tools needed to think and
argue critically about how laws work, how they evolved in the course of history and in different parts
of the world, how they are enforced, and how they affect our everyday lives.
The courses in this program address a wide range of subjects, including the philosophical, moral,
historical, social, and political underpinnings of law; the U.S. Constitution; law enforcement and oth-
er aspects of criminal justice; methods of scientific proof; psychological influences on evidence,
trials, and decision-making; cultural perspectives and non-western legal traditions; and the use of law
to regulate environmental policy. Courses are taught by faculty in the Sciences, Social Sciences, and
Humanities, whose work centers on legal processes, and by visiting professors from various law
schools.
THE CONCENTRATION
The concentration in legal studies consists of six courses, including an interdisciplinary introducto-
ry course, four electives taken from at least two departments, and a senior seminar on a contemporary
topic in the law. Electives may vary from year to year according to course offerings. In addition, the
program offers local, alumni, and professional contacts for summer and WSP internships in a wide
range of government and private law-related settings.
REQUIRED COURSES
LGST 101(S) Processes of Adjudication
How are disputes resolved within social systems? Focused on this question, this interdisciplinary course
presents different perspectives on trials and other methods of adjudicating crimes, settling matters of
public policy, and resolving civil disputes among individuals, groups, governments, and organizations.
Topics to be addressed include the historical and Constitutional bases for juries and jury trials; alterna-
tive means of adjudication, as seen in American drug courts and military tribunals; adversarial, inquisi-
torial, and consensus-building approaches to dispute resolution used in past and non-western cultures;
methods of gathering and evaluating evidence; the role of forensic sciences and technology.
Format:lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on two exams, a 10- to 15-page paper, and class
participation.
Enrollment limit: 50.
This is an interdisciplinary course to be team-taught by faculty, from a variety of departments.

Open only to upperclass students under the supervision of a member of the Legal Studies Advisory
Committee.
LGST 401(S) Punishment and Crime: The Role of Criminal Law in the American Polity and
Legal System
This seminar examines theories that seek to justify criminal punishment and analyzes those theories in a
series of case studies. We explore retributive theory (punishment because it is "deserved"), utilitarian
theory (punishment because of the consequences it will produce), and expressive theory (punishment
that expresses social values). We then consider specific case studies pertaining to the death penalty, hate
crimes, and the law of self defense. Each case study provides an opportunity to consider a number of
important and broad-ranging issues. As to the death penalty, we consider such issues as the overall
morality of capital punishment, its racial implications, and the concerns that arise from the administra-
tion of a system that imposes a penalty of death. As to hate crimes, we consider the cases for and against
enhanced punishment of bias-motivated violence, the constitutional questions of punishment that is
based in part on a defendant's motivation, and the group characteristics that should be included in a hate
crime law. As to self defense, we consider the moral arguments that underlie this defense, gender-related
issues such as the battered woman syndrome defense, and race-related issues such as those raised by the
celebrated Bernhard Goetz case. Our goal is to understand the ways in which criminal law enforcement
offers a window into the self-perception of our society or its values.

LINGUISTICS (Div. I)
Coordinator, Assistant Professor: NATHAN SANDERS
Courses in linguistics enable students to explore language from a variety of perspectives: the inter-
nal workings of language as a system of communication, the physical means by which speech is pro-
duced, the role of language in society, the history of language groups and specific languages, and the
applicability of scientific knowledge about language to various human endeavors.
Linguistics offers neither a major nor a concentration, but its courses provide a solid grounding in
formal linguistics and complement study in several other disciplines: Anthropology, Philosophy,
Computer Science, Psychology, Cognitive Science, Sociology, English, Comparative Literature, and
all the foreign languages. Anthropology majors can receive major credit for Linguistics 101. Majors
in German Studies may receive major credit for a linguistics course with the special permission of the
department chair.
Knowledge of foreign languages is helpful but not required for introductory linguistics courses.
LING 101(F) Introduction to Linguistics (Same as Anthropology 107)
This course is a general introduction to the scientific study of language, particularly its theoretical de-
bates, methodology, and relationship to other disciplines. With this aim in mind, we will examine the
analytic methods and major findings of various subfields of linguistics, including phonetics, phonology,
morphology, syntax, semantics, and language change. Additional topics may include dialects, American
Sign Language, the acquisition of language, and the official English language movement. By the end of
the course, you should be acquainted with systematic methods of studying language, be aware of the
fundamental similarities and startling diversity of human languages, and have an informed perspective
on how issues of language have an impact on our society.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: participation in discussions, weekly homework, a midterm
exam, and a final exam.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 40 (expected: 40).
Hour: 1:10-2:25 MR SANDERS
LING 111(S) Articulatory and Acoustic Phonetics (Q)
Phonetics is the study of human speech sounds. This course emphasizes the International Phonetic Al-
phabet, a standardized system of transcribing speech. Students learn to recognize, describe, transcribe,
and produce speech sounds from languages all over the world. This course also covers phonetic analysis
of speech, including patterns of sounds within and across languages, the acoustic properties of the
speech signal, and how and why the mouth moves the way it does when we speak.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: participation in discussions, weekly homework, occasional
quizzes, a midterm exam, and a final project.
No prerequisites. No enrollment limit (expected: 20).

LING 211(F) Phonology
Phonology is the study of patterns of sounds within and across languages. The course begins with an
analysis of the internal structure of sounds, leading to the development of a formalism for representing
sounds. From there, we will develop formal rules to explain various types of systematic regularity in
languages. As we explore the nature of these rules, what they must look like and how they interact with
each other, we will revise the formalisms developed in class. Topics to be covered include distinctive
feature theory, rule ordering, opacity, morphology, autosegmental phonology, and current trends in pho-
nological theory.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: participation in discussions, weekly homework, a midterm
exam, and a final exam.
Prerequisites: Linguistics 101 or Linguistics 111. No enrollment limit (expected: 10).

include a review of basic phonetics and phonology, regularity of sound change, analogy, the compara-
tive method, linguistic reconstruction, linguistic family classification, and syntactic and semantic
change.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: participation in discussions, weekly homework, a midterm

HONORS PROGRAM IN MARITIME STUDIES
Candidates for honors in Maritime Studies will complete a thesis in their senior year. The project
will involve original research (archive, museum, field, or laboratory) followed by on-campus analysis
and writeup of results. This could be either a one-semester project, or a full year (two semesters plus
winter study). In either case, data collection during the summer before the senior year may be neces-
sary. In some cases, the thesis project may be a continuation and expansion of the student's Williams-
Mystic research project. Honors will be awarded if the thesis shows a high degree of scholarship, orig-
inality, and intellectual insight.

MAJOR
The major in Mathematics is designed to meet two goals: to introduce some of the central ideas in a
variety of areas of mathematics and statistics, and to develop problem-solving ability by teaching stu-
dents to combine creative thinking with rigorous reasoning.
Students are urged to consult with the department faculty on choosing courses appropriate to an
individualized program of study.
REQUIREMENTS (nine courses plus colloquium)
Calculus (two courses)
Mathematics 104 Calculus II
Mathematics 105 or 106 Multivariable Calculus
Except in unusual circumstances, students planning to major in mathematics should complete
the calculus sequence (Mathematics 103, 104, 105/106) before the end of the sophomore
year, at the latest.
Applied/Discrete Mathematics/Statistics (one course)
Mathematics 209 Differential Equations and Vector Calculus or
Mathematics 210 Mathematical Methods for Scientists (Same as Physics 210)
Mathematics 251 Discrete Mathematics or
Statistics 201 Statistics and Data Analysis or

a more advanced elective in discrete or applied mathematics or statistics, with prior departmental ap-
proval: Mathematics 305, 306, 315, 361, 375, 433, 452, or any Statistics course 300 or above or an
appropriate course from another department as listed in the notes below.
Notes: Mathematics 251 is required in Computer Science, and Mathematics 209 is recommended in
other sciences, but double majors should understand that no course may count toward both majors.
Core Courses (three courses)
Mathematics 211 Linear Algebra
Mathematics 301 Real Analysis or Mathematics 305 Applied Real Analysis
Mathematics 312 Abstract Algebra or Mathematics 315 Groups and Characters
Completion (three courses plus colloquium)
The Senior Major Course is any 400-level course taken in the senior year. In exceptional circumstances,
with the prior permission of the department, a student may be allowed to satisfy the Senior Major Course
requirement in the junior year, provided that the student has completed three 300-level mathematics
courses before enrolling in the Senior Major Course (if it is a statistics seminar, one of the 300-level courses
may be replaced by Statistics 231).
Two electives from courses numbered 300 and above or Statistics 231.
Weekly participation as a senior in the Mathematics Colloquium, in which all senior majors present
talks on mathematical or statistical topics of their choice.
Mathematics and Statistics
­ 223 ­
NOTES
In some cases, an appropriate course from another department may be substituted for one of the
electives, with prior permission of the Mathematics and Statistics Department. In any case, at least
eight courses must be taken in mathematics and statistics at Williams. These can, with prior permis-
sion, include courses taken away. Students with transfer credit should contact the department about
special arrangements.
APPLIED MATHEMATICS OR OTHER SCIENCES
Students interested in applied mathematics or other sciences, including economics, should consid-
er Mathematics 209, 210, 251, 305, 306, 315, 323, 342, 354, 361, 433, or Statistics 201, 231, 346, 442,
and additional appropriate courses from outside Mathematics and Statistics, including possibilities
such as Chemistry 301, Computer Science 256, Computer Science 361, Economics 255, Physics 201,
Physics 202, Physics 210 or more advanced physics courses.
BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Students interested in careers in business or finance should consider Mathematics 170, as well as
courses in statistics and related areas such as Statistics 101, 201, 231, 331, 344, 346, 442, 443. Since
these courses address different needs, students should consult with the instructors to determine which
seem to be most appropriate for individuals.
ENGINEERING
Students interested in engineering should consider the courses for applied mathematics immediate-
ly above, with Mathematics 209 and 305 especially recommended. Williams has exchange and joint
programs with good engineering schools. Interested students should consult the section on engineer-
ing near the beginning of the Bulletin and the Williams pre-engineering advisor for further informa-
tion.
GRADUATE SCHOOL IN MATHEMATICS
Students interested in continuing their study of mathematics in graduate school should take Mathe-
matics 301 and 312. Mathematics 302 and 324 are strongly recommended. Many of the 400-level
courses would be useful, particularly ones that involve algebra and analysis. Honors theses are en-
couraged. Reading knowledge of a foreign language (French, German, or Russian) is helpful.
STATISTICS AND ACTUARIAL SCIENCE
Students interested in statistics or actuarial science should consider Mathematics 341, Statistics
201, 231, 331, 346, 442 and Economics 255. Additionally, students should consider taking some
number of the actuarial exams given by the Society of Actuaries, which can constitute part of an hon-
ors program in actuarial studies (see section on honors below).
TEACHING
Students interested in teaching mathematics at the elementary or secondary school level should
consider Mathematics 285, 313, 325, 381, Statistics 201 and practice as a tutor or teaching assistant.
Winter study courses that provide a teaching practicum are also highly recommended.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN MATHEMATICS/STATISTICS
The degree with honors in Mathematics/Statistics is awarded to the student who has demonstrated
outstanding intellectual achievement in a program of study which extends beyond the requirements of
the major. The principal considerations for recommending a student for the degree with honors will
be: Mastery of core material and skills, breadth and, particularly, depth of knowledge beyond the core
material, ability to pursue independent study of mathematics or statistics, originality in methods of
investigation, and, where appropriate, creativity in research.
An honors program normally consists of two semesters and a WSP (031) of independent research,
culminating in a thesis and a presentation. Under certain circumstances, the honors work can consist
of coordinated study involving a regular course and one semester plus a WSP (030) of independent
study, culminating in a "minithesis" and a presentation. At least one semester should be in addition to
the major requirements.
An honors program in actuarial studies requires significant achievement on four appropriate ex-
aminations of the Society of Actuaries and giving a second colloquium talk. Written work is a possible
component.
Highest honors will be reserved for the rare student who has displayed exceptional ability, achieve-
ment or originality. Such a student usually will have written a thesis, or pursued actuarial honors and
written a minithesis. An outstanding student who writes a minithesis, or pursues actuarial honors and
writes a paper, might also be considered.
Prospective honors students are urged to consult with their departmental advisor at the time of reg-
istration in the spring of the sophomore or at the beginning of the junior year to arrange a program of
study that could lead to the degree with honors. By the time of registration during spring of the junior
year, the student must have requested a faculty member to be honors advisor and must have obtained
the department's approval of formal admission to the honors program. Such approval depends on both
the record and the promise of the applicant. It is conditional on continuing progress.
Mathematics and Statistics
­ 224 ­
The recommendation for honors is usually announced at the end of the spring term. Participation in
the honors program does not guarantee a recommendation for honors. The decision is based not only
on successful completion of the honors program but also on the merit of the student's overall record in
mathematics. If the student completes the program during the fall or winter study, the decision may be
announced at the beginning of the spring term, conditional on continuing merit.
ADVANCED PLACEMENT
The Mathematics and Statistics Department attempts to place each student who elects a mathemat-
ics course in that course best suited to the student's preparation and goals. The suggested placement in
an appropriate calculus course is determined by the results of the Advanced Placement Examination
(AB or BC) if the student took one, and any additional available information. A student who receives a
3, 4, or 5 on the BC examination is ordinarily placed in Mathematics 106. A student who receives a 4
or 5 on the AB examination is ordinarily placed in Mathematics 105. A student who receives a 1 or 2
on the BC examination or a 2 or 3 on the AB examination is ordinarily placed in Mathematics 104.
Students who have had calculus in high school, whether or not they took the Advanced Placement
Examination, are barred from Mathematics 103 unless they obtain permission from the instructor. A
student who receives a 4 or 5 on the Statistics AP examination is ordinarily placed in Statistics 231.
Students interested in statistics should consult the department for placement. In any event, students
registering for mathematics and statistics courses are urged to consult with members of the depart-
ment concerning appropriate courses and placement. In general, students are encouraged to enroll in
the most advanced course for which they are qualified: it is much easier to drop back than to jump
forward. The department reserves the right to refuse registration in any course for which the student is
determined to be over-prepared.
GENERAL REMARKS
Divisional Requirements
All courses may be used to satisfy this requirement.
Alternate Year Courses
Core courses Mathematics 301, 305, 312, and 315 are normally offered every year. Other 300-level
courses may be offered in alternate years. Senior seminars (400-level courses) are normally offered
every two to four years. Students should check with the department before planning far into the future.
Course Admission
Courses are normally open to all students meeting the prerequisites. Students with questions about
the level at which courses are conducted are invited to consult members of the department.
Course Descriptions
Descriptions of the courses in Statistics follow the descriptions of Mathematics courses. More de-
tailed information on all of the offerings in the department is available in the Informal Guide to Mathe-
matics Courses at Williams that can be obtained at the departmental office.
Courses Open on a Pass/Fail Basis
Students taking a mathematics or statistics course on a pass/fail basis must meet all the require-
ments set for students taking the course on a graded basis.
With the permission of the department, any course offered by the department may be taken on a
pass/fail basis. Permission will not be given to mathematics majors to meet any of the requirements of
the major or honors degree on this basis. However, with the permission of the department, courses
taken in the department beyond those requirements may be taken on a pass/fail basis.
Graduate School Requirements
An increasing number of graduate and professional schools require mathematics and statistics as a
prerequisite to admission or to attaining their degree. Students interested in graduate or professional
training in business, medicine, economics, or psychology are advised to find out the requirements in
those fields early in their college careers.
MATHEMATICS COURSES
NOTE: STATISTICS COURSE LISTINGS FOLLOW THE MATHEMATICS COURSE

MATH 101(F) Mathematical Analysis and Descriptive Statistics
This course is intended to develop quantitative skills for non-science majors. We will cover basic algebra
from an applied point of view, including working with formulas and solving for unknowns. We will
cover basic finance using a spreadsheet to set up, analyze, and compare different financial scenarios
including loans and annuities computations. We will cover descriptive statistics by exploring data, plot-
ting distributions, computing mean/median/variance, displaying scatter plots with trend lines, and work-
ing with contingency tables.
Format: lecture and computer lab. Evaluation will be based primarily on homework, quizzes and/or ex-
ams, and computer projects.

Hour: 9:55-11:10 TR S. JOHNSON
MATH 102(F) Precalculus
This course prepares students for Mathematics 103, first semester calculus. The course begins with a
brief review of algebra followed by a thorough treatment of algebraic, logarithmic, and trigonometric
functions from a graphical, analytical and applied point of view.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on homework, quizzes, and/or exams.
Prerequisites: placement by a Quantitative Studies Counselor or permission of instructor. Enrollment
limit: (expected: 15).
Hour: 9:55-11:10 TR STEVENSON
MATH 103(F,S) Calculus I (Q)
Calculus permits the computation of velocities and other instantaneous rates of change by a limiting
process called differentiation. The same process also solves "max-min" problems: how to maximize
profit or minimize pollution. A second limiting process, called integration, permits the computation of
areas and accumulations of income or medicines. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus provides a
useful and surprising link between the two processes. Subtopics include trigonometry, exponential
growth, and logarithms. This is an introductory course for students who have not seen calculus before.
Students who have previously taken a calculus course may not enroll in MATH 103 without the permis-
sion of instructor.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on homework, quizzes, and/or exams.
Prerequisites: Mathematics 101 (or demonstrated proficiency on a diagnostic test; see Mathematics
101). No enrollment limit (expected: 50-60).
Hour: 8:00-8:50 MWF First Semester: TAPP
9:00-9:50 MWF Second Semester: S. JOHNSON
MATH 104(F,S) Calculus II (Q)
Mastery of calculus requires understanding how integration computes areas and business profit and ac-
quiring a stock of techniques. Further methods solve equations involving derivatives ("differential equa-
tions") for population growth or pollution levels. Exponential and logarithmic functions and trigono-
metric and inverse functions play an important role. This course is the right starting point for students
who have seen derivatives, but not necessarily integrals, before. Students who have received the equiva-
lent of advanced placement of AB 4 or BC 3 may not enroll in Mathematics 104 without the permission
of instructor. Students who have higher advanced placement must enroll in Mathematics 105 or above.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on homework, quizzes, and/or exams.

MATH 105(F,S) Multivariable Calculus (Q)
Applications of calculus in mathematics, science, economics, psychology, the social sciences, involve
several variables. This course extends calculus to several variables: vectors, partial derivatives, multiple
integrals. There is also a unit on infinite series, sometimes with applications to differential equations.
This course is the right starting point for students who have seen differentiation and integration before.
Students with the equivalent of advanced placement of AB 4, BC 3 or above should enroll in Mathemat-
ics 105.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on homework, quizzes, and/or exams.

tiple integrals. The goal of the course is Stokes Theorem, a deep and profound generalization of the Fun-
damental Theorem of Calculus. The difference between this course and Mathematics 105 is that Mathe-
matics 105 covers infinite series instead of Stokes Theorem. Students with the equivalent of BC 3 or
higher should enroll in Mathematics 106, as well as students who have taken the equivalent of an inte-

MATH 170(F) Mathematics of Finance (Q)
This course investigates the mathematics underlying various problems that arise in personal, consumer,
and business finance. Topics include simple and compound interest, periodic loans (such as home mort-
gages and auto loans), present value, future value, bank discounting and rediscounting, amortization,
sinking funds, corporate and municipal bonds, perpetual annuities, taxes (including itemization), life
annuities, depreciation, inflation, and the basic mechanics of life insurance. Students are required to
carry out several spreadsheet projects; instruction on the use of these systems is provided as needed.
Although the course does not prepare students for the examinations of the Society of Actuaries, it is
basically actuarial in approach, not a course in "how to invest."
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on performance in class quizzes, spreadsheet exer-
cises, and exams.

Who should have won the 2000 Presidential Election? Do any two senators really have equal power in
passing legislation? How can marital assets be divided fairly? While these questions are of interest to
many social scientists, a mathematical perspective can offer a quantitative analysis of issues like these
and more. In this course, we will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of various types of voting
systems and show that, in fact, any such system is flawed. We will also examine a quantitative definition
of power and the principles behind fair division. Along the way, we will enhance the critical reasoning
skills necessary to tackle any type of problem mathematical or otherwise.

MATH 180(S) The Art of Mathematical Thinking: An Introduction to the Beauty and Power
of Mathematical Ideas (Q)
What is mathematics? How can it enrich and improve your life? What do mathematicians think about
and how do they go about tackling challenging questions? Most people envision mathematicians as
people who solve equations or perform arithmetic. In fact, mathematics is an artistic endeavor which
requires both imagination and creativity. In this course, we will experience what this is all about by dis-
covering various beautiful branches of mathematics while learning life lessons that will have a positive
impact on our lives. There are two meta-goals for this course: (1) a better perspective into mathematics,
and (2) sharper analytical reasoning to solve problems (both mathematical and nonmathematical).
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based primarily on projects, homework assignments, and
exams.

MATH 209(S) Differential Equations and Vector Calculus (Q)
Historically, much beautiful mathematics has arisen from attempts to explain heat flow, chemical reac-

fraction of the associated ordinary and partial differential equations. The mystical Pythagorean fascina-
tion with ratios and harmonics is vindicated and applied in Fourier series and integrals. Integrating vec-
torfields over surfaces applies equally to blood flow, gravity, and differential geometry.

MATH 211(F,S) Linear Algebra (Q)
Many social, political, economic, biological, and physical phenomena can be described, at least approxi-
mately, by linear relations. In the study of systems of linear equations one may ask: When does a solu-
tion exist? When is it unique? How does one find it? How can one interpret it geometrically? This course
develops the theoretical structure underlying answers to these and other questions and includes the study
of matrices, vector spaces, linear independence and bases, linear transformations, determinants and in-
ner products. Course work is balanced between theoretical and computational, with attention to improv-
ing mathematical style and sophistication.

MATH 251T(S) Introduction to Mathematical Proof and Argumentation (Q)
The fundamental focus of this tutorial is for students to acquire the ability to create and clearly express
mathematical arguments through an exploration of topics from discrete mathematics. Students will learn
various mathematical proof techniques while discovering such areas as logic, number theory, infinity,
geometry, graph theory, and probability. Our goal is not only to gain an understanding and appreciation
of interesting and important areas of mathematics but also to develop and critically analyze original
mathematical ideas and argumentation. Note: this course fulfills the same requirements as does Mathe-
matics 251 but credit will not be given for both Mathematics 251T and Mathematics 251.

MATH 301(F) Real Analysis (Q)
Real analysis is the theory behind calculus. It is based on a precise understanding of the real numbers,
elementary topology, and limits. Topologically, nice sets are either closed (contain their limit points) or
open (complement closed). You also need limits to define continuity, derivatives, integrals, and to under-
stand sequences of functions.

MATH 302(S) Complex Analysis (Q)
The calculus of complex-valued functions turns out to have unexpected simplicity and power. As an
example of simplicity, every complex-differentiable function is automatically infinitely differentiable.
As examples of power, the so-called "residue calculus" permits the computation of "impossible" inte-
grals, and "conformal mapping" reduces physical problems on very general domains to problems on the
round disc. The easiest proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, not to mention the first proof of
the Prime Number Theorem, used complex analysis.

Algebra gives us the tools to solve equations. Sets such as the integers or real numbers have special
properties which make algebra work or not work according to the circumstances. In this course, we gen-
eralize algebraic processes and the sets upon which they operate in order to better understand, theoreti-
cally, when equations can and cannot be solved. We define and study the abstract algebraic structures
called groups, rings and fields, as well as the concepts of factor group, quotient ring, homomorphism,
isomorphism, and various types of field extensions.

Physics (Same as Physics 316) (Q)
Living in the early decades of the information age, we find ourselves depending more and more on
codes that protect messages against either noise or eavesdropping. We begin this course by studying the
history of this subject, including, for example, the story of the enigma code from World War II. We then
examine some of the most important codes currently being used to protect information, including linear
codes, which in addition to being mathematically elegant are the most practical codes for error correc-
tion, and the RSA public key cryptographic scheme, popular nowadays for internet applications. Look-
ing ahead by a decade or more, we show how a "quantum computer" could crack any RSA code in short
order, and how quantum cryptographic devices will achieve security through the Heisenberg uncertainty
principle.
Evaluation will be based on homework sets and exams.

MATH 321(F) Knot Theory (Q)
Take a piece of string, tie a knot in it, and glue the ends together. The result is a knotted circle, known as a
knot. For the last 100 years, mathematicians have studied knots, asking such questions as, "Given a
nasty tangled knot, how do you tell if it can be untangled without cutting it open?" Some of the most
interesting advances in knot theory have occurred in the last ten years.
This course is an introduction to the theory of knots. Among other topics, we will cover methods of knot
tabulation, surfaces applied to knots, polynomials associated to knots, and relationships between knot
theory and chemistry and physics. In addition to learning the theory, we will look at open problems in the
field.

MATH 403(F) Irrationality and Transcendence (Q)
The study of the nature of numbers is one of the most ancient and fundamental pursuits in all of mathe-
matics. In this course we explore the worlds of irrational and transcendental number theory. A number is
algebraic if it is the solution to a nontrivial polynomial equation with integer coefficients. Numbers that
are not algebraic are called transcendental. While these issues are ancient, it was not until 1844 that it
was shown that transcendental numbers exist. Since then many modern techniques have been developed
to shed some insight into these enigmatic numbers. These techniques beautifully weave ideas from alge-
bra and analysis together. Here we will provide all the necessary ideas from algebraic number theory and
from complex analysis. Mathematics 302 and Mathematics 313 are not pre-requisites.

and transformations admitting and not admitting an invariant measure. There will be an emphasis on
specific examples such as group rotations, the binary odometer transformations, and rank-one construc-
tions.

MATH 414(S) Galois Theory (Q)
The relation of high school algebra to the abstraction of Mathematics 312 is not apparent, but Galois
Theory shows the link. One goal of high school algebra is to solve (find roots of) linear equations (ax + b
= 0) and quadratic equations. By the sixteenth century, methods were found to solve third and fourth
degree equations. Here progress stopped until the early nineteenth century, when Abel and Galois
showed that no such general method for finding roots of equations of degree higher than four can exist.
They needed totally new tools, which led to the mathematics of abstract algebra. The goal of Mathemat-
ics 414 is to develop through linear algebra, the deep connection between roots of polynomials and finite
groups.

lar newspapers feature statistics to catch the eye of the passerby, and sports broadcasters overwhelm the
listener with arcane statistics. How do we learn to recognize dishonest or even unintentionally distorted

representations of quantitative information? How are we to reconcile two medical studies with seeming-
ly contradictory conclusions? How many observations do we need in order to make a decision? It is the
purpose of this course to develop an appreciation for and an understanding of the interpretation of data.
We will become familiar with the standard tools of statistical inference including the t-test, the analysis
of variance, and regression, as well as exploratory data techniques. Applications will come from the real
world that we all live in.

STAT 201(F,S) Statistics and Data Analysis (Q)
Statistics can be viewed as the art (science?) of turning data into information. Real world decision-mak-

Sherlock Holmes, when prematurely asked the merits of a case by Dr. Watson, snapped back, "Data,
data, data! I can't make bricks without clay." In this course, we will study the basic methods by which
statisticians attempt to extract information from data. These will include many of the standard tools of
statistical inference such as the t-test, analysis of variance and linear regression as well as exploratory
and graphical data analysis techniques.

most information from it in the fewest number of observations. The efficient design of experiments is
important not only in the sciences: it has been credited for helping Japanese industry achieve its success.
The examples from this course will be primarily from the students area of interest. Students will be
paired by area of interest and previous statistical experience. The culmination of the course will be a
project where each student designs, carries out, analyzes, and presents an experiment of interest to him
or her.

ods. We will study both the mathematics of regression analysis and its applications, including a discus-
sion of the limits to such analyses. The applications will range from predicting the quality of a vintage of
Bordeaux wine from the weather to forecasting stock prices, and will come from a broad range of disci-
plines.

STAT 421(F) Introduction to Categorical Data Analysis (Q)
This course focuses on methods for the analysis of categorical response data. In contrast to continuous
data, categorical data consists of observations classified in categories. For example, when asked about
their preference for a brand-name product, respondents choose brands A or B, i.e., a binary response.
When zoologists ask about the primary food choice of alligators, they classify the response into three
categories: fish, invertebrate or fellow alligators/reptiles. Traditional tools of statistical data analysis are
not design to handle such data and pose inappropriate assumptions. In this course, we will develop meth-
ods specifically designed to address the discrete nature of the observation, and consider applications to
the social sciences, biological/medical sciences, and business.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based on homework, exams and a final applied project.

Department strongly recommends that students elect at least one course from each group.
It is strongly recommended that prospective majors complete Music 104, 201, 202, and 207 by the
end of the sophomore year.
Performance and Concert Requirements
Music majors are encouraged to participate in departmental ensembles throughout their careers at
Williams; i.e., for eight semesters. Majors are required to participate in departmental ensembles for at
least four semesters. The student must petition to meet this requirement in an alternative way. Music
majors are also expected to attend departmentally-sponsored concerts.
Foreign Languages
Music majors are strongly urged to take courses in at least one foreign language while at Williams.
Musicianship Skills
Music majors are strongly urged to maintain, refine and improve their musicianship skills, such as
sight-singing, score reading, melodic and harmonic dictation, and keyboard proficiency, throughout
their entire Williams career.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN MUSIC
Three routes toward honors and highest honors are possible in the Music major:
a. Composition: A Composition thesis must include one major work completed during the senior year, a
portfolio of smaller works completed during the junior and senior years, and a 10- to 15-page discus-
sion of the student's work.
b. Performance: A Performance thesis must include an honors recital given during the spring of the
senior year and a 15- to 20-page discussion of a selection of the works performed. The student's
general performance career will also be considered in determining honors.
c. History, Theory and Analysis, or Ethnomusicology: A written Historical, Theoretical/Analytical, or
Ethnomusicological thesis between 65 and 80 pages in length and an oral presentation based on the
thesis is required. A written thesis should offer new insights based on original research.
Music
­ 233 ­
To be admitted to the honors program, a student must have at least a 3.3 GPA in Music courses (this
GPA must be maintained in order to receive honors), and have demonstrated ability and experience
through coursework and performance in the proposed thesis area. A 1- to 2-page application to the
honors program, written in consultation with a faculty member, must be made to the chair of Music
before or during spring registration in the junior year.
Honors candidates must enroll in Music 493(F)-W031-494(S) during their senior year. A student
who is highly qualified for honors work, but who, for compelling reasons, is unable to pursue a year-
long project, may petition the department for permission to pursue a thesis over one semester and the
winter study term. If granted, the standards for evaluating the thesis in such exceptional cases would
be identical to those that apply to year-long honors projects. Final submission of the thesis must be
made to the Music Department by April 15 of the senior year. The department's decision to award
honors will be based on the quality of the thesis.
LESSONS
Courses involving individual vocal or instrumental instruction involve extra fees which are subsi-
dized by the department. (See Music 251-258 and Studies in the Musical Art 325, 326, 427, 428). For
further information contact the Department of Music.

100-LEVEL COURSES
MUS 101(F) Listening to Music: An Introduction
Intended for non-major students with little or no formal training.
When you listen to music--on the radio, on a CD, at a concert--how much do you really hear? This
course has two goals: to refine listening skills, thus increasing the student's understanding and enjoy-
ment of music, while at the same time providing a survey of the major composers and musical styles of
the Western classical repertory to be encountered in concert halls today. Students will be introduced to
music from the Baroque, Classical, Romantic, and Modern periods, including works by composers such
as Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Brahms, Mahler, and Stravinsky. Genres to be covered include the sym-
phony, chamber music, opera, song, and choral music. Attendance at selected concerts on campus re-
quired.
Evaluation will be based on two tests, two concert reports, and a final exam.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 40.

MUS 112(S) Music and Nationalism
It may stand to reason that cultural expression bears traces of the nations in which it was produced. In the
case of music, that connection has either been politicized or, conversely, downplayed-as critics and phi-
losophers tried to locate music solely within a sublime, otherworldly realm. This course will investigate
the historical, political, and aesthetic connections between music and the nations in which it has soun-
ded. We will focus on the canon of European art music in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
Topics will include instrumental music and ideals of German "seriousness" and organicism; religious
music and nationalism; Wagner and anti-Semitism; the operas of Italian and Russian nationalism;
Bartók and folk music; and the careers of composers such as Liszt and Stravinsky, whose lives and musi-
cal contributions bridge multiple nationalist projects.
Music

Our discussions will come to grips with several thorny issues: Do national musical styles exist? If so, are
they also nationalist? Is musical nationalism simply an issue of reception? intention? Is all nationalism
alike? What are the politics of depicting nationality in music?

An introduction to the life and music of the German Baroque composer Johann Sebastian Bach. We will
consider both matters of cultural context (such as the social milieu in which Bach developed his art and
the use and perception of his music by his contemporaries), and matters of purely musical content (the
styles and forms of his prodigious oeuvre). Both instrumental and vocal music will be surveyed, includ-
ing the Brandenburg Concerti, the Goldberg Variations, the Magnificat, and the B Minor Mass. The
course will conclude with an exploration of the attitudes towards Bach and treatments of his music in the
more than 250 years since his death.

in African-American music, the relationship of African-American music in the U.S. to the music of
Africa and the African diaspora, the process of acculturation, African and African-American aesthetics
in music, and the impact of social conditions on African-American music in the U.S.

Asia (China, Korea, and Japan) to Southeast Asia (Thailand and Indonesia) to the Indian subcontinent,
Central Asia (Tibet and Afghanistan), to the Middle East (Iran and the Arabian peninsula), and will end
with the extension of Asian music across North Africa and into Eastern Europe. Within this broad sur-
vey, we will focus on selected and representative musical cultures and genres. In each section of the
course, aspects of cultural context (including music's function in religious life and its relationship to the
other arts), will be emphasized. While our focus will be on the traditional and classical musics of these
cultures, we will also briefly consider the current musical scene. Encounters with this music will include
attendance at live performances when possible.

This course takes the piano, its repertory, and its performers as focal points for a social history of Western
music since the late eighteenth century. In addition to exploring "serious" works by composers such as
Mozart and Beethoven, we will consider "parlor" music and music by crowd-pleasing virtuosi such as
Liszt and Gottschalk. We will also consider a broad range of classical, jazz, and popular performers,
ranging from Clara Schumann, Vladimir Horowitz, Arthur Rubinstein and Glenn Gould through Art
Tatum and Thelonious Monk to Liberace. Other topics will include the "cult of the virtuoso," the rise of
the Victorian "piano girl," and the piano as a locus around which issues of gender, class and race are
played out in nineteenth century and twentieth century musical life.

MUS 138(S) Sibyl of the Rhine: The Life and Times of Hildegard of Bingen
The 11th century German abbess Hildegard of Bingen was one of the most remarkable people of her
age. She was a theologian and reformer, poet, composer, artist, author of treatises on natural science and
medicine; she corresponded with emperors, kings, queens and popes as well as abbots, abbesses, nuns,
monks, and laypeople. Yet she lived most of her long life in a remote cloister on the banks of the river
Rhine, and was virtually lost to history until her recent rediscovery 900 years after her birth. This course
draws on a wealth of recent scholarship to explore the life and times of this extraordinary woman, using
her music as the window into her ideas and her world. Class meetings will include discussion of readings
by and about her life and work as well as in-class performance of her plainsongs and liturgical drama.
Format: lecture/discussion, two days a week. Evaluation based on class participation, several short pa-
pers, and a final project. A field trip may be required.

THEORY AND MUSICIANSHIP
MUS 103 (F), MUS 104(S) Music Theory and Musicianship I
The courses are designed for potential majors and for students with strong instrumental or vocal back-
grounds. Although there is no prerequisite for Music 103, students are expected to have some knowledge
of musical rudiments, reading proficiency in at least one clef, and ideally have some comfort reading
both bass and treble clefs. An entrance exam administered on the first day of Music 103 will assess stu-
dents' skills and background, and determine if a student requires any additional remedial work to com-
plement and fortify course work during the early weeks of the semester. Students with a strong back-
ground in music theory may take a placement exam during First Days to see whether they can pass out
of one or both semesters. Students are expected to take Music 103 prior to Music 104; exceptions will be
made only for students who have either placed out of Music 103 or have received permission of the
instructor.
Music 103-104 presents the materials, structures and procedures of tonal music, with an emphasis on the
harmonic and contrapuntal practice of the baroque and classical periods (ca. 1600-1825).
Music 103 explores triadic harmony, voice leading, and counterpoint with an emphasis on the chorale
style of J.S. Bach and his predecessors. Keyboard harmony and figured bass exercises, sight singing,
dictation, analysis of repertoire, written exercises and emulation projects will develop both an intellectu-
al and an aural understanding of music of the period.
Music 104 continues the practical musicianship work of Music 103, while expanding the scope of har-
monic topics to include seventh chords and chromatic harmony. Music 104 further explores the trans-
formation of chorale harmony in contrapuntal works of the eighteenth century, and introduces the ele-
ments of classical style. Projects include the composition and performance of a baroque fugue and a
classical minuet.

MUS 201(F), 202(S) Music Theory and Musicianship II
Music 201-202 presents the harmonic practices, techniques, and structures of the nineteenth and twen-
tieth century compositions (c. 1825-1950) through analysis, performance, dictation, and composition of
characteristic examples of "romantic" and "modern" aesthetics.
In Music 201 the development of chromatic harmony is presented from Beethoven through Strauss and
Mahler by means of analysis, composition, written exercises, sightsinging, keyboard application and
dictation. To supplement the development of musical skills appropriate to the period, students are ex-
pected to attend weekly skills labs in eartraining, sightsinging, and keyboard application, as well as to
develop, outside of class, their vocal, aural, and keyboard competence through regular practice of the
materials supplied. Format: three lectures and two skills lab-sessions per week. Evaluation will be based
on class participation, written projects of various lengths, compositions, and a final exam. Prerequisite:
Music 104 or permission of instructor.

This course explores 1000 years of music-making in Western European culture, beginning with the phil-
osophical and theoretical origins of that music in ancient Greece and extending to the life and music of
J.S. Bach. Topics covered will include how the sound of music changed over a millennium; the different
functions it served and how genres developed to serve these functions; the lives of the men and women
who composed, performed, and wrote about music; and how the changing notation and theory of music
related to its practice over the centuries. At the same time, the course provides an introduction to the
modern study of music history, sampling a broad range of recent scholarship reflecting an array of criti-
cal approaches to the study of early music in our own day.

MUS 210T(S) American Pop Orientalism (W)
This tutorial will investigate the representation of Asians and Asian Americans in American popular
culture since the late nineteenth century. Our focus will be on music's role in Orientalist representation in
a wide variety of media, including Hollywood film, television, popular song, Broadway musicals, and
novels. We will begin with major texts in cultural theory (Said, Bhabha, Clifford, Spivak) and will at-
tempt throughout the semester to revise and refine their tenets. Can American Orientalism be distin-
guished in any fundamental way from nineteenth-century European imperialist thought? How does
Orientalist representation calibrate when the "exotic others" being represented are themselves Ameri-
cans? Our own critical thought will be sharpened through analysis and interpretation of specific works,
such as Madame Butterfly, "Chinatown, My Chinatown," The King and I, Sayonara, M. Butterfly, Alad-
din, and Weezer's Pinkerton. We will end the semester by considering the current state of Orientalism in
American popular culture.
Format: tutorial. Evaluation will be based on five 5- to 6-page essays and on the quality of the student's
critical engagement with the work of his/her colleagues.
Previous related coursework and/or musical experience is desirable, but is not required. Enrollment lim-
it: 10 (expected:10). Preference to sophomores and juniors.

to regular assignments involving arranging in various styles, the class will study successful vocal ar-
rangements. Analysis of the various components involved in good arranging--including voice leading,
range, balance and voicing, key relationships, and motivic and structural cohesiveness--will be ad-
dressed.
Evaluation will be based on weekly arranging assignments building toward the midterm, final exams--
larger arranging projects, and a performance of selected works.
Prerequisites: permission of instructor.

MUS 212(F) Jazz Theory and Improvisation I
The theory and application of basic techniques in jazz improvisation including blues forms, swing, be-
bop, modally based composition, Afro-Cuban, etc. Appropriate for students with very little specific ex-
perience in jazz as well as more experienced students. Knowledge of all key signatures, major/minor
keys and modes, intervals, triads and basic seventh chords (including inversions) and their functions
within keys, and competence on an instrument is essential. Alternates between lecture style exposition
of theoretical topics and their specific applications in an informal performance/rehearsal setting.
In addition to the development of skills, written work consists of assignments (e.g., harmonic analysis
and realization as well as exercise in transposition and transcription) and a final project (e.g., transcrip-

400-LEVEL COURSES
MUS 402(S) Senior Seminar in Music
This seminar, the culminating course in the major, will focus on a classic subject of musical inquiry: the
relationship between music and language. Is music itself a language? Does joining words to music im-
part power to the words or provide signification to the music? How should text be set to music? These
questions have intrigued composers, philosophers, and linguists throughout history and across the
globe. Our work in this seminar will involve both the analysis of specific vocal styles and the critical
interpretation of historical and contemporary theories of music and language. We will investigate such
topics as: polytextuality in the fourteenth-century motet; stile rappresentativo and Italian humanism;
symbolic language in Bach; Rousseau's theory of music as ideal language; rhetoric and the Classical
style; detached texts in nineteenth-century instrumental music and musical analysis; musical narration in
nineteenth-century opera; traditions of Buddhist chant; Qur'anic recitation as non-music; experimental
vocal techniques in the twentieth-century; the ballads of Cole Porter; Dylan's bardic style; the voice and
technology.
Evaluation will be based on papers, presentations, and class participation.
Prerequisites: Music 202, 207, 208, 209 and permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: all senior music
majors (expected: 7).

Neuroscience is a rapidly growing interdisciplinary field concerned with understanding the rela-
tionship between brain, mind, and behavior. The interdisciplinary nature of the field is apparent when
surveying those who call themselves neuroscientists. Among these are anatomists, physiologists,
chemists, psychologists, philosophers, computer scientists, linguists, and ethologists. The areas that
neuroscience addresses are equally diverse and range from physiological and molecular studies of
single neurons, to investigations of how systems of neurons produce phenomena such as vision and
movement, to the study of the neural basis of complex cognitive phenomena such as memory, lan-
guage, and consciousness. Applications of neuroscience research are rapidly growing and include the
development of drugs to treat neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkin-
son's disease, the development of noninvasive techniques for imaging the human brain such as PET
scans and MRI, and the development of methods for repair of the damaged human brain such as the
use of brain explants. Combining this wide range of disciplines, areas of research, and application for
the study of a single remarkably complex organ--the brain--requires a unique interdisciplinary ap-
proach. The Neuroscience Program is designed to provide students with the opportunity to explore
this approach.
THE PROGRAM
The program in neuroscience consists of five courses including an introductory course, three elec-
tives, and a senior course. In addition, students are required to take two courses, Biology 101 and
Psychology 101, as part of the program.
Neuroscience (Neuroscience 201) is the basic course and provides the background for other neuro-
science courses. Ideally, this will be taken before the end of sophomore year. Either Biology 101 or
Psychology 101 serves as the prerequisite. Electives are designed to provide in-depth coverage in-
cluding laboratory experience in specific areas of neuroscience. At least one elective course is re-
quired in Biology (Group A) and one in Psychology (Group B). The third elective course may also
come from Group A or Group B, or may be selected from other neuroscience related courses upon
approval of the advisory committee. Topics in Neuroscience (Neuroscience 401) is designed to pro-
vide an integrative culminating experience. Most students will take this course in the senior year.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN NEUROSCIENCE
The degree with honors in Neuroscience provides students with the opportunity to undertake an
original research project under the supervision of one or more of the Neuroscience faculty. In addition
to completing the requirements of the Neuroscience Program, candidates for an honors degree must
enroll in Neuroscience 493-W031-494 and write a thesis based on an original research project. Pre-
sentation of a thesis, however, should not be interpreted as a guarantee of a degree with honors. Stu-
dents interested in pursuing a degree with honors should contact the Neuroscience Advisory Commit-
tee in the spring of their junior year.
REQUIRED COURSES
Biology 101 The Cell
Psychology 101 Introductory Psychology
(Both of these courses should be completed by the end of the sophomore year.)
Neuroscience 201 Neuroscience
Neuroscience 401 Topics in Neuroscience
ELECTIVES
Three elective courses are required. At least one elective must be from Group A and at least one
elective must be from Group B. The third elective may come from either Group A or Group B or the
student may wish to petition the advisory committee to substitute a related course.

NSCI 401(F) Topics in Neuroscience
Neuroscientists explore issues inherent in the study of brain and behavior. The overall objective of this
seminar is to create a culminating senior experience in which previous course work in specific areas in
the Neuroscience Program can be brought to bear in a synthetic, interdisciplinary approach to under-
standing complex problems. The specific goals for students in this seminar are (1) to evaluate original
research and critically examine the experimental evidence for theoretical issues, and (2) to gain an un-
derstanding of this discipline through group work, and oral presentations. Topics and instructional for-
mats will vary somewhat from year to year, but in all cases the course will emphasize an integrative
approach in which students will be asked to consider topics from a range of perspectives including mo-
lecular, cellular, systems, behavioral and clinical neuroscience. Previous topics have included memory,
autism, depression, alcoholism, language development, and stress.
Format: student-led discussions and presentations, three hours a week. Evaluation will be based on pre-
sentations, participation in class discussion, and a term paper.
Prerequisites: open only to seniors in the Neuroscience program. Enrollment limit: 24 (expected: 10).
This course is required of all senior students in the Neuroscience program.

The Performance Studies Program provides an opportunity to inhabit an intellectual place where
the making of artistic and cultural meaning intersects with critical reflection on those processes. The
program has as its primary goal the bringing together of those students and faculty engaged in the
creative arts, i.e., studio art, creative writing, dance, film and video, music, and theater with those de-
partments that reflect in part on those activities, e.g., Anthropology and Sociology, Art History, Clas-
sics, foreign languages, Comparative Literature, English, History, Music, Philosophy, Psychology,
Religion and Theater. The central ideas which performance studies confronts-action, body, frame,
representation, race, ethnicity, gender, politics, history and transcultural experience-circulate within
and through the subjects and fields upon which the program draws.
Performance Studies
­ 243 ­
Performance Studies offers an introductory course (Theatre 220) and a capstone course (Theatre
335). In 2004-05, these courses are listed in the theatre department:
Students interested in participating in the Performance Studies Program are encouraged to do five
things: 1) take the introductory course, which in 2004-05 is Theatre 220, Approaching Performance
Studies; 2) take the capstone course, which in 2004-05 is Theatre 335, Contemporary U.S. Theatre
and Performance: Latinos/as in the Everyday ; 3) try different artistic media, both in the curriculum
and beyond; 4) move between the doing of art and performance and thinking about that process; and
5) prepare a portfolio of their work in different media.
As a senior year project, we strongly recommend the generation of a senior portfolio. Preparation
of the portfolio should normally begin in the second semester of the junior year. It will be done under
the supervision of a member of the advisory faculty and will be submitted in the spring of the senior
year. What we suggest is that portfolios should draw on at least four projects or productions. They
should show critical self-reflection on the creative processes, a comparison of the artistic media
employed and also demonstrate performance criticism on the work of others.
THEA 220(S) Approaching Performance Studies (Same as Women's and Gender Studies
220)
Theatre, film, video, music, dance, visual art, performance art, community activism, public gather-
ings--all fall under the rubric of "performance." Performance studies takes on these types of perform-
ances in the name of theorizing performance as a cultural act. This course will serve as an introduction to
the field of performance studies and its theoretical bases in anthropology, dramatic theory, poststructur-
alism, psychoanalytic theory, folklore, religion, cultural studies, literary theory, religion, philosophy,
feminist theory, and queer theory. In addition to reading and discussing theory, local live and recorded
performances will be considered. Williams faculty who are advisory faculty for the Performance Studies
Cluster (see masthead in the course catalog) will give guest lectures. The course will culminate in the
showing of students' final projects. This course is the introduction course for the Performance Studies
Program.
Format: seminar. Each class will be organized around a topic. An example: liminality. The students
would read Victor Turner to access the symbolic anthropological definition of liminality as "in-between-
ness." We would also consider performances, either described in readings such as Mikhail Bakhtin's
Rabelais and His World or on video/DVD, like Richard Schechner's Dionysus in 69. Students would
bring to class short, 3-page papers on how these performances would comment on and possibly define a
type of liminality. During the class meeting, along with the describing what is "in-between," they would
need to establish what the parameters of the performance are; in other words, what is the "in-between"
between? In the case of Schechner's Dionysus in 69, the anthropology-trained Schechner stages an In-
donesian birth ritual at the beginning of the play, enacted by white naked actors in a warehouse in SoHo.
In class, students would outline a revised, collective paper about the ethical and aesthetic aspects of
Schechner's choice and how they play into the theoretical concept of liminality.
Students are also required to make a final presentation, to be shown in a colloquium at the end of the
semester. Participation in class and on Blackboard is mandatory.
Evaluation will be based on class papers and final presentation.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20 (expected: 25). No first-years admitted. Preference to sopho-
mores, then juniors and seniors.
This course is part of the Critical Reasoning and Analytical Skills initiative.

THEA 335(S) Contemporary U.S. Theatre and Performance: Latinos/as in the Everyday
(Same as American Studies 335 and Women's and Gender Studies 337)*
This course explores Latino/a theatre and performance from the 1960's to the present. We will study
Latino/a theatre and performance in its broadest U.S. articulations, from mainstream Broadway produc-
tions to grass roots community carpas, from oppositional site-specific interventions to disembodied per-
formance in cyber space. We will pay particular attention to the intrinsic connections between social
movements and popular culture in the articulation of a counter-hegemonic Latino/a imaginary. What is
the relationship between migration, memory, Aztlan, border culture, the "Spirit Republic of Puerto
Rico," and exilic and diasporic subjectivities?
format: seminar.
Requirements: class participation and two presentations, one short essay (5-7 pages) and two longer es-
says (7-10 pages).
No prerequisites. No enrollment limit (expected: 15).

PHILOSOPHY (Div. II)
Chair, Professor JANA SAWICKI
Professors: GERRARD, SAWICKI, WHITE***. Associate Professor: DUDLEY. Assistant Profes-
sors: BARRY, CLARKE, CRUZ, MLADENOVIC**, WILBERDING. Visiting Assistant Profes-
sor: J. PEDRONI*. Visiting Lecturer: MUENCH.
To engage in philosophy is to ask a variety of questions about the world and our place in it. What
can we know? What should we do? What may we hope? What makes human beings human? These
questions, in various forms, and others like them are not inventions of philosophers; on the contrary,
they occur to most people simply as they live their lives. Many of us ask them as children, but later
either ignore them, or accept answers we can live with. Philosophers, however, seek to keep such
questions open, and to address them through reasoned discussion and argument, instead of accepting
answers to them based on opinion or prejudice.
The program in philosophy is designed to aid students in thinking about these issues, by acquaint-
ing them with influential work in the field, past and present, and by training them to grapple with these
issues themselves. The program emphasizes training in clear, critical thinking and in effective writing.
Philosophy courses center around class discussions and the writing of interpretive and critical essays.
MAJOR
Philosophy is a discipline with a long and intricate history, a history that remains an integral part of
the discipline. In this way, it differs dramatically from the natural sciences: for example, although no
contemporary physicists or biologists embrace Aristotle's physics or biology, among philosophers
there continue to be champions of Aristotle's metaphysics and of his ethics. Because of the richness
and continuing importance of the history of philosophy, the program is designed to give majors a his-
torical background that will acquaint them with a wide variety of approaches in philosophical issues,
and will provide them with a basis for evaluating and contributing to contemporary debates.
A total of nine courses is required for the major in Philosophy. Students should begin with Philoso-
phy 101 and 102, in either order; both are required for the major. These courses provide introductions
to historical figures and themes that continue to be influential in many contemporary discussions in
the two major areas of philosophical inquiry, i.e., practical inquiry into issues of ethics and politics,
and theoretical inquiry into issues of knowledge, belief, understanding, and reality. The final required
course is the Senior Seminar, Philosophy 401. Each student selects the six electives that complete the
major. The exposure to figures and topics in 101 and 102 provides students with some basis for choice,
but optimal shaping of an individual curriculum requires in addition consultation with faculty mem-
bers and other students.
Generally speaking, as students progress from 100- to 300-level courses, there will be decreasing
breadth and increasing depth. In addition, writing assignments become longer, and students assume
increasing responsibility for identifying and developing the topics of their essays. Finally, students in
300-level courses are often required to assume responsibility for making oral presentations or guiding
significant parts of class discussions.
Students considering graduate study in philosophy are strongly urged to develop reading compe-
tence in German, French, or Greek before graduation.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN PHILOSOPHY
The degree with honors in Philosophy is awarded to the student who has demonstrated outstanding
achievement in a program of study that extends beyond the requirements of the major. The extension
beyond major requirements may take the form either of independent work culminating in a senior
essay or thesis (the independent-study route) or of additional course work (the directed-study route).
Candidates must have GPAs of 3.6 or higher in their courses in philosophy at the end of the junior and
senior years. Juniors interested in pursuing honors should so inform the Department Chair no later
than mid-April.
The independent-study route to honors requires the completion and defense of either a senior essay
produced in the fall semester plus winter study period (maximum 40 pages) or a year-long senior the-
sis (maximum 75 pages). Plans for either essay or thesis (including a brief proposal and bibliography,
worked out in consultation with an advisor) must be submitted to the department in April of the junior
year. A recommendation for graduation with honors will be made on the basis of the thoroughness,
independence, and originality of the student's work.
The directed-study route to honors required the completion of two courses in philosophy in addi-
tion to the nine required for the major. Candidates taking this route must also submit to the department
revised copies of two term papers (10 pages or longer) written for philosophy courses they have taken;
each student will be assigned an adviser to help guide the process of revision. A recommendation for
graduation with honors will be made on the basis of the scope of the student's course work, the quality
of the student's participation in Philosophy 401, and the thoroughness, independence, and originality
reflected in the submitted papers.

PHIL 101(F,S) Introduction to Moral and Political Philosophy (W)
Throughout the history of Western philosophy, there have been debates concerning how human beings
should live: What should we do both with our lives as wholes and in specific problematic situations? The
debates have addressed us both as individuals and as members of political communities. This course
aims to aid us in responding to these debates, and in living our lives, on the basis of reasoned conclusions
rather than from unrecognized presuppositions. The course concentrates on Plato's Republic, the most
influential ethical and political text within Western philosophy, but we assess the Republic in light of
elaborations and criticisms that have developed over the past 2500 years, in works by Aristotle, Kant,
and Mill.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: class discussion, frequent short papers (totaling 20-30
pages).
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 per section (expected: 19 per section). Preference given to first-
year students and sophomores.

PHIL 102(F,S) Introduction to Metaphysics and Epistemology (W)
Metaphysics and epistemology are the two core pursuits of theoretical philosophy (as opposed to practi-
cal philosophy, the focus of Philosophy 101). Metaphysics is concerned with the ultimate character of
reality. The metaphysician seeks to develop knowledge (as opposed to mere opinion or belief) of all
things natural, human, and divine. She asks, for example: Are we free, or are our acts determined? Is
there a God? If so, what must God be like? Epistemology is concerned with how we determine the dif-
ference between knowledge and mere opinion. The epistemologist thus asks: What does it mean truly to
know something? How can we acquire such genuine knowledge? Answers to these epistemological
questions are essential if we are to have any confidence in the methods and results of our metaphysical
investigations. This course will emphasize the established historical classics that provide the basis for
understanding contemporary work on metaphysics and epistemological issues; we will consider, among
others, the work of Descartes, Hume, and Kant.

PHIL 103(S) Logic and Language (Q)
Logic is the study of reasoning and argument. More particularly, it concerns itself with the difference
between good and bad reasoning, between strong and weak arguments. We all examine the virtues and
vices of good arguments in both informal and formal systems. The goals of this course are to improve
the critical thinking of the students, to introduce them to sentential and predicate logic, to familiarize
them with enough formal logic to enable them to read some of the great works of philosophy, which use
formal logic (such as Wittgenstein's Tractatus), and to examine some of the connections between logic
and philosophy.
Requirements: a midterm, a final, frequent homework and problems sets.

PHIL 201(S) Continental Philosophy Workshop: Reading the Critics of Reason (W)
Nineteenth- and twentieth-century European philosophy gave rise to an astounding number of brilliant
thinkers (including Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Heidegger, Arendt, Lacan, Adorno, Gadamer, Irigaray,
Deleuze, and Derrida), who in turn initiated an equally astounding number of important philosophical
movements (including existentialism, structuralism, critical theory, hermeneutics, French feminism, and
post-structuralism). Fortunately, this bewildering diversity comprises a recognizable tradition in virtue
of a common theme: the relentless critique of the conceptions and projects of reason inherited from the
Enlightenment, Kant, and Hegel. Unfortunately, because many of these critiques are written in ways that
attempt to undermine and transform our notions of rationality, they can be maddeningly difficult to read.
This course will introduce students to continental philosophy by teaching them to interpret the challeng-
ing forms from which its content is inseparable. The course will be run as a workshop in reading hard
texts (class time and assignments will be devoted to the development and practice of rigorous analytical
techniques), and will prepare students for more advanced work in the humanities and social sciences.

PHIL 202(S) Analytic Philosophy--Language and Mind (W)
This course is designed to introduce students to twentieth-century philosophy by focusing on two of its
premier research areas, language and mind. Each of these topics been studied independently of the other,
with the philosophy of language dominating the first half of the century and the philosophy of mind
surging in the second half. Research on language and mind have also enjoyed a fruitful liaison, as much
of the technical apparatus of the philosophy of language has been used to illuminate the mind. The other
side of this coin is that language is something that minds achieve, and some prominent theories of lin-
guistic meaning have emphasized psychological elements of language use. The course will begin with
the work of Frege, Russell, and Wittgenstein, and end with the work of Putnam, Dennett, Fodor and
Churchland. The course is intended to prepare students for more advanced research on either language
or mind. At the same time, the course aims to offer an overview of the methods and intellectual style of
analytic philosophy. Thus, it will also serve as preparation for advanced work in epistemology, philoso-
phy of science, metaphysics, and ethics. The syllabus can be found at: http://www.williams. edu/philos-

PHIL 207(S) The Art of Living (Same as Classics 209) (W)
In ancient Greece and Rome philosophy wasn't simply an academic discipline; people chose to become
philosophers and to engage in an art of living devoted to rigorous self-examination and the rational
molding of the self. This course will introduce you to this conception of philosophy as a way of life and
explore some of the questions that often most concern us and that have seemed to many to have a partic-
ularly philosophical character to them: What is happiness? What is a good life? How should I live?
Should I fear death? What role should reason play in my life? What role should the emotions play? What
is love? What is friendship? What gives life meaning? Course materials will be drawn from a mixture of
traditional philosophical works (including works by Plato, Aristotle, Epicurus, and Seneca) together
with some philosophically challenging works of literature, film, and music. Students will be expected
not only to examine these materials closely but also to reflect upon their own convictions about these
matters and to try to adhere to the Delphic injunction to know thyself. "To be a philosopher," wrote that
great New England genius Henry David Thoreau, "is not merely to have subtle thoughts...but so to love
wisdom as to live according to its dictates....It is to solve some of the problems of life, not only theoreti-
cally, but practically." In this course we will seek to put Thoreau's words to the test.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: several short writing assignments, the keeping of a philoso-
phy journal, active class participation, and a final exam. *Note*: in addition to regular class attendance,
students will be required to attend a number of evening film screenings (approximately four films in
total).

PHIL 209(S) Philosophy of Science
It is a generally held belief, in our times and culture, that science is the best source of our knowledge of
the world, and of ourselves. The aim of this course is to examine the origins, grounds, and nature of this
belief. We will analyze and discuss various accounts of scientific method, structure and justification of
scientific theories, scientific choice, change, and the idea that scientific knowledge is progressive. The
course will begin with the "received view" of scientific theories, methods, and knowledge, advanced by
logical positivists, which assumes the objectivity and the rationality of science. We will then discuss
philosophies of science that emerged out of various criticisms of this view-especially those of Popper,
Lakatos, Kuhn and Feyerabend-and the challenges to the assumptions of scientific objectivity and ratio-
nality their works provoked. This discussion will naturally lead us to the relativist and social-construc-
tivist views developed within contemporary science studies. Finally, we will analyze the current debate
about the cognitive credentials of science and the proper approach to the study of science, which came to
be known as "the science wars."

PHIL 221(F) Greek Philosophy (Same as Classics 221) (W)
The roots of nearly every central issue in western philosophy can be traced back to a starting point in
Ancient Greece, and yet even if we concede that (western) philosophy began in ancient Greece, it is no
easy task to say just when it began and with whom. We will begin this course with just this question.
Homer and Hesiod exerted an enormous influence on all later thinkers in the areas of ethics and theolo-
gy; should they be considered the first philosophers? In what ways do the early efforts of the pre-Socrat-
ics such as Thales and Anaximander distinguish themselves from Homer and Hesiod? After surveying
the major pre-Socratic thinkers, we will turn our attention to the three figures that tower above all of
ancient philosophy: Socrates, Plato and Aristotle. Regarding the latter two, our focus will be on their
metaphysics and epistemology, as well as on their theories of soul and God, and so this course should
form a nice complement to Philosophy 101, 205 or 255 which give pride of place to their ethics. Finally,
we will take a brief look at some later developments in Greek philosophy, notably Skepticism and Neo-
Platonism.

PHIL 223(S) Environmental Ethics (Same as Environmental Studies 223)
Environmental issues are among the most urgent, complex and pervasive issues we face, and they are
often radically bound up with concerns that are ethical in nature. This combination has given rise to a
growing body of difficult questions such as: What is the value of wilderness versus oil or jobs? Do ani-
mals have rights? Do the highly developed nations have different obligations with respect to global
warming and the loss of species than the lesser developed nations? Can we frame these questions and
considerations in a way that does not unfairly privilege our own perspective? Philosophers in the west-
ern tradition have only recently begun to search for coherent theoretical frameworks within which to
address these questions; their attempts constitute the field known as environmental ethics. In this course
we will look at several of the leading approaches in this field, particularly as they bear on our relationship
to animals, social justice, and wilderness preservation. We will also read select literary works for the
light they throw on these topics. Authors will include Tom Regan, Peter Singer, Bernard Williams, J.M.
Coetzee, Cora Diamond, Mark Sagoff, Carolyn Merchant, and Barbara Kingsolver.

PHIL 226(F) Big Games: The Spiritual Significance of Sports (Same as Religion 279)
Sports matter beyond all apparent reason. They are children's games, yet grip adults. They serve as en-
tertainment, yet are taken most seriously. They demand physical excellence, yet drive athletes to injury
and spectators to become obese. The significance of contemporary sports is thus unquestionable, but it is
also unexplained. Diversion and fitness alone cannot begin to account for the extraordinary amounts of
time, money, and emotion invested in the playing, watching, and analysis of sports.
This course will attempt to comprehend the significance of sports by attending to their role as a source of
three distinctive forms of "spiritual" experience: patriotism, beauty, and divinity. We will consider the
extent to which the fundamental elements of contemporary sports (games, athletes, equipment, arenas,
fans, and media) can be interpreted as together comprising a complex phenomenon that provides oppor-
tunities for all participants to share in these experiences. Throughout we will investigate actual exam-
ples, taken from particular sports, chosen for their ability to illuminate different aspects of spiritual expe-
rience.
Format: lecture and discussion; possible field-trips. Requirements: two short papers, one final project,

PHIL 236(S) Contemporary Ethical Theory (W)
Moral life is filled with difficult decisions. For instance, is it ever appropriate to sacrifice the welfare of
an individual for the sake of the community, or does each individual have an inviolable status that must
be respected? Are some actions so morally objectionable that they must never be done, even to promote
very good ends? And how centrally should moral considerations figure in our personal decision-mak-
ing? Should they always take priority, even at the expense of our personal projects and intimate relation-
ships, or are there some spheres in which we should be free to pursue our goals without concern for
morality? Finally, should our moral regard extend only to our fellow rational beings, or should it reach to
non-human animals and the environment as well?
We will explore these and related questions by systematically comparing what the two dominant ethical
theories of the twentieth century, consequentialism and deontology, have had to say about them. While
both theories find their roots in earlier thinkers--consequentialism in Bentham and Mill, deontology in
Kant--our focus will be on contemporary developments of these views. After examining these two ap-
proaches in depth, we'll turn our attention to recently developed alternatives that attempt to transcend
the dichotomies that continue to divide consequentialist and deontological approaches. Readings will
include works by the following authors: Bentham, Mill, Nozick, Railton, Brink, Williams, Wolf, Taurek,
Rawls, Smart, Scheffler, Nagel, Kant, Kamm, Quinn, Kagan, Ross, Scanlon.

PHIL 237(S) What Does a Work of Art Mean?
According to myth, the Philosopher's Stone could turn iron into gold. According to this course, even
more amazing is that configurations of colored paint or sound waves or ink stains can be turned into art,
music, and literature. How is that a work of art can have a meaning? What does it mean for a work of art
to have a meaning? Must a work of art have a meaning? Is the meaning of art similar to, or different
from, the meaning of language?
We will examine works of visual art, such as Marcel Duchamp's L.H.O.O.Q., works of music, such as
Duke Ellington and Louis Armstrong's 1961 recording of "It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That
Swing)", and works of literature such as Vladimir Nabokov's Pale Fire. We will read such philosophers
as Gottlob Frege, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Arthur Danto, Nelson Goodman, and Catherine Elgin. Most of
the art we investigate and most of the philosophers we read will be from the twentieth and twenty-first
centuries.

PHIL 255(F) Knowledge and Happiness
Can you be genuinely happy even if you are mistaken about your deepest beliefs? It might seem so:
imagine that everything you believed turned out to be illusory. The association of happiness with knowl-
edge runs deep in the western philosophical tradition, reaching back at least to Socrates, and still reso-
nates with some of our strongest intuitions about what gives life meaning. At the same time, this Socratic
tradition has inspired a long and rich sceptical counter-tradition according to which human happiness
consists in relinquishing the attempt to acquire knowledge and instead making peace with the fact that
all we will ever know is how things appear to us. The sceptical tradition also appeals to some of our
deepest intuitions--about human fallibility and the tenuousness of our grasp of things of fundamental
importance. In this course we will study a range of philosophical and literary works from within both of
these traditions with the aim of enriching our own sense of the place of certainty, rational conviction and

PHIL 270(F) Arguing about God (Same as Religion 283)
"Faith is a fine invention," according to Emily Dickinson's poem, "when gentlemen can see; but micro-
scopes are prudent in an emergency." This course will see how far the microscopes of reason and logic
can carry us in traditional arguments about the existence and nature of God. We will closely analyze
classical arguments by Augustine, Avicenna, Aquinas, Anselm, Maimonides, Descartes, and others.
Pascal's wager is a different approach: it argues that even though proof of the existence of God is un-
available, you will maximize your expected utility by believing. We will examine the wager in its origi-
nal home of Pascal's Pensees, and look at William James' related article, "The Will to Believe." The
millennia old problem of whether human suffering is compatible with God's perfection is called "the
problem of evil". We will examine this issue in Hume's Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion, classic
sources and contemporary articles.
Students should be aware that, in the classic tradition, this class will resemble a logic course.

PHIL 272T(F) Free Will and Responsibility (W)
In both moral and legal decisions we hold people responsible for their deliberate actions. This practice
seems justified as long as people are free to make the choices that they do. But what criteria must a deci-
sion meet in order to qualify as free? Clearly, a free decision must not be the result of external coercion.
But must the decision also be free from any outside influence at all? If so then freedom may seem impos-
sible, for we are all deeply influenced by external factors ranging from the general laws of nature to
specific features of our genetic endowment and social environment, including religion, political ideolo-
gy, and advertising. These affect not only our particular choices but also, more fundamentally, who we
are and what we value.
Since it is undeniable that we are pervasively influenced by such outside forces, the question to ask is
whether, and how, free choice is possible amidst all of these influences. In this course we will examine
the best-known philosophical attempts to make sense of the nature of free will and responsibility. Since
these questions have a direct bearing on which theory of legal punishment we should accept, we will
spend the final few weeks of the course examining theories of legal desert and punishment. If there is
time, we may also look at some recent feminist work on the notion of autonomy.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: students meet with the instructor in pairs for roughly an hour each week;

PHIL 304T(S) Authenticity: From Rousseau to Poststructuralism (W)
The eighteenth-century aesthetician Edward Young once asked: "Born originals, how comes it to pass
we die copies?" In the same century, Jean-Jacques Rousseau answers this question about the origins of
authenticity by charting the individual's "fall" into society; that is, into artifice, hypocrisy, vanity, and
conformism. This tutorial begins with Rousseau's reflections on authentic individuality as they are de-
Philosophy
­ 250 ­
veloped in several of his works. We then trace the idea of authenticity (as an aesthetic and ethical catego-
ry) in both literary and philosophical texts associated with romanticism, existentialism, Marxian critical
theory, and the self-analysis of the psychoanalytic tradition (e.g. Stendhal, Nietzsche, Marx, Oscar
Wilde, Joseph Conrad, Gide, Heidegger, and Freud). We conclude with recent challenges to the coher-
ence, viability, and value of the ideal of authenticity as it applies not only to individuality, but also to
group identities and "artifacts" (e.g. Benjamin, Foucault, Derrida). Themes and questions investigated
include the following: (1) Must "authenticity" refer to some notion of an innate core or deep self? Are
there other terms in which we can imagine "being ourselves"?; (2) Can one adopt authenticity as a proj-
ect? Or, do analysis and reflection invariably defeat such a project?; (3) Does being authentic require that
one defy social conventions in favor of the "natural" or "instinctual"? Is it compatible with adopting
conventional roles or forms of selfhood, with belonging to a community, with being "civilized" or with
an artful self-styling?; (4) What impact do the rise of bourgeois society, the machine age, consumerism,
and mass media have on the possibilities for authenticity?; (5) Is the voice and style of authenticity nec-
essarily simple, direct, and sincere? For example, what truth if any can be found in Oscar Wilde's re-
mark: "Man is least himself when he talks in his own person. Give him a mask and he will tell you the
truth"?; (6) Are particular versions of the ideal of authenticity either gender- or racially-inflected?
Students will work with partners. Each student will write and present orally an essay of 5-6 pages every

critiques of their partner's essay. Evaluation will be based on written work, oral presentation of essays,

Anglo-American feminist appropriations of the work of French poststructuralist Michel Foucault have
resulted in pathbreaking and provocative social and cultural criticism. Original analyses of anorexia ner-
vosa, masculinity and femininity, sexual desire and identity, and rape law have been developed from this
collaboration. Of course, the feminist reception of Foucault has not been uncritical. Many have argued
that Foucault's analysis of power and subjection is nihilistic, normatively confused, and pessimistic.
Others point to the gender-blind nature of his inquiries and to the allegedly masculinist features of his
emphasis on pleasure and power and his later turn to a virile Greek ethics. This course begins with a brief
introduction to some of Foucault's early writings but focuses on a close reading of middle and late texts
that have become central to feminist debates about the significance of his work; i.e., Discipline and Pun-
ish, The History of Sexuality (Vols. I-III), Herculine Barbin, and selected interviews and lectures. We
examine debates about Foucault as well as uses of his critical and genealogical tools in an effort to assess
the value of his work for emancipatory politics.

PHIL 341(F) Kierkegaard's Ironic Socrates
Irony is classically defined as saying the opposite of what you mean. But what if your whole outlook on
life was ironic such that when you appeared earnest you were actually joking and when you appeared to
be joking you were deadly serious? What would be the point of such a life and how would we ever tell if
we had a full-blown ironist in our midst? The Danish philosopher Soren Kierkegaard's first major work,
The Concept of Irony with Continual Reference to Socrates, develops the radical thesis that the ancient
Greek philosopher Socrates was just such an ironist, someone who consistently maintained an ironic
standpoint towards his fellow citizens and everything that made up Athenian society. In the process of
arguing for this view, Kierkegaard takes his readers on a whirlwind tour of the main classical texts about
Socrates (by Xenophon, Plato, and Aristophanes), offers up some searching reflections about the nature
of irony more generally, and sets himself against Hegel's reading of Socrates while joining Hegel in his
criticism of the German romantics and the modern manifestation of irony. To make matters more com-
Philosophy
­ 251 ­
plicated, anumber of recent scholars have argued that Kierkegaard's work about irony is itself thorough-
ly ironic. Is this a book that defends a serious philosophical thesis or a work designed to reduce the entire
philosophical enterprise to rubble? Our aim in this course will be to give this very unusual, arguably
profound meditation on Socrates and the nature of irony a thorough and searching examination.

"In this work [...] I would like to defend the glorious City of God [...] The work is long and difficult, 'but

which he examines an entire spectrum of philosophical issues: ethics, philosophy of religion, metaphys-
ics, political philosophy and the philosophy of history. In this tutorial we shall read the City of God from
beginning to end and discuss the philosophical concerns it raises, including the problems concerning
free will and determination, theodicy and evil, and the foundations of justice. The text will also be dis-
cussed historically in order better to understand both Augustine's debts to his philosophical predecessors
such as Plato and later thinkers' (e.g., Descartes') debts to Augustine. All reading will be in English, and
no knowledge of Latin is required.
Format: tutorial. Students will work in pairs.
Requirements: Each participant will write and present one 5- to 7-page paper every other week and com-
pose and present comments on the partner's paper in alternate weeks. Grades will be based on the quality
of both the written work and the oral presentations and critiques.
Prerequisites: any one of the following: Philosophy 101, Philosophy 102, Religion 101 or permission of
the instructor. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 6-10).

PHIL 388T(F) Consciousness (W)
The nature of consciousness remains a fundamental mystery of the universe. Our internal, felt experi-
ence--what chocolate tastes like to oneself, what it is like to see the color red, or, more broadly, what it is
like to have a first person, waking perspective at all--resists explanation in any terms other than the
conscious experience itself in spite of centuries of intense effort by philosophers and, more recently, by
scientists. As a result, some prominent researchers propose that the existence of consciousness requires a
revision of basic physics, while others (seemingly desperately) deny that consciousness exists at all.
Those positions remain extreme, but the challenge that consciousness poses is dramatic. It is at the same
time the most intimately known fact of our humanity and science's most elusive puzzle.
In this tutorial we will read the contemporary literature on consciousness. We will concentrate both on
making precise the philosophical problem(s) of consciousness and on understanding the role of the rele-
vant neuroscientific and cognitive research. Tutorial partners will have an opportunity to spend the end
of the semester working on a special topic of their choosing including, for instance, consciousness and
freewill, consciousness and artificial intelligence, disorders of consciousness, or the scientific reduction
of mind to brain. The syllabus can be found at:
http://www.williams.edu/philosophy/fourth_layer/faculty_pages/jcruz/courses/consciousness.html
Format: tutorial. Requirements: Participants will present substantial written work in the tutorial every
other week, and will be responsible for commenting on their tutorial partner's work on off weeks. Ex-
pect several short lectures by the instructor over the course of the semester where all the tutorial mem-
bers convene. Prerequisites: Philosophy 102 and at least one upper-level course in philosophy. Prefer-
ence will be given to majors in philosophy or neuroscience, or concentrators in cognitive science. Open
to sophomores with permission of the instructor. Every effort will be made to pair students according to
similar or complimentary background. This course is writing intensive. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected:

Philosophy, Physical Education

PHIL 389(F) Being and Structure
Many of the most prominent "continental" philosophers of the past two centuries, including Hegel,
Schopenhauer, and Heidegger, have attempted to develop defensible "big-picture" (comprehensive or
systematic) accounts of what there is (including, broadly, both thinking and being, subject and object,
etc.). The "analytic" counterparts of these thinkers have generally focused on particular areas or prob-
lems rather than on the whole, but have worked hard to treat those areas and problems with clarity and
precision--features often scarcely detectable in the "continental" accounts. Currently, however, co-au-
thors Lorenz Puntel of Munich and Alan White of Williams--the instructor for this course--are com-
pleting a book Being and Structure: Framework for a Systematic Philosophy that attempts to retain the
virtues of each of these modes of philosophizing: the scope of the continental with the intelligibility of
the analytic. In addition to developing a novel ontology, the book attempts to establish that scientism is
philosophically untenable, that human beings are free, and that a being not indefensibly termed "God"
exists.
The texts for this course will be drawn from the English version of this work, whose publication is
planned to coincide with that of a German counterpart. Students in the course will have the opportunity
not only of examining what the authors view as an ambitious new contribution to philosophical litera-
ture, but of helping to fine-tune the work as it progresses. Co-author Puntel will be accessible to the
seminar via e-mail, and will meet with the seminar in late October.
Requirements: attendance, preparation, participation; regular short writing assignments and/or class
presentations; a term paper (10-15 pages)
Prerequisite: Philosophy 102 or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 5-10). Prefer-
ence to Philosophy majors.

PHIL 401(F) Senior Seminar: Rationality
Rationality is essential to modern self-understanding: we define ourselves, in no small part, by our ca-
pacity to offer and evaluate reasons in support of our theoretical and practical commitments. Conse-
quently, we are unwilling to accept the validity of either knowledge claims or social institutions that are
not rationally justified. There is, however, sharp disagreement among philosophers about the criteria of
rationality. The promise of modernity, therefore, cannot be assessed without an adjudication of the phil-
osophical disagreement about the nature of reason. In this course we will examine and evaluate some of
the most important historical and contemporary accounts of rationality.
The seminar will give senior majors the opportunity to meet several of the authors whose work we will
be discussing. Students will be responsible for presentations on the assigned readings, and for the devel-
opment of a final paper involving independent research.
Format: seminar. Requirements: several short assignments, final paper, attendance and participation.

The instructional Physical Education Program at Williams is an integral part of the student's total
educational experience. As a part of the liberal arts concept, the program develops the mind-body
relationship, which is dependent upon the proper integration of physical and intellectual capacities.
The main objective of the physical education program is to develop in each student an appreciation of
physical fitness and wellness, and to expose them to a variety of activities that are suitable for lifetime
participation.
Physical Education, Physics

Four credits of physical education represent one of the requirements for the College degree. There
are five physical education units during the year. In the fall semester, there are two six-week physical
education quarters. Winter Study is another unit, and there are two physical education quarters in the
spring semester. Four sections meet two times per week in seventy-five minute periods and two sec-
tions meet three times per week in fifty-minute periods.
The following courses are offered at various times during the year. A schedule listing all courses

What is light? How does a transistor work? What is a black hole? Why are metals shiny? What is
wave/particle duality? There are people for whom questions like these are of more than passing inter-
est; some of them become Physics or Astrophysics majors. A physics student experiments with the
phenomena by which the physical world is known and explores the mathematical techniques and
theories that make sense of it. A Physics or Astrophysics major serves as preparation for further work
in physics, astrophysics, applied physics, other sciences, engineering, medical research, science
teaching and writing, and other careers involving insight into the fundamental principles of nature.
ASTROPHYSICS MAJOR
The Physics Department, in cooperation with the Astronomy Department, offers a major in astro-
physics consisting of (at least): 6 or 7 courses in Physics, 3 or 4 in Astronomy, and 1 in Mathematics.
The core sequence of the Astrophysics major is the same as the Physics major described below (ex-
cept that Physics 302, although strongly recommended, is not required). Students intending to pursue
graduate study in astrophysics will need to take upper-level physics electives beyond the basic re-
quirements for the major. Honors work in Astrophysics may be in either physics or astronomy. Stu-
dents majoring in Astrophysics are expected to consult early and often with faculty from both depart-
ments in determining their course selections. The detailed description of the Astrophysics major is
given under "Astronomy," along with a description of the Astronomy major also offered by that de-
partment (see page 86).
PHYSICS MAJOR
Introductory courses
Students considering a major in physics should take both physics and mathematics as first-year
students. A student normally begins with either Physics 131 or Physics 141:
Physics
­ 254 ­
1) Physics 131 Particles and Waves. This is designed as a first course in physics. It is suitable for
students who either have not had physics before or have had some physics but are not comfortable
solving "word problems" that require calculus.
2) Physics 141 Particles and Waves--Enriched. Students in this course should have solid back-
grounds in science and calculus, either from high school or college, including at least a year of high
school physics.
The Department of Mathematics will place students in the appropriate introductory calculus
course. The physics major sequence courses all make use of calculus at increasingly sophisticated
levels. Therefore, students considering a Physics major should continue their mathematical prepara-
tion without interruption through the introductory calculus sequence (Mathematics 103, 104, and 105
or 106). Students are encouraged to take Physics 210 as early as possible. Physics 210 is cross listed as
Mathematics 210 for the benefit of those students who wish to have the course listed with a MATH
prefix.
Advanced Placement
Students with unusually strong backgrounds in calculus and physics may place out of Physics 141
and either: 1) begin with the special seminar course Physics 151 in the fall (typically followed by
Physics 210 in the spring), or 2) begin with Physics 142 in the spring (possibly along with Physics
210). Students may take either 151 or 142 but not both. On rare occasions a student with an exception-
al background will be offered the option of enrolling in Physics 201.
Placement is based on AP scores, consultation with the department, and results of a placement
exam administered during First Days. The exam can also be taken later in the year by arrangement
with the department chair. The exam covers classical mechanics, basic wave phenomena, and in-
cludes some use of calculus techniques.
Requirements for the Major
A total of ten courses in physics and mathematics are required to complete the Physics major.
Students who place out of both Physics 141 and Physics 142 and begin their studies in Physics
201 are required to take a total of nine courses.
Required Physics Sequence Courses
Physics 141 Particles and Waves--Enriched
or Physics 131 Particles and Waves
Physics 142 Foundations of Modern Physics
or Physics 151 Seminar in Modern Physics
Physics 201 Electricity and Magnetism
Physics 202 Waves and Optics
Physics 210 Mathematical Methods for Scientists
Physics 301 Quantum Physics
Physics 302 Statistical Physics
Required Mathematics Course
Mathematics 105 Multivariable Calculus or Mathematics 106 Multivariable Calculus
Students entering with Advanced Placement in mathematics may obtain credit toward the major for
the equivalent Mathematics 105 or 106 taken elsewhere.
At least two more physics or other approved courses must be taken, bringing the total number of
courses for the major to ten.
Options
1) Mathematics 104 may be counted if taken at Williams
2) Mathematics 209 may substitute for Physics 210.
3) Astronomy 111 may count in place of Physics 141 if a student places out of 141 (see "advanced
placement" above).
4) An additional Astronomy or Astrophysics course above the introductory level that is acceptable for
the astrophysics major may be counted.
5) Two approved Division III courses above the introductory level may be substituted for one Physics
course. Approval is on an individual basis at the discretion of the department chair.
6) Honors work is in addition to completion of the basic major so Physics 493 and 494 do not count
towards the ten courses in the major.
Preparation for Advanced Study
Students who may wish to do graduate work in physics, astrophysics, or engineering should elect
courses in both physics and mathematics beyond the minimum major requirements. The first-year
graduate school curriculum in physics usually includes courses in quantum mechanics, electromag-
netic theory, and classical mechanics that presuppose intermediate level study of these subjects as an
undergraduate. Therefore, students planning graduate work in physics should elect all of the follow-
ing courses:
Physics
­ 255 ­
Physics 402T Applications of Quantum Mechanics
Physics 405T Electromagnetic Theory
Physics 411T Classical Mechanics
Advising
Both majors and non-majors are encouraged to consult with the department chair or course instruc-
tors about course selections or other matters.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN PHYSICS
The degree with honors in Physics will be awarded on the basis of a senior thesis presenting the
results of a substantial experimental or theoretical investigation carried out under the direction of a
faculty member in the department. There is no rigid grade point average required for admission to the
program or for the awarding of the degree with honors, but it is normally expected that honors students
will maintain at least a B average in physics and mathematics. Students will normally apply for admis-
sion to the program early in the spring of their junior year and during senior year these students will
normally elect Physics 493, W031, and 494 in addition to the usual requirements for the major. At the
end of winter study, the department will decide whether the student will be admitted to honors candi-
dacy. Both a written thesis and a colloquium presentation of the results are required. The degree with
honors will be awarded to those who meet these requirements with distinction. The degree withhigh-
est honors will be awarded to those who fulfill them with unusually high distinction.
Honors candidates will also be required to participate in departmental colloquium talks.
OPTIONS FOR NON-MAJORS
Many students want to take a self-contained and rigorous full-year survey of physics. For such stu-
dents, the most appropriate sequence will be either Physics 131 or Physics 141 followed by Physics
132, depending on the student's background in science and mathematics (see Introductory Courses
above). Either of these sequences satisfies the physics requirement for medical school.
The department also offers one semester courses designed for non-majors. This year there are three
such offerings: Physics 100, Physics 109, and Physics/Religion 342.
PHYS 100(S) Physics of Everyday Life (Q)
How do things work? What makes a car go or a bird fly? Why do microwaves heat food? How does a
CD player work? Why are diamonds hard and metals shiny? How do we see?
Science is all around us. From common objects to high technology, science is part of our everyday lives.
Amazingly, with a few powerful principles we can understand the materials that make up our world and
the rules that govern their behavior--that's physics.
In this course we will explore the world we know and the microscopic components from which it is
made, and we will extract from this exploration the central concepts underpinning contemporary phys-
ics. The mathematics used in the course will be basic algebra and trigonometry.
Format: lecture, three hours per week/home experiments. Evaluation will be based on weekly home-
work, a midterm, a project, and a final exam, all with a significant quantitative component.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 120 (expected: 75).

PHYS 109 Sound, Light, and Perception (Not offered 2004-2005) (Q)
(www.williams.edu/Registrar/catalog/depts/phys/phys109.html)
AALBERTS and MAJUMDER
PHYS 131(F) Particles and Waves (Q)
We focus first on the Newtonian mechanics of point particles: the relationship between velocity, accel-
eration, and position; the puzzle of circular motion; forces; Newton's laws; energy and momentum; and
gravitation. The historical context in which these ideas developed will be discussed. We then turn to the
basic properties of waves, such as interference and polarization, with emphasis on light waves. Finally,
we bring the two strands together with a brief discussion of the wave-particle duality of modern quan-
tum mechanics.
This course is intended for students who have not studied physics before or who have had some physics,
but are not comfortable solving "word problems" that require calculus. (Students with strong back-
grounds in the sciences are encouraged to consider taking Physics 141 instead.) Physics 131 can lead to
either Physics 132 (for students wanting a one-year survey of physics) or Physics 142 (for students con-
sidering a physics or astrophysics major).
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours every other week. Evaluation will be
based on weekly problem sets, hour tests, labs, and a final exam, all of which have a substantial quantita-
tive component.
Prerequisites: Mathematics 103. No enrollment limit (expected: 60).

PHYS 132(S) Electromagnetism and the Physics of Matter (Q)
This course is intended as the second half of a one-year survey of physics. In the first half of the semester
we will focus on electromagnetic phenomena. We will introduce the concept of electric and magnetic
Physics
­ 256 ­
fields, and study in detail the way in which electrical circuits and circuit elements work. The deep con-
nection between electric and magnetic phenomena is highlighted in a discussion of Faraday's Law of
Induction. In the second half of the semester, we introduce several of the most central topics in twentieth-
century physics. We will discuss Einstein's theory of special relativity as well as aspects of quantum
theory. We will end with a treatment of nuclear physics, radioactivity, and uses of radiation.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours every other week. Evaluation will be
based on weekly problem sets, labs, hour tests, and a final exam, all of which have a substantial quantita-

PHYS 141(F) Particles and Waves--Enriched (Q)
This course covers the same topics as Physics 131, but with a higher level of mathematical sophistica-
tion and more emphasis on waves. It is intended for students with solid backgrounds in the sciences,
either from high school or college, who feel comfortable solving "word problems" that require calculus.
Physics 141 can lead to either Physics 132 (for students wanting a one-year survey of physics) or Phys-
ics 142 (for students considering a physics or astrophysics major).
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours every other week/conference, one hour
every other week. Evaluation will be based on weekly problem sets, quizzes and hour tests, and labs, all
of which have a substantial quantitative component.
Prerequisites: high school physics and Mathematics 103 (or equivalent placement). No enrollment limit
(expected: 50).
Hour: 11:00-11:50 MWF Lab: 1-4 M,T,W TUCKER-SMITH
PHYS 142(S) Foundations of Modern Physics (Q)
The twentieth century has been an extremely productive and exciting time for physics. Special relativity
has extended physics into the realm of high speeds and high energies. Quantum mechanics has success-
fully described phenomena at small energies and small distance scales. Our understanding of atoms,
molecules, and solids has developed from a few revolutionary ideas into a sophisticated framework
which today supports technologies that were unimagined in 1900.
This course will introduce many important developments in physics, including special relativity, the
Bohr model of the atom, Schrodinger's wave mechanics in one dimension, the chemical bond, energy
bands in solids, and nuclear physics.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours every other week/conference, one hour
every other week. Evaluation will be based on weekly problem sets, labs, two hour tests, and a final
exam, all of which have a substantial quantitative component.
Prerequisites: Physics 141 and Mathematics 103, or equivalent; students may not take both Physics 142
and Physics 151. Physics 131 may substitute for Physics 141 with the permission of instructor. No en-
rollment limit (expected:50).
Hour: 11:00-11:50 MWF Lab: 1-4 M,T,W STRAIT
PHYS 151(F) Seminar in Modern Physics (Q)
Why does a hot coal glow red rather than blue or green or some other color? Remarkably, this simple
question could not be answered before the year 1900, because the answer depends on a radical assump-
tion introduced in that year by Max Planck. His work on thermal radiation marked the beginning of a
revolutionary era in the history of physics that culminated in a new framework for our understanding of
the physical world. The two pillars of this framework, quantum mechanics and relativity, together with
the ideas of statistical physics that allow us to apply quantum mechanics to macroscopic objects (such as
hot coals), constitute the core of this course. As we study this material, we will also be exploring the
process of research in physics, partly by doing some experiments of our own. We will discuss the inter-
action between experiment and theory, as well as the roles of simplicity, elegance and unity in the search
for explanations. This is a small seminar designed for first-year students who have placed out of Physics
141.
Format: lecture/discussion, three hours per week; laboratory, every other week. Evaluation will be based
on class participation, labs, weekly problem sets, an oral presentation, two hour-exams and a final exam,
all of which have a substantial quantitative component.
Prerequisites: placement by the department (see advanced placement above). Students may take either
Physics 142 or Physics 151 but not both. Enrollment limit: 20 (expected: 14).
Hour: 11:00-11:50 MWF Lab: 1-4 W WOOTTERS
PHYS 201(F) Electricity and Magnetism (Q)
In this course, we study electromagnetic phenomena and their mathematical description. Topics include
electromagnetic induction, alternating circuits, and the electromagnetic properties of matter. We also
introduce Maxwell's equations, which express in remarkably succinct form the essence of the theory.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on
Physics

weekly problem sets, labs, two hour tests, and a final exam, all of which have a substantial quantitative
component.
Prerequisites: Physics 142, Mathematics 105 or 106. No enrollment limit (expected:25).
Hour: 10:00-10:50 MWF Lab; 1-4 M,T STRAIT
PHYS 202(S) Waves and Optics (Q)
Wave motions are characteristic of almost every type of material, including strings, springs, water, and
solids. They also describe the behavior of electromagnetic fields and elemental matter. Despite these
diverse settings waves exhibit many common characteristics, so that the understanding of a few simple
systems can provide insight into a wide array of phenomena. In this course we begin with the study of
oscillations of simple systems with only a few degrees of freedom. We then move on to study transverse
and longitudinal waves in continuous media in order to gain a general description of wave behavior. The
rest of the course focuses on electromagnetic waves, and in particular on optical examples of wave phe-
nomena. In addition to well known optical effects such as interference and diffraction, we will study a
number of modern applications of optics such as short pulse lasers and optical communications.
Throughout the course mathematical methods useful for higher-level physics will be introduced.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on
weekly problem sets, labs, a midterm exam, and a final exam, all of which have a substantial quantitative
component.
Prerequisites: Physics 201, co-requisite Physics/Mathematics 210 or permission of instructor. No enroll-
ment limit (expected:25).
Hour: 10:00-10:50 MWF Lab: 1-4 T,W MAJUMDER
PHYS 210(S) Mathematical Methods for Scientists (Same as Mathematics 210) (Q)
This course covers a variety of mathematical methods used in the sciences, focusing particularly on the
solution of ordinary and partial differential equations. In addition to calling attention to certain special
equations that arise frequently in the study of waves and diffusion, we develop general techniques such
as looking for series solutions and, in the case of nonlinear equations, using phase portraits and lineariz-
ing around fixed points. We study some simple numerical techniques for solving differential equations.
A series of optional sessions in TrueBasic will be offered for students who do not already have a back-
ground in programming.
Format: lecture, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on weekly problem sets, a midterm
exam and a final exam, all of which have a substantial quantitative component.
Prerequisites: Mathematics 105 or 106 and familiarity with Newtonian mechanics at the level of Physics
131. No enrollment limit (expected: 20).
Hour: 9:55-11:10 TR WOOTTERS
PHYS 301(F) Quantum Physics (Q)
This course serves as a one-semester introduction to the history, formalism, and phenomenology of
quantum mechanics. We begin with a discussion of the historical origins of the quantum theory, and the
Schroedinger wave equation. The concepts of matter waves and wave-packets are introduced. Solutions
to one-dimensional problems will be treated prior to introducing the system which serves as a hallmark
of the success of quantum theory, the three-dimensional hydrogen atom. In the second half of the course,
we will develop the important connection between the underlying mathematical formalism and the
physical predictions of the quantum theory. We then go on to apply this knowledge to several important
problems within the realm of atomic and nuclear physics.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on
weekly problem sets, labs, a midterm exam, and final exam, all of which have a substantial quantitative
component.
Prerequisites: Physics 202 and Physics 210. No enrollment limit (expected:15).
Hour: 9:00-9:50 MWF Lab: 1-4 M,W MAJUMDER
PHYS 302(S) Statistical Physics (Q)
The natural world is built with many small components interacting in a simple but coordinated way.
With a statistical view, we may make sense of the cooperative phenomena which emerge.
For example, we can associate macroscopic thermodynamic properties with ensembles of microscopic
states. With calculations and simple numerical exercises we shall probe a wide variety of physical phe-
nomena: magnetism, gasses, heat engines, thermal radiation, electrons in solids, polymers, random
walks in fluids or in the stock market, and genomic information.
Format: lecture, three hours per week /computer laboratory, 1 1/4 hours per week. Evaluation will be
based on weekly problem sets, quizzes, labs and a final exam, all of which have a substantial quantitative

PHYS 316(S) Protecting Information: Applications of Abstract Algebra and Quantum Physics
(Same as Mathematics 316) (Q)
Living in the early decades of the information age, we find ourselves depending more and more on
codes that protect messages against either noise or eavesdropping. We begin this course by studying the
history of this subject, including, for example, the story of the enigma code from World War II. We then
examine some of the most important codes currently being used to protect information, including linear
codes, which in addition to being mathematically elegant are the most practical codes for error correc-
tion, and the RSA public key cryptographic scheme, popular nowadays for internet applications. Look-
ing ahead by a decade or more, we show how a "quantum computer" could crack any RSA code in short
order, and how quantum cryptographic devices will achieve security through the Heisenberg uncertainty
principle.
Evaluation will be based on homework sets and exams.
Prerequisites: Physics 210 or Mathematics 211 (possibly concurrent) or permission of the instructors.
(Students not satisfying the course prerequisites but who have completed Mathematics 209 or Mathe-
matics 251 are particularly encouraged to ask to be admitted.)

This course will explore a number of important topics in quantum mechanics such as perturbation theory
and the semiclassical interaction of atoms and radiation. Research or review articles from the physics
literature will be assigned to supplement standard texts and to help motivate discussion. Applications
and examples will be taken mostly from atomic physics with some discussion of precision measure-
ments and fundamental symmetries.
The class as a whole will meet once a week for 50 minutes to discuss questions on the reading. Each
student will also be assigned to a tutorial meeting with the instructor and one or two other students, at
which the students will take turns presenting solutions to assigned problems. Written solutions to se-
lected problems will be due a few days later.
Format: tutorial, 1&1/4 hours per week; lecture, one hour per week. Evaluation will be based on weekly
problem sets, tutorial participation, presentations, and a final exam or final project, all of which have a
substantial quantitative component.
Prerequisites: Physics 301. Enrollment limit: 20 (expected: 10).

ear oscillators, numerical solutions, approximation methods, the calculus of variations, the Lagrangian
and Hamiltonian reformulations of mechanics, rotating frames of reference (with emphasis on the im-
plications for physics on the Earth) and scattering cross sections. The carry over of ideas developed in
the context of classical mechanics into other areas of physics will be explored. The class as a whole will
meet once per week for an introductory lecture/discussion. A second tutorial meeting between the
instructor and a pair of students will be scheduled later in the week. Students will take turns working and
discussing problems at the chalkboard. Written solutions will be due later in the week.

The Political Economy major is designed to give students a grasp of the ways in which political and
economic forces interact in the shaping of public policy. The major includes substantial study of the
central analytical approaches in both political science and economics and seeks to surmount the
sometimes artificial barriers of specialization that may characterize either discipline taken by itself. In
the junior and senior years a conscious merging of the approaches in the two fields is undertaken in the
three required Political Economy courses. (These courses are designed by, and usually are taught
jointly by, political scientists and economists.) Political Economy 301 examines major writings in
political economy and analyzes economic liberalism and critiques of economic liberalism in the con-
text of current policy issues. Political Economy 401 examines interactions of political and economic
forces in contemporary international affairs. Political Economy 402 examines such interactions in se-
lected current public policy issues. Background for these senior courses is acquired through courses in
international economics, public finance, and domestic and international/comparative politics and
policy.
Students in Political Economy 402 visit Washington, D.C. Sunday night through Wednesday of the
first week of spring vacation to conduct interviews relating to their Political Economy 402 group pro-
jects. This is a course requirement.

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN POLITICAL ECONOMY
Due to the special demands of this interdisciplinary major, the only route to honors in Political
Economy is the thesis. Seniors may pursue the honors thesis course (Political Economy 493-W031)
during the fall semester and winter study period. The third course contributing to such an honors pro-
gram would normally be an elective in Political Science or Economics taken during the junior year.
This course, which may be one of the required electives, must be closely related, indeed must prepare
the ground for the honors thesis.
Juniors in the Political Economy major with at least a 3.5 GPA in the program may apply for the
honors thesis program by means of a written proposal submitted to the chair before spring registration.
Written guidelines for such proposals are available in the chair's office or on the program website. The
proposal should have been discussed with at least two faculty members, and at least one faculty advi-
sor from each discipline should be solicited by the student prior to submission of the proposal.
Final decisions about admission to the honors program will be made in early summer, when spring
grades become available.
To achieve the degree with honors in Political Economy, the thesis must be completed by the end of
winter study period and be judged of honors quality by a committee consisting of the two advisors and
a third reader. A thesis judged to be of particular distinction will qualify its author for the degree with
highest honors.
COURSE NUMBERING SYSTEM
The numbering system for courses offered and required in Political Economy is identical to the
system outlined on page 45.
POEC 301(F) Analytical Views of Political Economy (Same as Economics 301 and Political
Science 333)
This course explores the relationship between politics and economics by surveying influential works of
political economy. Its first part examines three major systems of thought in relation to the historical de-
velopment of capitalism in Western Europe: the classical liberalism of Adam Smith, Karl Marx's revolu-
tionary socialism, and the reformist ideas of John Stuart Mill, R. H. Tawney, and John Maynard Keynes.
The second part considers more recent writings that revise and critique liberalism from a variety of per-
spectives. The historical focus of the course permits you to appreciate the ongoing dialogue between
classical and contemporary views of political economy, while classroom discussion involves frequent
reference to current public policy issues.
Format: discussion/lecture. Requirements: eight 2-page papers and a final exam.
Prerequisites: one course in Economics andeitherPolitical Science 201or203or AP credit in American
Politics (or permission of instructor). Enrollment limit: 35 (expected: 32). Preference given to Political
Economy majors and sophomores intending a Political Economy major.
Required in the Political Economy major but open to non-majors.

Chair, Associate Professor CHERYL L. SHANKS
Professors: CRANE, C. JOHNSON, MACDONALD, MAHON, MARCUS, REINHARDT, A. WIL-
LINGHAM. Associate Professors: M. DEVEAUX, M. LYNCH, MCALLISTER, SHANKS. As-

Politics is most fundamentally about forging and maintaining community, about how we manage to
craft a common destiny guided by shared values. Communities need a way to reconcile conflicts of
interest among their members and to determine their group interest; they need to allocate power and to
determine its just uses. Power may be used wisely or foolishly, rightly or cruelly, but it is always there;
it cannot be wished away. Political science attends to the ways that social power is grasped, main-
tained, challenged, or justified. The contests over power and the values that it should be used to further
give politics its drama and pathos. For this reason, the effort to understand politics aims not only to
describe and explain, but also to improve political life.
The Political Science major is structured to allow students either to participate in the established
ways of studying politics or to develop their own foci. To this end, the department offers two routes to
completing the major, each requiring nine courses. We invite students either to organize their major
through the subfields that structure the discipline of political science (American politics, international
relations, political theory, and comparative politics), or to develop individual concentrations reflect-
ing their particular interests, regardless of subfields.
MAJOR
SUBFIELD CONCENTRATION ROUTE: Upon declaring a major, students choose a subfield
from American politics, international relations, political theory, and comparative politics. The sub-
field concentration draws at least four (4) of the nine courses from one subfield, and includes the ap-
propriate core course from 201-204, two electives at the 200 or 300 level of the student's choice and
the senior seminar (or an individual project) in the student's subfield. (A degree with honors in Politi-
cal Science requires two (2) additional courses which DO NOT count toward the nine (9) major re-
quirements.) With permission of the department chair, students may take a senior seminar in a differ-
ent subfield, providing the student takes a third elective in the subfield of concentration. In addition,
students must take courses in two subfields outside the subfield of concentration to satisfy the breadth
requirement (all courses at the 100 level and all methods courses also count toward the breadth re-
quirement).
INDIVIDUAL CONCENTRATION ROUTE: Alternatively, students may devise a concentration of
their own. In this event, the student prepares a curricular plan in consultation with a faculty advisor,
explaining the nature of the concentration and the courses the student will take. The individual con-
centration also requires nine (9) courses, with at least five (5) thematically linked courses constituting
the concentration. Of these five courses, four are electives at the 200 or 300 level, including one from
201-204, and one is a senior seminar or individual project. In addition, students pursuing an individual
concentration must take at least two other courses that illustrate breadth in political science. To com-
plete the requirement, the student has his or her choice of any two other courses within the Political
Science Department. The faculty advisor and the department chair must approve the student plan.

ADVISEMENT
When a student chooses to major in Political Science (usually at the end of the sophomore year), he
or she may register with any Political Science faculty member at the designated time and places. The
registering faculty member will ask for preferences for a permanent faculty advisor and will assist
undecided students in finding an advisor whose interests match theirs. In all cases students will be
paired by the end of their sophomore year with an advisor who will continue with them through gradu-
ation.
COURSE NUMBERING
The course numbering used by the Political Science Department reflects the format and specializa-
tion of a course more than its level of difficulty. The 100-level courses are designed to address ques-
tions of broad political interest. The courses are pitched both to those considering and not considering
political science as a major. The 200-level courses are divided between our core courses and our elec-
tives. The core courses, numbered between 201-204, serve as introductions both to the substance of
the politics and the subfields organizing the study of politics. The core courses, which were previously
numbered at the 100 level, are open to all students, including first-year students and non-majors. The
200-level elective courses provide general overviews of political processes, problems and philoso-
phies in a way generally accessible without prerequisites. 300-level courses are more specialized and
usually require prerequisites. 400-level courses are senior seminars offered for students in the major;
senior seminars also are open to juniors and to non-majors if space permits.
WINTER STUDY PROJECT
The department welcomes relevant WSP 99 proposals that can make important contributions to the
student's understanding of public affairs and politics. Majors, seniors, and students without previous
WSP 99 experience have preference.
THE JUNIOR YEAR ABROAD
A major in Political Science can be readily and usefully combined with study in a foreign country.
Normally, no more than one course taken per semester abroad in a program approved by the College
may be counted toward the requirements for a degree in Political Science.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE
The Political Science Department grants honors to candidates who, (1) complete the Senior Semi-
nar, (2) receive at least a grade of 3.50 on a Senior Thesis (493-W031-494), and (3) have a minimum
GPA of 3.5 in Political Science.
To become a candidate for honors the student must, (1) apply in the second semester of the junior
year, (2) submit a research proposal acceptable to the department's honors committee and for which
an appropriate advisor is available, and (3) have a minimum GPA of 3.5 in Political Science for the
first six semesters. (Political Science 493-W031-494 DO NOT count toward the total of nine required
of all majors.)
ADVANCED STUDY IN AMERICAN POLITICS
The Department of Political Science provides the opportunity for an unusually gifted student to
engage in an entire year's advanced research in American politics under singularly favorable condi-
tions. Supported by income derived from an endowment fund, the student, designated the Sentinels of
the Republic Scholar (after the name of the fund), receives a substantial research stipend to cover costs
associated with the proposed project.
This unique research course (Political Science 481-W033-482) is designed to encourage the pur-
suit of excellence among the most talented Williams students of Political Science. Admission to it is
awarded to the most distinguished candidate on the basis of demonstrated capacity for outstanding
work and of the project's promise for creative contributions to the understanding of American politics,
political institutions and thought.
PSCI 100(F) Asia and the World (Same as Asian Studies 201)*
Asia looms large in contemporary world politics: Japan is gradually assuming an expanded regional
national security role; The People's Republic of China is emerging as a multifaceted Great Power; India
is challenged by rising ethno-nationalism. This course will explore both the historical background and
current dynamics of political and economic issues in these three countries, drawing on themes of imperi-
alism, nationalism, and globalization. It is an introductory class and, therefore, no prior coursework in
political science or Asian studies is necessary.
Format: predominately lecture. Requirements: two short papers and a final exam.

What does it mean when someone says they're a Midwesterner? A Southerner? A New Englander? A
Texan? Are these meaningful categories when thinking about politics? Is there importance attached to
being an urban resident versus a suburbanite? What about a rural resident? What's the significance of
living in a border town? This course is an exploration of the politics of place. The country's politics have
Political Science
­ 263 ­
always been keyed, in important ways, to geography: representation in national government is defined
in terms of geographic areas; funds and resources from the national government are distributed unequal-
ly around the country; state and local governments, which have an influential role in our political system,
vary tremendously from one place to the next; and the country's history has been marked by the violence
of geographic conflicts as well as the acquisition of new territory. Much of our social and economic life
can also be understood in terms of geography. Patterns of settlement, immigration, slavery, agriculture,
education, religion, and cultural production have left and continue to leave different patterns of sediment
throughout the country; these patterns and their interactions form the bedrock of our politics. We will
spend the semester thinking about the significance of place in politics by exploring the ways that culture,
economy, and political institutions vary throughout the country. Topics covered will include urbaniza-
tion and urban politics, the development of the suburbs, regional differences, and the effects of global-
ization on local differences.
Format: seminar. Requirements: class participation, weekly 1-page reading responses, and three 5 to

PSCI 120(F) America and the World After September 11
The terrorist attacks of September 11 and the war in Afghanistan raised fundamental questions about the
past and future course of American foreign policy. While virtually no one defended the terrorist attacks,
many academics argued that the root causes of September 11th were supposedly to be found in the flaws
of the American approach to the world. In this view, America is an arrogant, unilateralist country that
ignores the views and perspectives of the rest of the world community, relies far too much on its over-
whelming military power, and often acts against its ideals and values by supporting repressive and un-
popular regimes. This course has three primary objectives. First, we will assess important critiques of
contemporary American foreign policy from both the left and right of the political spectrum. Second, we
will examine the historical and intellectual background of both supporters and critics of American for-
eign policy in the post Vietnam War era. Third, in the aftermath of September 11 we will attempt to
answer the most important question of all for any analysis of American foreign policy: What is to be
done? While current issues of American foreign policy will be addressed in this class, potential students
should note that its primary focus is not placed on the technical/military elements of combating terror-
ism.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: assignments will include weekly response papers, two 5- to

Begun as an experiment over 200 years ago, the American constitutional order has grown into a polity
that is simultaneously praised and condemned, critiqued and mythologized, modeled by others and re-
modeled itself. This course will introduce students to the dynamics and tensions that have animated the
American political order and that have nurtured conflicting assessments. Topics will include the primary
institutions of national government (Congress, the Presidency, and the Supreme Court) as well as the
politics of policy-making in the United States. We will study structures, processes, key events, and pri-
mary actors that have shaped American political development. In investigating these topics, we will ex-
plore questions such as these: How is power allocated? What produces political change? Is there is a
trade-off between democratic accountability and effective governance? How are tensions between liber-
ty and equality resolved? Do our institutions produce good policies, and how do we define what is good?
How are the politics of America different from the politics of other modern democracies?

PSCI 202(F,S) (formerly 120) World Politics: An Introduction to International Relations
International politics differs from domestic politics in the absence of centralized, legitimate institutions.
Anarchy characterizes the world of sovereign states--there is no world government, nor agreement that
one is desirable or even possible. This lack of a common authority means that any dispute among coun-
tries is up to the countries themselves to settle, by negotiating, appealing to shared norms, or using force.
For this reason, while international relations involves many of the same topics that consume domestic
politics--ethnic antagonisms, spending on aid, war, national identity, inequality, weapons manufacture,
finance, loans, pollution, migration--it shares few of the same processes for dealing with them. This
course covers problems central to international relations. It considers the importance that this radical
decentralization has for achieving values we hold, and examines processes that might undermine or sup-
port the anarchical system in which we live.
Format: fall semester is lecture, possible discussion sessions; spring semester is a "lecture" class and
requirements are two papers, a final exam, reading response papers, and class participation.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 40 per section (expected: 40 per section). This is an introductory

PSCI 203(F,S) Introduction to Political Theory
What is justice? What does it entail for individuals and communities? How can it be secured, socially
and politically? Who decides? On what basis? These questions have been controversial since their earli-
est formulations, and they remain controversial now. This course introduces the study of political theory
by exploring some of the key controversies. Drawing on both contemporary and classic theories, and
using practical examples from today's world, we will examine justice in relation to such themes as au-
thority, equality, democracy, power, oppression, liberalism, capitalism, bureaucracy, community, cultur-
al pluralism, and rights. Specific theorists will vary from year to year, but may include such thinkers as
Plato, Aristotle, Hobbes, Machiavelli, Locke, Rousseau, Marx, Mill, Nietzsche, Weber, Arendt, Rawls,
and Foucault.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: two (5-page) papers and a final exam.

PSCI 204(F,S) Introduction to Comparative Politics
People around the world are all like Americans--or at least they all want to be like Americans, right? Fat
chance! People in different countries not only have different resources, but also different values. The
very foundations of political life--ideas about belonging, the fair division of social roles, about family
and religion, authority, law-- are deeply bound up with culture and history. Comparative politics seeks
to account for the fantastic variety of political life around the globe. Why were there so many dictators in
Latin America? Does oil or diamond wealth always lead to corruption or dictatorship? Why is Canada
so darned peaceful? How come some revolutionary governments end up stable and powerful (the US,
Cuba) whereas others go berzerk and fall apart (France, Cambodia)? This class will ground students in
the fundamental conceptual categories used in comparative political analysis, including nationalism, the
state, political culture, institutionalism, religion and politics, constitutionalism, and political economy.
Format: discussion/lecture. Requirements: two papers and a final exam.

PSCI 207(F) Political Elections
Elections in American politics are dynamic events in which many different groups struggle to gain con-
trol of political institutions at the local, state, and federal levels. During the campaigns, candidates and
their supporters move across the land, appear on television, radio, and through the printed press. Simul-
taneously, various organizations and interest groups attempt to gain influence with the candidates and
with public opinion by raising money, making endorsements, running political appeals in the various
media, and supplying activists to work for the candidates they favor. This course explores the factors that
shape the outcome of political elections in America. Among the factors we will consider are: the state of
the economy, international events, the role of political parties at the state and national levels, the current
partisan balance, ideology, media, special interests, money, candidates, the "hot" issues of the moment
Political Science
­ 265 ­
and long enduring issues, campaign debates, media, and campaign polling and public opinion. We will
consider in detail the 2004 national elections both for Federal office (President, Senate and House) and
for State Offices (Governors, State legislators).
Format: lecture. Requirements: a midterm, a final, and a research paper.

In the U.S. work is often lauded as the means to achieve autonomy, independence, status and wealth.
The centrality of work for virtuous citizenship in the American political tradition has led to conflicts over
labor and paid employment. In this class we will examine political disputes about the nature, condition,
and rewards of work, including union organization and strikes, living wage campaigns, accommoda-
tions for those with disabilities, discrimination and fair labor practices, and workplace democracy.
Format: discussion/lecture. Requirements: class participation, three short papers (5 to 7 pages) and a

PSCI 216(F) (formerly 219) Constitutional Law I: Structures of Power
Constitutional Law I focuses on the legal and political regime established by the U.S. Constitution. We
concentrate on two themes at the core of American constitutionalism: (1) the respective powers of, and
interaction among, the federal government's three branches ("separation of powers"); and (2) the inter-
sections and boundaries of federal and state authority ("federalism"). Specific topics include the Su-
preme Court's power to overturn actions by political agents; Congress's authority to make laws govern-
ing matters not mentioned in the Constitution; Congress's power to strip the courts of authority to decide
certain issues; states' power to resist the decrees of federal courts; the president's emergency powers;
and war-making authority of both the president and Congress. Most of the reading consists of Supreme
Court opinions, but some reading and much discussion will address historical context. Recurring issues
include the extent to which the Court does and should heed the framers' intent; the extent to which the
Court does and should take into account public opinion and other political considerations; and the signif-
icance of John Marshall's famous but somewhat cryptic admonition: "we must never forget that it is a
constitution we are expounding."

PSCI 217(S) (formerly 216) Constitutional Law II: Rights
Constitutional Law II explores constraints imposed on governmental power by a system of civil rights.
Areas examined include equal protection, due process, freedom of speech and religion. Within these and
other broad doctrines, countless specific controversies arise. Those we address include abortion, same-
sex marriage, affirmative action, flag-burning, and the death penalty. Much of the reading consists of
Supreme Court cases, but we will also pay close attention to the broader context surrounding these cases.
A recurring question is the relevance of the Court's undemocratic nature. Should the Court see itself as a
tribune of the powerless, which must restrain the political branches or, alternatively, should it generally
defer to the people's elected representatives? A closely related question involves the extent to which the
Court should confine the rights it protects to those specifically listed in the Constitution. Finally, to what
extent do and should judges consult their moral or even political views, as opposed to undertaking a

PSCI 223(S) International Law
International law embodies the rules that govern the society of states. It spells out who can be a state and
how to become one, what states can do, what they cannot do, and who can punish transgressions; it also
determines the status of other actors, like international organizations, heads of state, refugees, transna-
tional religious institutions and multinational corporations. International law is like domestic law, with
one difference: the same group that makes the law enforces it. In other respects it is the same: it protects
the status quo, including the distribution of power among its members; it spells out legitimate and illegit-
imate ways of resolving conflicts of interest; it is biased toward the powerful; it tells its members how to
act to coordinate their interests and minimize direct conflict; some of it is laughable and purely aspira-
tional, some of it necessary for survival. And like domestic law, it is enforced only some of the time, and
then against the weak more than the strong. Yet law is still where we look first for justice. This course
will examine the historical bases of contemporary international law, its development since World War II
in the context of American hegemony, and current dilemmas in its practice. Students will study historical
materials as well as cases.

PSCI 225(S) International Security
What is security? While international security once primarily referred to military conflict and the threat
of nuclear war, today it often refers to the environment, the movement of peoples, biological and
chemical weapons, and other non-traditional sources of insecurity. This class examines a wide range of
conceptions and problems of international security, traditional and non-traditional, and considers the
prospects for cooperation to overcome these threats. It first asks whether the focus of security studies
should be individual human beings, states, the world as a whole, or something else. It then asks whether
security should be seen as primarily competitive, so that one's security can only be enhanced by
threatening the security of another, or primarily cooperative, so that one's security is best protected by
increasing the security of others. It also evaluates the various mechanisms by which states and non-state
actors can act to increase the security of individuals, groups, and the world, as well as the extent to which
they are likely to act in these ways.

mobile transnational corporations, international trade tribunals, global currency markets and natural
resources cartels than their masters. All of these developments have direct and far-reaching effects on
the power of states, the wealth of societies, and the life chances of billions of people around the world.
This course offers a broad introduction to the politics of global economic relations, emphasizing the
inherent and inseparable intertwining of politics and economics, power and wealth, the state and the
market. It begins with a short overview of liberal, economic Nationalist, Marxist and green theoretical
traditions (including Smith, Keynes, List, Marx, Polanyi and others) and a study of the emergence of the
contemporary global order. We will examine both global trade and global finance, along the way
focusing on important issues of current interest including free trade and the WTO, the spread of
transnational corporations, dollarization, international labor standards, and uneven development.

The dominant moral, political and social theoretical framework associated with the Enlightenment gen-

specifically, is markedly different from that of the Ancients. It is arguably the framework within which
most debate in the West still occurs. Yet while (or perhaps because) it constitutes something of a shared
horizon, the framework itself is often simply taken for granted. The project of this course will be to make
the parameters of much contemporary thought explicit by tracing the development of the tradition to
which we are in large part heir. Class will involve careful reading and critical discussion of works by
Hobbes, the Levellers, Locke, Rousseau, Kant, Hegel and Mill.

PSCI 236(S) Social Capital
`Social capital' refers to the distinctively human resources and social relations that characterize a given
polity. Social and political theorists since Pierre Bourdieu and Alexis de Tocqueville have advanced ar-
guments about the source and value of social capital and how it is best sustained and developed. Con-
temporary thinkers continue this discussion, arguing about whether and why civic engagement is impor-
tant, how civic spaces and civil society might be rejuvenated, and democracy `deepened.' This course
offers a critical exploration of the issues and questions that attend the idea of social capital. We begin by
looking at the origins of thinking about social capital, in the political theory of Bourdieu, de Tocqueville,
and Antonio Gramsci, and then turn to more recent debates about the value of social capital and a re-
newed civil society. We will read works by such thinkers such as Robert Putnam, Sidney Verba, Iris
Young, and Cass Sunstein, as well as writers associated with communitarianism and "third way" poli-
tics. Finally, we will critically interrogate the social capital thesis from the standpoint of questions about
gender and culture.

peninsula during this period. Rather than proceeding from a chronological narrative of historical devel-
opment, we will focus on dominant themes and significant episodes, events, and epochal ruptures that
have shaped the understanding of contemporary issues in the two Koreas as well as the way historians
have interpreted and understood the past. Themes such as the relationship between state and society,
nationalism and identity construction, capitalist development and modernization, democracy and au-
thoritarian rule, and gender relations will be explored through critical theoretical texts, historical and
literary texts, and films.

PSCI 245(S) Nationalism in East Asia (Same as Asian Studies 245 and History 318)*
The disintegration of the Soviet Union, violence in East Timor, conflict between North Korea and South
Korea and similar phenomena have signaled the continuing importance of nationalism and at the same
time the increasing instability of nations. What is a nation? Under what conditions is nationhood formed
and under what circumstances do nations collapse? Are national identities immutable and exclusive of
other forms of identification? Is, as Frantz Fanon once wrote, "Europe literally the creation of the Third
World?" This course will critically investigate the questions of nationalism and cultural identity as they
have arisen in East Asia. In the first part of the course, we will examine seminal theoretical texts --com-
ing from disciplines such as anthropology, history, literary studies, and philosophy --that have informed
our contemporary understanding of the nation and nationalism and attempt to arrive at a conceptual clar-
ification of the subject. The second part will focus on various nationalist projects as they have unfolded
across East Asia--Japan, China, and Korea. Through careful thematic comparisons of these cases, we
will explore the extent to which non -European nationalisms are modular or derivative; examine the
often fraught relationships between nation and state as well as gender and nation; and investigate the
ways in which modern nationalist projects provide new ways of synthesizing culture, power, and histo-
ry.

PSCI 252(S) Terrorism in Comparative Perspective
Many Americans may have learned about terrorism on September 11, 2001, but the phenomenon was
common in twentieth century politics and political discourse. Terrorism was practiced, defined, and de-
Political Science
­ 269 ­
bated over and over before the American government declared war on it. The debates, however, estab-
lished only that no single definition of terrorism has been agreed on.
The course is divided into two parts. First, it will consider rival definitions of terrorism, including those
developed by scholars and by states. We will try to identify the differences among the definitions, of
course, but we will focus more attention on the more interesting questions about why definitions clash
fundamentally and what is at stake politically and morally in the rival definitions. Second, the course
will look at three different settings in which terrorism--or accusations of terrorism--have featured
prominently. We will begin by looking at the conflict in Northern Ireland, to get a sense of who uses
"terrorism" and why, and what it means to characterize some violence as terrorism (as opposed, say, to
"political"). Next, we will consider state violence in South Africa during the apartheid era, to get the
issue of what is at stake in debates about whether state violence may or may not be characterized as
terrorism. Is there such a thing as "state terrorism"; what, if it exists, is it; and why does the question
matter? Finally, we will read about Al Qaeda, an organization that, quite unusually, does not recoil from
charges that it uses terrorism. Why has Al Qaeda adopted terrorism, how is its terrorism similar to and
different from that of other organizations, and what is the purpose of terrorism for Al Qaeda? By
comparing these three examples of "terrorist" violence, we will develop a better sense of the value of the
category of terrorism and a sharper sense of what is meant when violence is called terrorism.

PSCI 262(S) America and the Cold War
This course will examine the rise and fall of the Cold War. Our focus will be on four central issues. First,
why did America and the Soviet Union become bitter rivals shortly after the defeat of Nazi Germany?
Second, which side, if any, was primarily responsible for the length and intensity of the Cold War in
Europe? Third, how did the Cold War in Europe lead to events in other areas of the world, such as Cuba
and Vietnam? Finally, could the Cold War have been ended long before the collapse of the Soviet Union
in 1989. Political scientists and historians continue to argue vigorously about the answers to all these
questions. We will examine both traditional and revisionist explanations of the Cold War, as well as the
new findings that have emerged from the partial opening of Soviet and Eastern European archives. The
final section of the course will examine how scholarly interpretations of the Cold War continue to influ-
ence how policymakers approach contemporary issues in American foreign policy.

Iranian revolution, the domestic violence after canceled elections in Algeria, the violence as well as civil

society in Egypt, the electoral successes in Jordan, Lebanon and Yemen, the violent struggles against
Israel in Lebanon and Palestine, the politicization of Muslim immigrant communities in Europe and
America, the social arguments over women adopting the veil and Islamic education, theoretical debates
about the compatibility of Islam with democracy, the rise of new media forms, and much, much more.
This course explores many of the difficult questions surrounding the rise of Islamic politics in a wide
range of political contexts. What is political Islam? Why, how, and to what extent has it succeeded?
What are its goals? Is it inherently violent, anti -Western, or hostile to modernity, as many claim, or is it
potentially progressive, democratic, and moderate? How have different states dealt with the challenge--
and does their repression explain the turn to violence? What is the meaning of jihad? How have other
Islamists responded to the violent terrorism of al -Qaeda? Can Islam and the West peacefully co -exist, or
is the war on terror leading towards an inexorable clash of civilizations?

PSCI 310(F) Political Psychology (Same as Psychology 345)
Political psychology studies the heart of politics. For example, many political philosophers begin their
political programs with foundational claims about "human nature." These claims are then used to sup-
port their vision of politics. Claims about progress presume that human nature will be improved with the
right political change. For example, the enlightenment held that rationality would be strengthened by
progress, and thereby make democracy more viable. Those who defend authoritarian regimes often do
so by proclaiming that the general public is incapable of self-rule and must accept rule by their betters.
Many of these arguments turn on how rational people are and their capacity and willingness to pursue
justice for all people. We explore what psychology tells us about people as political citizens and leaders.
Political psychology explores how people understand and act in and on the world around them. More
specifically, when people attend to politics and how people make political judgments. The course pays
special attention to the powerful, but surprising, roles that emotions play in all aspects of politics.

PSCI 314(S) American Political Development (W)
From the Founding to the present, the American political order has been both remarkably stable and

is the nature of the stability? What accounts for change in American politics? How much and what kind
of change is possible? What does the stability and change of the past have to teach us about the present?
The goal of this course is to develop an understanding of both the fabric of the country's continuity as
well as the impulses behind its transformative sequences. We will be concerned with large-scale devel-
opments (and/or lack of) in the state and its relation to society and economy. We will look at explanations
for the country's stability, such as liberalism and American exceptionalism, as well as critiques of these
concepts. We will discuss the building (and dismantling?) of the American state, its major policy pro-
grams, and its relation to its citizens. We will also consider how issues of class, race, and gender alter our

policy making, or improve on it somehow? What would "politics as unusual" look like anyway? This
class examines the policy making process in the United States: How do issues get defined as problems
worthy of government attention? What kinds of alternatives are considered as solutions to these prob-
lems? Why do we end up with some policies but not others? Do certain kinds of processes yield better
policies than others? How do we decide what constitutes a good policy?

This course examines a key example of struggle over government policy after it becomes law. We inves-

the letter of the law. The major focus of the course is the U.S. Voting Rights Movement, a product of the
Voting Rights Act of 1965, and one prime illustration of the debate over a policy consensus in the con-
text of fragmentation represented by federalism, separation of powers, and racial and ethnic diversity in
the polity. The course selects from a range of contemporary policy areas for comparison including abor-
tion rights, environmental protection, educational equity, immigration, regulation of business, and pub-
lic support for the arts.

PSCI 328(F) The International Politics of Oil (W)
Since the early 1900s oil has grown increasingly important to economic growth, military power, and
political influence. This course will explore why oil became central to both state power and economic
growth by examining how control over oil resources and markets has been used by states and corpora-
tions to achieve their often divergent objectives (e.g., states-alliance maintenance, companies-cartel
maintenance/source country pliancy). Among the contending actors seeking to establish order over oil
resources (e.g., great powers, private oil companies, producing and demanding countries, and cartels
among companies or producing states), leading states' interests often appear to determine outcomes de-
spite periodic challenges from producing states. This course will examine how these struggles for order
and advantage amidst varying degrees of state and corporate competition have affected international
relations and the broader economic structure of the world economy. After reviewing the post-WWI
competition among rival great powers and leading oil companies for political autonomy and oil source
control, we will examine how producing countries paradoxically gained greater political leverage and
earning from their own oil resources in the 1960s and 1970s by binding themselves financially to the
leading great powers through reinvestment of their earnings with these states' banks. The final part of
this course will examine whether the world's existing oil-based economic and security relationships will
continue. We will explore the possibility of upsetting technological advances, rising great powers' de-
mands, the competition over new supply sources, and greater producing country leverage over the lead-
ing industrial states.

PSCI 329(F) Ethics and Interests in International Politics
People sometimes claim that we cannot or should not judge the effect that countries and individuals have
on outsiders in moral terms. Some argue that such standards are irrelevant because there cannot be a
morality without a community. Others contend that any ethical standard would be unrealistic because
the environment within which states operate is too uncertain to allow moral considerations. Yet every-
one-leaders and citizens, conservatives and progressives, the faithful and the secular-talks about duty,
and justice, and rights when they talk about international politics. We judge practices and laws in terms
of practicality and efficiency, but we also say that continuing sanctions against Cuba is right or wrong,
the American invasion of Iraq was just or unjust, Japan's export policies promote fair or unfair trade
practices, pharmaceutical companies have a duty to supply AIDS drugs in poor countries, or a right not
to do so. We expect private and public leaders to be honorable as well as cunning, to serve some public
good even if it is not one we ourselves would choose. This course maps the international ethical world
through a series of cases, including the decision to use the atomic bomb, wartime propaganda, economic
sanctions, child labor, epidemics, sex tourism, trade in toxic waste.
Format: discussion. Requirements: biweekly short papers, one 5-to 7- page paper, and one twenty-page

PSCI 330(S) Equality (W)
What does it mean to be "equal" in society today? Why has equality increasingly come to be seen as a
requirement of basic justice in liberal democracies? This course serves as an introduction to the subject
of equality and its importance to liberal and democratic political theory and practice. Some central ques-
tions posed in the course include: Is it is enough to be formally equal in the eyes of the law, or do people
require equal resources, opportunities and capacities in order to be truly "equal"? Can liberal democratic
states deliver on promises of justice and fairness in the absence of comprehensive social equality and
equitable economic distribution? Is it the state's role to foster such equality? The course disentangles
different forms of equality (such as economic, political, sexual, racial and cultural equality) and assesses
the merit of several concrete solutions to inequality, such as affirmative action and policies promoting
multiculturalism.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: class participation and presentations, two 6- to 8-page essays,

PSCI 331T(F) Non-Profit Organization and Community Change (W)
This tutorial is based on two converging realities: an evolving recognition of the vitality of private sector
supported community organization work; and the challenge now presented that such organizations may
have to assume a larger role due to reductions in public agency support and declining participation
among the poor and racial minorities. In the United States these agencies--essentially NGO's--played
important roles in communities and movements, often modeling the very programs adopted by the gov-
ernment. Some, like the Highlander Center, have near-mythical status in our memories about what it
means to struggle for social change; others, including HARYOU, were critical in structuring thought
about anti-poverty strategies; in recent years some like Teach for America have plunged into the thick of
the effort to keep public education a viable option. This tutorial will examine the role of non-profits and
social justice work in the United States focusing on the non-profit as a type, governance and staffing,
fund-raising and persecution. The tutorial will examine research and writing on the non-profit in U.S.
social justice advocacy as well as focus on specific cases.

PSCI 334(S) Aristotle and Contemporary Political Thought
Aristotle defended the "natural" enslavement of non-Greeks, thought that women were less rational than
men and was opposed to rule by working people. At the same time, he set out compelling accounts of
happiness, of political association, of what it means to act well and of inquiry itself. What are we to make
of this? In this course we will reflect upon the work of contemporary neo-Aristotelian thinkers - people
who argue that there are important things to be learned from Aristotle, even for those with progressive
politics. Our task will be to understand and assess the kinds of challenges that such thinkers pose to con-
temporary liberalism (a position in the history of Western political thought that is endorsed by
most--though not all--American Republicans and Democrats alike) and to liberal capitalist society.
Past exposure to ancient political thought will be helpful, but is not a requirement of the course.
Format: seminar/discussion with lectures as needed.

PSCI 335(S) Public Sphere/Public Space (W)
Throughout the modern era, political thinkers have argued that a free and democratic society needs a
vital "public sphere." That argument has taken on renewed significance in today's intellectual debates.
This seminar looks briefly at the evolution of the argument, but concentrates on its relevance to contem-
porary politics. Our investigations will center on the character and meaning of public space. We will
look at space both as a key metaphor in political theory and as a medium of everyday practical struggle:
that is, we will examine not only some of the most influential conceptions of public life, but also the
political economies of cities, how groups carve out "turf" through street-level negotiations, and the ways
in which politics shapes and is shaped by the design and use of the built environment. Our main focus
will be on the following topics: the relationship between ideas of citizenship and models of the public;
the racing, gendering, and class-stratification of spaces (civic, residential, commercial, etc.); urbanity
and suburbanization; the kinds of spaces and politics opened and closed by the internet and contempo-
rary mass media; the effects of contemporary processes of globalization on political identity and demo-
cratic practices. Likely authors include Arendt, Berman, Davis, Delany, Foucault, Fraser, Gamson, Hab-
ermas, Hall, Harvey, Holston, Sennett, Sunstein, Warner, Virilio.
Format: discussion. Requirements: three 6-page papers, regular class participation, and one group exer-

PSCI 345(S) Cosmology and Rulership in Ancient Chinese Political Thought (W)*
This class will involve students in close reading of, and exegetical writing about, core texts of ancient
Chinese political thought. The purpose is to gain an understanding of a number of different perspectives
on politics and leadership, especially Confucianism, Legalism and Taoism. While the primary focus will
be on the meaning of the texts in the context of their own times, contemporary applications of core con-
cepts will also be considered.
The class will begin with background reading from Benjamin Schwartz's text, The World of Thought in
Ancient China. Then the class will read significant portions of the following canonical works: The Clas-
sic of Change (Yi Jing); The Analects of Confucius (Lun Yu); Lao Zi's Classic of the Way and Integrity
(Dao De Jing); Sun Zi's Art of War (Bing Fa); the Writings of Han Fei Zi.

The futures of Mexico and the United States are now bound up more closely than ever. Yet Mexico
enters this future with a very different past and a distinctive political system. The first half of this course
is historical, concentrating on the slow emergence of the national state and a national consciousness.
Along the way we delve into Mexican art, cuisine, religious expression, music, literature, and especially
film. The second half considers the fitful and uneven emergence of a new political order in Mexico,
beginning with an examination of why the long-dominant PRI regime has been falling apart. It then
looks at new developments in several areas: migration and US immigration policy; the border; the role
of the state; and finally, the Chiapas rebellion and indigenous autonomy. We end the course by returning
to some of the issues of the first half, asking what it means to be both Mexican and "modern," what it
feels like to live in "Amexica," and what kind of politics we might expect to arise there.
Format:lecture/discussion. Requirements: a map quiz, a medium-length midterm paper, and either a

PSCI 362T(F) George Kennan and the Dilemmas of American Foreign Policy
As a grand strategist and historian, George Kennan has always criticized American foreign policy for its
inconsistencies and contradictions. Most historians, however, have generally viewed Kennan as an in-
tellectual whose own work is characterized by exactly those flaws. It is not hard to see why Kennan
represents such a puzzle to historians. Kennan rose to prominence as a conservative and hostile critic of
the Soviet Union, but for most of the Cold War he argued against hostile policies towards the Soviet
Union. Kennan authored the doctrine of containment in the late 1940's, but he has spent most of the last
fifty years denouncing the very policies usually justified in the name of containment. Has Kennan been
misunderstood by both policymakers and historians, or is it the case that Kennan's own philosophy of
American foreign policy is either incoherent or contradictory? This tutorial will examine Kennan's work
as both a grand strategist and historian of American foreign policy. First, we will examine Kennan's own
writings and the foreign policy doctrines he developed over the course of the 1930's and 1940's. Second,
we will examine Kennan's very influential contributions to the writing of the history of American for-
eign policy. Third, this tutorial will examine how professional historians continue to grapple with the
intellectual puzzles posed by George Kennan and the ongoing efforts to situate his contributions to the
history of American foreign policy.
Format: tutorial. Students will be expected to write and present orally an essay of approximately seven
pages every other week on an assigned topic. Students not presenting will have the important responsi-
bility of critically evaluating the work of their colleague. We will also meet periodically as a group to
discuss selected topics.

PSCI 410(S) Senior Seminar in American Politics
This seminar will focus on the state of American democracy early in its third century. Two elements
provide a basis for judging the state of American politics: first, we begin with a comparison of politics at
the founding of the Republic with the state of politics in our own time; second, each seminar participant
will engage in research on a particular aspect of American politics. Among the topics that will be consid-
ered are: the competing conceptions of democracy; the appropriate roles of the various institutions of
politics (the press, political parties, local, state, and national politics); and, the social and economic sys-
tems and their diverse effects. The seminar will also consider how the American political system has
changed and whether it has changed for the better and/or worse. Has the increasing diversity of the
American population, the growth of imperial assertiveness, the impact of the world economy on Ameri-
ca (and of the American economy on the world), the pace of technological change, among other modern
features, made democratic politics more or less possible?

PSCI 420(S) Senior Seminar in International Relations: Culture, Identity and Power
Mainstream realist and liberal international relations theory has long focused on issues of power, ratio-
nality, and material self-interest. September 11 fundamentally challenged these theories. International
relations theory had little to say about the powerful forces of religious identity and ideological grievance
which motivated al Qaeda. The rise of anti-American sentiment around the world, along with American
visions of reshaping the world in its own image, seemed to fundamentally challenge the core assump-
tions of international relations theory. Rather than a world of nation-states struggling for self-interest,
many now saw the world as one of clashing civilizations struggling for cultural identity, or as one driven
by the pressures of the spread of American power and culture through globalization.
Culture and identity, rather than power or wealth, seem to have moved to the center of world politics.
Unlike realism and liberalism, the constructivist school of thought had long emphasized the power of
ideas and culture. This course explores these constructivist international relations theories to make sense
of the rising importance of culture, ideas, and identity in world affairs.
Format: seminar. Requirements: class participation, weekly assignments, and a research paper.

This seminar will critically examine whether or not the recent war on terrorism has fundamentally al-

ceed in two parts. First, we will read about globalization. We will not read everything there is to read
about globalization; nor will we attempt to survey all theoretical perspectives on globalization. Rather,
we will plumb a particular line of thought, drawn mostly from neo-Marxists writers, to familiarize our-
selves with some of the major issues. The second part of the course will center on individual student
research projects. Each student will choose some facet of the recent war on terrorism (e.g., whether it is a
"war" or not; how "terrorism" is defined; how it has affected the movement of goods and people around
the world; whether it has had important cultural effects; etc.) and, throughout the entire semester will
comb journalistic and academic sources for information.
Format: seminar. Requirements: a 5-page paper on one of the books we read together, a presentation to
the class on the topic of his or her research, and a 20-page research paper engaging the question of how
that particular aspect of the war on terrorism has influenced larger processes of globalization.

PSCI 420(F) Senior Seminar in International Relations: American Hegemony and the Future
of the International System
Since the time of Thucydides, world politics has always been a story of several great powers competing
for power, wealth, and security. The collapse and dissolution of the Soviet Union, however, left the
United States in a position of dominance that has no parallel in history. This course examines how inter-
national relations theorists and American policymakers have grappled with the dilemmas and opportu-
nities of global hegemony since 1989, with a particular focus on the challenges that have emerged in the
aftermath of September 11. Will other powers, such as China or a united Europe, inevitably challenge
American dominance? Should America actively seek to promote its ideas and values throughout the
world? Does a hegemon have unique and special responsibilities for advancing international justice?
What kind of grand strategy should the United States pursue, both now and in the future? Why does so
much of the world seem to resent American hegemony?

PSCI 430(F) Senior Seminar in Political Theory: Democracy and its Critics
This course focuses on several of the key political challenges directed at contemporary democratic
theory and practice. It has become commonplace to claim that liberal democratic states are insufficiently
democratic in their political processes and that they are neither as representative nor as inclusive of the
citizens they purport to represent. We will examine these and other criticisms of contemporary politics as
well as of the liberal and democratic political theories that underpin them. The course also provides an
opportunity to explore some democratic alternatives advanced by proponents of such approaches as de-
liberative democracy, associative democracy, multicultural or pluralist democracy, and republicanism.
Among the authors we will read are Seyla Benhabib, James Bohman, Joseph Carens, Robert Dahl, John

PSYC 272(S) Psychology of Education
This course introduces students to a broad range of theories and research on education. What models of
teaching work best, and for what purposes? How do we measure the success of various education prac-
tices? What is the best way to describe the psychology processes by which children gain information and
expertise? What accounts for individual differences in learning, and how do teachers (and schools) ad-
dress these individual needs? How do social and economic factors shape teaching practices and the edu-
cational experiences of individual students? The course will draw from a wide range of literature (re-
search, theory, and first hand accounts) to consider key questions in the psychology of education. Upon
completion of the course, students should be familiar with central issues in pre-college education and
know how educational research and the practice of teaching affect one another.

In all animals, hormones are essential for the coordination of basic functions such as development and
reproduction. This course studies the dynamic relationship between hormones and behavior. We review
the mechanisms by which hormones act in the nervous system. We also investigate the complex interac-
tions between hormones and behavior. Specific topics to be examined include: sexual differentiation;
reproductive and parental behaviors; stress; aggression; and learning and memory. Students critically
review data from both human and animal studies. All students will design and conduct an empirical
research project.
Format: Empirical Lab Course. Requirements: presentations and participation in discussions, midterm

Diagnosing and treating neurological diseases is the final frontier of medicine. Recent advances in neu-
roscience have had a profound impact on the understanding of diseases that affect cognition, behavior,
and emotion. This course provides an in-depth analysis of the relationship between brain dysfunction
and disease state. We will focus on neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease, Parkin-
son's disease, and Huntington's disease. We will consider diagnosis of disease, treatment strategies, as
well as social and ethical issues. The course provides students with the opportunity to present material
based upon: (1) review of published literature, (2) analysis of case histories, and (3) observations of
diagnosis and treatment of patients both live and on videotape. All students will design and conduct an
empirical research project.

PSYC 317T(F) Nature versus Nurture: Controversies in Developmental Psychobiology
Do your genes determine who you are? This course examines the relative contributions of nature (genet-
ics) and nurture (the environment) to the development of behaviors such as eating, stress response,
Psychology
­ 280 ­
learning, play, aggression, parenting, alcoholism and addiction. Modern neuroscience techniques, such
as brain imaging, "knock-out" mice, and quantitative trait loci mapping, report extraordinary new rela-
tionships between genes and behavior. In contrast to these findings are equally exciting studies on the
critical effects of the pre- and postnatal environment and social milieu which support environmental
theories of the development of behavior. This tutorial will explore the empirical and theoretical issues in
this controversy to arrive at a synthetic understanding of the interaction of genes and environment.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: Students will meet in pairs with the instructor for an hour each week.
Each week, students will either present an oral argument of a 5 page position paper or respond to their
partners' paper.

PSYC 322(S) Concepts: Mind, Brain, and Culture
How does conceptual knowledge differ across cultural groups? How do the categories of experts differ
from the categories of novices? Do children have the same kind of conceptual knowledge as adults?
How are categories represented in the brain? In this course, we will explore various empirical findings
from cognitive psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and anthropology that address these questions. In
doing so, we will consider how our conceptual knowledge is a function of our mind, brain, and culture.
All students will design and conduct an empirical research project.

PSYC 326(S) Decision-Making
Why does our ability to reason sometimes fail us? Why do we occasionally make choices that are bad for
us? We address these questions by surveying experimental approaches to understanding reasoning and
decision-making processes in human behavior, and by solving and analyzing problems that psycholo-
gists have used to investigate these processes. Class discussion focuses on cognitive theories of rational
and irrational thinking as well as behavioral theories of suboptimal choices. Topics include impulsive-
ness and self-control, the subjective values of short-term versus long-term rewards, addictions and bad
habits, probability judgments, gambling, and moral reasoning.

judgment, and behavior. Among the many questions we consider are: Why do we both overestimate the
extent to which others are like us and exaggerate our personal uniqueness? Why do we overestimate the
extent to which others notice us and pay attention to us? Why is it so difficult to accurately recall what
we used to think, and predict what we will think and do in the future? When we have a choice of
receiving information about ourselves that is accurate versus information that is flattering, which do we
choose--and why? Finally, we consider ways in which the self is conceived differently in non-Western
cultures.

color, and on the role of self-esteem in stereotyping and prejudice, and (2) interpersonal suspicion, in-
cluding an examination of factors that might reduce suspicion in interracial or cross-cultural dyads or
groups. Students will research and critically analyze and integrate the relevant literatures concerning
these topics, and will design and conduct original research to test empirically several hypotheses that
emerge from these literatures. We will examine a variety of types of research design and statistical tech-
niques.

MAJOR
The major in Religion is designed to perform two related functions: to expose the student to the
methods and issues involved in the study of religion as a universal phenomenon of psychological,
sociological, and cultural/historical dimensions; and to confront students with the beliefs, practices,
and values of specific religions through a study of particular religious traditions. It is a program that
affords each student an opportunity to fashion his/her own sequence of study within a prescribed basic
pattern constructed to ensure both coherence and variety. It consists of at least nine semester courses
as follows:
Required sequence courses
Religion 101 Introduction to Religion
Two seminars (courses numbered 200, 301-309)
Religion 402 Issues in the Study of Religion
Elective courses
Five additional courses in Religion are to be selected in such a way that at least one course is taken
in both the Western and non-Western traditions. Students will construct their sequence in consultation
with departmental advisors and subject to their approval. In order to achieve a deep coverage of a
particular religious tradition or set of related problems in the study of religion, students are urged to
select three electives that together have some kind of coherence, be it cultural, historical, or topical.
Related courses from other departments or programs may be included among the three courses, and
the point of coherence can be the subject of research papers in the senior seminar.
Students are advised to elect additional courses in related fields (e.g., psychology, sociology, an-
thropology, art, history, philosophy) in order to gain a clearer understanding of the social and cultural
contexts in which religions appear.
For those who wish to go beyond the formally-listed courses into a more intensive study of a partic-
ular religious tradition, methodological trend, or religious phenomenon (e.g., ritual, symbol-forma-
tion, mysticism, theology, etc.), there is the opportunity to undertake independent study or, with the
approval of the department, to pursue a thesis project.
The value of the major in Religion derives from its fostering of a critical appreciation of the com-
plex role religion plays in every society, even those that consider themselves non-religious. The major
makes one sensitive to the role religion plays in shaping the terms of cultural discourse, of social atti-
tudes and behavior, and of moral reflection. But it also discloses the ways in which religion and its
social effects represent the experience of individual persons and communities. In doing these things,
the major further provides one with interdisciplinary analytical tools and cross-cultural experience
and opens up new avenues for dealing with both the history of a society and culture and the relation-
ships between different societies and cultures. What one learns as a Religion major is therefore re-
markably applicable to a wide range of other fields of study or professions.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN RELIGION
The degree with honors in Religion requires the above-mentioned nine courses and the preparation
of a thesis of 75+ pages with a grade of B+ or better. A thesis may combine revised work done in other
courses with new material prepared while enrolled either in Religion 493-W031 or Religion
W031-494. Up to two-thirds of the work in the thesis may be such revised work, but at least one-third
must represent new work. The thesis must constitute a coherent whole either by its organizing theme
or by a focus on a particular religious tradition. Candidates will also be expected to present the results
of their thesis orally in a public presentation. Students who wish to be candidates for honors in
Religion will submit proposals and at least one paper that will be included in the thesis to the depart-
ment in the spring of their junior year. Students must have at least a 3.3 GPA in Religion to be consid-
ered for the honors program.
The chair will serve as advisor to non-majors.
REL 101(F,S) Introduction to Religion
As an examination of the structure and dynamics of certain aspects of religious thought, action, and sen-
sibility--employing psychological, sociological, anthropological, and philosophical modes of inqui-
ry--the course offers a general exposure to basic methodological issues in the study of religion, and
includes consideration of several cross-cultural types of religious expression in non-literate and literate
societies.

REL 200(S) Religion and the Modern World
It is impossible to comprehend the modern world without understanding the contribution of religion in
the process of modernization, the cultural condition of modernity and the artistic tradition of modernism.
This course is divided into three parts. We begin by exploring the gradual reconciliation of religion and
culture in leading post-Enlightenment thinkers like Kant, Hegel, Schleiermacher and select Romantic
poets. When art displaces religion as the expression of spiritual aspiration, the traditional transcendent
God gradually becomes identified with immanent social, cultural and psychological processes. Religion
comes to be understood as a human construction created to address specific needs and desires. In part
two, we consider pioneering theorists who establish the relation between religion and economics
(Marx), biology (Darwin), society (Durkheim) and psychology (Freud and Nietzsche). The work of
these theorists frames the questions that the current study of religion is designed to answer. A study of
the intricate relationship between modernization and secularization draws together the first two parts of
the course and prepares the way for a consideration of the return of the religious in post-modern society
and culture (Heidegger, Berger). While originally defined as a movement in architecture and art, post-
modernism emerged during the last half of the twentieth century as a new social and cultural condition.
Rapid technological changes and the economic and social transformations they brought created uncer-
tainties and instabilities, which had unexpected consequences. Far from inevitably leading to secular-
ism, modernization created the conditions for the return of religion in a variety of guises. The course
concludes with a consideration of alternative postmodernisms and their corresponding religious expres-
sions in the work of Venturi, Lyotard, Baudrillard, LaHaye and Derrida.
Requirements: midterm and final papers.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 30 (expected : 30). Preference given to first-years and sophomores.

REL 203(S) Introduction to Judaism (Same as Jewish Studies 101)
This course offers students a critical introduction to issues within Jewish studies and the study of Jews,
Judaism and Jewishness. Who are Jews and how have these designations shifted and changed over
time? What is Judaism? How and in what ways is it a religion? What role do texts and practices play in
defining Judaism? How are these works Jewish cultural and/or Jewish religious expressions? What are
some of the other forms in which Jewishness has been and continues to be expressed? The course asks
these questions in order to both build on the legacy of how Judaism has been studied within the academ-
ic field of religious studies and to challenge some of these long held assumptions. In other words, the
course both appreciates and challenges this scholarly legacy by offering students religious studies, Jew-
ish studies and literary critical tools to better appreciate Jewish texts and practices. And, by looking at
Jews, Judaism and Jewishness in the plural, the course offers students a broad historical vision of Jewish
culture.
The course is organized, more or less, chronologically offering students a critical overview of Jewish
history moving from the biblical period to the present with attention to specific Jewish texts and artifacts
from specific periods and geographical locations within this history. Through this course students will
learn to read, interpret, contextualize, and critically assess these works. In this way they will be
introduced to contemporary Jewish studies as it intersects with the study of religion.
Assignments will include: class discussions, group projects and papers, as well as essay exams. Texts for
this course include: the Hebrew Bible, the Tanakh; Lentricchia and McLaughlin, Critical Terms for Lit-
erary Study; Peskowitz and Levitt (ed), Judaism Since Gender; Holtz (ed), Back to the Sources; Pesko-
witz, Spinning Fantasies; Scheindlin, A Short History of the Jewish People and reserve readings.

In conformity with the Enlightenment stress upon reason, eighteenth century Jewish philosopher Moses
Mendelssohn writes, "True divine religion arrogates to itself no power over opinion and judgments. It
knows only the power to win over by arguments." The persistence of rationalist interpretations of
religion as well as the emergence of new philosophical perspectives will be considered as they bear upon
the meaning of God, revelation, law, ethics and ritual practice in Judaism as interpreted in the philoso-
phies of Hermann Cohen, Franz Rosenzweig, Martin Buber, Emmanuel Levinas and Joseph B. Solo-
veitchik. The impact of the holocaust as unprecedented catastrophe upon concepts of God, history and
memory will be explored. Postmodern accounts of exegesis as itself a form of ritual practices and the

This course is set up to explore a series of issues around what constitutes Jewish identity at the beginning
of the twenty-first century. It pays especially close attention to the issue of gender. By taking gender as a
given constitutive element in these constructions, it focuses on the intersection of gender with all kinds
of other aspects of Jewish life and Jewish practice. Issues will include notions of Jewish study, work,
play, performance, myth and desire. Through close readings students will engage with a range of texts
that explore ancient as well as contemporary constructions of Jewishness. Texts for the class will in-
clude: Peskowitz/Levitt, Judaism Since Gender; Miriam Peskowitz, Spinning Fantasies: Rabbis, Gen-
der and History; Irena Klepfisz, Dreams of an Insomniac; Ari Elon, From Jerusalem to the Edge of

REL 220(S) Modern Christian Thought
This course tracks the major developments in Christian thought from the Reformation to the nineteenth
century. We will begin by examining the background to the Reformation, showing how the Reformation
along with its precursors indirectly helped to usher in a modern world that placed greater emphasis on
Religion
­ 286 ­
the value of selfhood and moral autonomy, encouraged the emergence of the Enlightenment and scien-
tific rationality, and helped to lead to the cultural and political realignment of nation-states. We will con-
clude by assessing the attempts of eighteenth and nineteenth century philosophers and theologians to
salvage a moral if no longer normative place for Christianity at the table of modernity, a process that
continues to grow ever more ambivalent.
This course will include a lecture and discussion component, student presentations, two 5- to 7-page
writing assignments and a final research paper (12-15 pages).

NORTH AMERICAN RELIGIONS
REL 221(F) New Religions in North America
This course explores contemporary North America religion from a historical, sociological, and philo-
sophical perspective. We will examine the historical and contemporary experiences of America's ever-
expanding religious diversity, prominently featuring the voices of those traditionally excluded from old-
er, Protestant-informed accounts of American religion. The focus of the course will be the exploration of
the ever-expanding variety of new religions in North America, challenging students to engage the nu-
merous cultural, philosophical, and methodological issues involved with the study of marginal religions.
New religions often highlight cultural anxieties, e.g. loss of identity in contemporary secular societies,
responses to new technologies, changing gender roles, globalization, etc. The study of new religions
becomes, then, a closer, reflexive examination of contemporary American culture and its underlying
tensions. For example, the Raëlian Movement claims to have cloned the first human. Wicca, on the other
hand, offers critiques of environmental depredation and traditional gender roles. In sum, we will explore
the historical roots of the current boom in new religions, detail contemporary issues, and outline the pos-
sible forms new and emerging religions may assume in the coming years. This course will also have a
website dedicated to the exploration of new religions, providing links to interesting sites, basic re-
sources, and student essays/projects.
Lecture/discussion. Students will be evaluated on the basis of their writing and presentation projects,
three 5- to 7- page essays, along with their thoughtful discussion of the key issues raised in the course.
Open to all classes without prerequisite. Enrollment limit: 30 (expected 15).

REL 222(S) Apocalypse in Contemporary North American Religious Thought
Apocalyptic thought pervades much of contemporary American culture, whether among Protestant
evangelicals, new religions, novelists and filmmakers, or even scientists and environmentalists who
warn of ecological catastrophe and the deadly consequences of nuclear proliferation. Many recent phi-
losophers and theologians have also contributed to apocalyptic thinking, writing about the "End of histo-
ry" and the "Death of God," for example. What does it all mean? Are we witnessing a remarkable con-
sensus that the End has indeed arrived? No, not exactly. This course will introduce, using historical, so-
ciological, and philosophical accounts, how Americans have thought about and continue to think about
questions of the End. Students will be evaluated on the basis of periodic response papers (1-2 pages), 2
short papers (5-7 pages) and a final paper (12-15 pages), and their participation and thoughtful discus-
sion of the key issues raised in the course. Lecture/discussion.

THE ISLAMIC TRADITION
REL 230(F) Reading Reading: An Introduction to the Qur'an and Islam (Same as
Comparative Literature 260) (W)*
One of the two most consequential texts in human history, the Qur'an is more conscious of itself as text
and the work of interpretation that is part of the life of a text. Because it is God's most important sign
(and also because it is relatively short) millions have memorized it and the art of Qur'anic recitation is
one of the supreme Islamic performing arts. Nevertheless it is primarily as a text that the Qur'an exists in
itself and in the minds of Muslims. The text of the Qur'an will thus be the focus of this course, reading it
extensively, intensively and repeatedly throughout the semester. We will attend to the structure and vari-
ety of styles and topics in the text and to the Qur'an's understanding of itself in relation to other forms of
literary expression. We will place the form and content in the context of seventh century c.e. Arab soci-
ety and attend to the life of the Prophet (PBUH) that provides one crucial framework to the text. Through
the lens of tafsir, Qur'anic commentary, we will also use the text to give an initial survey of some of the
main theological, philosophical, mystical and legal developments in the Islamic tradition. Finally we
will explore some of the aspects of the place of the text in the life of Muslims, including the development
of calligraphy and recitation.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: three essays (6-8 pages) based on class materials (at least one
will have a revision process). Students able to read the Arabic text may substitute work in a collateral
Religion

REL 232(S) Women and Islam (Same as History 309 and Women's and Gender Studies 232)*
This course will be an introduction to Islamic religion and culture that takes issues of gender as its orga-
nizing focus. We begin with a consideration of notions of honor, purity, and the dangerous feminine in
the Mediterranean machismo world. We will then give attention to the career and teaching of the Prophet
Muhammad (PBUH) and the role played by women in the establishment of Islam, as well as to the Qu-
ranic understanding of the relation of the sexes. We then examine the relation of the sexes as reflected in
legal, mystical, literary, and folkloristic texts with special attention to the relation of sexual and sacral
desire. This will allow us to consider the cultural ecological foundations of the creation of male and fe-
male identity in Islam as well as the importance of class difference (e.g., village versus city, rich versus
poor) that must be recognized in a careful examination of this issue. We conclude with a consideration
based both on literature and the social analysis of contemporary debate about the role of women in Islam
and why this issue is in many ways the centerpiece of the problem of Muslim identity in the modern
world.

have all led to an increased focus on Central Asia and its neighbors, Russia, China, the Middle East. This
course will be an introduction to the Caucasus, the Central Asian Republics, Xinjiang and Mongolia and
the interests of their neighbors, including now the United States in those areas. This will be a lecture
course that will introduce the salient themes and issues that are necessary for understanding these areas.
The course will inevitably be deeply comparative focusing on themes of "the clash of civilizations," the
construction of national identities, notions of ethnicity and the treatment of ethnic minorities, resurgent
religious movements, and the relation of state and civil society. This course will also function as an
introduction to doing social scientific research on these areas and special attention will be devoted to the
preparation of a research paper.

THE SOUTH-ASIAN TRADITIONS
REL 240(F) Hindu Traditions*
Whether or not the implied unity of the term "Hinduism" reflected existing conditions on the South
Asian subcontinent when it was first coined in the nineteenth century, the idea of an all-embracing "Hin-
duism" or "Hindu religion" has now long been in use in self-recognized Hindu communities around the
world. This course will introduce students to the historical emergence of two contemporary Hindu tradi-
tions. We shall first consider the Hinduism of modern-day Bali, in which doctrine and practice have been
articulated in terms of Indonesian state-bureaucratic regulations regarding the nature of "legitimate"
religion. We shall then examine the emergence of "Hindu nationalism" in contemporary India and the
rise of the Bharatiya Janata Party. In each case, special attention will be paid to the representation of
tradition and alterity, as well as to the deployment of both scriptural and other modes of authority. The
course will offer an overview of broadly western scholarship on Hinduism, and the ways in which schol-
ars have engaged with each of these two Hindu traditions.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: full and active participation, one 5-page essay and one

Women in several Southeast Asian countries have long been subjected to various forms of paternalistic
authority through state institutions such as village-regulated family planning and mandatory participa-
tion in women's civil and religious groups. However, the networks established through these institutions
have often been mobilized in different ways to challenge the very paternalism that created them. In this
course, in addition to selected readings, students will analyze a series of educational television broad-
casts and other state media (in translation), and consider the ways in which religion has been deployed in
discourses on citizenship, motherhood and the family. Through critical readings and the analysis of ex-
amples from Southeast Asia, students will be challenged to examine the question of whether Euro-
American scholarship on gender tends to naturalize a western, secularist (and arguably urban intellectual
élite) model of progressive politics. Format: seminar. Requirements: full and active participation, one

REL 272(S) Mass Media and Religious Violence*
Both religion and violence are often attributed in scholarly and popular discourse to a given society's
failure to achieve modernity. However, such understandings usually rest on the unreflectively ethnocen-
tric assumption that modernity equals secularity, and that religion is at best a private matter, or (more
commonly)--like violence--a residual to be explained away in terms of socio-political or economic
factors. Organized around a series of media sessions, lectures and discussions, this course will examine
specific conflicts and outbreaks of violence as represented in mainstream Euro-American and Southeast
Asian mass media, with a special emphasis on their respective assumptions regarding the nature of
religion and religious difference. Students will consider critically the extent to which modern mass me-
dia are crucial to--or even constitutive of--public understandings of religion-related violence as well as
the path to resolution.

historical and cultural contexts. Are these beliefs and practices a subordinate part of larger religious sys-
tems or are they "the operating systems" of every religion and culture? How do recent modern and post-
modern analyses of body, love, desire, gender, pleasure and pain, contribute to our understanding of
asceticism? How are asceticism and mysticism related? Are ascetic patterns exhibited in other cultural
practices such as sport and dance? Can asceticism be related to such phenomena as anorexia and torture?
Do some analyses of the metaphysical and psychological foundations of asceticism themselves reflect
covert attachments to ascetic ideals? First-person accounts and writings describing the lives of selected
Christian, Upanisadic and Buddhist sages, saints and mystics as well as the literature of dance and athlet-
ics will be considered. Modern and postmodern works such as those of Freud, Nietzsche, Weber, Mer-
leau-Ponty, Foucault, Deleuze and Guattari, Kristeva and Irigaray as they bear upon questions associat-
ed with asceticism will also be analyzed.

If the workplace was the essential site of modernity, then the shopping mall is the quintessential site of
postmodernity; the place where consumption trumps production and, it has been argued, our only re-
maining public space. This course will focus on the experience of shopping, focusing on three themes.
First we will explore the manufacturing of desire on which consumption must depend. We will critique
the tired critiques of advertising and explore in more depth the neurotic and erotic dimensions of the
creation of desire for objects. We will then turn to some comparative and historical analysis contrasting
the experience of shopping in traditional bazaars and contemporary malls, as well as exploring the histo-
ry of consumerism from the eighteenth century through the current phenomena of globalization. Finally,
we will explore the place of shopping in our collective imaginations, attending especially to the relation
between the gendering of the shopping experience and expressions of contempt and outrage toward
consumerism, with a special focus on the discourse on Christmas in American society.

MAJOR--French Language and Literature
The French major seeks to provide training in literary and cultural analysis and linguistic expres-
sion through the study of selected texts from the French-speaking world. Emphasis is placed on the
changes in form and subject matter from the early modern period to the contemporary era.
The major consists of nine courses above the 103-104 level with optimally one course each from
the following areas:
1) Poetry and Poetics
2) Prose Narrative and Fiction
3) Theatre and Dramatic Literature
4) Thematics, Special Topics, Survey Courses
Students must also take a 400-level capstone seminar which may count toward any of the four
required areas.
Students entering the major program at the 109/110-level may, with the permission of the Depart-
ment, choose as part of their major program, one course in Art History, History, Philosophy, Compar-
ative Literature or other subjects that relate to and broaden their study of French. Students
entering the major program at the 200-level may, in some cases and with the permission of the Depart-
ment, include two such courses in their major program.
Working with the major advisor, the student will formulate a curricular plan that will ensure balance
and coherence in courses taken. Such balance and coherence will be based on the above areas of liter-
ary and cultural investigation. Prospective majors should discuss their program with the major advisor
by the end of their sophomore year. This is especially imperative for students who are planning to
spend a part or all of their junior year in France.
Inasmuch as all courses in French assume the active participation of each student in discussions
conducted in the foreign language, regular attendance at class meetings is expected.
MAJOR--French Studies
The major in French Studies is an interdisciplinary program that provides students with the oppor-
tunity to acquire skills and knowledge embracing the cultural, historical, social, and political heritage
of France and the Francophone world. The program allows for an individualized course of study in-
volving work in several departments and the opportunity to study abroad.
Students electing the French Studies major should register with the French Studies faculty advisor
during their sophomore year. At that time they should submit a feasibility plan that articulates their
projected program.
Romance Languages
­ 291 ­
The French Studies major consists of ten courses satisfying the following requirements:
1) at least two courses in French language and/or literature above the French 103 level;
2) a senior seminar;
3) Electives: The remaining courses needed to complete the major must be drawn from at least
three different departments and relate primarily to an aspect of the culture, history, society, and poli-
tics of France and the Francophone world. These courses will be selected in consultation with mem-
bers of the Department of Romance Languages. Appropriate electives might include:
History 331 The French and Haitian Revolutions
Religion 301 Psychology of Religion
All courses in French literature and language above the 103 level.
In addition, students should take at least two non-language courses that are taught in French.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN FRENCH
Two alternative routes are available to those who wish to apply for the degree with honors.
The first of these involves the writing of a senior thesis. Honors candidates are required to devote to
their theses two semesters of independent study (beyond the nine courses required for the major) and
the winter study period of their senior year (493-W031-494). The thesis will be written in French and
will usually be in the range of from forty to sixty pages. Candidates are expected to submit thesis pro-
posals in May of their junior year. By the end of the first semester of the senior year, students will
normally have finished the research for the thesis. By the end of the winter study period, candidates
will submit to the department an outline and rough draft of their work. At this time, the student will
make apresentation of his project at a departmental colloquium. The thesis will be discussed and eval-
uated to determine whether or not the student should continue in the honors program. The second
semester of independent thesis work will be spent revising and rewriting the thesis. The completed
dissertation in its final form will be due at the end of April. The second route is a group of three clearly
related courses (offered by the Department of Romance Languages or by other departments, such as
History, Art, Philosophy, English, etc.), only one of which may be counted in the nine courses com-
prising the major. One of the courses will be an Independent Study (plus senior year WSP 030). At the
end of the spring semester the student will write an essay that synthesizes the content of the three re-
lated courses. Students may apply for this route by November 2 of the senior year.
In the case of both routes to the degree with honors, the department's recommendation for gradua-
tion with honors will be based on the originality and thoroughness of the finished project.
THE CERTIFICATE IN FRENCH
The Certificate in French Language and Cultures consists of a sequence of seven courses for which
the student must earn a cumulative grade average of B or higher. In addition, the student must take a
proficiency test and achieve a score of "Advanced." The test will be administered by the department
once a year during the month of April to all students desirous of obtaining the Certificate. Those inter-
ested should express their intent to the chair of the department by March 1 or earlier.
For students with no prior French background, the course sequence will consist of French 101-102,
French 103 and 104, and three courses in French above the 104 level, with at least one of these
courses at the 200-level or higher taken at Williams. If the student starts out the sequence at French
103, in addition to the three courses in French beyond the 104 level (including a 200-level course or
higher), two electives may be taken in other departments. One elective should be in French or Franco-
phone cultural history (art, literature, drama, music) and the other in French or Francophone intellec-
tual, political or social history.
See French Studies Major description above for list of possible electives in other departments.
PLACEMENT
A placement test in French is administered at Williams at the opening of the fall semester. Incoming
first-year students who register for any French course above the 101-102 level must take this test,
regardless of their previous preparation.
STUDY ABROAD
French majors are strongly advised to complete part of the requirements for the major by studying
abroad either during the academic year or the summer. Most American study-in-France programs re-
quire applicants to have completed a fifth-semester, college-level French course (French 105, for ex-
ample) before they go abroad. A special affiliation with the Hamilton Junior Year in France program
enables Williams students (who have completed 105) to participate in a comprehensive academic and
cultural experience in a French-speaking environment. Credit for up to four courses towards the major
can be granted at the discretion of the Department: normally 1 major credit for one semester and up to
4 major credits for a full year or two semesters. The final assignment of credit will be authorized in
consultation with the student's major advisor once the student has returned to Williams. Such credits
can only be determined by review of course format, course materials, and evidence of satisfactory
academic performance. Students interested in studying abroad need to consult with faculty members
in French by the second semester of their first year. Early planning is essential. Because the academic
quality of certain programs of study in France may well be beneath the pedagogical standards normal-
Romance Languages

ly associated with a Williams education, students will receive major credit for only those programs
recommended by the Department. Please consult a faculty member to find out which programs are
acceptable. Normally, the Department does not administer proficiency exams (for study abroad) to
any student who has not completed a French course at Williams.

The first semester of intermediate French continues and enhances the language skills begun in French
101-102. Greater emphasis is placed on the integration of vocabulary and grammatical structures into
meaningful contexts so as to expand reading and comprehension as well as written and oral self expres-
sion. The course joins the development of written and oral skills to a review of significant aspects of
French grammar, which are now studied in greater depth and used with greater understanding. Franco-
phone cultures will be presented through the reading of short literary and journalistic texts, the screening
of films, and the analysis of other cultural realia. Conducted in French.
Format: class meets for four hours a week and includes a mandatory language laboratory component.
Requirements: class participation, oral class presentations, short papers, exams, and quizzes.
Prerequisites: French 101-102 or examination placement. Enrollment limit: 20 (expected: 20).

RLFR 104(S) Advanced Intermediate French
The goal of this course is to build on the writing, reading, and aural comprehension skills in French de-
veloped at the elementary and intermediate levels (specifically those of French 103). The course will
consist of a continued review of fundamental grammar structures, but will emphasize the application
and assimilation of those structures in activities of composition, oral presentation, and discussion. Textu-
al resources will be drawn from literary and cultural settings and will be used to develop basic analytical
skills in French. Conducted in French.
Requirements: class participation, oral class presentations, short papers, quizzes, and exams.

LITERATURE COURSES
RLFR 109(F) Introduction to French Literature: Laughter and Despair
Through an organized web of obsessions, this course will introduce students to some seminal moments
of French literature and culture. In the face of human misery and futility, the writers selected respond in a
multiplicity of ways, ranging from despair to laughter. The course will gravitate around dialectically
opposed though not exclusive notions such as seriousness and frivolity (frivolous seriousness, serious
frivolity), depth and superficiality, being and appearance, the Court and the City. By establishing con-
nections between the various genres and periods, the course will show how the reading of one text in-
fects and enhances our understanding of another. Readings will include: Villon, Du Bellay, Ronsard,
Pascal, Molière, Perrault, Constant, Flaubert, and Ionesco. Conducted in French.
Requirements: class participation, several short papers, an oral presentation, and an hour exam.
Prerequisites: French 104 or 105 or by placement test or by permission of instructor.

RLFR 110(S) War and Resistance: Two Centuries of War Literature in France, 1804-2004
In 1883, Maupassant called on his fellow war veterans and writers to join him in speaking out against
warfare and violence, crying "Let us dishonor war!" From the Gallic Wars against Caesar (during the
first century BC) to France's controversial role in the current "War on Terror" (at the opening of the
twenty-first century), the French literary tradition is rich in texts that bear witness to war and speak out
against its monstrous inhumanity. While war literature in France can be traced back to medieval texts on
Charlemagne, Arthur, Lancelot, and Joan of Arc, this course will focus specifically on literary represen-
tations of war during the nineteenth- and twentieth-centuries, from the Napoléonic Wars, to the First and
Second World Wars, to the Algerian and Cold Wars, and the current "War on Terror." Discussions will
examine the impact of war on soldiers and civilians, patriotism and pacifism, history and memory; the
implications of war as invasion and conquest, occupation and resistance, victory and defeat; the relation-
ship of war to gender, sexuality, and ethnicity; and the role of war in colonialism and genocide. Readings
to include novels, short stories, and poems by Balzac, Stendhal, Hugo, Rimbaud, Daudet, Maupassant,
Zola, Cocteau, Barbusse, Céline, Malraux, Wiesel, Duras, and Fanon. Films to include works by Re-
snais, Malle, Angelo, Pontecorvo, and Duras. Conducted in French.
Format: seminar. Requirements: active class participation, two short papers, an oral presentation, and a
final paper.
Enrollment limit: 20 (expected: 20).
Hour: 1:10-2:25 TF MARTIN
RLFR 111(F) Introduction to Francophone Literature: Roots, Families, Nations*
Mothers, sisters, fathers, brothers, cousins. Orphans, illegitimate children, runaways, exiles. As Leo
Tolstoy wrote in the opening of his 1877 novel, Anna Karenina, "All happy families resemble one
another; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own fashion." The Francophone world, stretching
across Europe, Africa, the Middle East, Asia and the Americas, has often been described as an unhappy
family, joined by a shared language, but also by a problematic history. Through fiction and film, this
course will examine how writers and filmmakers from the Francophone world have approached the idea
of family both literally and metaphorically, using the idea of family to explore questions of identity, ori-
gins, colonialism, resistance, nationhood and interconnectedness in a global community. Authors we
will read include: Henri Lopes (Congo), Leila Sebbar (France/Algeria), Driss Chraibi (Morocco), Dany
Laferrière (Haiti), Maryse Condé (Guadeloupe), Aimé Césaire (Martinique), Assia Djebar (Algeria),
and Linda Lê (Vietnam). Conducted in French.
Requirements: active class participation, Blackboard postings, two short papers, an oral presentation,
and a final paper.
Prerequisites: French 109 or above or results of the College Placement Examination, or permission of
instructor. Enrollment limit: 20. (expected: 15).

RLFR 204(S) The Spirit of the Renaissance: Rediscovery and Invention
The seminar will examine the literary culture of France in the sixteenth century through selected master-
works of poetry and prose. During the age that marks the transition between the Middle Ages and neo-
classicism, French society is engaged in a process of vigorous experimentation in such themes and is-
sues as individualism, spontaneity, inspiration, eroticism, literary genre, poetics, the visual arts, and so-
cial conflict. We will give particular attention to the shift from oral to printed culture and the setting of
individual works within the context of modern theories of language and writing. Authors to be studied:
Rabelais, Du Bellay, Ronsard, and Montaigne. Conducted in French.
Requirements: class participation, two short papers, an oral presentation, and a final exam.
Prerequisites: French 109, 110, 112 or permission of the instructor.
Hour: 9:55-11:10 TR NORTON
RLFR 211(F) The Poetry of Revolution and Modernism: Baudelaire, Rimbaud, Mallarmé
With modernism begins a revolt that writes itself in as well as against language. Poetry in France, espe-
cially from 1850 on, initiates a revolution. It seeks to subvert the world and the word, to open conscious-
ness to untried experiences of the real, and to call into question the forms of representation by which
society and culture maintain their power. The course will focus attention on the subversive intent of three
major nineteenth-century poets whose works attempt to create a truly revolutionary and modern con-
sciousness which will define French literature and criticism well into the late-twentieth century. Subjects
to be discussed in depth will include: (1) the search for the unknown; (2) the escape from the everyday
world; (3) the attitude toward nature and the modern city; (4) the use of symbol and allegory; (5) the
power of memory in poetic re-creation; (6) the nature of the prose poem as a new modernist genre; (7)
the genesis of symbolism; (8) the place of love and fantasy in poetic experience; and (9) the relation of
music (Claude Debussy, Pierre Boulez, Jim Morrison) to poetic expression. In particular, the works of
each poet will be discussed in relation to the historical and cultural events of the time: Baudelaire and the
modernization of Paris and Second Empire style; Rimbaud and the insurrection of the Paris Commune;
Mallarmé and fin-de-siècle and symbolist aesthetics. Readings will include Baudelaire's Les Fleurs du
mal and Le Spleen de Paris; Rimbaud's early poems, Une Saison en enfer, and Les Illuminations; and
Mallarmé's Poésies; plus critical writings by Benjamin, Blanchot, Kristeva, and Bonnefoy. Conducted
in French.

RLFR 310(S) Sexuality and Seduction in Nineteenth and Twentieth-Century France
In 1857, both Flaubert'sMadame Bovary and Baudelaire's Les Fleurs du mal were put on trial for sexual
indecency and "crimes against public morality." In 1868, Le Figaro attacked Zola's novel Thérèse Ra-
quin as "putrid literature" for its depiction of adultery, murder, and scandalous sexuality in nineteenth-
century Paris. A century later, Gide, Colette, and Duras continued to shock French readers with their
extraordinary novels on male and female homosexuality, inter-generational lovers, and bi-racial rela-
tionships. In this course, we will examine a wide range of issues on eroticism and sexuality in nine-
teenth- and twentieth-century French literature, including marriage and adultery, seduction and desire,
love and betrayal, prostitution and fetishism, gay and lesbian identity, cross-dressing and gender repre-
sentation, exoticism and colonial (s)exploitation. Readings to include novels, shorts stories, and poems
by Chateaubriand, Constant, Duras, Balzac, Flaubert, Baudelaire, Zola, Maupassant, Gide, Proust, Co-
lette, Duras, and Guibert. Conducted in French.

RLFR 312(F) Between the Two World Wars
The period from 1913 to 1939 was an adventurous time for the French novel. In this course, we will
study novels by Gide, Proust, Colette, Camus, Martin du Gard, Mauriac, Malraux, and Sartre. Although
there is great diversity among these authors, they were all reacting to the aftermath of the First World
War and the breakdown of traditional French culture. Through the popular character of the rebellious
adolescent, they experimented with revolt against the stifling social order of Church and family. The real
challenge of the period, however, concerned not a break with the past or discoveries of new levels of
consciousness and freedom, but rather the mature acceptance of responsibility for the future and the ar-
ticulation of fresh spiritual and political visions. Conducted in French.
Requirements: several short papers and oral class presentations.
Prerequisites: any French literature course or permission of the instructor.

RLFR 408(S) Senior Seminar. Imagined Algeria: Silenced Histories and Dismembered
Narratives (W)*
Before his assassination in 1993, Algerian novelist Tahar Djaout wrote: "If you speak up, you die. If you
don't speak up, you die. So speak up and die!" Reflecting the country's painful history, the modern liter-
ary landscape of Algeria is a topography of reification, exile, and erasure. Algeria was a French colonial
possession from 1830 to 1962; in 1954 an eight year war of independence started that took approximate-
ly one million Algerian lives; since 1992 the country has endured an unspoken but deadly civil war in
which over 100,000 people have died and over 7000 "disappeared." In this class we will examine the
politics of representation in literary and visual texts of Algeria from the colonial period to the present.
We will examine the creation and erasure of the colonial subject, the plurality and suppression of lan-
guage, the fabrication of national myth, the writing of trauma and narratives from exile that attempt to
piece together the broken bodies of a nation. Readings include works by the following authors: Assia
Djebar, Anouar Benmalek, Kateb Yacine, Albert Camus, Emmanuel Roblès, Tahar Djaout, Nabile
Farès, Malek Alloula, and Jacques Derrida. Conducted in French.
Requirements: active class participation, postings on Blackboard, two short papers, an oral presentation

SPANISH
The Spanish major consists of nine courses above the 103-104 level. These nine courses include 301,
any 200 level or above (excluding RLSP 205 and RLSP 303), and 403.
The major seeks to provide training in literary analysis and linguistic expression, as well as an appreci-
ation of Hispanic civilization, through the study of the major writers of the Spanish-speaking world.
Students majoring in Spanish may replace one of their Spanish electives with a course in Comparative
Literature, with one course in Latin-American Studies that is 200-level or higher, or with a course in Lin-
guistics.
Inasmuch as all courses in Spanish assume the active participation of each student in discussions con-
ducted in the foreign language, regular attendance at class meetings is expected.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN SPANISH
Candidates for a senior thesis must have maintained a 3.5 GPA in the major by the time of proposal
submission. Two alternative routes are available to those who wish to apply for the degree with honors.
The first of these involves the writing of a senior thesis. Honors candidates are required to devote to their
theses two semesters of Independent Study (beyond the nine courses required for the major--and the win-
Romance Languages
­ 296 ­
ter study period of their senior year (493-W031-494). The thesis will be written in Spanish and will usually
be in the range of from forty to sixty pages. Candidates are encouraged to submit thesis proposals in May
of their junior year. By the end of the first semester of the senior year, students will normally have finished
the research for the thesis. By the end of the winter study period, candidates will submit to the department a
completed first draft of their work. At this time, the student will make a presentation of his project at a
departmental colloquium. The thesis will be discussed and evaluated to determine whether or not the stu-
dent should continue in the honors program. The second semester of independent thesis work will be spent
revising and rewriting the thesis. The completed dissertation in its final form will be due at the end of April.
The second route is a group of three clearly related courses (offered by the Department of Romance
Languages or by other departments, such as History, Art, Philosophy, English, etc.), only one of which
may be counted in the nine courses comprising the major. One of the courses will be an Independent Study
(plus senior year WSP 030) in the spring of the senior year, at the end of which the student will write an
essay that synthesizes the content of the three related courses. Students may apply for this route by Novem-
ber 2 of the senior year.
In the case of both routes to the degree with honors, the department's recommendation for graduation
with honors will be based on the originality and thoroughness of the finished project.
THE CERTIFICATE IN SPANISH
The Certificate in Spanish Language and Culture consists of a sequence of seven courses for which the
student must earn a cumulative grade average of B or higher. In addition, the student must take a proficien-
cy test and achieve a score of "Advanced." The test will be administered by the department once a year
during the month of April to all students desirous of obtaining the Certificate. Those so interested should
express their intent to the chair of the department by March 1 or earlier.
For students with no prior Spanish background, the course sequence will consist of Spanish 101-102,
Spanish 103 and 104, and three courses in Spanish above the 104 level, with at least one of these courses at
the 200-level or higher taken at Williams. If the student starts out the sequence at Spanish 103, in addition
to the three courses in Spanish beyond the 104 level (including a 200-level course or higher), two electives
may be taken in other departments. One elective should be in Spanish or Latin-American cultural history
(art, literature, drama, music) and the other in Spanish or Latin-American intellectual, political, or social
history. Spanish 200, 201, or 208 can be counted for the elective requirement.
List of possible electives in other departments:
Anthropology 215 The Secrets of Ancient Peru: Archaeology of South America
Anthropology 216 Native Peoples of Latin America
Anthropology 217 Mesoamerican Civilizations

RLSP 201(F) (formerly 111) The Cultures of Spain
Linguistically, culturally, and historically, the Iberian peninsula bears the traces of the past civilizations
that once inhabited the land. Iberians, Celts, Phoenicians, Greeks, Carthaginians, Romans, Visigoths,
Arabs, and Jews have all been instrumental in shaping the modern nation and the contributions of these
groups are the starting point in any understanding of Spain's rich cultural heritage and traditions. Cultur-
al diversity in contemporary Spain reflects at once the distinct autonomous regions which constitute the
socio-political fabric of the country, such as Catalonia and the Basque Country, and also patterns of
migration both within and beyond the European Union. In this course we will examine and consider
Spain past and present. We will study periods of tolerance and cultural brilliance, such as the co-exis-
tence of Arabs and Jews in Medieval Cordoba, as well as censorship and repression, brought about by

LANGUAGE STUDY
The department provides language instruction to enable the student to acquire all four linguistic
skills: understanding, speaking, reading, and writing. Russian 101-W088-102 covers the basics of
Russian grammar. Russian 103 and 104 offer additional instruction in grammar and provide extensive
practice in reading and conversation. Russian 201 and 202 aim to develop facility in speaking, writ-
ing, and reading.
STUDY ABROAD
The department strongly encourages students desiring to attain fluency in Russian to spend a se-
mester or year studying in Russia or one of the former Soviet republics. Students generally apply to
one of several approved foreign study programs. Russian 104 or the equivalent and junior standing are
normally prerequisite for study abroad.
LITERATURE AND CULTURE IN TRANSLATION
The department regularly offers courses on Russian literature and culture in English for those stu-
dents who have little or no knowledge of Russian, but who wish to become acquainted with the major
achievements in Russian literary and cultural history.
THE CERTIFICATE IN RUSSIAN
To enhance a student's educational and professional profiles, the Certificate in Russian offers a use-
ful tool for using the language in a wide variety of disciplines. The sequence of language and culture
courses is designed to supplement a student's major at Williams by enabling the student to expand his
or her knowledge in a related field.
The course of study for the certificate gives credit for Russian 101 and 102, which do not count
toward the major. Students who enter Williams with previous training in Russian may substitute more
advanced courses for the 100- and 200-level courses; they can also be exempted from up to two of the
required courses. Thus, in order to earn a certificate a student must take no fewer than five courses
(including three language courses) after enrolling at Williams.
Students must receive a minimum grade of B in each course taken in the sequence. In addition, they
must receive a score of at least 85% on a standardized language proficiency test administered by the
department.

RUSS 204(F) Freeze, Thaw, Resurrection: Twentieth-Century Russian Literature in
Translation (Same as Comparative Literature 204) (W)
During the twentieth century, Russian literature transformed itself many times, evolving through pre-
scriptive literary norms, a renewed interest in "truth-telling," and experimentation with form and subject
matter. In this course, we will study examples of the avant-garde, Socialist Realism, experimental prose,
the literature of emigration, youth prose, urban prose, Gulag literature, and dystopian literature. Where
appropriate, we will devote special attention to the links between Russian history and literature, and we
will also consider the Russian incarnations of modernism and postmodernism in relation to their world
literature counterparts. Though prose fiction in the form of novels, novellas and short stories will feature
as the center of the course, we will supplement these readings with the occasional study of poetry and a
few film screenings. Readings by Belyi, Bulgakov, Pasternak, Nabokov, Solzhenitsyn, Zamiatin, and
others. Knowledge of Russian is not required. All readings will be in English.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: thoughtful and active class participation, regular postings on
the course's Blackboard web site, occasional one-page response papers, three short papers, and a final

RUSS 206(S) Topics in Russian Culture: Feasting and Fasting in Russian History
This course will use the methodology of food history to explore the broader historical, economic, and
artistic conditions that gave rise to Russian culture. We will examine culinary practice as well as the
social context of cooking and eating in Russia. In order to elucidate the important interplay between
culture and cuisine, we will discuss such issues as the domestic roles of women and serfs, the etiquette of
the table, the role of drinking and temperance movements, and the importance of feasts and fasts in the
Russian Orthodox Church calendar. Short stories, memoirs, and cookery books will provide insight into
class and gender differences, cooking techniques, and the specific tastes that characterize Russian
cuisine. This class will present Russian culture from a predominantly domestic point of view that
originates from the wooden spoon as much as from the scepter. Knowledge of Russian is not required.
Requirements: several short written assignments and class presentations, a final project involving
research in some aspect of Russian culinary history, and participation in a communal feast.

In this course, we will explore the contentious topic of gender in a Russian context by examining an
array of representations of masculinity and femininity in Russian prose, poetry and film of the twentieth
century. By interrogating these representations, we will assess what it means (and what it has meant) to
be a Russian man or woman, and in the process, we may challenge some of our own Western assump-
tions about gender constructs. As we identify and analyze the characteristics of ideal/real men and
women, we will consider how and whether gender stereotypes are reinforced or shattered in the works of
contemporary authors. Readings by Babel, Maiakovskii, Nabokov, Pelevin, Petrushevskaia, Tolstaia,
Tsvetaeva and others. Class discussion and primary texts in Russian, with secondary materials in Rus-
sian and English.

Chair, Professor DONALD deB. BEAVER

Assistant Professor: MLADENOVIC.
Science and Technology Studies (SCST) is an interdisciplinary program concerned with science
and technology and their relationship to society. In addition to being concerned with the historical
development and a philosophical understanding of the ideas and institutions of science and technolo-
gy; Science and Technology Studies also examines their ethical, economic, social, and political im-
plications.
The role that science and technology have played in shaping modern industrial societies is general-
ly acknowledged, but few members of those societies, including scientists and engineers, possess any
understanding of how that process has occurred or much knowledge of the complex technical and
social interactions that direct change in either science or society. The Science and Technology Studies
Program is intended to help create a coherent course of study for students interested in these questions
by providing a broad range of perspectives. At present, courses are offered which examine the history
or philosophy of science and technology, the sociology and psychology of science, the economics of
research and development and technological change, science and public policy, technology assess-
ment, technology and the environment, scientometrics, and ethical-value issues.
To complete the requirements of the program, students must complete six courses. The introducto-
ry course and senior seminar are required and three elective courses are chosen from the list of desig-
nated electives. Students may choose to concentrate their electives in a single area such as technology,
American studies, philosophy, history of science, economics, environment, current science, or current
technology, but are encouraged to take at least one elective in history, history of science, or philoso-
phy. The sixth course necessary to complete the program is one semester of laboratory or field science

WILLIAMS PROGRAM IN TEACHING
Director, SUSAN ENGEL
The program in teaching is designed to enable Williams Undergraduates to study the ideas, questions,
and practices involved in good teaching at all levels. The program seeks to promote and facilitate an ex-
change of ideas about teachers, learners and schools, within and beyond the Williams campus. The pro-
gram offers a range of opportunities including courses on education, intensive supervised student teaching,
workshops, advising, lecture series, and ongoing peer groups for those who teach. Students may participate
in a variety of ways, ranging from taking one course to a sustained in-depth study of teaching and learning
geared to those who want to become teachers, or educational psychologists. We seek to connect students
with one another, to bring in expert teachers to provide mentoring, and to create links across the curriculum
so that students can see the vital connections between what they study (French, Algebra or Biology for
instance) and the process of teaching those topics to elementary and high school students. The program is
open to any student interested in education and offers opportunities for all levels of interest, including those
who want to find out about certification and graduate study. Students seeking certification through an ar-
rangement with the Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts (MCLA) should consult with Susan Engel be-
fore the end of their sophomore year.

No specific major is required to participate in the program--although some lend themselves easily
to certification, such as Mathematics, English, Biology, American history, or French, almost all of our
majors can provide the basis of teacher certification. Alternately, students can major in Psychology,
take a concentration of courses in a different field, and then pursue that content area more intensively
in graduate work.

As a reflection of the theatre's historical relationship to literature and the arts, stage production is
studied in the context of the literary and artistic movements which have informed theatrical endeavor.
The major in Theatre emphasizes the collaborative nature of the discipline by drawing upon courses
offered by faculty of the Language, Literature, Music, and Art Departments. Although students will
be equipped to proceed to graduate and professional schools in theatre, the major is primarily directed
toward those interested in studying the theatre as an artistic phenomenon and as an interpretive tool.
Because a deep understanding of theatre requires training and experience with the synthesis on stage,
the major includes curricular study of production and performance, as well as continued participation
in departmental stage production.
Williamstheatre, the production arm of the Department of Theatre, operates under the supervision
of the departmental faculty. Major departmental productions as well as laboratory and experimental
productions of all kinds are mounted on both the DownStage Theatre and the new stages of the '62
Center for Theatre and Dance. Participation in acting or technical work is open to all members of the
Williams College community. Students majoring in Theatre will be asked to consult regularly with
departmental advisors in devising the sequence of courses and production participation that will
constitute their major.
MAJOR
The Theatre Department course requirements are Theatre 101, Theatre 102, Theatre 301, Theatre

taught by the Music Department. Students with an interest in theatre design should particularly elect
Art Studio courses in drawing.
Production requirement for the major: All majors in Theatre are required to participate in a mini-
mum of eight department productions in addition to the laboratory requirement for Theatre 102. Par-
ticipation in at least three of the eight must be in technical production, and one must be in stage man-
agement. Assignment to productions is normally made in consultation with the department and chair.
Theatre majors are strongly urged to include dance and fencing in fulfilling their Physical Educa-
tion requirements.

Candidates for Honors will apply for admission through the submission of a portfolio to the Depart-
ment Chair by February of their junior year, as well as a description of their proposed project. The
portfolio will be comprised of four parts:
1. The first part will include a list of the courses students have taken relevant to their work towards the
major, This list will include courses offered by the Theatre Department, but may also include classes
taken other Departments. Students should also list and describe relevant independent studies and pro-
duction credits.
2. The second part of the portfolio will include a selection of materials developed for these courses and
productions listed in Part 1. The selection should include at least three papers or samples of other
written work, and might also include design projects, director's notebooks, studio art projects, actor's
journals or other forms of documentation of the candidate's work. For students who have taken a
semester away, it is particularly important that they provide the Department with a detailed picture of
their activities while studying off-campus. Course descriptions and syllabi should be submitted in
addition to a list of courses taken and activities performed.
3. The third part of the portfolio is an annotated bibliography of dramatic texts which the student has
read, drawn from a list supplied by the Department. Annotations should be based upon a particular
angle of engagement with the text, that reflects the area or areas that the student has chosen to empha-
size in their theatrical training. For instance, one might choose to write from the point of view of an
actor, a designer, a director, a playwright, or a dramaturg.
4. The portfolio should conclude with a retrospective essay that reflects on the materials that are being
submitted. Students should look for connections between the various aspects of their work, state any
theoretical positions that they have come to embrace, assess their strengths and weaknesses, and dis-
cuss their educational goals for their work with the Department during their Senior year.
The portfolio will be examined alongside the student's record and their project description; a deter-
mination will then be made as to their admission into the Honors program. Students intending to apply
for Honors, should meet with the Department Chair by the end of the fall semester of their junior year.
Once a student is admitted to the Honors program, the department Chair will assign an Honors Project
Advisor, who will work with the student to specify a timeline and work program for the completion of
the Honors Project. At a minimum, this will entail enrollment in Theatre 493 or 494, plus presentation
to the Department Honors Committee of the completed project for evaluation.
THEA 101(F) Introduction to Theatre
Introduction to Theatre is intended to prepare students for future courses in acting, directing, dramatic
literature, performance studies, and design by introducing them to critical thinking about theatre as a
constructed performance. The course is organized to emphasize historical and theoretical connections
between plays. Examples would be: looking at Aeschylus' The Oresteia (5th century BCE), and Charles
L. Mee's Orestes 2.0 (1992); comparing the staging of gender in A Doll House by Henrik Ibsen (1879)
and Fences by August Wilson (1985).

THEA 201(F) Theatrical Design: Process of Collaboration
This course examines the designer's process and collaborative role in the creation of theatre through a
combination of lecture, discussion, and individual /group projects. Text and music will be analyzed in
ways that help clarify how a designer develops a point of view while solving the practical needs of pro-
duction. All aspects of design-scenery, lighting, costume, and sound- will be explored with particular
emphasis on how these elements synthesize and contribute to the larger intellectual, emotional, and
physical context of the stage. Basic presentation skills and technique will be taught as crucial elements of
design development.
Evaluation will be based upon committed class participation and thoughtful, timely completion of all
assignments and projects.
Prerequisite: Theater 102 or ArtS 100 or permission of the instructor. This course is a prerequisite for all

tion, primarily through intense scene work. Readings will include selections by Stanislavsky, Meisner,
Adler, or similar theorists. Improvisation may be used to explore simplicity, clarity of expression, listen-
ing, and specificity in the actor's task. Focus on the imagination and creation of character will be empha-
sized through the scene work. The dramatic literature employed will range from early realist/naturalist
classics to contemporary playwriting. Students will reflect critically on their progress through written
and oral critiques. Scene work will require extensive preparation outside of class.
Prerequisites: Theatre 203. Enrollment limit: 14.

THEA 220(S) Approaching Performance Studies (Same as Women's and Gender Studies
220)
Theatre, film, video, music, dance, visual art, performance art, community activism, public gather-
ings--all fall under the rubric of "performance." Performance studies takes on these types of perform-
ances in the name of theorizing performance as a cultural act. This course will serve as an introduction to
the field of performance studies and its theoretical bases in anthropology, dramatic theory, poststructur-
alism, psychoanalytic theory, folklore, religion, cultural studies, literary theory, religion, philosophy,
feminist theory, and queer theory. In addition to reading and discussing theory, local live and recorded
performances will be considered. Williams faculty who are advisory faculty for the Performance Studies
Cluster (see masthead in the course catalog) will give guest lectures. The course will culminate in the
showing of students' final projects. This course is the introduction course for the Performance Studies
Program.
Format: seminar. Each class will be organized around a topic. An example: liminality. The students
would read Victor Turner to access the symbolic anthropological definition of liminality as "in-between-
ness." We would also consider performances, either described in readings such as Mikhail Bakhtin's
Rabelais and His World or on video/DVD, like Richard Schechner's Dionysus in 69. Students would
bring to class short, 3-page papers on how these performances would comment on and possibly define a
type of liminality. During the class meeting, along with the describing what is "in-between," they would
need to establish what the parameters of the performance are; in other words, what is the "in-between"
between? In the case of Schechner's Dionysus in 69, the anthropology-trained Schechner stages an In-
donesian birth ritual at the beginning of the play, enacted by white naked actors in a warehouse in SoHo.
In class, students would outline a revised, collective paper about the ethical and aesthetic aspects of
Schechner's choice and how they play into the theoretical concept of liminality.
Students are also required to make a final presentation, to be shown in a colloquium at the end of the
semester. Participation in class and on Blackboard is mandatory.
Evaluation will be based on class papers and final presentation.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20 (expected:25). No first-years admitted. Preference to sopho-
mores, then juniors and seniors.
This course is part of the Critical Reasoning and Analytical Skills initiative.

THEA 221T(S) Contemporary Play and Performance Analysis (Same as English 224T and
Women's and Gender Studies 221T) (W)
Contemporary Play and Performance Analysis teaches students at the sophomore level how to write
about performance and plays through the practice of dramaturgy. Dramaturgy can be loosely defined as
the "intellectual management" of a performance. In a writing-intensive, academically rigorous tutorial
format, we will develop and hone seeing, reading, and writing about plays and performance. The sylla-
bus will feature the viewing of on-campus and local performances, films of performances, and the read-
ing of contemporary (post-2000) play scripts. We will approach each production dramaturgically, mean-
ing we will research the pieces seen and read and incorporate that into weekly writing assignments. Stu-
dents will be expected to write every other week on collateral readings and their relationship to the per-
formances and plays. On alternating weeks, students will offer commentary on their tutorial partner's
writing assignment.
Format: tutorial. Evaluation will be based on weekly papers and commentary.
Prerequisite: Theatre 101. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). No exceptions. Sophomores strongly pre-
ferred; juniors by permission of instructor only.
Hour: TBA BEAN
THEA 222(F) Polis/Metropolis: Theatre, History, and Urban Culture (Same as
Comparative Literature 217, English 213 and History 341) (W)
This class will focus on specific historical moments in selected urban spaces-for instance, Madrid in
1634, London in 1747 or Berlin in 1926. For each of these moments, we will make concrete connections
between play texts, conceived broadly, and the political and cultural geographies from which they
emerge. Each week, we will consider developments in theater technology and acting methodology, the
work of concurrent practitioners in other artistic media, the intersection of social class and power and the
iconography of architectural space. With this in mind, we will develop a conceptual framework within
which to situate, analyze, and better understand a representative performance text. These texts include
but are not limited to Moliere's Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme, Chekhov's The Seagull and Alfred Jarry's
Ubu Roi.
Format: lecture/seminar. Evaluation will be based on weekly responses, two short papers, and a substan-
tial final paper.

THEA 223(S) Women in Theatre from Africa and the African Diaspora (Same as
African-American Studies 223 and Women's and Gender Studies 223)*
This course will examine the lives of women from Africa and the African Diaspora through theatre, in
lectures and discussions. The primary goal of this course is to heighten awareness, understanding and
Theatre
­ 308 ­
appreciation for theatre performed and written by these women. Using published and unpublished mate-
rial, videotapes of various productions and interviews, we will explore the themes and aesthetics of these
works within their social and historical context. Throughout the course it will become apparent that
theatre is not only created for entertainment, but mainly as a tool for effecting social change and eradicat-
ing stereotypes. Upon completion of this course, you should be familiar with works by women from
various countries in Africa and the United States.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class participation, projects and a final project consisting
of an 8- to 10-page research paper on a topic related to one of the subjects/artists covered over the course
of the semester.

writing exercises and an intensive workshop process. We will combine an overview of different theatri-
cal modes with critical perspectives on theatre--what it is, how it works, what it should be--from Aris-
totle to the present. We will focus on processes of transition from theory to practice and from the page to
the stage.
Format: seminar. Requirements: analytic papers and workshop projects.
Prerequisites: limited to junior Theatre majors. No enrollment limit (expected: 7).

THEA 302(S) Scenic Design
This course examines the artistic, intellectual, and practical roles of a set designer in the development of
works of theatre. Through the analysis of carefully selected text and music-based drama, a range of tech-
niques will be explored and utilized to create theoretical stage designs. Although emphasis will be on
3-dimensional modeling as the primary means of process and presentation, sketching, drafting, and digi-
tal tools will be important factors in course work. Unique, diverse, and strong points of view will be
encouraged.
Evaluation will be based upon committed class participation and thoughtful, timely completion of all
assignments and projects.

THEA 306(S) Advanced Acting Workshop
An exploration of the Commedia Dell'Arte, a Renaissance Italian (and later trans-European) perfor-
mance style based on tipi fissi, or fixed character types. We will develop skills which fall into three gen-
eral categories: historical awareness-the character's places of origin and socio-economic status; physical
precision-their postures, walks, and gestures; and improvisational ability-an understanding of structure,
give-and-take, and commitment to ensemble storytelling. With this in mind, students will research the
various characters and learn their specific postures, walks, and gestures; make masks based on the tradi-
tional Commedia designs; develop strategies for improvisation; and create and rehearse a scenario. The
class will culminate in a final improvised public performance.
Format: studio. Evaluation will be based on participation in class exercises; research projects; specific
presentation projects including a final performance of Commedia characters.

WOMEN'S AND GENDER STUDIES (Div. II)
Chair, Associate Professor KATHRYN R. KENT
Advisory Committee: Professors: DRUXES**, SAWICKI. Associate Professors: S. BOLTON,
BUELL*, CASE, M. DEVEAUX, C. JOHNSON, KENT. Assistant Professors: LONG,

Librarian: MENARD. Health Educator: DENELLI-HESS. COLLINGSWORTH (MCC).
Women's and Gender Studies can be defined as the study of how gender is constructed, how it is
inflected by differences of race, ethnicity, sexuality, class, and so on, how gender affects the experi-
ences and situations of men and women, and how assumptions about gender influence the construc-
tion of knowledge and experience. Scholarship in Women's and Gender Studies has brought ne-
glected material into established fields and raised important methodological questions that cross dis-
ciplinary boundaries and challenge established intellectual frameworks. The program in Women's
and Gender Studies thus includes courses from a wide variety of disciplines that focus in a coherent
way on gender issues, as well as core courses that acquaint students with the interdisciplinarity of the
field.
THE MAJOR
The Women's and Gender Studies major encourages exposure to the interdisciplinary character of
feminist scholarship. In addition, majors are required to gain some knowledge of methods within a
field or discipline (3 courses in one of the categories listed below), to appreciate the importance of
diversity (racial, sexual, class, ethnic, national, etc.) in scholarship on gender, to gain exposure to fem-
inist theory, and to pursue work at an advanced level (3 courses at the 300-level).
In order to ensure that students reflect about the paths that they choose through the major, each
major will be assigned to an advisor in the spring of the sophomore year. With the advisor, the student
will establish a revisable course of study for the following two years. Students interested in declaring a
major should contact the chair of the Program (Kent, x2549).

a conventional research thesis of 40-70 pages or of other modes of presentation (e.g., art, music,
poetry, theater, fiction). Proposals for non-thesis projects should include evidence of experience and
competence in the chosen mode.
A student may become a candidate for honors in Women's and Gender Studies after the following
criteria are met:
1) in April of the junior year, submission and Women's and Gender Studies Committee approval of a 4- to
6-page project proposal, in which the ideas, aim, general methodology, and preliminary bibliography for
the project are outlined and a faculty advisor is named;
2) at the end of the junior year, cumulative grade point average of 3.5 in the major;
3) on the first day of classes of the senior year, submission and approval by the faculty advisor of a 5- to
10-page prospectus for the project.

WGST 402(S) Feminism and the Politics of Family (W)
This course is designed to enable advanced Women's and Gender Studies students to engage in vital
research on interdisciplinary topics. Family and the myriad of issues often associated with it continue to
be a central site for debates within feminism, women's and gender studies. In this seminar we will ex-
plore some of the most contentious and dynamic areas of contestation, such as arguments for and against
marriage; claims for the connection between reproduction and women's oppression; the gendered divi-
sion of labor; feminist revisions and rejections of the family; theories of how gender and sexuality are
produced within the family; the possibility of feminist parenting; the question of the relation of the fami-
ly to the state; the idea of family as a site for a transnational feminist politics. Emphasis will also be
placed on exploring the historical and cultural diversity of social arrangements that are gathered into
(and often rendered invisible by) dominant definitions of family. Course materials will draw from a vari-
ety of sources, and may include psychoanalysis, memoirs, novels and poems, social history, parenting
guides, legal rulings on marriage and family, collections of family photographs, political and economic
theory.

CRITICAL REASONING AND
ANALYTICAL SKILLS (CRAAS) COURSES
Chair, Associate Professor KATHRYN R. KENT
To one degree or another, every class at Williams goes beyond its subject--be it mathematics, Ma-
chiavelli, or modernism--to teach intellectual skills that have wide application in other fields as well
as outside of the academy: scientific reckoning, expository writing, rhetorical analysis, oral presenta-
tion, and so on.
Courses offered under the CRAAS initiative foreground such analytical skills. While each CRAAS
class covers a different topic, all are aimed particularly at developing the processes necessary for ex-
cellence in a range of fields: techniques for analyzing ideas, data, texts or artworks; approaches to
interpreting, synthesizing, and developing arguments; strategies for presenting ideas and results.
CRAAS classes typically emphasize the practices of meta-analysis--self-criticism, editing, and re-
vision--with the goal of constant improvement. Many classes feature peer tutoring, small group
work, and intensive one-on-one engagement with the professor. Students should leave a CRAAS
course with a substantially heightened ability to approach problems, analyze texts, and craft argu-
ments in whatever discipline they may go on to explore.
A few CRAAS courses are restricted to advanced students, but the majority are open to all, and
some are specifically targeted for first year students. Most have strictly limited enrollment. Because
these classes cultivate the general strategies of effective scholarship, students are encouraged to con-
sider taking a CRAAS course early in their academic careers.

PEOPLES AND CULTURES COURSES
The peoples and cultures requirement is intended to help students to begin to understand the cultur-
al diversity of American society and the world at large, so that, as citizens of an increasingly intercon-
nected world, they may become better able to respond sensitively and intelligently to peoples of var-
ied social backgrounds and cultural frameworks. Courses which fulfill this requirement are thus de-
signed to familiarize students with some dimension of American cultural diversity or that of the non-
Western world. Each student must complete one graded semester course primarily concerned with:
(a) the peoples and cultures of North America that trace their origins to Africa, Asia, Latin America,
Oceania, or the Caribbean; Native-American peoples and cultures; or (b) the peoples and cultures of
Africa, Asia, Latin America, Oceania, or the Caribbean. Although this course, which may be counted
toward the divisional distribution requirement, may be completed any semester before graduation,
students are urged to complete the course by the end of the sophomore year.

QUANTITATIVE/FORMAL REASONING COURSES
Williams students should be adept at reasoning mathematically and abstractly. The ability to apply
a formal method to reach conclusions, to use numbers comfortably, and to employ the research tools
necessary to analyze data lessen barriers to carrying out professional and economic roles. Prior to their
senior year, all students must satisfactorily complete a Quantitative/Formal Reasoning (QFR)
course--those marked with a "(Q)." Students requiring extra assistance (as assessed during First
Days) are normally placed into Mathematics 100/101/102, which is to be taken before fulfilling the
QFR requirement.
The hallmarks of a QFR course are the representation of facts in a language of mathematical sym-
bols and the use of formal rules to obtain a determinate answer. Primary evaluation in these courses is
based on multistep mathematical, statistical, or logical inference (as opposed to descriptive answers).

RELATED COURSE LISTINGS
There are a number of significant areas of studies in which Williams offers many relevant courses,
yet no formal program. To alert students to the opportunity for integrating courses from diverse disci-
plines into a focus area and to encourage them to do so, the courses in this section are organized as lists
of topic-related courses. For their full descriptions, see the respective departmental sections.
Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual Studies
Gay, lesbian, and bisexual studies focuses on the social construction of sexuality, past and present.
Although, at present, Williams does not have a formal concentration in gay, lesbian, and bisexual

WRITING-INTENSIVE COURSES
Courses designated as "writing intensive"--those marked with a "(W)"--stress the process of
learning to write effectively. Such courses include a substantial amount of writing (a minimum of 20
pages), usually divided into several discrete assignments. Instructors pay close attention to matters of
style and argumentation. Enrollments are limited to 19.
All Williams College students are required to take two writing-intensive courses: one by the end of
the sophomore year and one by the end of the junior year. Students will benefit most from writing-in-
tensive courses by taking them early in their college careers and are therefore strongly encouraged to
complete the requirement by the end of the sophomore year.

WILLIAMS OFF-CAMPUS PROGRAMS
WILLIAMS-EXETER PROGRAMME AT OXFORD UNIVERSITY
Director, Professor JAMES L. NOLAN, Jr.
THE PROGRAMME
Williams College offers a year-long programme of studies at Oxford University in co-operation
with Exeter College (founded in 1314), one of the constituent colleges of the University. Williams
students will be enrolled as Visiting Students at Exeter and as such will be undergraduate members of
the University, eligible for access to virtually all of its facilities, libraries, and resources. As Visiting
Students in Oxford, students admitted to the Programme will be fully integrated into the intellectual
and social life of one of the world's great universities.
Although students in the Programme will be members of Exeter College, entitled to make full use
of Exeter facilities (including the College Library), dine regularly in Hall, and join all College clubs
and organisations on the same terms as other undergraduates at Exeter, students will reside in Ephraim
Williams House, a compound of four buildings owned by Williams College, roughly 1.4 miles north
of the city centre. Three students from Exeter College will normally reside in Ephraim Williams
House each year, responsible for helping to integrate Williams students into the life of the College and
the University. A resident director (and member of the Williams Faculty) administers Ephraim Wil-
liams House, oversees the academic programme, and serves as both the primary academic and per-
sonal advisor to Williams students in Oxford.
Students enrolled in the Oxford Programme must enroll for the full academic year, which consists
of three academic terms, each of which includes eight full weeks of instruction: MICHAELMAS
TERM (early October to early December), HILARY TERM (mid-January to mid-March), and TRIN-
ITY TERM (late April to late June). Students are expected to be in residence to write their first tutorial
papers before the eight weeks of instruction begins and to remain in residence during the week after
the term ends in order to sit their final examinations. Between the three terms there are two intervening
four-five week vacations, during which students may be expected to continue reading as preparation
for their upcoming tutorials.
THE TUTORIAL SYSTEM
Undergraduate instruction at Oxford University is largely carried out through individual or small-
group tutorials, in which students meet weekly with their tutor to present and discuss an essay they
have written, based on an extensive amount of reading undertaken from an assigned reading list they
will receive at the beginning of each term. In addition to the weekly tutorial, students are from time to
time encouraged to attend a pertinent course of lectures offered by the University that corresponds to
the material being addressed in their tutorials.
Each student will plan a course of study for the three terms of the academic year in consultation
with the director of the Programme. In his or her capacity as the Tutor for Visiting Students at Exeter
College, the director, working closely with Exeter's subject tutors, will arrange the teaching for the
students, monitor student progress, be in regular contact with the student's tutors, supervise the ex-
aminations that students will sit at the end of each academic term, and report on each student's aca-
demic progress to the Senior Tutor at Exeter College. There are no "add/drop" periods at Oxford; once
a student has made a commitment to a particular tutorial course, and the director has then secured a
tutor to teach that course, students cannot back out.
Over the course of the three terms, students are required to enroll in a minimum of FOUR full tutori-
al courses (each consisting of eight individual tutorial meetings and requiring the preparation of eight
essays) and ONE half tutorial course (consisting of four individual tutorial meetings and the prepara-
tion of four essays). Some students choose to substitute a fifth full tutorial course for the half tutorial
course and a few will decide to enroll in two full tutorial courses each term. The average course load
Williams-Exeter Programme at Oxford
­ 328 ­
undertaken by most students in residence in Oxford during the past has been five full tutorial courses
or their equivalent.
GRADES AND CREDIT
Grades for each tutorial course reflect the grade assigned to all eight (or four) tutorial sessions, in-
cluding their related essays, considered together, as well as the grade for the final examination on
work accomplished in the individual tutorials and supplementary readings. Final examinations last
three hours in the case of full tutorial courses and two hours in the case of half tutorial courses and are
always sat in the ninth week of term, following the eight weeks of instruction each term. The final
grade recorded on the Williams transcript is calculated by counting the grade for the tutorial meetings
and essays as two-thirds of the grade and the final examination as one-third of the overall grade. For
some tutorial courses (especially in writing and the studio arts), tutors may offer the student the option
of a final paper or project in lieu of an examination.
Upon satisfactory completion of the requirements for the Williams-Exeter Programme at Oxford
University, students receive academic credit for a regular Williams academic year, the four tutorial
courses replacing the regular eight semester courses the student would normally take at Williams, the
half tutorial course replacing the Winter Study Course. Grades eventually become a part of their Wil-
liams transcript in the summer after their completion of the Programme and are included in the com-
putation of their Grade Point Average.
Tutorial courses in Oxford may be used toward fulfilling the divisional distribution requirement; a
student may earn a year maximum of three distribution requirements, with no more than one from
each division, for the year. All tutorial courses at Oxford meet the Williams College "Writing Inten-
sive" designation, except for those in the studio arts, mathematics, and the sciences.
Tutorial courses in Oxford may also be used to meet major requirements. Some departments at Wil-
liams will grant a two-course credit towards the major for each full tutorial course taken at Oxford,
and one course towards the major for each half tutorial course taken at Oxford. Most departments,
however, will grant a one-course credit towards the major for each relevant tutorial course taken at
Oxford (whether a full or a half). Students are encouraged to check with their department chair(s) to
confirm official department policy.
THE COURSE OF STUDY
Students are encouraged to pursue a course of study during their three terms at Oxford that best
reflects the strength of the University's offerings. They will, in particular, be able to undertake work in
fields which are represented only marginally or infrequently in the Williams curriculum (Classics,
Theology, etc.) and in fields in which Oxford is particularly noted (English Literature, Modern Histo-
ry, Philosophy, Politics, etc.). Exeter College also has a Fellow in English Language and Literature
(with interests ranging from the Renaissance--including Shakespeare--to the early nineteenth centu-
ry) committed to teaching Williams students, and students are thus encouraged to consider undertak-
ing at least one tutorial course in these fields as part of their course of study.
What follows is a list of tutorial courses normally available to students studying with the Williams-
Exeter Programme at Oxford. The tutorials listed below (WIOX 311-384) represent a selection of
some of the standard "papers" (courses) that comprise the Oxford degrees in various subjects and that
are taught in tutorial format. Normally, but not always, tutors can be secured who can teach these sub-
jects to Williams students, although demand, leave patterns, and other constraints, sometimes mean
that not all of these subjects can be staffed in all terms.
Some tutorial courses are accompanied by lectures. In such cases the term in which the lectures are
delivered is listed, as is the term in which students should take the tutorials (MT-Michaelmas Term;
HT-Hilary Term; TT-Trinity Term). Sometimes, where appropriate, prerequisites are also listed.
While many students enroll in the tutorial courses listed below (WIOX 311-384), it is also possible
to choose from other available Oxford courses under the heading of WIOX 390, a general rubric for
more specialized tutorial work. This is described in more detail below.

advance for the entire academic year. Students will be expected to attend the lectures in all terms

WIOX 390 Specially Arranged Subjects
Specially arranged tutorial courses in some subject areas other than those covered by the WIOX
311-384 courses might also be possible. A WIOX 390 is not simply what would be called an "inde-
pendent study" course at Williams. Rather, a WIOX 390 is normally a "paper" (course) that is regular-
ly offered at Oxford as either a required or optional part of the degree in various subjects. For a list of
all the "papers" that make up the degree requirements in various disciplines, students should consult
the University of Oxford Examination Regulations, a recent copy of which can be found in the Dean's
Office. Important guidelines for how to make sense of this complex and weighty tome (the equivalent
of the Williams College Bulletin) are available from the Dean's Office and also from the director. It is
easier to find tutors for a WIOX 390 in some fields (Classics, English, History, Philosophy, Theology,
etc.) than in others (Psychology, the natural sciences, etc) and students should realize that it is not
always possible for the Programme to accommodate their requests.
A sample list of Specially Arranged Subjects (WIOX 390) staffed during the past three years is of-
fered below. This list is not comprehensive. Furthermore, students who wish to undertake a WIOX
390 course are encouraged to consult the Examination Regulations rather than simply repeat what
other students in the past have done.

NON-CREDIT FOREIGN LANGUAGE STUDY
In addition to their regular tutorial courses, students may begin or continue the study of a wide
range of foreign languages on a non-credit basis through a variety of arrangements available through
the University as well as a number of other educational and cultural institutions in the city of Oxford.
The Programme normally subsidizes such study.
STUDENT LIFE
By virtue of the fact that, while in Oxford, they are officially Visiting Students at the University--
and full members of Exeter College--Williams students are offered every opportunity to become ful-
ly integrated into student life in Oxford. Both Exeter College and Oxford University are home to an
exceptional variety of sports clubs, debating societies, interest groups, cultural organizations, and so-
cial activities, virtually all of which are available to Visiting Student members of the University. Stu-
dents are encouraged to participate fully in the social life of Exeter College--to dine in Hall as often as
they wish, to frequent the College bar, to use the College's athletic facilities, and to become members
of the various College clubs and organizations. Furthermore, Williams students also have access to
the University's athletic events, concerts, theatrical productions, museums, and libraries. All Wil-
liams students in Oxford are provided with membership in the Oxford Union, which, in addition to its
debating activities and club rooms, possesses dining facilities and the largest lending library in the
University.
At the Ephraim Williams House, all Williams students are housed in capacious double rooms and
enjoy full access to the House's library (recently expanded and refurbished), common rooms, laundry
facilities, computer lab, and a large dining room, in which a weekly catered meal is served during the
eight weeks of term. There are also a number of small kitchens in the House which students may use.
All rooms are fully wired for high-speed internet access and are fully equipped with furnishings, bed
linens, and a telephone. The grounds include a courtyard where basketball can be played, sheltered
bike racks, barbecue facilities, a reflective garden and a gnome garden. A number of student jobs are
available during the academic year for students who wish to earn a little spending money by helping to
Williams-Exeter Programme at Oxford
­ 335 ­
maintain the facilities and organize Programme activities. Ephraim Williams House is a short bike or
bus ride (or a twenty-minute walk) from Exeter College and the center of town, and is within easy
walking distance of the University parks and the local shops, restaurants and banks of Summertown.
The Programme will partially subsidize student bus passes or bicycle purchase or rental to facilitate
travel around Oxford.
Before the academic year begins--at the end of September and in early October--ten days of ori-
entation activities are scheduled. Students are expected to be in residence for all of these many activi-
ties, some of which take place in Ephraim Williams House, others at Exeter College. At this time stu-
dents will become acquainted with the workings of the Programme, of Exeter College, and of the Uni-
versity, and will be familiarized with the rules and regulations they are expected to abide by during
their residence in Oxford.
Throughout the academic year, provision will be made for trips to a number of sites of historical,
cultural, or political interest. In the past these have included the Cotswolds, Stratford, Stonehenge,
Bath, Wells, Warwick Castle, Blenheim Palace, and various sites of interest in London. Students will
also be given the opportunity to attend a number of theatrical productions and other cultural events.
Oxford's proximity to London gives students ready access to that city's multiple attractions and many
resources. The Oxford-London train service is frequent and the journey takes just over an hour. The
buses to London run even more regularly (and are cheaper), and the one-way journey takes about
ninety minutes. In recent years, students have also enjoyed a group overseas excursion at the outset of
the break between Hilary and Trinity terms, in 2002 to San Sebastian and Bilbao, in 2003 to Nice and
Monte Carlo, and in 2004 to Sicily.
During the summer before students arrive in Oxford, they will receive a copy of the latest edition of
Ephs Among the Dreaming Spires, which will further explain the perks, policies, and procedures of
the Programme, the rules and regulations they are expected to follow, and tips for how best to enjoy a
fulfilling year in and around Oxford.
ILLNESS AND INSURANCE
Students must ensure they are covered either by the Williams College health insurance policy or by
some other comprehensive health insurance plan (generally a family health insurance policy). While
in Britain, students will be covered by the National Health Service (NHS) for routine visits at the
Group Medical Practice used by Exeter College and for emergency hospital treatment. Prescription
drugs are available through the NHS for a nominal fee. There are limited outpatient psychological
counseling services available through the NHS and the Programme, although, as Visiting Students at
the University, Williams students are entitled to make use of the University Counseling Centre. Any
extensive or long-term counseling, however, would need to be covered by the student's personal
health insurance policy. Finally, students are not likely to be covered under the NHS for medical ser-
vices received in foreign countries, especially those countries that do not enjoy membership of the
European Union.
FEES
The tuition and room fees paid by students on the Williams-Exeter Programme at Oxford are the same
as those for a year spent in residence at Williams. Students are responsible for some of their own meals and
for all of their personal expenses. They are also responsible for the cost of their air travel to and from Brit-
ain, although they may select to take the group flight to London arranged by the Programme at competitive
rates. They are provided with three meals a day for the first four or five days in Oxford and with a weekly
catered meal in Ephraim Williams House during the eight weeks of term. They may also eat lunch and
dinner on any day of the week at Exeter. They will pay a small charge for lunch at Exeter, but dinner will be
provided free of charge. Students will not be charged the full Williams board fee during their year in Ox-
ford, but they will pay a proportion of the board fee to help cover these costs. For planning purposes, stu-
dents and their parents should expect the cost of a year on the Programme to be roughly the same as a year
at Williams. Financial aid eligibility will be figured on the usual basis of tuition, fees, room, board, and
personal and book expenses, as if the student were at Williams for the year. Similarly, the normal self-help
contribution would be expected. Since the academic year ends later at Oxford than at Williams, the sum-
mer earning expectations for students for the following year will be reduced by one half and the difference
will be made up by additional Williams aid.
APPLICATION
Admission to the Programme is on a competitive but flexible basis. Students must apply to the
Dean's Office by the prescribed deadline (normally early in February) and, prior to applying, should
consult with the chair of their major department. Any questions students might have about curricular
offerings at Oxford can also be raised with the director of the Programme in Oxford. In addition to
completing the formal application form, students can expect to be interviewed at Williams and will
subsequently need to complete an application for Visiting Student status at Oxford University. All
admissions to the Programme are subject to approval by Exeter College. Students can expect to be
notified of acceptance before Spring Break. It is normally expected that they will have completed the
College's distribution requirement by the end of their sophomore year. In making its decisions, the
Admissions Committee of the Williams-Exeter Programme at Oxford University takes student GPA

into account, expects all applicants to have demonstrated capacity for rigorous independent work and
extensive essay writing, and looks favorably on those students whose intellectual maturity, curiosity
and enthusiasm would best prepare them for a demanding course of study in Oxford. All applicants
must identify two Williams faculty members who are willing to provide references. Because of the
emphasis at Oxford on weekly written work for each tutorial course, at least one of those faculty mem-
bers should be able to offer an assessment of the applicant's writing ability.
WILLIAMS-MYSTIC MARITIME STUDIES PROGRAM
Director, JAMES T. CARLTON
Faculty: MARY K. BERCAW EDWARDS (University of Connecticut), JAMES T. CARLTON
(Williams College), LISA GILBERT (Mystic Seaport), GLENN S. GORDINIER (University of
Connecticut), CATHERINE ROBINSON HALL (Mystic Seaport), DANIEL BRAYTON (Midd-
lebury College).
The Williams College-Mystic Seaport Maritime Studies Program offers students a unique opportu-
nity to explore the ocean, to travel the Atlantic and Pacific Coasts, and to undertake original research
of their own design in the humanities and sciences. A term at Williams-Mystic satisfies both a semes-
ter's credit and one winter study requirement, as well as intensive writing course credit. Four Williams
courses are offered as an integrated, multidisciplinary curriculum in the semester-long program at
Mystic Seaport, in Mystic, Connecticut: Maritime History, Literature of the Sea, Marine Policy, and
either Marine Ecology or Oceanography (see the American Maritime Studies section in this catalog).
Williams College faculty members serve as the Director and Marine Scientist. Travel includes an off-
shore voyage on the open ocean sailing aboard a tall ship, a seminar along the Pacific Coast, and an
additional coastal field seminar, all of which are cross-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary exercises.
Students live in historic, cooperative, coed houses at Mystic Seaport, the world's largest maritime mu-
seum, and have full access to world-class maritime collections, a maritime library, well-equipped lab-
oratory, and diverse coastal habitats (where field research can be undertaken in a wide variety of envi-
ronments, ranging from tidepools and salt marshes to sandy beaches and estuaries). Students also par-
ticipate in maritime skills under professional instruction, with choices such as celestial navigation,
music of the sea, boat building, or small boat handling and sailing. Williams-Mystic seeks candidates
who are willing to try new things and work in a compelling academic environment. No sailing experi-
ence necessary, and all majors welcome--a typical semester at Williams-Mystic is represented by 12
to 14 different majors spanning the sciences and humanities. Sophomores, juniors, and seniors can
attend. Participation in Williams-Mystic can also be used in partial fulfillment of the Maritime Studies
Concentration at Williams. Interested students should contact Williams-Mystic at admissions@wil-
liamsmystic.org, call (860-572-5359), visit the website (williamsmystic.org), or obtain a Williams-
Mystic catalog from the Dean's office. Applications are on the web and at the Dean's office.

WINTER STUDY PROGRAM
REMINDERS ABOUT WSP REGISTRATION
All students who will be on campus during the 2004-2005 academic year must register for WSP.
Registration will take place in the early part of fall semester. If you are registered for a senior thesis in
the fall which must be continued through Winter Study by departmental rules, you will be registered
for your Winter Study Project automatically. In every other case, you must complete registration.
First-year students are required to participate in a Winter Study that will take place on campus; they
are not allowed to do 99's.
Even if you plan to take a 99, or the instructor of your first choice accepts you during the registration
period, there are many things that can happen between registration and the beginning of Winter Study
to upset your first choice, so you must list five choices. You should try to make one of your choices a
project with a larger enrollment, not that it will guarantee you a project, but it will increase your
chances.
If you think your time may be restricted in any way (ski meets, interviews, etc.), clear these restric-
tions with the instructor before signing up for his/her project.
Remember, for cross-listed projects, you should sign up for the subject you want to appear on your
record.
For many beginning language courses, you are required to take the WSP Sustaining Program in
addition to your regular project. You will be automatically enrolled in this Sustaining Program, so no
one should list this as a choice.
The grade of honors is reserved for outstanding or exceptional work. Individual instructors may
specify minimum standards for the grade, but normally, fewer than one out of ten students will qualify.
A grade of pass means the student has performed satisfactorily. A grade of perfunctory pass signifies
that a student's work has been significantly lacking but is just adequate to deserve a pass.
If you have any questions about a project, see the instructor before you register.
Finally, all work for WSP must be completed and submitted to the instructor no later than Thursday,
January 27th. Only the Dean can grant an extension beyond this date.
WINTER STUDY 99'S
Sophomores, juniors and seniors are eligible to propose "99's," independent projects arranged with
faculty sponsors, conducted in lieu of regular Winter Study courses. Perhaps you have encountered an
interesting idea in one of your courses which you would like to study in more depth, or you may have
an interest not covered in the regular curriculum. In recent years students have undertaken in-depth
studies of particular literary works, interned in government offices, assisted in foreign and domestic
medical clinics, conducted field work in economics in developing countries, and given performances
illustrating the history of American dance. Although some 99's involve travel away from campus,
there are many opportunities to pursue intellectual or artistic goals here in Williamstown.
99 forms are available online:
http://www.williams.edu/Registrar/winterstudy/99direct.html
The deadline for submitting the proposals to faculty sponsors is Thursday, 30 September.

nee, and attempt to define the nature of his unique contribution to American culture.
Method of evaluation: 10-page paper or an equivalent project.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit:25. Priority given to seniors.
Meeting time: three hours twice a week (Monday/Wednesday mornings); some mandatory film
screenings may occur outside of regularly-scheduled class time.
Cost to student: $100.

ANTHROPOLOGY AND SOCIOLOGY
ANSO 011 Berkshire Farm Internship
A field placement at Berkshire Farm Center and Services for Youth in Canaan, New York. Berkshire
Farm Center is a residential treatment facility for troubled, at-risk adolescent boys who have been re-
manded to the Farm by the Family Court. These youths come primarily from lower socio-economic
strata, are very ethnically diverse, and hail from both urban and rural areas throughout New York
State. The problems that they bring to Berkshire Farm are multiple. These include: the psychological
scars of dysfunctional families, including those of physical, emotional, and sexual abuse; chemical
dependency; juvenile delinquency; inability to function in school settings; and various other issues.
Residential treatment is a multi-modal approach that includes anger-replacement training, social
skills training, and behavioral modification.
Williams students will commute to Berkshire Farm and work under supervision in one of the follow-
ing areas: school, cottage life, chemical dependency unit, research, recreation, performing arts, or in
individual tutoring.
Requirements: students will keep a journal reflecting on their experiences, and a weekly seminar with
the instructor will draw on service learning experience. Students will also be required to submit a final
10-page paper at the end of the course.
Prerequisites: interview with instructor. Enrollment limit: 15--please note: all queries about this
course should be directed to the instructor, who can be reached at 518-781-4567 ext. 322.
Cost to student: none.

ANSO 012 Children and the Courts: Internship in the Crisis in Child Abuse
The incidence of reported child abuse and neglect has reached epidemic proportions and shows no
signs of decreasing. Preventive and prophylactic social programs, court intervention, and legislative
mandates have not successfully addressed this crisis. This course allows students to observe the Mas-
sachusetts Department of Social Services attorney in courtroom proceedings related to the care and
protection of children. Students will have access to Department records for purposes of analysis and
will also work with social workers who will provide a clinical perspective on the legal cases under
study. The class will meet regularly to discuss court proceedings, assigned readings, and the students'
interactions with local human services agencies. Access to an automobile is desirable but not re-
quired; some transportation will be provided as part of the course.
Requirements: full participation, a journal, and a 10-page paper to be submitted at the end of the
course.
Enrollment limit: 15--please note: all queries about this course must be directed to the instructor,

ture, the course will go on to consider the theory and practice of media based on the instructor's own
experiences shooting, scripting, and editing a documentary film on Afghanistan. The class will look at
raw footage shot in Afghanistan, clips and scripts from different stages of the editing process, as well
as the final film. Issues to be considered include the verite, of cinema verite, the pros and cons of narra-
tion, and the relationship between art and science in documentary production.

SOCIOLOGY
SOC 013 Puzzles and Puzzlers (Same as Russian 013)
Why do people spend their time doing puzzles? Why did riddles exist throughout history and cross-
words appeared only in the twentieth century? In literature, how do games and puzzles contribute to
the construction or subversion of meaning? What is the metaphorical significance of games and
puzzles, in literature and in real life? Is the game for the reader's benefit or is the reader part of the
game?
This course will approach puzzles from both sociological and literary perspectives, thus providing
students with the opportunity to analyze games and puzzles in literary texts while also assessing their
significance in contemporary culture through collaborative ethnography, interviews in and outside of
class and analysis of documents. Primary texts will include works by Nabokov, Borges, Calvino and
Eco; we will also consult theoretical writings by Caillois, Huizinga, Motte and the OuLiPo group. Ex-
ercises will include constructing a taxonomy of puzzles, interviewing puzzle-makers and puzzle-fans,
exploring trans-cultural and historical variations in crosswords and riddles, and integrating cultural
criticism with an appreciation of the puzzles' role in contemporary culture.
Course requirements: thoughtful and active class participation, several papers and take-home assign-
ments, a group presentation and a final paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit:19.
Meeting time: mornings, three days a week.
Cost to student: $75.

ARTH 012 Topics in Video Art: The Museum
In recent years video art has become a mainstay in many art museums worldwide, but this has not al-
ways been the case. This course will investigate the introduction and proliferation of video art into
museums paying close attention to the ways in which they have changed one another. The course will
investigate multiple approaches to video making including: performance documentation, found foot-
age, collage, narrative, abstraction, video diary, documentary, and installation, and how each of these

different types affects the curatorial process. Through selected readings, screenings and museum vis-
its, the course will address issues of display, the role of the audience, and approaches to collecting.
WCMA's Media Field gallery will serve as a test case and students will create proposals for exhibi-
tions in the space.
Evaluation will be based on participation in class discussions and museum visits. Short response pa-
pers to readings and screenings and one final
presentation/exhibition proposal. One to two visits to area museums or NYC depending on the exhibi-
tions on view at that time.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit:12: Preference given to ArtH 101-102 and/or ArtS 288.

ARTH 014 Out of the Closet: What Clothes, Costumes and Textiles Reveal in European and
American Art (Same as Theatre 014)
Why does the 16-year-old Hapsburg Queen of Poland wear lace AND chain mail in a seventeenth
century portrait by Joseph Heintz? This course addresses this paradox and other enigmas of costume
in European and American art at the Clark Art Institute in Williamstown. In paintings, as in life, cer-
tain clothes and fabrics can be used as emblems of power and prestige, and they yield both overt and
subtle information about the one who wears them. Each week this class will combine two two-hour
sessions of slide lectures and on site study of costumes and textiles in paintings and prints at the Clark
Art Institute with field trips to local New England collections of historical fashion, such as Historic
Deerfield's costume collection. The last field trip of the session, scheduled for January 27th, will be to
New York City. For the final project students will "curate" and write up a "virtual installation" of
paintings and prints at the Clark with specific emphasis on the iconography of clothing in the art-
works.
Requirements: regular attendance in class and field trips. 10 page paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 12.
Meeting times: Tuesday and Wednesday afternoons with field trips on Thursdays. Please note that
there will be no class on Wednesday the 26th. That class's lecture will be combined with the New York
City field trip scheduled for the 27th.
Cost to students: meals on field trips; transportation to and from New York City.

(See under Asian Studies for full description.)
ARTS 011 Monotype
Through this course students will explore the expressive qualities of the monotype, which combines the
fluidity of painting with the process of printmaking. We will use a variety of techniques including direct
additive and subtractive methods, use of non-traditional tools, direct-trace drawing, and collage. Discus-
sions of the relationship between process/technique and the image's intent will be emphasized. This class
will focus primarily on hand printing though a printing press will be available during class time. Students
will be encouraged to use daily sketchbooks and active observation to develop a personal visual voice.
Evaluations will be based on growth and development of work, effort, maintaining a daily sketchbook, at-
tendance, and class participation. Assignments will be progressive leading to a final portfolio of prints and
critique.
Prerequisites: Drawing I is recommended but not required. Enrollment limit:16.
Meeting time: afternoons, two three-hour classes per week and one local museum trip.

ARTS 013 Video Installation Art
This is a studio seminar exploring various approaches to Video Installation Art. Students will investigate
and interrogate some of the theoretical, aesthetic, and practical issues of Video Installation. This is primari-
ly a studio workshop, with some screenings and supplemental reading, but most of our effort will be put
toward each student making a final piece to install near the end of Winter Study. Students can work indi-
vidually or in collaborative groups.
Evaluation will be based on participation and assignments.
Prerequisites are either one art course, some experience with video production, or excitement about work-
ing with video installation. Enrollment limit:12.
We will meet three mornings a week for 2 hours with field trips and extra lab time scheduled as necessary.
Cost will be minimal ($10-$50), but subject to variation depending on material costs for projects.

tions for viewers to explore their own relationship with the world and to see how their ideas and ex-
pectations color experience. Often this is done using common objects, experiences, and humor, which
grounds the work in everyday life.
ARTS 014 Figure Drawing
Using the nude model as the primary source, students will be introduced to time honored techniques
and traditions of western art to draw the human form. The technical aspects of capturing gesture and
form of the figure through careful observation will be the departure point. Beyond an investigation of
rendering through direct observation students will be encouraged to pursue an individualistic ap-
proach to drawing the figure. To foster this, slide lectures will introduce students to a brief history of
figure drawing with an emphasis on twentieth century and contemporary masters. Students will en-
gage in drawing exercises meant to suggest the expressive possibilities of the figure. The course is in-
tended to expand students' ideas about how to make a drawing, what a drawing is and what it can be.
Students will be evaluated on the portfolio of drawings assembled during the course, attendance, par-
ticipation and effort. A minimum of three hours per week is expected of each student outside of class
to sketch and develop drawings as part of their class portfolios.
Prerequisites: ArtS 100. Enrollment limit:15.

ARTS 015 Large-Format Photography
The course is designed to introduce students to studio/view cameras, to processing the sheet-film neg-
atives made in them, and to making contact and projection prints. Studio exercises will include careful
analysis of camera movements to teach their use, and a consideration of lighting techniques; dark
room exercises will include the tray development of sheet film, determination of effective film speed,
and control of contrast through development time. The subject matter of the photographs produced in
the course will not be prescribed; it is limited only by the participants' imagination and the weather in
January. Working with subjects of their own choosing, students will be instructed in the principles of
traditional photographic image making by producing large-format negatives and translating them into
effective black-and-white prints in 4x5 and 8x10 formats.
Each student will be expected to make exhibition-quality prints, which may be enlargements or con-
tact prints from 4x5 negatives, or contract prints from 8x10 negatives. The prints will be exhibited in a
group show at the end of Winter Study.
Evaluation will be based on commitment to the course, participation in discussion sessions, and the
quality of the prints.
No prerequisites (although camera and darkroom experience a plus). Enrollment limit:10.
Meeting time: mornings; there will be six hours weekly for lectures, demonstrations and crits. At least
20 hours weekly in the darkroom are expected, under the supervision of a photo technician.
Cost to student: $200 lab fee.

ARTS 016 Systems and Chance
This course will be an introduction to making art through systemic procedures that allow chance ele-
ments to surface in the work. Combining specific rules with opportunities for accidents and visual
play, this approach has its roots in many fields, including systems art of the 1970's, where following
the procedure was often more important than the finished product, and Surrealist parlor games that in-
corporated nonsequiters, dreams, and random elements. Slide presentations will include 70's work by
Sol Lewitt, John Cage, Roman Opalka, Jennifer Bartlett, as well as other artists currently working in
similar ways. Media will include drawing, simple printmaking techniques (like rubber stamps), and
some less traditional materials (yarn, food, rope, etc.). While some of the projects will be individual
works, others will be collaborations. For example, the entire class may work on a revised version of
the Exquisite Corpse, where artists construct figures without seeing each other's work. Or each stu-
dent may be asked to create compositions based upon random elements (coins thrown onto canvas,
names in the phone book, dictionary definitions), enacting a kind of art game.
Evaluation will be based on the inventiveness and quality of the work, effort, completion of all assign-
ments, participation in critiques, and attendance.
We will meet twice a week for three hours. Students are expected to work outside of class to finish
their assignments.
No prerequisites, although ArtS 100 is recommended. Enrollment limit:12. Preference is given to jun-
iors, seniors, and sophomores, in that order.
Meeting times: Tuesday and Wednesday, 10:00 am--12:50 pm
Lab fee: $50 for basic materials. Depending upon the choice of assignments, students may have to

The city of Oaxaca is a unique place where age-old dialects, traditional art practices and religious cus-
toms coexist side by side with contemporary life. Living and studying in Oaxaca, Mexico will provide
students with the opportunity to experience the richness of culture that Oaxaca has to offer. This
course is designed as an exploration of Mexican culture and is centered on the teaching and enhance-
ment of Spanish, as well as, daily practical studio components in the making of art. Specifically, it will
be organized with morning Spanish classes, afternoon art studio classes, (focusing on drawing, sculp-
ture and collage), as well as frequent excursions to view museums, artist's studios, archaeological
sites, galleries and cinema. The hope is, that immersion into a culture so vastly different from our own
can have a profound and lasting effect on one's perspective with regards to life, culture and art. Stu-
dents will live with a Mexican family in Oaxaca, providing a greater opportunity to practice Spanish
and gain a deeper understanding of Mexican life.

JAPN 010 Japanese Animation
Read or Die is the title of a popular Japanese animated series about secret agents in the employ of the
world's great libraries. But what does it mean to read in an age and culture so dominated by visual me-
dia? This class is an introduction to the serious study of Japanese animation, or anime, and the chal-
lenges it poses to traditional ways of reading literature and film. We will screen a number of animated
Japanese feature films and television series, and look at related media like printed comics (manga).
We will also read the work of literature and media scholars who have tried to come to terms with man-
ga and anime, but one of the questions we will ask is whether written criticism can ever effectively
grapple with this material. To test this, one option for the final project will be a visual presentation
instead of a written paper: a storyboard, comic, animation, film, etc. that comments on the course ma-
terial in a sophisticated and illuminating way. Required activities: three 2-hour morning class meet-
ings per week and two 2.5-hour afternoon screenings per week, plus self-scheduled viewings, read-
ings, and a 10-page paper or visual project. Evaluation will be based on attendance, participation, and

NASA's space program has had many successes, but the choice between human and robotic space-
flight is difficult and significant. We shall study several of NASA's most interesting programs, includ-
ing both the beautiful images and the drama behind the scenes. The robotic programs include the
Hubble Space Telescope, the Galileo spacecraft at Jupiter, the Cassini spacecraft at Saturn, and Mars
rovers. The human spaceflight programs include the Apollo missions and their motivations, the Space
Shuttle, and the International Space Station. We will also consider future plans for robotic and human
exploration of the Moon and Mars. We will consider the impact of leadership decisions of presidents,
NASA Administrators, directors of institutes for NASA's Great Observatories (Space Telescope Sci-
ence Institute, Chandra X-ray Center, Spitzer Science Institute) and others. A field trip will include
meetings with scientific leaders and Washington-area astronomical sites.

ASTR 013 Image Processing in Science and Medicine (Same as Computer Science 013)
Images have long been fundamental in the sciences. With the discovery of x-rays this became true in
medicine as well. Digital imaging has become a staple throughout our society, but the nature and proc-
essing of a scientific image differs from that of an image obtained for artistic or commercial purposes.
This course will cover the principles and practice of image processing as applied to the sciences and
medicine, particularly astronomy and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We will discuss how im-
ages are acquired, including transformations from raw data to meaningful images. We will cover the
properties of images, their generalization to dimensions other than two, and fundamental operations
that may be applied to enhance features or extract particular kinds of information. Students will obtain
their own images using one or more of the following: an MRI scanner, an astronomical telescope, or
an electron microscope.
We will meet three times a week for two-hour morning sessions, and there will be weekly assign-
ments. Other required activities include a field trip (~9AM to 5PM) to a medical MRI facility, a night
(7PM to 10PM) of observing on the Hopkins Observatory 0.6-m telescope, and a visit to the Williams
electron microscope facility. Students will learn to use one or more image processing software pack-
ages, and will write their own software in Java.
Evaluation of student performance will be based on attendance, weekly assignments, and a final proj-
ect. The final project will be presented both in written form and as an oral presentation at a simulated
scientific conference.
The prerequisites for this course are Mathematics 105 or 106 (or equivalent taken elsewhere) and
some experience in any programming language. Enrollment limit: 10.
Cost to student: approximately $130 for the book.

es from the SEM in Adobe Photoshop. (Do you want your erythrocytes red or blue?) There will be
brief reading assignments, a guest speaker and a 10-page paper with 8 well focused micrographs re-
quired. The lab is scheduled to receive a new SEM this summer that will allow observation of wet

BIOL 012 Time, Tropism, and the Visual Image
This is a studio art class that will approach rendering the image from a technical and philosophical ori-
entation. Using gesture drawing and watercolor, students will focus on the concepts of motion and
stimulus in the figure as well as in botanical forms. Throughout the term students will be expected to
keep a journal (written, drawn and painted) that investigates motion, stimulus, and the passage of time
through daily observation. We will also view and discuss artworks at Williams College Museum of
Art that respond to the human experience of motion and time. The final project will be a synthesis of
what has been observed and internalized. Students will be expected to produce a series of works that
reveal their personal responses to the process of moving through life. Some themes might be coming
of age, aging, effects of stimuli, or nostalgia. Students will be evaluated based on the final project,
depth and detail of journal, and verbal participation in group critiques and discussions.

CHEM 010 Declassified Digging and US Foreign Policy in the Americas
In 1973 the democratically elected socialist Salvador Allende's presidential tenure ended in a bloody
coup and Allende's death. Recently the release of 24,000 declassified documents allow authors to re-
tell the history of the US foreign policy in Chile from the 1960s to early 1970s. In the first part of the
course we explore declassified documents on the CIA's covert operations in Chile through The Pino-
chet File by P. Kornbluh. Next, groups of students select a period of time between 1950 and 1974 and
look at newspapers, like the New York Times and the Washington Post, to identify the main events oc-
curring at that time. Finally, each group considers a place in the American continent, a particular year,
and an event that could be linked to possible activity by any US agency. What kind of information
could be found in archives of declassified documents in this place and time? For example, the late six-
ties are associated with student activities around the world, and given the extensive activity in Chile
by the CIA, we would also examine Mexico City, October 12 of 1968. The "Plaza de las Tres Cultu-
ras" massacre in Mexico City may also be linked to possible covert CIA operations.

Many artists' materials (in the form of support, pigments, coatings, and binding media) existed in very
specific times throughout history. Knowing this, we can create a timeline and begin to date art objects
by examining their material and how each object was manufactured. In this class, we choose an object
of questionable authenticity and immerse ourselves in it. For example, a painting of questionable au-
thenticity will have the pigments analyzed, the media analyzed, an x-ray will be taken, showing the

CHEM 025 Oriental Rugs: "Rugs that fly, rugs that crash, rugs that never leave the ground"
(Same as ArtH 025)
People, primarily women, have been weaving rugs for thousands of years, and rugs have played a cen-
tral role in the culture and commerce of many societies. This course explores the world of oriental
rugs, with an emphasis on the history, aesthetics, and economics of these extraordinary weavings, and
the dyestuffs used in their production. The course is divided between classes in Williamstown for the
first part of Winter Study, and a trip to Turkey, one of the great rug weaving centers of the world, for
the second part. We discuss the origins and ethnography of oriental rug weaving and designs, the
methods by which rugs are made, and the tactile and visual characteristics that make a rug
great--"one that flies"--from merely good--"one that crashes or perhaps never takes off"! We dis-
cuss as well the re-introduction of natural dyes into rug weaving about 25 years ago, and the econom-
ics of the rug trade, a world in which "caveat emptor" rules with a vengeance. We examine what fac-
tors determine the cost of making new rugs, what determines the values of "collectable rugs", the role
of bargaining in the market for rugs, and the methods that some rug dealers use to divide the gains
when they collude at auctions.
After a series of classes here in Williamstown and the examination of rugs and textiles from several
Massachusetts collections, the class proceeds to Turkey for about two weeks in Istanbul, Konya (Cen-
tral Anatolia), and the vicinity of Bergama (Western Anatolia). In Istanbul, we visit the well-known
cultural monuments of the Golden Horn, and see classical rugs in two museums, accompanied by
Turkish academic experts. We also see the market up close in the Grand Bazaar, and elsewhere in Sul-
tanahmet. Traveling to Konya, we visit museums, and see production of kilims (flatwoven rugs) and
felt rugs. In Bergama, we visit the original natural dye projects--which started a revolution in new rug
production. We then visit at least one repair workshop in Istanbul, and possibly also Sultanhami (near
Aksaray, in Central Anatolia, east of Konya), and discuss conservation issues. There may be an op-
portunity for dye analysis in the lab of Dr. Harald Bohmer of Maramara University in Istanbul, known
with others at Marmara for helping to revive the art of weaving in Turkey with natural dyes.
Evaluation will be based on classroom discussion, one 3 -5 page paper discussing an individual rugs
or group of rugs from an aesthetic perspective (due at the end of the trip), and a practicum on rug struc-
ture and provenance conducted in Turkey.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit:10. Placement is through interview prior to registration for the
course.
Meeting time: several mornings and some afternoons for extensive meetings during the first part of
Winter Study before traveling to Turkey for the second part of Winter Study.
Cost to student: approximately $150 per student for books and local travel, and about $2,250 for travel
to, and within, Turkey.

includes both concepts (such as "an eye for an eye") and specific laws (such as the law of the goring
ox) that were written into the Old Testament 1000 years later. In this Winter Study session, we will use
the Code of Hammurabi as a starting point for considering such offenses as manslaughter, assault,
rape, adultery, fraud and medical malpractice. Through analysis of formal law codes, contracts and
case records, we will learn about principles of personal responsibility and blood guilt, the status of
women and slaves in patriarchal societies, and royal and divine roles in the pursuit of justice.

COMPARATIVE LITERATURE
COMP 010 Living by Words: Surviving and Thriving in the Art and Sport of Rhetoric (Same
as English 010, Leadership Studies 013, and Special 013)
Whether dealing in the realms of public life, commerce, or academe, the speaker who can clearly and
cogently define or defend a policy, product, or theoretical position is usually the most successful. De-
pending on the venue and the aim of the speaker, the words might be artful and poetic, cajoling and
competitive, formally read from the page or seemingly delivered impromptu. This course will briefly
examine some of the classic styles of oratory from Ancient Greece to Madison Avenue. Students will
make visits to a variety of venues that employ a special style of professional discourse (TV and radio
stations, the Albany and Boston state houses) and learn a range of methods and techniques for practic-
ing the basics of effective spoken communication. The practical intent of the course is for participants
to develop confident, cogent, and dynamic presentation styles, to reinforce tight organizational focus
and relaxed, natural delivery, and to develop creative approaches to speaking in front of a group. The
course will guide participants through the presentation process from conception, outlining, and devis-
ing the message, to development of visual aids, message delivery, and handling question and answer
sessions. Methods employed will include vigorous pursuit of improvisational theater techniques and
vocal training. Participants will deliver brief presentations at each session and receive intensive per-
sonal coaching and a videotaped record of their personal progress. The final project will be a presenta-
tion at a public forum.
Evaluation will be based on active participation in the class, a written evaluation of a public presenta-
tion the student has attended, and successful completion of mini-presentations during Winter Study
and the final presentation at the end of term.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit:12.
Meeting time: mornings; 3 two-hour sessions per week and 2-3 field trips outside of Williamstown.

There will be in-depth study of the purpose of each part and of the different options available when
purchasing. Research will include finding good places to acquire the parts, most likely online, and will
require deciphering and explaining the jargon used. The students will have the choice of purchasing
their own parts and ending up with their own computer which they can take home, or to use existing
spare parts from the OIT basement to end up with a computer suitable for donation off campus or to
use as a campus email station. The class will be in a lab with the hardware, spare parts and tools for
assembly present. A final step will be the installation of an operating system and finding or download-
ing appropriate drivers for the hardware.

ECONOMICS
ECON 010 Taxes and Business Strategy
Taxes affect many individual and business decisions, especially decisions regarding saving and in-
vestment. This course provides a comprehensive framework for exploring how taxes affect such deci-
sions. We will apply this framework to a series of problems: 1) household saving decisions; 2) financ-
ing decisions of firms; 3) financing and location decisions of multinational corporations and 4) the
role of tax considerations in financial innovation. In addition to providing a framework for analyzing
how taxes affect business strategy, the course will also provide some basic information on how the
U.S. tax system works, especially with respect to business decisions. Several class sessions will be de-
voted to discussions of case studies of specific problems.

tion. In general, this class will emphasize to the economics of incentives. This course is intended for
CDE students only.
Evaluation will be based on class participation and a 10-page final paper. There is the possibility of
occasional visits by microfinance policy-makers/practitioners.

ECON 013 The Grameen Bank
"To argue that banking cannot be done with the poor because they do not have collateral is the same as
arguing that people cannot fly because they do not have wings." (Quote from Mohammad Yunus,
Founder of Grameen Bank). The Grameen Bank is arguably one of the most successful development
organizations in the world. Despite making small uncollateralized loans, it has very high repayment
rates. Grameen's borrowers are predominantly landless women. Its lending methods have been repli-
cated in many countries including the US. This course will examine the facts and the myths behind
Grameen and the microcredit movement. We shall also study village savings associations and the in-
centive problems with poverty reduction. This course will feature several documentary films and an
occasional visiting speaker (microcredit practitioner).
Evaluations will be based on class participation and presentations.
No prerequisites: Enrollment limit:15. If overenrolled, there will be a lottery to decide who gets in.
Meeting time: afternoons, two three-hour sessions per week.

ECON 014 Accounting
The project will examine the theoretical and practical aspects of financial accounting. Although the
beginning of the course will explore the mechanics of the information gathering and dissemination
process, the course will be oriented mainly towards users, rather than preparers, of accounting infor-
mation. The project will include discussion of the principles involved in accounting for current assets,
plant assets, leases, intangible assets, current and long-term debt, stockholders' equity, the income
statement and the statement of cash flows. Students will be expected to interpret and analyze actual
financial statements. The nature of, and career opportunities in, the field of accounting will also be
discussed. The project is a "mini course." It will present a substantial body of material and will require
a considerable commitment of time by the student, including regular attendance and participation in
discussion and homework cases and problems.

ECON 015 Stock Market
Elementary description and analysis of the stock market. Emphasis will be on the roles of the market
in our economy, including evaluation of business firms and the success of particular capital invest-
ments, allocating savings to different types of investment, and providing liquid and marketable finan-
cial investments for individual savers.
The course will focus on the description of mechanics of trading on various exchanges and other mar-
kets, stock market indexes of "averages" (Dow-Jones, S&P, 500, etc.), how to read the financial news,
historical rates of return on stocks and portfolios, role of mutual funds, beta coefficients, and "random
walk" theory. The course will also involve a brief introduction to financial reports of firms and analy-
sis of financial ratios.
Each student will participate in discussions, do some homework assignments and, as part of a team,
give two presentations and write a 10-page report analyzing the wisdom or folly of having chosen a
particular investment portfolio. The project grade will be determined on the basis of performance on
several quizzes and the written investment portfolio report.

ECON 016 Political Economy of Economic Strategy
Achieving economic growth and development requires more than just good policies-success depends
on a country's economic strategy working effectively in an integrated manner. The demands of com-
petent policy-making require balancing the competing interests of domestic and international inves-
tors, workers and the unemployed, bureaucrats and politicians, as well as other groups. Policy frame-
works need to address difficult trade-offs, and key stakeholders must lend their political support. In
the face of changing global circumstances and the dynamic pace of reform, policy-makers must eval-
uate and adapt economic strategies in order to support progress in achieving public objectives. This
course provides skills for evaluating economic frameworks, exploring the coherence and interdepen-
dence of the strategy and its likelihood to achieve policy objectives. The material integrates the les-
sons from the first semester, applying them to specific development experiences in several countries.
Evaluation will be based on class participation, policy papers and a final presentation.

ECON 017 Business Economics
In this course, the class will carry out a real-time forecast of the U.S. economy and explore its implica-
tions for the bond and stock markets. The course will build upon principles of both macro and micro-
economics. It will provide an introduction to the work done by business economists and the tech-
niques they use. An economic database, chart-generating software and a statistical analysis program
will be available to each student on the Jessup computers and, if necessary, on a disk for IBM-compat-
ible computers.
The first week will focus on becoming familiar with the database, looking for relationships between
key economic variables, and studying movements in interest rates over the period 1960-2002. Early in
the first week, the class will be divided into teams of 2 students with each team choosing a particular
aspect of the economy to forecast.
During the second and third weeks, the class will work with various leading indicators of economic
activity and will prepare forecasts of the key components of gross domestic product and other key
variables. We will also have several invited guests from the Wall Street investment world speaking on
various aspects of the stock market at regular and optional class sessions. The fourth week will feature
a formal presentation of the economic forecast with invited guests from the Williams College faculty.
To put the forecasting exercise in context, there will be class discussions of business cycles, credit
cycles, long waves in inflation and interest rates and the impact of the Internet on the economy and the
stock market.

ECON 019 Volunteer Income Tax Assistance
This course examines tax policy towards low-income families in the United States, and has the fol-
lowing three objectives: 1) For students to understand the shift of redistributive policy in the United
States from income support through the transfer system (Aid to Families with Dependent Children/
Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) towards support of working individuals through the tax
system (primarily the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)); 2) For students to understand the chal-
lenges that low income individuals have "making ends meet" and to understand the role that the EITC
has played in increasing the standard of living of the working poor; and 3) To enable students to under-
stand the tax code well enough to prepare simple income tax returns, including those for filers claim-
ing the EITC. Students will be trained by the IRS to prepare income tax returns for low-income indi-
viduals and families. At the end of the term, students will use their newly acquired expertise to help
individuals and families in Berkshire County prepare and file their returns.
Evaluation: Students must complete IRS VITA training; staff one session of tax preparation assistance
during the final week of winter term; and write a ten-page analytical and reflective essay.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 14.
Meeting time: mornings. Students are also required to participate in sessions with IRS trainers, with

ECON 020 Henry George, Eliminating Poverty
Henry George, an American economist (1839-1897) published "Progress and Poverty" in 1879. In
this he observes that with increasing wealth there is increasing poverty and he offers a solution to this
problem. We will study "Progress and Poverty" to understand his theory and his remedy and to under-
stand the possibility of its application today.
George's remedy is to tax land to the exclusion of all other taxes. Today the Georgist movement uses
this idea to encourage cities to modify the property tax, which, in most places, taxes land and buildings
at the same rate, to reduce the tax on buildings and to increase the tax on land to produce the same
yield. We will study the effect of shifting the property tax from buildings to land in the twenty Penn-
sylvania cities that have adopted this idea.
One of the great problems of the world today is that in many countries, a small minority of the people,
own most of the land. We will study the possible use of George's ideas to ameliorate this problem.
Evaluation will be based on attendance and the completion of a 10-page paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20.
The course will meet mornings for two hours on three days each week.
There will be no cost to students.

ECON 025 Evaluating Economic Strategy: A Case Study of South Africa's First Ten Years of
Democracy
South Africa's first democratic elections in 1994 ushered in a government committed to a social and
economic development program aimed at transforming the country. Ten years later, it is clear that the
government's economic policies have turned around an economy that was in crisis. Economic growth
has created jobs, but not enough to keep up with the increased number of people looking for employ-
ment. Development strategy has reduced poverty, but slowly, and enormous backlogs in social deliv-
ery of housing, health care and education still exist. South Africa remains one of the most unequal
countries in the world, grappling with the costs and benefits of globalization as the government em-
braces free trade and financial liberalization, yet attempts to implement policies aimed at reducing
poverty and improving social equity. What has worked, and what has failed? This course will provide
students with an overview of South Africa's social and economic strategy over the past ten years, and
an opportunity to explore first hand the dilemmas policy-makers face. Through meetings with Parlia-
mentarians and bureaucrats, businesspeople and social activists, teachers and students, labor leaders
and health care workers, the participants in this course will learn about the challenges, successes and
failures of South Africa's socio-economic strategy.
South Africa is a country of contrasts: international polls rank Cape Town as one of the world's three
most pleasant cities, yet minutes from the central business district smolder huge pockets of abject ur-
ban poverty. This course will investigate how such a skewed distribution of resources has evolved,
and what progress a democratic government has made in redressing the problem. A major part of the
course will focus on understanding the problem-visiting poor townships created as economically non-
viable entities, investigating inequities in the provision of education and health care, and compre-
hending the predicament of the rural poor.
Since 1999, poverty reduction has replaced macro stabilization as the central goal of South Africa's
policy framework. The market-oriented approach adopted by government, however, has left policy-
makers with few effective tools for achieving their objectives. The unifying theme of this course ex-
plores how public policy can further social development as a means of achieving economic growth
and reducing poverty. The course will examine the constraints imposed by the apartheid legacy, and
the distinct stages of the democratic government's approach to social and economic transformation.
Using economic data, first-hand observation and meetings with key stakeholders, students will ac-
quire skills in evaluating the effectiveness of the government's socio-economic strategy.

ENGL 012 Looking at Contemporary Documentary Photography (Same as ArtH 013)
This course explores the evolution of modern documentary photography. We will start with Robert
Frank's The Americans, and how Frank's singular vision deeply shaped the next generation of pho-
tographers working the American streets and landscape. Diane Arbus, Bruce Davidson, Lee Freid-
lander, William Klein, Danny Lyon, Gary Winogrand are some of the photographers whose work we
will get to know well . Discussions will include the new wave of independent and Magnum photojour-
nalists (Phillip Jones Griffiths, Josef Koudleka, Susan Meiselas, Gilles Peress, James Nachtwey, Alex
Webb, Ron Haviv and Tyler Hicks) and the wars from Vietnam to Bosnia to Iraq they cover as well as
the personal visions they explore. Insight into the diverse currents of documentary photography will
be explored through the work of Robert Adams, Bill Burke, Larry Clark, Lois Conner, Linda Connor,
Larry Fink, Nan Goldin, Emmet Gowin, Sally Mann, Mary Ellen Mark, Nicholas Nixon, and Abelar-
do Morell. The class will meet three mornings a week for two hours. Slide presentations will occupy
half of the first meetings and give way to discussion of issues in documentary photography. Students
will be encouraged to work on individual projects of their own choice. Each student will be required to
make a brief presentation to the class on a documentary topic of their choice. A final paper expanding
on this documentary topic will be due at the end of the course. Students will be evaluated on their
classroom presentation, general participation and their written work. A field trip to New York will let
us see first hand works from the collections at the Museum of Modern Art, Whitney Museum of
American Art and the International Center of Photography and meet with curators of photography at
these institutions.

you will choose the author you want to explore, compile a list of the author's complete works, and in
consultation with the instructor, decide how much of it you want to read, and assign two or three items
(poems, stories, chapters from novels, acts of plays, essays) to the rest of the class for reading and dis-
cussion. In the second week you will compile a list of biographies and autobiography, and do some
selective reading to discover how many "lives" your author had, what kinds of things the biographers
Winter Study Program
­ 358 ­
agree and disagree about, whether and how your author's life illuminates or complicates an under-
standing of the works. In the third week you will find out what's hot and controversial in critical and
scholarly discussions of your author. In the fourth week, you will draw on your reading to write an
imitation or parody of your author, complete with introductory commentary.
Evaluation will be based on annotated bibliographies and oral presentations in the first three weeks
(60%), and a written 10-page imitation or parody-plus-commentary in the final week (40%).
Prerequisite: any 100-level English class except 150, or any literature class in Comparative Literature

ENGL 015 Victorian Monsters
Victorian fiction conjured many of the monsters that still haunt our cultural imagination: Franken-
stein, Dracula, Jekyll and Hyde, and miraculously resurrected (or surviving) dinosaurs. This course
will focus on the original novels and stories from which these mythic figures emerged: Mary Shelley's
Frankenstein, Robert Louis Stevenson's "The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" Bram Stok-
er's Dracula, and Arthur Conan Doyle's The Lost World, considering their engagement with the dom-
inant cultural anxieties of their day and the grounds of their enduring appeal. We will also discuss a
few of the myriad film permutations of these stories, and students will do independent projects on the
evolution of one of these figures in popular culture.
Requirements: one 4-to 5-page paper and one presentation that will focus on the student's indepen-

the films by the directors themselves and by their critics. Students will view films by these directors as
well as those by John Singleton, Kassi Lemmons and Julie Dash. Theoretical essays will be assigned
in conjunction with film-viewings.

ENGL 017 Contesting the Frontier (Same as American Studies 017)
In 1893, the historian Frederick Jackson Turner claimed that the existence of the frontier had been the
source of the American character, which he defined as a mixture of practical wit, ceaseless energy, and
individual freedom. In his view, the frontier was a "free land" of "opportunity," an unmarked expanse
beckoning and demanding that Americans annex it. Yet the frontier was also a war zone, marked by
relentless and chaotic violence, and the frontiersman's freedom could be the occasion for an unravel-
ling of the self. The frontier was the site not only of the advance of one civilization, but the destruction
of a host of preexisting civilizations. And nature on the frontier was seen in any number of lights: a
willing partner in economic endeavor, a spectacle for aesthetic contemplation, or a wild and hostile
front posing only danger. This course will examine the problems of selfhood, national identity, and the
relationship of nature to culture which lent the myth of the frontier its ideological force. Readings in-
clude: Francis Parkman, The Oregon Trail; Charles Brockden Brown, Edgar Huntly; James Fenimore
Cooper, The Pioneers; A Son of the Forest, the autobiography of the Pequot William Apess; Thomas
Bangs Thorpe, "The Big Bear of Arkansas"; Zitkala-Sä, Native American Stories; Willa Cather, O

The course will examine the esthetic, documentary and therapeutic uses of photography in medicine
via three resources: the literature, guest speakers, and practice. We will examine how patients and
Winter Study Program
­ 359 ­
health care workers have been represented in the photographic medium, and how these representa-
tions have evolved with political and social changes. The goal is to sensitize us to the role of image-
based methods in representing various aspects of medicine. We'll look at some of the very first docu-
mentation of illness using photography in the nineteenth century, as well as the use of photography in
dealing with AIDS, breast cancer and other illnesses in the works of Hugh Diamond, Jo Spence, Nich-
olas Nixon and others. Contemporary documentary and fine art photographers dealing with these
themes will present their work in class. Lastly, class participants will be asked to photograph, and cri-
tique in writing, simple documentary assignments.
Requirements: consistent attendance and active participation in class and assignments.
Prior photographic experience is not required for this class. Enrollment limit: 10.

ENGL 019 Structuring Your Novel
This course is particularly designed for students who are currently wallowing in the morass of their
own novels, or who imagine themselves diving in and want to test the mud. Class time will be divided
between lecture/discussions and workshops; for the first half of the course, we'll talk about different
kinds of novels and different strategies for building them. I'll ask you to complete a number of short
sketches or plot summaries, which we will workshop in class. But you will also be working on a lon-
ger, more detailed summary, a scene-by-scene breakdown of an extended piece of prose fiction,
which can either be some pre-existing project that you bring in from outside the class, or else some-
thing generated out of the first two weeks. During the second half of the course, we will workshop
those. The goal is to finish with one functioning, detailed outline, and several small workable
sketches.

ENGL 020 Feature Writing for Magazines
Writing nonfiction feature articles for mainstream magazines is a uniquely viable way both to practice
the craft of writing and to make a living -- with more creativity than traditional journalism and far
more reliability than screenwriting. This workshop will immerse students in the genre, providing
tools for understanding and navigating the realm while guiding students through every step of writing
nonfiction for magazines. In short, students will learn how magazines work and how to write articles
that work for magazines. Nonfiction magazine writing is also known as literary journalism or creative
nonfiction. The best of this type of nonfiction shares many qualities with good fiction: It is artful yet
unaffected in its prose, strategic and structured in its narrative and vivid in its characterizations. But it
is also targeted very specifically to each magazine's distinctive audience and grounded firmly in facts
and ethics. This workshop will explore these issues as well as voice, tone, idea development, research,
the query process and, most vital of all, the writing of finished pieces. Students will write several short
and one long work of nonfiction, suitable for submission to magazines, and will refine these writings
through a round-table workshop process. Course readings will introduce students to top-quality liter-
ary journalism from the magazine world, including selections from authors such as Susan Orlean and
David Quammen. Students will be evaluated on workshop participation and on the writing of work-
shop assignments, including several short and one long work of magazine-style nonfiction, totaling
approximately twenty pages.
Prerequisites: any English Department creative writing or writing intensive course, or by permission
of the instructor.Enrollment limit:15.Selection criteria: In the event of over-enrollment, selection will
be made on the basis of writing samples.
Meeting times: afternoons, three times per week.

ENGL 022 Willa Cather: Art and Ambition (Same as American Studies 012, Classics 010,
Comparative Literature 013 and Women's and Gender Studies 010)
Though in the past often described as a "Nebraska novelist" or "a leading woman writer," Willa Cath-
er today is increasingly recognized simply as one of America's greatest authors. The first goal of this
course is to give students a chance to read and discuss a substantial selection of Cather's fiction dating
from the start of her career through 1926.
As we read these works, we shall pay particular attention to themes of art and ambition, especially as
they relate to the heroines of Cather's novels. This topic also has very personal relevance to Cather
herself, who strove relentlessly to become an ever more skillful artist-and who was also driven by
ambition to win public recognition, and to garner its rewards. Finally, I hope that reading Cather's
works with these themes in mind will stimulate students to think about questions they face as did
Cather-as they try to balance personal interests and values with the pressures of shaping one's career.
Schedule: three 2 1/2 hour meetings per week, probably 1-3:30 p.m, TWTh.
Evaluation will be based on participation and attendance, preparation of several short response papers
and a longer oral report, and a final term paper of at least 10 pages.
Cost to student: approximately $100 (for books and course packet).
The course will be open to students from all classes, without prerequisite. Enrollment limit: 12.

ENGL 023 Representing Jazz (Same as American Studies 023)
The music called "Jazz" has been, in substance and in its associations, a rich cultural signifier. This
course will examine various attempts in written and visual media, in commentary and in style, to defi-
ne "jazz" and its cultural significance. Texts will include essays, fiction, poetry, autobiographical
works, interviews, journalism, film clips, photographs, and paintings. We will give particular atten-
tion to musicians such as Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Billie Holiday, and Charles Mingus. We
will read texts by LeRoi Jones (Amiri Baraka), Ralph Ellison, Albert Murray, Bob Kaufman, Ntozake
Shange, Whitney Balliett, and others.
Requirements: Students will be expected to contribute actively to the in-class analysis of texts and im-
ages. A class presentation and a final 10-page paper will also be required.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit:15. Preference given to students with prior course work in African-
American Studies, jazz, or photography.
Meeting time: mornings, three times a week.

ENGL 025 Desert Places
Desert Places explores the American tradition of seeing Sonoran deserts as dangerous, waste, or
empty places available for development by Euroamerican settlers without regard for natural or cultur-
al history. Among the "utopian" sites studied will be Tucson (both the downtown and its sprawling
surround of resort and retirement communities); the University of Arizona Desert Laboratory; Indian
gaming resorts; Biosphere 2 and Arcosanti. We'll frame our approach to these sites by looking at ways
some earlier cultures (Tohono O'oodham, Hopi, Mexican) accommodated and responded to the
area's stringent ecology. We'll spend one or two nights camping in the desert if it can be arranged.
The course will begin with ten days of classes at Williams, followed by a sixteen-day trip to Arizona.
In addition to site visits and talks with local ecologists and historians, we'll read works of literary and
cultural history (Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca, William Finnegan, ) deep ecology, urban develop-
ment, and systems theory.
Evaluation will be based on class attendance, participation, two to three short site-specific papers that
they'll present during class meeting in Arizona, and a final 8-page interpretive paper. In the event of
overenrollment, selection for the course will be based on a short statement of interest.
Prerequisites: a one-page statement of interest, due by December 1st. Enrollment limit:10.
Meeting time: In Williamstown, three mornings a week; in Arizona, four days a week, flexibly ar-
ranged according to the logistics of travel and site availability.
This course is not defined as a "trip" for financial aid purposes. The maximum reimbursement to fi-
nancial aid students is $500.
Cost: approximately $950.
ROSENHEIM
ENGL 027 My Favorite Director
This course gives students an opportunity to do research on their favorite film directors and in an oral
presentation share what they have learned. The first half of the course will be devoted to developing a
filmography and an annotated bibliography of 10 items (e.g., reviews, articles, books or chapters) on
the director each student chooses. We will be working with a librarian to facilitate this part of the
course. One reading about each director or one of his/her films will be recommended for reading by
the whole class (this should be approximately 10-15 pages long). During this time, we will also screen
one film by each director for the whole class to view. There will be oral presentations during the sec-
Winter Study Program
­ 361 ­
ond half of the course, and students should also turn in their filmographies, bibliographies, and an out-
line of their oral presentation at the end of Winter Study. Students may choose to augment their oral
presentations with video clips from the directors' films.
Requirements: annotated bibliography, filmography, oral presentation.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 8.

ature, and drawing. Students will spend time outdoors learning the ecosystem of the Williamstown
area and time indoors doing observational drawing, reflective writing, and reading and discussions of
nature literature. The writing component of the journal will be the equivalent of a 10-page paper. The
month's work will be contained in a nature journal, to be displayed and discussed as part of a final
project. Designed for students with interests in environmental studies, natural history writing, and
drawing.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit:12.

ENVI 013 The Law and the Literature of the Environment: The Environment on Trial
This course will trace the development of an American consciousness towards the environment
through an examination of the historical and political roots of our law and literature. "Law" includes
state and federal judicial decisions and legislation. "Literature" includes not just the written word but
also painting, sculpture, and music. An important question to be addressed in this course is why so
many Americans can be so passionate on environmental issues, for instance, barring the Arctic Na-
tional Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas exploration, when almost none of us will ever set foot on the Ref-
uge itself. Our journey to understand this quintessentially American phenomenon begins with the Pu-
ritans of New England, the planters of Virginia and their predecessors. Among the other subjects to be
considered are the influence of the frontier and the important role played by the ready availability of
seemingly endless land, Thomas Jefferson and the Lewis and Clark Expedition, Emerson and Tho-
reau, Manifest Destiny, the paintings of Thomas Cole, Albert Bierstadt, Frederick Remington and
others, the beginning of the environmental protection movement, Frederick Jackson Turner and the
end of the frontier in 1890, the establishment of the forest service and the national park systems, Teddy
Roosevelt and the debate between conservation v. preservation, the music of Aaron Copeland, Woody
Guthrie and others, Rachel Carson and Silent Spring, environmental "trigger" disasters, the crucial
year, 1960, and the decade that followed, NEPA, EPA and the role of the courts, Mr. Justice Douglas'
dissent in Sierra Club v. Morton, and the approach of the current national administration.
Evaluation will be based on attendance and classroom participation. Students will prepare a 10-page
analytical paper or, alternatively, four 3-page short papers which will present one or more sides of an
issue and form the basis for classroom discussion. They will be asked to defend or reject the conclu-

sions reached or approaches taken by our courts and legislatures and by our literature, as broadly de-
fined, on environmental issues.

ENVI 014 We are What We Eat?--A Field Study
Where does our food come from? Is there enough on hand in the region for a secure supply for all of
us? Can or should more food be produced locally? Is farmland still being lost here? Who is hungry in
our community, and why? Are diet-related diseases a local problem? These are all questions that are
answered by undertaking a Community Food Assessment (CFA), which is the focus of this course. A
CFA examines a broad range of food related issues and resources in order to inform actions to improve
community food security. Community food security is achieved when all citizens obtain "a culturally
acceptable, nutritionally adequate diet through local, non-emergency sources." In an unstable world,
with many unsustainable practices, knowledge of the local food system can be a valuable asset. Stu-
dents in this course will collect data on our food system by interviewing, surveying, direct observa-
tion, and conducting focus groups in the community. We will also take advantage of the Internet, GIS,
and groundwork laid by local organizations such as Berkshire Grown. Students' interests will deter-
mine our goals, possibly including underutilized farmland, barriers to healthful eating, community
gardens, sources of food eaten locally, quantification of foods grown locally, etc.
We will meet twice a week for 3-hour sessions of plotting strategies, sharing data, and working on
computers individually. It is expected that students will spend at least 20 hours per week on aspects of
data collection, including time spent traveling in the community. The outcome of the course will be a
group report on the regional food system, with individual students writing chapters of at least 10 pages
in length.
Students will be evaluated on their written contribution and participation.
Enrollment limit: 20.
Meeting time: afternoons.
Cost to students $40.

GEOS 012 Landscape Photography (Same as Environmental Studies 012)
This class will broaden students' appreciation for the appearance and history of the landscape and
teach the skills of making a successful photograph. Williamstown, situated in a valley between the
Green and Taconic Mountains and bisected by the Green and Hoosic Rivers, is a place of great natural
beauty. The local landscape is a subject that inspires both professional and amateur photographers al-
ike. While Williamstown will be the subject of most of our work, we will use it to learn principles of
universal application. Students will discover the importance of light in making a photograph. They
will also learn camera skills and the mechanics of photography to make slides, which will be reviewed
Winter Study Program
­ 363 ­
at biweekly class meetings. In addition to photographing and critiquing slides, the class will visit
collections at the Clark Art Institute and WCMA to see original work and examine and discuss books
on reserve at Sawyer Library. An overview of the history of landscape photography will be provided
with an emphasis on American workers such as Carlton Watkins, William Henry Jackson, Edward
Weston, Ansel Adams, and Alvin Langdon Cobern. We will also demonstrate examples of different
cameras such as medium format, view cameras, and panorama cameras. Students will produce a body
of successful photographs/slides that will be projected at the Winter Study presentation day. Students
will submit short written explanations with each of their photographic assignments.
Evaluation will be based on attendance, the student's photography, and their presentation.
Prerequisites: students will need a 35mm camera. Enrollment limit:15. Preference given to first-year
students and sophomores.
Meeting time: mornings; 3 days a week for the first two weeks and 2 days a week after that; short field

GEOS 025 Baja California Field Geology
Participants on this trip will spend two-and-a-half weeks on the Baja Peninsula and islands in the Gulf
of California. After assembling in San Diego, CA, the group will drive south along the trans-peninsu-
lar highway (MEX 1) to the city of Loreto, visiting geologic outcrops and eco-regions that illustrate
the unusual tectonic and biological history of the Baja Peninsula and adjacent Gulf of California.
Once at Loreto, the group will travel by boat to Carmen and Coronado Islands. Participants should ex-
pect primitive conditions and should be willing to contribute to the duties of communal camp life.
Extended stops will be made at two unstudied Gulf of California coastal basins. The basin at San Fran-
ciscito is Pliocene in age and formed in granites of (Cretaceous?) age. The basin at Coronado Island
abuts the south side of a Pleistocene age volcano. During the trip students will learn to measure strati-
graphic sections, map geologic units, collect and identify fossils, and synthesize geologic and biologic
data. Course evaluation will be based on completion of a daily journal and a geologic map with ex-
planatory text for the San Franciscito project (10-page equivalent).
Prerequisite: Geoscience 253T. Enrollment limit: 10.
Cost to student: $850 plus $200 contribution from food plan. A portion of the trip expenses will be

HISTORY
HIST 011 Lost in Translation? Portrayals of Japan in American Films
Hollywood seems to have an enduring fascination with imaginatively recreating certain Japanese cul-
tural icons: the noble samurai, violent yakuza, demure Japanese woman, and stoic businessman. This
course will examine the history of how American films have portrayed Japan, from the late 1950s to
the present. We will consider questions of how and why images of Japan have changed over this peri-
od, whether or not films can and should endeavor to capture "the real", and how we should understand
these film portrayals. Our discussions will be grounded in some theoretical reading, including works
on Orientalism, and the history of U.S.-Japan relations in the post-World War II period. Films to be
shown will include "Sayonara" (1957), "The Barbarian and the Geisha" (1958), "Tora! Tora! Tora!"
(1970), "Gung Ho" (1986), "Black Rain" (1989), "Rising Sun" (1993), "The Last Samurai" (2003),
and "Lost in Translation" (2003).
Evaluation will be based on class participation and one 10-page paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit:20.
Meeting time: mornings; 2-3 sessions per week.
Cost to student: $30 for books and photocopies.

HIST 012 Reading Childhood
What books did you love when you were a kid? What books did and over? Were there book characters
you knew as well as real people? As adults, how does the literature we read as kids continue to influ-
ence us emotionally and intellectually? How significant a part of childhood is reading? How do book
illustrations and reading aloud influence our relationships with books? In this class, we will re-visit
the books we loved as children with children. Each college student will work with an elementary
school student. Together you will both read each other's favorite books and talk and write about them.
Depending on the age of your partner and their inclination s/he and you may want to do some illustra-
tions as well. We will read discuss a few readings on memory and the history of childhood as a class,
but your primary work will be the literature you read with your school age reading partner.
Requirements will include a book list drawn up by you and the child, additional works of children's
literature, and brief readings we will do as a class. Students will also turn in a record of correspon-
dence between you and the child, and two 5-page papers on children's literature--one autobiographi-
cal and one analytical.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit:12.
Meeting time: mornings, 2-3 sessions per week.

HIST 013 Dances With Stereotypes?: American Indians on Film (Same as American Studies
013)
Cinematic representations of American Indians have seemingly abandoned the negative stereotypes
of early Westerns. In the last thirty years, film makers have increasingly professed their concern for
historical accuracy and cultural sensibility in representing Indian subjects. In this course, we will test
these claims by examining old and new representations of Indians in mainstream American films and
by comparing these representations with those found in foreign films and films directed and produced
by American Indians. How and why have images of Indians in mainstream American films changed?
To what extent have they remained the same? To what extent are foreign and American Indian films
proposing alternative ways of representing Indian history and culture? To answer these questions, we
will not only watch a number of movies but also read short essays on American Indian history, film
history, and movie reviews. Evaluation will be based on class participation and a 10-page paper
comparing two or more movies. Films we will see include: Broken Arrow; Little Big Man; How Tasty
Was My Little Frenchman; The Mission; Powwow Highways; Dances With Wolves; Black Robe;
Smoke Signals.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit:25.

HIST 014 Women and Politics in the Middle East: The Long Twentieth Century (Same as
International Studies 014 and Women's and Gender Studies 014)
If women hold up half the sky, why have they not played a larger role in Middle Eastern politics during
the twentieth century? Has the role of women been insignificant, or merely unrecognized? What is-
sues regarding women's participation in the political arena are specific to the Middle East, and what
have global relevance? Starting with the late Ottoman Empire (1870s), this course examines the vari-
ous roles women have played in the political life of the modern Middle East, from the colonial/man-
date era, through the struggles for independence, to the current day. We will consider participation
through both formal (voting rights, candidacy for electoral office) and informal (influence within the
family, popular protest) channels. Throughout this period, the precise nature and extent of women's
participation has been a matter of public debate. Using primary and secondary sources, we will ex-
amine the political, economic, social, and religious arguments that have been advanced throughout
the twentieth century to both promote and limit women's participation in the political realm.
For the final paper, students will have the option of working either chronologically or thematically:
analyzing the historical experiences of a particular nation-state, or analyzing the regional significance
of a particular issue and/or set of arguments regarding women's participation in political life.
Meeting time: mornings, 2-3 sessions per week.
Evaluation will be based upon regular attendance, response papers and a 10 page final paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit:20.
Fees include $25 reading packet and two books.

HIST 025 Cool Iceland: The Art of Cultural Survival
Iceland is cool, both literally and figuratively. For centuries, people barely managed to survive in this
remote and cold place at the edge of the world. Recently, however, Icelanders have come to enjoy one
of the highest standards of living in the world with an incredible diversity in artistic production. So
how do a people and a culture manage to stay alive in an unforgiving climate? Why is this cultural pro-
duction so lively and thriving? And how does Iceland's unique nature and history influence its con-
temporary artists? In this travel course, Williams students will be exposed to how Icelanders bring
light to their long and dark days of winter. The vibrant Icelandic art scene will be explored by visiting
Icelandic artists, galleries, and art schools; we will listen to Icelandic musicians, rappers, rockers and
classical musicians, to assess how nature and light may or may not spark artistic flares. We will con-
sider whether Icelanders view themselves as Icelandic or part of a universal cultural movement. We
will also explore the art of making money in Iceland, especially how entrepreneurs have utilized Ice-
land's nature, such as a cutting-edge genetics company, geo-thermal plant, and adventure tourism.
Requirements: an introductory session will be held in Williamstown prior to the trip, approximately
300 pages of reading on Icelandic culture, and a final project/paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit:12.
Cost to student: approximately $1750, which includes airfare, lodging, domestic transportation, and
some meals.

LEAD 011 Managing Non-Profits: An Insider's Look
This course will focus on the study of the particular skills needed to run a successful non-profit orga-
nization, which include administration, creative vision, financial management, fund raising, and pub-
lic accountability. It will also consider, absent the profit motive, what spurs a non-profit's pursuit of
excellence. The syllabus is based on a series of case studies, involving presentations by administrators
and directors from arts, social service, educational, and environmental organizations. Notable institu-
tions, such as the New York City Ballet and MASS MoCA, will be represented. Class discussion will
be informed by assigned readings and organizational materials.
Student evaluation will be based on class attendance (which is required) and acceptable preparation as
evidenced by class participation and familiarity with the assigned readings and other materials. One or
two students will be assigned to each class to act as leaders of the class discussion. They will be re-
sponsible for: (1) familiarizing themselves with the organization and the guest speaker; (2) undertak-
ing additional reading and research on the subject of the organization's mission; and (3) preparing
questions and discussion points. Each student will prepare an evaluation on each non-profit after its
case study. Finally, a 10-page paper will be due by the last day of class in which the student: (1) evalu-
ates the organizations and executives s/he has studied in terms of integrity of mission and effective-
ness in forwarding its cause; and (2) identifies the common characteristics or traits shared by the non-
profit executives who s/he considers most successful.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15. Preference given to juniors.
Class will meet three times each week, for three hours in the afternoon. A three-day trip to New York

LEAD 014 The Essentials of Leadership in Xenophon and Tolkien
Peter Drucker claims, " The earliest writers on the subject...know all that has ever been known
about leadership. The scores of books, papers and speeches on leadership...that come out every
year have little to say on the subject that was not already old when the Prophets spoke and Aeschy-
lus wrote. The first systematic book on leadership: the Kyropaidaia [The Education of Cyrus] of
Xenophon--himself no mean leader of men--is still the best book on the subject." In this course
we will explore this claim by taking a "liberal arts" approach to the study of Leadership. We will
study Xenophon's Education of Cyrus and Tolkien's Lord of the Rings to learn how to be better
leaders.
Students will be evaluated through their individual classroom participation, team presentations
and the writing of a 10-page analytic paper.
Prerequisites: familiarity with Tolkien's Lord of the Rings will be assumed. Enrollment limit: 16.

i.e. National Outdoor Leadership School, Outward Bound etc., that will provide a suitable learning
environment and be at least 22 days in length. The Director of the Williams Outing Club will assist
students in their search if necessary. Upon choosing a program and being accepted, students will
meet with the Director in a pre-program meeting in December to create a framework for observing
group dynamics and studying a variety of leadership styles. A required ten-page paper based on
their journals will be required immediately after their return to campus for the start of third quarter.
There will also be a follow up class to debrief the experience in the first week of February. All pro-
grams must meet with the approval of the Outing Club Director.
Requirements: course approval by WOC Director, daily journal writing with focus on leadership
and group dynamics, ten page paper and 2 class meetings pre and post trip.
Student assessment will be based on ten page paper and class discussions.
No prerequisites. Not open to first-year students. Interested sophomores, juniors and seniors must
consult with WOC Director before registration. Enrollment limit:20.
Cost to student will vary depending on the program selected--range is generally from

LEGAL STUDIES
LGST 010 Inside the Judicial System
Students in this course will learn how the Massachusetts Trial Court works through discussion with
faculty, reading and site visits to local courts. In addition to observing court proceedings, students
Winter Study Program
­ 368 ­
will have ample opportunity to meet with court personnel in order to gain insight into how person-
nel view their role and function. The main focus of this course will be on local or community courts.
In Massachusetts, the District Courts have jurisdiction over a wide variety of matters and can have a
significant impact on the quality of life of a community. Students may be surprised to learn that
judges have a finely honed appreciation of the court's aspirations and mission. Nevertheless it is
worthwhile to question whether these aspirations are apparent to the public and if they meet the
public's expectation of what courts should be.
Requirements: Students are expected to read materials, participate in weekly seminars, spend no
fewer than 30 hours at an assigned court site, maintain a journal, and write a 10-page final paper.
Students taking this course are also expected to meet with faculty before the end of the Fall term on
the campus at a time to be arranged. The purpose of this meeting includes an overview of the sylla-
bus and discussion and selection of court sites.
Meeting time: TBA.

LING 010 Surviving Your Fifteen Minutes: An Intensive Look at the Phenomenon of Reality
Television
What is reality television? When did it start? Where is it headed? Why do so many people love it?
And just how real is it, really? To help answer these questions, we will read and discuss various
scholarly works on the topic of reality television. In addition, during the middle two-thirds of the
course, selected students will be immersed in a highly competitive simulation of the reality tele-
vision show Survivor, voting each other out of the simulation in order to be the last one standing
and the winner of the ultimate prize! Because of the nature of the simulation, attendance is abso-
lutely mandatory for students in the simulation. There is also room in the course for students inter-
ested in the topic and in helping to observe and to run the simulation but who cannot or do not wish
to compete in the actual simulation itself. The course concludes with a hands-on analysis of the
editing process, as we find out how malleable reality can be, how lies can be spun out of truth, and
how heroes and villains can be edited from the same source. Students will work together to write
up the story of their collective experiences in the simulation, to be published in weekly install-
ments (in the spring in the Record and/or on the web), giving everyone in the course a chance at
their own 15 minutes.
Evaluation will be based upon attendance, participation in the simulation, a final 10-page paper
on some scholarly aspect of reality television, and documentary-style summaries of the events of
the simulation. The number of required summaries depends on performance in the simulation.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit:20. Selection based on lottery.
Meeting time: mornings, 4 three-hour meetings per week (M, T, W, and R)
Cost to student: about $50 for readings and other materials.

MATH 012 Interpersonal Conflict Resolution (Same as Leadership Studies 015 and
Psychology 015)
Think back to the most recent disagreement you had with a member of your family, a teacher, or a
friend. What conflict style did you employ? Were you assertive or did you give in easily? Did you get
angry and upset or were you calm and rational? Were you satisfied with the outcome or could you
have done something to handle the situation better? What about the other person involved in the dis-
agreement? Every day we observe and engage in these types of interpersonal conflicts. Rarely,
though, do we take the time to analyze these conflicts and consider techniques for productive resolu-
tion. In this class, we will discuss the history and theory of interpersonal conflict, conflict resolution,
and mediation. The class format will be a mixture of lecture, discussion and activities in which stu-
dents will practice conflict resolution and mediation techniques.
Evaluation will be based on homework exercises, participation in class discussions and activities and
a final 10-15 page paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit:12.
Cost to student: approximately $90 for books
Meeting times: mornings, six hours per week.

MATH 013 Pilates: Fitness, Philosophy, and Physiology
This course is an introduction to Pilates mat work. Often referred to as the first physical therapist, Jo-
seph Pilates was dissatisfied with existing approaches to exercise at the turn of the last century. He
studied both Eastern methods of exercise such as yoga which focused on relaxation and breathing and
Western methods which concentrated on building strength and endurance. He combined different
Winter Study Program
­ 370 ­
qualities of both methods in an attempt to create an ideal form of physical training. Pilates focuses on
the core muscles: the abdominals and back. We will study the Pilates mat exercises in detail, including
performance, physiology, breathing, muscular emphasis, and modifications. We will also discuss the
philosophy behind the exercises. This course is intended for those students with little to no previous
experience with Pilates, but with some dance or fitness background/experience.
Evaluation will be based primarily on class participation, weekly quizzes, and a final 10-page paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit:10.
Meetings time: 10:00 a.m.--12:00 p.m., Monday-Thursday each week. (One hour Pilates class, one
hour lecture.)
Cost to student: approximately $100 for equipment (including fitness ball, dynaband, and Pilates
magic circle) and books.

MATH 014 Fantasy Novels of C.S. Lewis and Charles Williams (Same as English 028)
Both Lewis and Williams were members of The Inklings, the remarkable group of British authors and
thinkers who met regularly at "The Eagle and Child" Pub in Oxford, where writers (including Tol-
kien) read their works in progress to one another. Lewis is well-known; the works of Williams have
received less recognition, but were admired by W. H. Auden, Dorothy L. Sayers, and T. S. Eliot. Both
Lewis and Williams approached their work as staunch Anglican Christians, and their point of view
will be respected in this course; however, their novels can speak to the lives of all readers who are sen-
sitive to their own world and to human relationships.
Readings will include the Ransom Trilogy of Lewis: Out of the Silent Planet, Perelandra, and That
Hideous Strength (often called "the Charles Williams novel written by C.S. Lewis), and Williams's
War in Heaven and Descent into Hell (which Lewis listed as one of the ten books which most in-
fluenced his own thinking). The month will conclude with Lewis's final novel Till We Have Faces.
Evaluation will be based on attendance and participation in all discussions. The final project will be a
10-to-20-page short story in the style of, incorporating some ideas of, or using literary techniques of
the novels read. Alternatively, students may choose to write an expository or critical paper of about 15
pages relating some or all of the novels read to other fiction by these two authors or to works of com-
parable writers such as George MacDonald, Madeleine l'Engle, or J.K. Rowling.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit:14.
Cost to student: $40-$70 for books.
Meetings time: mornings.

MATH 016 Knitting: The Social History and Craft Form
Creating fabric out of interlocking loops can be traced back to the Neolithic period, and knitted like
artifacts 1600 to over 2000 years old have been found in Egypt, Peru, and Sweden. Knitting requires
little machinery and can be done almost anywhere yet requires a significant amount of learned skill.
Knitting techniques have been handed down through generations, shared in small groups, and trans-
ferred between cultures as trade routes emerged. The social history of knitting is a rich reflection of the
history of culture.
This course examines the social history and technique of this important craft. We will examine the so-
cial history of knitting through a sequence of readings, lectures, and discussions. Reading list in-
cludes: No Idle Hands: The History of American Knitting, by Anne L. MacDonald, related articles
provided by the instructor, and Reader's Digest Knitter's Handbook, by Montse Stanley.
We will engage a series of project samples designed to introduce and improve skills of beginning knit-
ters, starting with simple blanket squares, a knitted cap, and culminating in a final project of a basic
sweater. Students will also be required to select and research some aspect of knitting and write a
10-page research paper. Topics will need pre-approval of the instructor.
Evaluation will be based on participation, projects and final a10-page research paper.
No prerequisites. Preference given to beginning knitters. Enrollment limit:15.
Meeting time: three 2-hour evening periods every week.
Cost to student: approximately $70 for materials kit and $45 for textbooks.

MUSIC
MUS 010 The Many Faces of Carmen
The story of the gypsy femme fatale Carmen still fascinates; in Western culture she exemplifies the
seductive, exotic, independent and forbidden female who drives a fine upstanding man to a life of
crime and finally murder. This course explores a broad array of tellings of this archetypal narrative,
focusing on their multifaceted textual and musical constructions of individual and group identities,
encompassing gender and sexuality, "Otherness", nationality and ethnicity, and socio-economic iden-
tification. We begin with Prosper Merimee's 1845 novella on which Bizet based his 1875 opera Car-
men, and conclude with the MTV production Hip Hopera: Carmen starring Beyonce Knowles in the
title role. In between these poles we will consider Bizet's opera as a stage work and then in various
film transformations, including DeMille's silent film of 1915; the 1948 Hollywood version calledThe
Loves of Carmen with Rita Hayworth; Preminger's 1954 film of Hammerstein's all-black musical
Carmen Jones; Carlos Saura's flamenco version from 1983; and the contemporary Russian composer
Shchedrin's 1991 modern dance version.
Evaluation will be based on class attendance and participation; and a 10 page paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit 30; preference to first-years and sophomores.
Meeting time: three two-hour morning meetings per week.
Cost to student: $20 for reading packet.

MUS 011 Music and Film
This course will involve an intensive study of the history, theory, and interpretation of film music. We
will begin by creatively considering how film and music might be united in the cinema and with
introductory readings in film music theory and history. We will then focus our interpretive and analyt-
ical work and class discussions on selected films. While most of our attention will be devoted to the
work of major composers and directors of American and European film (with possible examples from
Japanese and Indian cinema), we will also consider more specialized subjects related to the instruc-
tor's research. Sample topics to be explored include: music and the silent film; Hollywood musicals;
opera and film; Herrmann and Hitchcock; Rota and Fellini; music's role in cinematic propaganda;
rock music video; Kubrick's musical decisions; psychoanalytic interpretations of film sound.
This course will meet for two hours three times a week in the morning. Students are also required to
attend three 90-120 minute film screenings each week either in the late afternoon or early evening in

MUS 013 Tuning and Temperament
This course explores practical, theoretical and historical aspects of tuning and temperament. The need
for temperaments--corrections and compromises to tuning systems with pure intervals--became ur-
gent in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, as changes in musical style (the rise of fixed-intona-
tion keyboard instruments, the advent of major/minor keys and concomitant increase in modulatory
range) made more apparent the incommensurability of pure-intoned intervals within a 12-note chro-
matic pitch space. Although the course will examine issues and practices from antiquity to the twen-
tieth century, we will focus primarily on the many temperaments that arose in the seventeenth century,
the practical musical issues that necessitated them, and the religious, philosophical, and scientific jus-
tifications for those corrections. Students will have the opportunity to construct and realize avariety of
temperaments on a harpsichord and/or using CSound software.
Evaluation will be based on participation, small weekly assignments, and a final 10-page paper ex-
amining the effects and consequences of a historical tuning on the realization of a pertinent musical
work.
Prerequisites: Music 103. Enrollment limit:12. Preference given to students with an interest in early
music performance.
Meeting time: Tuesdays and Thursdays, 10 a.m.-1 p.m.

MUS 017 Cuban "Classical" Composers and Their Music
This course covers some of the most relevant "classical" composers of Cuban Music history. We will
study the composers' life and work through the analysis of some of their relevant compositions. Class
discussions will include the relationship of these works with elements borrowed from Cuban popular
music and how the composer incorporates these elements into his/her own artistic expression. We will
also discuss the influence of the European and Afro-Cuban traditions on this repertoire.
Evaluation will be based on class attendance and participation; and a 10 page paper and presentation

MUS 018 Staging Opera (Same as Theatre 018)
The growing popular interest in opera over the last several decades has accompanied an often radical
shift in how these artworks are brought to the stage. In Europe, and increasingly in the US, directors
and dramaturges have moved away from traditional "robes and spears" stagings of canonical works
and embraced a more interpretative approach influenced by Marxism, deconstruction, and other criti-
cal schools of thought. This course will examine the practical, aesthetic, and ideological issues in-
volved in bringing this complicated art form to life on the stage. We will begin with a practical consid-
eration of the economic and demographic pressures influencing modern opera houses in their ap-
proach towards operatic production. We will then turn to recorded live performances of operas by
Mozart and Wagner, as it is these canonical works which have received the most sustained and varied
engagement by modern directors. Discussion will center around multiple stagings of these operas, as
well as readings which address the cultural or ideological elements of the works which stagings may
attempt to highlight or repress. The class will close with a brief consideration of opera films.
Requirements: active participation in class; short oral presentations; 10-page essay.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15.
Meeting time: 2 days per week, but independent or group screenings outside of class are required.
Cost to student: $25 course packet; purchase of opera productions on video or DVD is optional.

PHILOSOPHY
PHIL 010 Philosophy of Chess
Chess is one of the noblest and most fascinating of human endeavors. We will examine chess in many
of its facets: its history, philosophy and literature. We will look at the art of chess and the art that chess
has inspired. Above all, we will work together on improving our playing skills: we will study chess
openings, middle games and endgames, and engage in continual tournament play. One of our tourna-
ments will be an official United States Chess Federation [USCF] tournament; thus each student will
acquire a USCF rating. Students who are not already members of the USCF will be required to join.
Evaluation will be based on class participation and problem assignments.
Prerequisites: All students should know the rules of chess and be able to read chess notation. Enroll-
ment limit:20. If the class is overenrolled, students will be selected according to playing strength, as
indicated by USCF ratings, results in the College chess club, or other measures.
Meeting time: afternoons.
Cost to student: $100 ($50 for USCF membership, $50 for books).

PHIL 012 Erotic Love in Plato
"Not one single poet has ever sung a song in praise of so ancient and so powerful a god as Love
(Erôs)." So laments the character Pheadrus in Plato's Symposium. What follows are a series of
speeches in celebration of this god, which together comprise one of Plato's most beautiful (and hu-
Winter Study Program
­ 375 ­
morous) dialogues. And yet this same Plato seems to have a completely different attitude toward Erôs
in the Republic. In the few passages where it surfaces at all, the tone is strikingly negative. It is the ty-
rant--who represents the completely unjust man--who is afflicted with Erôs. In this seminar we are
get to the bottom of these apparently schizophrenic accounts through careful reading and thorough
discussion of the relevant material, namely the Symposium and parts of the Phaedrus as well a collec-
tion of shorter passages from other dialogues. What exactly does it mean to be a Platonic lover? How
is love to be explained in terms of (other) desire? What is the connection (if any) between love and
morality? These will be among the central questions guiding us in our investigation.
Requirements: Active participation in discussion and four 3-page response papers .
There are no prerequisites, but students are encouraged to read the Symposium and the Phaedrus once
prior to the start of the winter study period.
Meeting time: afternoons, twice per week.

PHIL 013 Sex, Marriage, and the Pursuit of Happiness: Legal Regulation of Sex and
Marriage in the Contemporary U.S.
Most Americans would agree with J.S. Mill that, all things being equal, individuals should be free to
pursue their own individual good in their own way. This conviction is at the heart of political liberal-
ism, and, one might argue, of America's conception of itself. Yet state and federal government in the
U.S. has always imposed considerable legal restrictions on its citizens' sex and love lives, regulating
their choice of marriage and sexual partners as well as the sexual practices they engage in with those
partners. (Only in 1965 did the Supreme Court rule it unconstitutional for states to proscribe the use of
contraceptives; many states have held (or hold) laws against sodomy, variously defined as anal or oral
sex.)
The proper scope and purpose of these regulations has come under intense scrutiny in the last two
years thanks to the 2003 Supreme Court decision to overturn state laws banning sodomy (Lawrence v.
Texas) and the 2004 decision of the Massachusetts Supreme Court to permit same-sex marriage
(Goodridge v. Massachusetts Dept. of Public Health). People from every part of the political spectrum
are considering anew the government's role in regulating sexual and marital practices.
In this course, we will deepen and refine our own conception of this role by studying highlights from
the federal case-law leading up to the Lawrence and Goodridge decisions (such as Griswold v. Con-
necticut, Bowers v. Hardwick, and Loving v. Virginia) together with selections from the impressive

PHIL 014 Who's on First: Writing and Thinking About Sport
What drives athletes to excel? What is the psychological, physical, economic and emotional price the
individual athlete and the culture pays for such excellence? How does a country put its own unique
mark on a sport? Does the Greek ideal of sport infuse todays athletes and teams? What current values
threaten the existence of many of our professional sports teams in our major cities?
This course will explore these questions and ask others as we read variously from books like; You Got-
ta Have Wa, Friday Night Lights, Take Time For Paradise, Money Ball, Golf In The Kingdom andBest
Sports Writing o f 2004, and watch movies such as; When They Were Kings, Hoop Dreams, Hoosiers,
Remember The Titans, Chariots Of Fire, A League of Their Own, Breaking Away, Wings, and A River
Runs Through It.
Requirements: one 10-page paper, class participation and regular attendance.
No prerequisites.
Meeting time: TBA.
Cost to student: $60-$75 for books.

PHIL 018 Williams in North Adams: The Entrepreneurship of Shitake (Same as Biology 018,
Economics 018 and Environmental Studies 018)
Think you could turn an abandoned textile mill into a successful mushroom business? You would
have to understand the biology of fungi, the science of indoor climate control, and industrial engineer-
ing. You would have to raise large amounts of capital, and be willing to risk it on the proposition that
you could grow large quantities of high-quality product at a profitable margin. You would have to
Winter Study Program

minimize the costs of your raw materials and other inputs, and optimize your marketing and sales.
And you would have to be willing to do a lot of hard, dirty work.
In this course students will learn about, and actively participate in, all aspects of the Delftree Corpora-
tion, which for the past 20 years has grown approximately 5% of the nation's shitake mushrooms in-
side a 100 year-old factory building in North Adams, Massachusetts. Students will pick and package
mushrooms, assist with the operation of proprietary technology (which may require a willingness to
experience the night shift), and study the complex issues involved in developing, sustaining, and ex-
panding a commodity-based agricultural business.
Evaluation will be based on attendance, enthusiasm, and a substantial oral presentation made on the
final day of Winter Study to Bill Greenwald, owner and CEO of the Delftree Corporation.
Student selection criteria: Preference to those demonstrably committed to the project.
We will meet each morning in Williamstown and drive to North Adams, where we will spend the day
(returning to campus in time for dinner).
Enrollment limit: 8.
Cost to student: reading packet, daily lunch money (or bring your own lunch).
DUDLEY
PHIL 025 Morocco (Same as International Studies 025)
Students in this course will spend winter study in Morocco. Morocco presents a compelling blend of
historical influences and modern world currents. Threads of Islam, Arab traditions, and the heritage of
the native Berber people are woven into a distinctive cultural tapestry, while traces of French colonial-
ism can still be seen in the political and social structure. Morocco is at the intersection of the West, the
Middle East, and Africa. Travel there is therefore a powerful way to introduce intellectual themes that
require and reward a subtle blending of insight from history, political science, religion, and philoso-
phy.
We will take the first steps in engaging some of these challenging topics in order to enable indepen-
dent study facilitated by serious and multifaceted exposure to the country. For the first two weeks, stu-
dents will live with Moroccan families in two quite different cities, the cosmopolitan capital of Rabat
and the traditional center of Islamic learning, Fez. We will gather several times each week for lectures
and presentations. In the third week of the course we will take a group trek through Berber villages and
the Atlas Mountains on our way to legendary Marrakech.
Students will be expected to attend all seminars, lead a group presentation, and complete a substantial
research paper (10-15 pages). The presentation and research paper will be occasions to explore a spe-
cial topic in depth including, for instance, justice and gender, art, literature, colonial studies, or Islam.
No prerequisites. Arabic is the official spoken language of Morocco, and French is spoken widely.
While desirable, neither is required. Enrollment limit:15. Preference will be given to majors and pro-
spective majors in Religion, Philosophy, Political Science, and Women's and Gender Studies, and to
concentrators in International Studies.
Cost to student: approximately $2900.

PHYSICS
PHYS 010 Light and Holography
This course will examine the art and science of holography. It will introduce modern optics at a level
appropriate for a non-science major, giving the necessary theoretical background in lectures and dis-
cussion. Demonstrations will be presented and students will make several kinds of holograms in the
lab. Thanks to a grant from the National Science Foundation, we have 7 well-equipped holography
darkrooms available for student use. At the beginning of WSP, the class will meet for lecture and dis-
cussion three mornings a week and for lab 2 afternoons a week. Later classes will be mainly laborato-
ry.
Students will be evaluated on the basis of regular attendance, completion of 4 laboratory exercises,
and a holography laboratory project or a 10-page paper. Attendance at all classes and labs is required
for a passing grade.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit:30. Preference will be given to students with no previous college
course in physics more advanced than Physics 100.
Cost to student: about $50 for holographic film, chemicals, and photocopies.

PHYS 012 Meet the Right Side of Your Brain: Drawing as a Learnable Skill
Representational drawing is not merely a gift of birth or a magical ability granted by angels, but a
learnable skill. If you ever wanted to draw, but doubted you had the ability or believed you could not
learn, then this course is for you. This intensive course utilizes discoveries in brain research to teach
representational drawing. By using simple techniques and extensive exercises you will discover and
develop the perceptual shift from your symbol based left hemisphere to your visually based right
Winter Study Program
­ 377 ­
hemisphere. This cognitive shift enables you to accurately see and realistically represent the physical
world. You will learn to draw a convincing portrait, self-portrait, and still life. This course is designed
to develop your powers of observation and enhance your innate creative problem solving abilities,
which are applicable in any field. Students need no previous artistic experience, just the willingness
and desire to learn a new skill. Students will be expected to attend and participate in all sessions. They
will also be required to keep a sketchbook recording their progress and complete a final project.
Evaluations will be based on participation, effort, and development. Students will be required to pro-
duce explanatory/analytical text to accompany their drawing assignments.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit:30, with preference given to juniors and seniors.
Meeting time: The course will meet three times per week in two sections of 15, one in the morning and
one in the afternoon. There will be about 10 hours lecture and group exercises with substantial addi-
tional independent student work. There also will be an exhibition of coursework on the final day of
Winter Study.
Cost to student: cost of text and (approximately) $15 for drawing materials.

PHYS 013 Automotive Mechanics
The purpose of this course will be to provide an understanding of the basic function of the major com-
ponents of the modern automobile. Through lectures, demonstrations, and hands-on experience, indi-
viduals will learn basic maintenance of an automobile. In addition, students will be expected to study
in depth one of the major automotive systems which include carburetor or fuel-injection systems, the
lubrication and cooling system, the electrical system, the steering, brake and suspension system, and
the power train for both manual and automatic transmissions.
The course will meet two hours a day, three times a week in the morning for classroom instruction. In
addition, students will meet at the Flamingo Motors in Williamstown one evening each week for prac-
tical demonstrations and hands-on activity. Students will be required to attend class regularly, read as-
signed material from the text, actively participate in work at the garage, and pass written midterm and
final examinations.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit:30. The class will be broken into three sections for lab work. Pref-
erence given to seniors.

PSCI 011 The Development of Inuit Art (Same as ArtH 011)
In the late 1940's a new source of modern art sprang into existence. Inuit art (which includes the fol-
lowing genre of art: sculpture, graphic arts, as well as jewelry, wall hangings, pottery and other
modes) is a very modern development. Since its beginning it has gained world-wide attention. There
are galleries of Inuit art not only through out Canada and the United States but also Europe and Asia.
Inuit art is included in the collections of major museums throughout the world. The production of Inuit
Winter Study Program
­ 378 ­
art developed in response to the sudden change in Inuit life from nomadic subsistence in the northern
arctic regions of Canada to fixed settlements on Baffin Island and regions around Hudson Bay and the
consequent need to create a cash-based economy. The course will cover the development of Inuit art
focusing on the two major forms, graphic and sculpture from the major artists (among them Keno-
juak, Oonark, George Arlook, Pudlo Pudlat, Peter Sevoga, Latcholassie, Parr, and Pauta). The course
will explore the changing character of Inuit life and governance (the Canadian government recently
completed a major reconstitution granting much of the people of the arctic north autonomy as a self-
governing region called Nunavut). In addition to the technical development of the art, its history and
the biography of the major artists, we will be exploring the cultural context of Inuit art to the Inuit as
well as to the international art market. The course will have available major examples of Inuit art,
movies, documentaries and visits by Inuit art dealers. There will be assigned readings and a paper as-
signment with students choosing from the following topics: 1) a study of a particular work of art; 2) a
study of a particular theme in Inuit art; 3) the work of a particular artist; 4) some aspect of Inuit life or
politics; 5) or economic analyses (for example, using Inuit art auction results over the years).
Evaluation will be based on a 10-page paper, class attendance and participation. No prerequisites. En-
rollment limit:25. Preference to upper class students.
Meeting time: afternoons, three classes per week.
Cost to student: $50 for readings.

PSCI 014 Acting Free: The Citizen and the State in Popular American Cinema
Democracy requires citizen participation. Because of this, scholars and pundits have expressed alarm
about the American public's apparent mistrust of, and apathy toward, politics and the political pro-
cess. An engaged citizenry does not appear deux ex machina however. Citizens learn their roles from
a variety of formal and informal institutions. This class uses the medium of film to explore the mes-
sages conveyed by popular culture about citizens' interactions with the state. In addition to some
background reading, we will analyze such films as Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, To Kill a Mock-
ingbird, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Norma Rae, Born on the Fourth of July, Citizen Ruth,
The Siege, The Insider, The People vs. Larry Flynt, Erin Brockovitch, and The Matrix.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit:15 students. Meeting time: Mornings. Evaluation based on partici-
pation and a 10-page paper. Cost: approximately $50 for books and packet.
MELLOW
PSCI 015 Political Economy of Tourism
In 1996, tourism finally surpassed oil as the world's most valuable export. It accounts for the bulk of
foreign revenue received by most countries: the two dozen small island countries list their exports as
"tourism, fish," and presidents and prime ministers from the world's wealthiest and most powerful
countries-men and women with the ability to launch nuclear war-worry that travel restrictions arising
from the war on terror will cost over a billion dollars in lost duck boat revenue and such. Tourism has
been lauded as the perfect form of environmentally sustainable development, derided as a degrading
enterprise that sells happy tropical primitives to jaded white-collar workers, advocated as a popular
avenue to global understanding, and condemned as the ultimate commodification--of experience.
This class examines international tourism through theory and case studies. We will read Dean Mac-
Cannell, The Tourist: A New Theory of the Leisure Class, Jamaica Kincaid, A Small Place, and Jon

PSCI 016 The Civil Rights Movement's Jubilee: Whither Memoralization?
Fifty years ago in January, Martin Luther King Jr. and the SCLC started the movement that typifies the
struggle for racial justice and the high point of the protest movement associated with King. This class
will use that campaign as a starting point to reexamine the movement's characteristics and compare
that to the way memories of that movement are shaped and are likely to be shaped at this Jubilee anni-
versary. The class will review efforts to memorialize the movement and the variety of media used
(print, music, film, internet, museum and statutes). The class will focus on two other cases -- W. E. B.
Du Bois and Bayard Rustin--where communities have been especially ambivalent due to an admix-
ture of concerns involving radicalism, sexuality, and patriotism.

From Afghanistan to Zimbabwe, the U.S. Department of State's list of "Independent States in the
World" designates 191 countries as "States." It also lists exactly one entity--Taiwan-- as "Other."
What exactly is Taiwan, in both the international realm and in various domestic political realms, and
what makes it unique? Can Taiwan and the People's Republic of China (PRC) unite peacefully? If Tai-
wan declares itself to be an independent state, will the PRC make good on its oft-repeated threat to go
to war with Taiwan? And how, either now or in the event of a military crisis, can the United States best
balance its own interests with its promises to both the PRC and Taiwan?
Requirements: attendance, one 10-page paper.

PSCI 018 The Work of the Supreme Court: A Simulation
The aim of this course is to provide a sense of the personal, theoretical, and institutional characteristics
of judicial decision making at the highest level. At the beginning of the course, all students will be fur-
nished with a set of the briefs for an actual pending Supreme Court case. Four students (two per side)
will be assigned to make oral arguments to the "Court," which will be composed of eight students,
each playing the role of a sitting justice, and the instructor, who will act as chief justice for purposes of
coordination. After hearing arguments, the "Court" will confer and prepare majority and other opin-
ions and announce them in "open court" at the conclusion of the term.
Evaluation will be based on the overall credibility in assigned role; effective argument, questions, per-
formance in conference, drafting, etc. and a 3--to 5--page "reflective" essay in which students will
be expected to identify and comment on some aspect of the work of the Court.
Prerequisites: permission of instructor. Enrollment limit:12. Preference to students who have com-
pleted one or more courses in related areas or have background in speech, debate or drama.

PSCI 019 Comic Book Politics (Same as American Studies 019)
Over the last twenty years, graphic novels and comic books have emerged within popular culture as an
important site of political critique and commentary. Pushing the limits of what comic books could or
should be, these works directly and indirectly explored a wide range of questions about power, re-
sponsibility, accountability, violence, fear, freedom, and toleration. Some directly address real world
Winter Study Program
­ 380 ­
political situations, but many raise these themes indirectly. The works that will be read represent out-
standing artistic and literary examples of the genre which directly raise such political issues. This
course uses these graphic novels as the basis for discussing the political issues. The works to be read
might (depending on availability other titles may be substituted or added) include Dave Sim's Cere-
bus, Alan Moore's Watchmen and V for Vendetta, Steve Darnall and Alex Ross's Uncle Sam, Warren
Ellis's Transmetropolitan, Frank Miller's Dark Knight Returns and 300, Mark Waid and Alex Ross's
Kingdom Come, Grant Morrison's The Invisibles, Art Spiegelman's Maus, Marjan Satrapi's Persepo-
lis, and Joe Sacco's Palestine. The reading load will not be light--don't be fooled by the fact that you
are reading comic books!
Evaluation will be based on a 10-page paper on a topic to be determined in consultation with the pro-
fessor OR four 2-3 page papers; regular and constructive class participation is also required.
The course will meet 4 days a week for a total of 6 hours.

PSCI 021 Fieldwork in Public and Private Non-Profits (Same as Environmental Studies 021)
This course is an internship experience in which students work full-time in a governmental or non-
governmental (including voluntary, activist, and grassroots) organization. Students may find intern-
ships in government and nonprofit organizations in which their work involves significant involve-
ment with public issues. Examples include: town government offices; state or federal administrative
offices such as environmental agencies or housing authorities; interest groups that lobby government
such as the ACLU or Natural Resources Defense Council; nonprofit organizations such as think tanks
or service providers such as Habitat for Humanity; and grassroots, activist or community develop-
ment organizations such as Greenpeace or neighborhood associations. The instructor will work with
each student to arrange an internship; such arrangements must be made in advance of the Winter
Term. Students should first make their own contacts with an institution or agency and the instructor
and other members of the Environmental Studies and Political Science Departments are available to
help students find placements, if necessary. Each student's internship mentor shall send a confirma-
tion letter to the instructor verifying the internship and describing the nature of the work to be per-
formed by the intern. Students will read a few short articles distributed at the beginning of Winter
Term and must agree to keep a journal, maintain weekly contact with the instructor, and write a final
paper summarizing and reflecting upon the experience. A group meeting of all students will occur af-
ter winter study to discuss the experiences.
Requirements: internship work; satisfactory evaluation from the institutional sponsor; 10 page final
paper; participation in final meeting.
At the time of registration, interested students should send a resume and letter of interest to Professor
Gardner.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit:15
Cost to student: approximately $15 for readings, student covers transportation costs to and from in-

PSCI 023 Experiential Learning
The Gaudino Fund offers four students the opportunity to carry out projects that involve critical, re-
flective, experiential learning. Each student selected for this course will register for Political Science
023, but will work independently of other students in the course. Each student will have his or her own
faculty sponsor who will help shape and monitor the project. Professor McAllister and the Gaudino
Board of Trustees will select the four students. The Board places a premium on proposals that foster
the development of habits of mind that illuminate direct experience, undertaken preferably in social
milieux previously unfamiliar to applicants. Students' projects must be academically rigorous and fo-
cused on intellectual problems worked out carefully with faculty sponsors. Projects must also entail
systematic self-reflective examinations of how students' experiences affected them personally. Pref-
erence will be given to projects unconnected with regular course work.
Professor McAllister will meet with the students as a group before and after January. The Gaudino
Fund will defray expenses for all students in the course up to $1000 per student.

PSYCHOLOGY
PSYC 010 Adventures in Disabilities (Same as Political Science 010)
A dramatic shift in the laws and values shaping the participation of persons with disabilities in Ameri-
can society has led to motorized carts in Professional Golf Association tournaments and modified
exam procedures for some college students. With the help of guest speakers who themselves have dis-
abilities as well as through readings and films, we will explore past and present understandings of dis-
abilities (physical, sensory, cognitive, mental health) and the changing responses to those who have
them. Each student will conduct an investigation, using interviews and site visits, to learn how current
understandings of disabilities have impacted a field in which they are interested. Alternatively, a stu-
dent may focus an inquiry on his or her own disability or that of a family member. The underlying
premise of this course is that we no longer expect the individual with a disability to "overcome her/his
handicap." Rather, it is the role of citizens and leaders to figure out creative ways to remove barriers to
participation and creatively accommodate those who have different ways of learning, communicat-
ing, or getting around. This is not a burden but an adventure.
Among the readings will be the book, No Pity: People with Disabilities Forging a New Civil Rights
Movement (Shapiro, 1993) and personal narratives written by persons with disabilities or their fami-
lies.
The cost to students of books and article reprints will be approximately $60.00.
Evaluation will be based on class participation, a final 10-page paper, and an oral presentation about
your investigation.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit:15.

PSYC 011 Children's Play
The meaning of play in the young child's life will be considered both through readings and practical
experience. The group will discuss several theoretical approaches to play, and each student will work
mornings or afternoons with children in natural play settings, e.g. nursery school or day-care center. A
journal relating reading and experience will be kept, and a final 10-page paper, relating theories of
play to the student's observations of children at play will be written.
No prerequisites, but interested students must consult with the instructor prior to registration. Enroll-
ment limited to number of available placements in children's programs.

PSYC 012 Dreams, Problem-Solving & Self-Understanding
In this course, students will learn how paying attention to nighttime dreams can help solve daytime
problems and lead to increased self-understanding, in support of living a more conscious and creative
life. Many practical and effective techniques for understanding dreams have been developed since
Freud published his groundbreaking book, The Interpretation of Dreams, in 1900. This course will
give students the opportunity to learn and practice these techniques, using class members' dreams as
well as published dream accounts. Class time will focus on working with dreams; assigned readings
will cover the major schools of thought in the history of dream interpretation, as well as provide il-
lustrations of various dreamwork techniques. We will also consider the growing body of research in
psychology and neurophysiology and what this data contributes to the understanding of dream forma-
tion, function and interpretation.
Evaluation will be based on weekly assignments, participation in class, and a final 10-page analytical
paper.
We will meet three times a week for 2 1/2 hour classes. Requirements include assigned readings,
keeping a dream journal, and practicing dreamwork techniques learned in class.

PSYC 013 The Difficult Concept of Mental Illness
The concept of mental illness (or "mental disorder") pervades clinical psychology and psychiatry.
Clinicians even borrow a vocabulary of illness from medicine: We use words like treatment, recovery,
and relapse; we make diagnoses; we write case reports. But is there any objective standard by which
certain psychological patterns can be called abnormality, disorder, or illness? For example, is there a
single scientific standard by which we can reject egregious diagnoses like drapetomania -- defined in
1854 as an abnormal compulsion of some slaves to try to escape -- while retaining seemingly impor-
tant diagnoses like schizophrenia? As Kendell notes, a long and vital debate persists over "whether
[mental] disease and illness are based on value judgments, or whether they are value-free scientific
terms". We, too, will wrestle with whether mental illness is more of a scientific or sociopolitical con-
cept. We will consider how the idea of mental illness has been framed cross-culturally and historical-
ly; examine the strengths and weaknesses of diverse contemporary definitions; and try to define it to
our personal satisfaction. Students may select any appropriate topic for their final written report. Pre-
requisite: Psychology 252.
Requirements/evaluation: four 1-page reaction papers, a 10-page final report, and active participation
in class, including a panel-style debate.
Meeting time: 1-3 PM Tues, Wed, Thurs. Wednesdays we meet for films and guest speakers only. En-
rollment: Limited to 15.

PSYC 014 Alcohol and Other Drug Abuse in the College Context
This course will review substance abuse in the college context, reviewing surveys of substance use
patterns among college students and examining college responses to the "problem." Students will
read articles, write journal entries, give short presentations, hear guest speakers, participate in an off-
campus field trip or two, and submit a final paper. Topics to be covered include stages of change, ad-
diction and recovery, basic alcohol and other drug information, substance abuse and the legal system
and leisure counseling, all with the focus on college-age students. This course is a lecture/discussion
course.
Evaluation: Students will be graded on the content and quality of their work submitted in a final 10- to
15-page paper. Final papers can include thoughts and responses to classes, readings, guest speakers,
course activities, field trips, and outside events attended as substance free leisure activities; insights
from journal entries; and/or responses from completed reading/viewing of suggested books or mov-
ies.

PSYC 016 The Examined Life--Using Mindfulness and Creative Expression to Increase
Self-knowledge
This course offers students an opportunity to explore their own thoughts, feelings, attitudes and mo-
tivations with the goal of increasing self-awareness and self-knowledge. The central concepts of
mindfulness and meditation will be introduced, as they relate to mental and physical health and well-
being, including the management of stress. A field trip to the Kripalu Center will be included in the
class. Students will be required to keep a creative journal for the duration of the course, and will be
asked to choose entries to share with fellow participants. In addition, a variety of experiential exer-
cises will be offered, including art expression, creative writing exercises and discussion of dreams and
dream analysis. Students will also be given the opportunity to increase self-awareness through
completion of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, the Strong Interest Inventory, the Attributional Style
Questionnaire, and the COPE. The influence of dispositional outlook and coping style will also be dis-
cussed.
At the end of this course, students will know more about their own thoughts, feelings, interests and
motivations. They will have learned basic meditation techniques and some additional skills for stress
management. They will see the value in examined, mindful living and have some skills to continue the
process of self-discovery.

PSYC 017 Teaching Practicum
Students interested in teaching may submit applications for a Winter Study assignment as a teacher's
aide at Mt. Greylock Regional High School or at the Williamstown Elementary School. Those accept-
ed will work under the supervision of a regular member of the teaching staff and submit a report on
their work at the end of the Winter Study Period. This project involves a four-week commitment to
full-time affiliation with the school. Interested students should consult before winter study registra-
tion with Professor Sandstrom, Bronfman 315. She will assist in arranging placements and monitor
students' progress during the four-week period. Criteria for pass include full time affiliation with the
school and a final 10-page report. The final report should summarize the student's experiences and re-
flections as drawn from a daily journal.
Prerequisite: approval of Professor Sandstrom is required. Enrollment limited to number of places
available at the two participating schools.
Cost to student: none.

psychology (e.g., advertising, law) setting should first make their own contacts with an institution or
agency to work full time during Winter Study. They should also check with the course instructor about
the suitability of the proposed placement, and should arrange to obtain a letter from a sponsor at the
institution who will outline and supervise the student's duties during January. The student must agree
to keep a journal and to submit a final paper summarizing and reflecting upon the experiences outlined
in the journal.

RELIGION
REL 010 An Historical Introduction to Christian Theology
This course exposes students to the themes of traditional Christian theology (i.e., to the doctrine of
God, Christology, and theological anthropology) by means of historical survey. It emphasizes the in-
terplay between the philosophical-intellectual context of an era and the formulation of belief. Figures
studied include Origen, Athanasius, the Cappadocians, Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, Luther, and Cal-
vin.
This course should appeal especially to Religion majors and Philosophy majors. But, it may have ap-
peal to History majors (especially those concerned with intellectual history). Finally, because of West-
ern and Eastern reliance upon Christian beliefs and imagery, the course may appeal to Literature and
Art History majors.
This is an introductory level course. While some background in the Christian scriptures would be
helpful, it will not be presumed. Also helpful-but not presumed-is acquaintance with ancient philoso-
phy, especially Aristotle and/or neo-Platonism.
The course would meet at least ten times for 1 1/2 hours. (preferably mornings; three times/week; due
to other commitments, it cannot begin before 9:30 a.m.)
The method will be primarily lecture, with discussion as time and interest allow. Obviously many top-
ics will be left out; therefore, students are encouraged to explore some issue or topic generally related
Winter Study Program
­ 384 ­
to the interface of Christianity with their own major. Alternatively, they may investigate a figure or
topic not directly addressed in the course.
Evaluation will be based upon a 10-page research paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 25. Preference to Religion and Philosophy majors.
Meeting time: TBA.
Cost to student: approximately $90 for reading materials.

REL 012 The Spirit and Practice of Yoga: Coming into Alignment
This class provides an orientation to yoga and builds a foundation for an effective and rewarding per-
sonal yoga practice. Each class begins with centering and discussion of selected readings on Pa-
tanjali's Yoga Sutras,providing a historical, cultural, and philosophical background for yoga. The sec-
ond part of each class is an extended yoga practicum where students will learn and refine yoga poses
including standing poses, vinyasa (flow), inversions, abdominals, hip-openers, backbends, twists,
forward bends, and restoratives. In this way the class develops lung capacity and builds strength, flex-
ibility, and awareness. Students receive individualized attention on how to work with principles of
alignment in their particular bodies, express poses with balanced energy, and embody heart qualities.
Yoga training is complementary to sports, athletics, and dance, aids in classroom and study, gives
tools for handling stress, and cultivates a sense of well-being and balance.
Evaluation will be based on attendance and participation in all classes and sessions, 4 three-page es-
says on Yoga Sutras; documentation of daily personal practice, and participation in public yoga dem-
onstration.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit:24.
Meeting time: afternoons; Monday, Wednesday, Thursday 1:30-3:30p.m.
Cost to student: $35 for Yoga Sutras, yoga mat, strap, block, and blanket.

RLFR 012 Paris-Dakar: Stories of Sports Cars and Much More... (Same as Comparative
Literature 012 and International Studies 012)
Paris-Dakar is the world's most prestigious and famous desert rally. Every January since 1977, four
hundred drivers have competed against each other in a twenty day race over 6,500 miles. Supporters
describe it as the last great adventure a human being can undertake, taking on what seem like impossi-
ble odds. Critics point to the environmental damage of the race, vehicular accidents and their African
casualties.
In this class, we will discuss the controversies of this very famous race, watch sections of it on televi-
sion, and research the landscapes and countries affected by it. Our main text will be a collection of
short stories called Paris-Dakar: Autres Nouvelles. As the editor of the stories explains, if one can
travel Paris-Dakar by car, by motorcycle, by 4X4, why can't one travel by words? These texts give
another account of the race by authors from countries through which the race passes, but also ignores:
Algeria, Morocco, Senegal, Niger, Mali, Mauritania, and Burkina-Faso.
Winter Study Program

Throughout the course, students will work closely with librarian Christine Ménard on a variety of re-
search projects to gather context to the race and to each story (author interviews, images of the coun-
try, environmental damage statistics, etc.). As a final project, each student will contribute content to a
website on the race that we will mount as a group. Readings in French. Discussions in English.
Requirements: research activities and a 10-page analytical essay in English.
Prerequisites: reading knowledge of French. Enrollment limit: 15.

RUSS 013 Puzzles and Puzzlers (Same as Sociology 013)
Why do people spend their time doing puzzles? Why did riddles exist throughout history and cross-
words appeared only in the twentieth century? In literature, how do games and puzzles contribute to
the construction or subversion of meaning? What is the metaphorical significance of games and
puzzles, in literature and in real life? Is the game for the reader's benefit or is the reader part of the
game?
This course will approach puzzles from both sociological and literary perspectives, thus providing
students with the opportunity to analyze games and puzzles in literary texts while also assessing their
significance in contemporary culture through collaborative ethnography, interviews in and outside of
class and analysis of documents. Primary texts will include works by Nabokov, Borges, Calvino and
Eco; we will also consult theoretical writings by Caillois, Huizinga, Motte and the OuLiPo group. Ex-
ercises will include constructing a taxonomy of puzzles, interviewing puzzle-makers and puzzle-fans,
exploring trans-cultural and historical variations in crosswords and riddles, and integrating cultural
criticism with an appreciation of the puzzles' role in contemporary culture.

SPECIALS
SPEC 010 Quest for College: Early Awareness in Berkshire County Schools
Today's extremely competitive higher education market places significant pressure on students na-
tionwide to start planning for college at an increasingly early age while simultaneously demanding
ever-higher standards of excellence for admission to top schools. "Early Awareness" initiatives aim to
educate middle school students as to what lies ahead on the college horizon, empowering them to
make sound academic and extracurricular choices that will keep open a maximum of options. The first
week of this course will be spent in the classroom, exploring and discussing problems and issues ger-
mane to the national trends towards greater (and earlier) college-related pressures. Students will re-
spond to a series of readings dealing with such issues as tracking, paid test preparation and untimed
testing, early decision, parental and peer pressures, special interests, misrepresentation of informa-
tion, independent counseling, and others. Class time will also be devoted to familiarizing students
with both the nuances of the college admission process and the administration of the early awareness
game, Quest for College. Students will spend the next two weeks visiting 10-12 Berkshire County
middle schools, administering the game and inviting students to the culminating College Day. All 8
students will then work together to plan and run College Day activities for students and their parents.
This day will include a) campus tours, b) general higher education info sessions, and c) financial aid/
scholarship info for the parents. If student and community interest is sufficient, the course may culmi-
nate in a public presentation and open forum early second semester.
Evaluation will be based on completion of field work (school visits), organization and execution of
project to bring local middle school students to the Williams Campus for a day of early-awareness re-
lated activities and a final paper (approximately 10 pages) reflecting on a course-related issue of the
student's choosing.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 8. Preference given to a) students with prior education/admission
experience, b) students with access to transportation c) juniors and seniors. Interested students must

SPEC 011 Science for Kids (Same as Chemistry 011)
Are you interested in teaching? Do you enjoy working with kids? Do you like to experiment with new
things? Here is a chance for you to do all three! The aim of this Winter Study Project is to design a se-
ries of hands-on science workshops for elementary school children and their parents. Working in
teams of 2-4, students spend the first two and a half weeks of Winter Study planning the workshops.
This involves deciding on a focus for each workshop (based on the interests of the students involved)
followed by choosing and designing experiments and presentations that will be suitable for fourth-
grade children. On the third weekend of Winter Study (January 22, 23) we bring elementary school
kids with their parents to Williams to participate in the workshops.
You get a chance to see what goes into planning classroom demonstrations as well as a sense of what
it's like to actually give a presentation. You find that kids at this age are great fun to work with because
they are interested in just about everything and their enthusiasm is infectious. You also give the kids
and their parents a chance to actually do some fun hands-on science experiments that they may not
have seen before, and you are able to explain simple scientific concepts to them in a manner that won't
be intimidating. It is a rewarding experience for all involved.
Evaluation is based on participation in planning and running the workshops. Each group is expected
to prepare a handout with descriptions of the experiments for the kids, parents, and teachers.
No prerequisites: You need not be a science major; all that is needed is enthusiasm.
Enrollment limit:25.
Meeting time: mornings. Classes meet three times a week for approximately three hours each session.
The workshop is run on the third weekend of Winter Study (January 22, 23) and attendance from 9:00
a.m. to 3:00 p.m. is mandatory that weekend. There are also one or two brief meetings held in the fall
term for preliminary planning.
Cost to student: none.

various voices and styles required by the different writing projects. Topics for discussion include the
vocabulary of food and wine, the politics of food, marketing and consumer psychology, and research
methods in food studies.
The class will meet three times a week for two-hour sessions at which students will discuss the reading
and present their own work for discussion.

narrative activity. In this course, we will continue the tradition, gathering from long-time local resi-
dents stories of their lives, their homes, and their experience of Berkshire County. It will provide an
opportunity to get to know the diverse groups and individuals who people the area. During the first
week of the course we will examine some theoretical texts that will underpin our field work, and we
will get acquainted with the people whose stories we will record. The second and part of the third
week will be taken up with listening to and transcribing those stories, and the final week will see the
compilation of the book, which will take place together with the narrators themselves. In the course
we will collaborate with several individuals and institutions, including Inkberry, the Harper Center,
and local visual and literary artists.
Requirements: The group will meet once a week (twice in the first week) for two hours to reflect on the
structural and functional dimensions of the stories and the storytelling process; students will also be
required to log at least four hours of interview time per week.
Evaluation: Each student will be responsible for two stories, which they will record, transcribe, edit,
and comment upon in their portion of the book. In addition, each student will write a 5-page analysis
of the book as a whole, using the narratological tools they've gained from the required readings.

3000 people of all ages, and in response to an invitation from the Minister of Health for the Northern
Autonomous Region of the Atlantic Coast, we plan to visit a remote area on the Rio Coco River in the
heartland of the Misquito people. The Rio Coco is the boundary between Honduras and Nicaragua
and is populated by small indian villages along its banks. Our visits will be by small boat and trucks.
Faculty from the New England College of Optometry will again train our students on campus prior to
our trip and then supervise our work in the communities. On campus, prior to our 10-day journey to
Nicaragua, we will study some aspects of Nicaraguan history and culture. We will then fly to Mana-
gua and spend a few days seeing the urban life of the country before flying to the Atlantic Coast for a
week of examinations as well as observing and living the reality of the third world.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 16. This course is not open to first-year students.
Meeting time: mornings; Monday, Wednesday, Friday, 10 a.m.-noon.
Cost to student: approximately $2,000.

SPEC 035 Making Pottery on the Potter's Wheel
Each class will begin with a lecture-demonstration, followed by practice on the potter's wheel. Each
student will have the use of a potter's wheel for each class. We will work on mugs, bowls, pitchers,
plates, jars, lids, vases, and bottles, and will finish these shapes as required by trimming and adding
handles, lugs, lids, spouts, and knobs. We will also work on several different handbuilding projects.
After the tenth class session, all class work will be biscuit-fired. The eleventh class will be devoted to
glazing the biscuited pieces. Glazing techniques will include pouring, dipping, layering, brushing,
and stamping, and using wax resist and other masking techniques to develop pattern and design. The
completed work will then be glaze-fired. The last meeting will be devoted to a "final exam" gallery
show of your best work. Woven into lecture-demonstrations will be presentations on various topics
relating to the science and history of pottery making.

SPEC 039 "Composing a Life:" Finding Success and Balance in Life After Williams
To be at Williams you have learned to be a successful student, but how do you learn to be successful in
life? How will you define success in both your career and in your personal life? How will you achieve
balance between the two? In short, what will constitute the "good life" for you? We borrow the con-
cept of "composing a life" from Mary Catherine Bateson, as an apt metaphor for the ongoing process
of defining success and balance in life. This course is designed: (1)To offer college students an oppor-
tunity to examine and define their beliefs, values, and assumptions about their future personal and
professional lives before entering the "real" world; (2) To encourage students to gain a better under-
standing of how culture, ideology, and opportunity affect their life choices; (3) To provide an opportu-
nity for students to consider different models of success and balance through "living cases" (in the
form of guests from various professions and lifestyles); and (4) To aid students in contemplating their
career options through individual advising and introducing various career and life planning resources.
Using selected readings, cases, and guest speakers, we will explore both the public context of the
workplace as well as the private context of individuals and their personal relationships in determining
life choices.
Requirements: regular attendance, class participation, field interview, and a 10-page final paper
No prerequisites. Questions about the course: please contact Michele Moeller Chandler at 458-8106
or michele.chandler2@verizon.net Enrollment limit:15.
Meeting time: mornings.
Cost to student: approximately $30 for case materials.
