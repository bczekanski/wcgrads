HISTORY OF THE COLLEGE
The chartering of Williams College in 1793 was an act of faith and certainly an act surpassing the
modest intentions of Colonel Ephraim Williams, for whom the college is named.
Colonel Williams had not intended to found a college. Enroute with his regiment of Massachu-
setts militia to join the battle with the French and Indians at Lake George, the Colonel had tarried
long enough in Albany to write his last will and testament on July 22, 1755. In it he bequeathed his
residuary estate for the founding and support of a free school in West Township, where for some
years he had commanded a detachment of militia at Fort Massachusetts, farthest outpost of the
province. The will stipulated that West Township, then in dispute between Massachusetts and New
York, must fall within Massachusetts and that the name of the township must be changed to Wil-
liamstown, if the free school was to be established at all.
On September 8, 1755, Colonel Williams was killed at the Battle of Lake George. On October 26,
1791, after many delays, fifteen scholars were admitted to the free school in Williamstown. Within a
year the trustees, not content with the original modest design of the founder, were captivated by the
idea of creating a college where, as they put it, "young gentlemen from every part of the Union" might
resort for instruction " in all the branches of useful and polite literature." The proposal was extremely
ambitious, to be sure, but ambition was a common American ailment. England did not develop a third
university until the nineteenth century; Williams was the twenty-first institution of higher learning to
flower in onetime British colonies, the second in Massachusetts, the sixth in New England. On June
22, 1793, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts granted a charter to Williams College.
I
The bold decision to plant a college in the wilderness betrayed the intentions of Colonel Wil-
liams; yet the new vision had been fed by the same sort of dreams that had led Ephraim Williams to
see a school and a comfortable community where only a military outpost had stood. The early trust-
ees and the legislature of the Commonwealth were to be remembered for their foresight, but in the
decades after 1793 they had reason to acknowledge that the soil they had chosen was stubbornly
uncongenial--so uncongenial, in fact, that for many years the trustees of Williams spent more time
and energy in trying to close the College than in trying to keep it open.
In 1819 they petitioned to move the college to Northhampton, and in 1821, having been spurned by
the legislature, President Zephaniah Swift Moore took matters into his own hands. Convinced that
almost everything about Williams was impossible--its location, its funds, its enrollment--he led a
group of students over the mountains into the Connecticut Valley. There he became their president
once again, at the struggling new college known as Amherst. As for Williams, one member of the
senior class wrote home to his father: "It remains for us to say whether it shall die suddenly, or whether
it shall linger along for two or three years."
In the past the public had come to the support of the institution. A lottery furnished funds essen-
tial to the opening of the free school. A public subscription was the answer of Berkshire County to
the threat of removal in 1819. What saved the College in 1821 was the willingness of the Reverend
Edward Dorr Griffin to take the job of president and the determination with which he drew upon the
College's reputation for religious conservatism to collect much-needed funds. By 1828, the Rever-
end Griffin could be seen standing in the middle of Main Street, supervising the construction of a
handsome new building, housing a chapel, a library, and classrooms, a testament to his confidence
and his skill. The building is now known as Griffin Hall.
The College which had been taking shape under Griffin and his predecessors was not unlike
many other New England colleges where the classical curriculum and a moral atmosphere served as
the basis for training young men for professional life. The college turned out its share of clergymen,
doctors, lawyers, and teachers, serving the needs of Western Massachusetts and surrounding com-
munities in New York and Vermont. But Williams was not yet a place to which "young gentlemen
from every part of the Union" resorted. In fact, Nathaniel Hawthorne, attending the commencement
exercises in 1838, jotted in his notebook some observations on the Williams students he saw there:
"Country graduates--rough, brown-featured, schoolmaster-looking...A rough hewn, heavy set of
fellows from the hills and woods in this neighborhood; unpolished bumpkins, who had grown up as
farmer-boys."
History of the College
­ 4 ­
Williams seldom knew financial security until the end of the nineteenth century. But it did have
assets that enabled it to develop into a prototype of the small New England liberal arts college. Scen-
ery, a reputation for moral soundness, a loyal body of alumni, and a devoted faculty went a long way
toward compensating for inadequate funds.
Of the scenery, Thoreau remarked, after a visit in 1844, "It would be no small advantage if every
college were thus located at the base of a mountain." For Thoreau the location of Williams was "as
good at least as one well-endowed professorship."
In the early years the religious reputation of the College depended on the essential orthodoxy of
its presidents and faculty. It gathered strength from the famous episode of the "haystack meeting" in
the summer of 1806. Five Williams undergraduates, seeking to continue their prayers and conversa-
tions in spite of a sudden thunderstorm, retired from a grove of trees to the shelter of a nearby hay-
stack, where they were inspired to launch the great adventure of American foreign missions. The
extremely informal ties with the Congregationalists saved it from the sometimes stifling strangle-
hold of an organic denominational connection.
During a crisis in the affairs of the College in 1821, a group of alumni met in Williamstown and
organized the Society of Alumni, dedicated to the future welfare of the College. Their action gave
Williams the distinction of organizing the first college alumni society in history. Alumni loyalty was
rewarded when, in 1868, the College provided for official alumni representation on the board of trust-
ees, an act of recognition in which only Harvard, among American colleges, anticipated Williams.
II
But essentially the College has built its reputation around teachers and teaching. Mark Hopkins,
who was a Williams professor from 1830 to 1887 and president of the College from 1836 to 1872, has
become a symbol of this emphasis. In American education Hopkins pioneered in making the student
the center of the educational experience, and he did it so well that one of his former students, U.S.
President James A. Garfield, immortalized his achievement in an aphorism which has passed into the
lore of American education: "The ideal college is Mark Hopkins on one end of a log and a student on
the other." The Hopkins tradition has become one of the College's great assets. It has been perpetuated
in the lives of generations of teachers.
Scenery, a reputation for building sound character, loyal but not especially affluent alumni, and
devoted teachers could keep the College open, but like most other colleges Williams did not experi-
ence growth and prosperity until the closing decades of the nineteenth century. The scenery, of
course, remained constant, but it developed into an even greater asset as the United States became
more urbanized and industrialized. Williams was still a country college; a Massachusetts court de-
cision of 1888 declared that cows owned by the college were tax exempt. The discovery that busi-
nessmen could profit from liberal education sent college enrollments upward as the century drew to
a close; now more Williams alumni were men of affairs, fewer were clergymen. By 1906, of all the
colleges in New England, Williams drew the largest percentage of students from outside New Eng-
land.
From 1793 through 1870 the Commonwealth of Massachusetts appropriated for Williams College
over $150,000, a sum of such importance that Mark Hopkins himself observed that he did "not see
how the College could have got on" without state aid. A new and more dependable source of financial
support was developed as the century drew to a close. In the 1890's Frederick Ferris Thompson of the
Class of 1856 became the first of many individuals to supersede the Commonwealth as the largest
benefactor of the College. Ephraim Williams' original bequest of $9,297 has since grown by addition-
al gifts and bequests to an endowment valued at approximately $1.3 billion.
III
Williams moved into the twentieth century firm in its intentions to remain a college, at a time when
aspirations toward university status were unsettling many of the old colleges. It adhered to a curricu-
lum that was designed for undergraduates; it made room for the elective principle, but it subjected
course election to safeguards and controls. The idea of a liberally educated man was not jettisoned in
favor of the widely accepted idea of almost complete student freedom in course election. A survey of
the college curriculum in 1925 showed that Williams had combined the principles of prescription and
election, the goals of concentration and distribution, in such a way as to be the only major American
History of the College
­ 5 ­
college without any absolutely required courses and without any uncontrolled wide-option electives.
The Williams curriculum has continued to evolve, but it has not undergone such a series of major
overhauls as characterize curriculums inspired by the popular educational fancy of the moment. Not
having abandoned itself to the elective principle in the nineteenth century, Williams did not need to
rescue itself with the general education principle of the twentieth century.
During its long history much of the life and tone of the college was shaped by students. While the
same influence continues, the competitive pressure for admission since World War II has allowed
for a new and significant degree of selectivity on the part of the College. Among the consequences
of this change have been a quickening of the intellectual life of the College and a reconsideration of
traditions and emphases no longer considered appropriate for an institution of liberal learning.
Among the first traditions to go was compulsory religious exercises, abandoned in 1962 after a
hundred years of gradual but steady erosion. Voluntary worship in the form of ecumenical chapel
services and the activities of student religious organizations carry on another long tradition. In re-
sponse to the concern of undergraduate leaders and the faculty and in recognition of the failure of
Greek Letter Fraternities to fulfill adequately objectives consistent with college purpose, the Trust-
ees in 1962 took the first of a series of actions that replaced fraternities with a residential house sys-
tem. Williams became, as a result, a much more open community. The decision to become coeduca-
tional and the admission of women to Williams as degree candidates in 1970 have reinforced the
spirit of equality and freedom conducive to a climate of learning.
In this atmosphere of change and heightened purpose the curriculum underwent appropriate
transformations, as a careful comparative study of the yearly catalogues readily shows, leading to
the present 4-1-4 curriculum and a more flexible and wide-ranging schedule and program both on
and beyond the campus. Changes in the curriculum included the addition of majors and the
introduction of interdisciplinary programs, along with the expansion of language offerings to in-
clude full, four-year cycles in Chinese and Japanese. Continuing the tradition of putting the student
at the center of the educational experience, Williams in the Fall of 1988 introduced in each depart-
ment at least one course taught as a tutorial, in which, typically, pairs of students meet weekly with
the professor to discuss a paper, problem set, or work of art produced by one of the students. By
1992 some 40 percent of the graduating class had experienced at least one tutorial course either in
Williamstown or in the Williams-Oxford program, run in association with Exeter College, Oxford,
which provides each year for some 30 Williams juniors a year-long immersion in the life of Oxford
University.
This curricular expansion reflected, and in part resulted from, the fact that the makeup of the col-
lege community was changing to mirror more closely the growing racial, ethnic, and religious di-
versity of American society. The percentage of Williams students who identified themselves as
members of one or more American minority group rose to 25 percent; of faculty almost 13 percent.
At the beginning of this decade, President Morton Owen Schapiro inaugurated a strategic plan-
ning process, through which the College community identified priorities for change in the curricu-
lum and in residential life. The size of the faculty is being expanded to provide more curricular op-
portunities for students in tutorials and experiential learning. Requirements have been added in in-
tensive writing instruction and in quantitative and formal reasoning. New programming and struc-
tures are being added to student residential life and major projects are underway to greatly enhance
the College's student center, its facilities for theatre and dance, and its office and teaching spaces for
faculty.

MISSION AND OBJECTIVES
We are to regard the mind, not as a piece of iron to be laid upon the anvil and hammered into any
shape, nor as a block of marble in which we are to find the statue by removing the rubbish, or as a
receptacle into which knowledge may be poured; but as a flame that is to be fed, as an active being that
must be strengthened to think and to feel--and to dare, to do, and to suffer.
President Mark Hopkins '24
Induction Address (1836)
Our colleges will not be rich enough until they are able to bring the education they offer within the
reach of the poorest young man in the land.
President P.A. Chadbourne '48
Induction Address (1872)
Dedicated to the welfare of the great common life of the State, [the College] may not much longer
close its doors to one half of the community because of their sex, neither may it narrow its labors or its
sympathies to any class, to any favored few.
James D. Canfield '68
Centennial Oration (1893)
[Young people] now entering college, if given their biblical life span--and who knows what more or
less than three score and ten?--will be carrying responsibilities well into the 21st century...No one can
pretend to more than a guess at what they will then be called upon to comprehend. This much we do know:
that no training in fixed techniques, no finite knowledge now at hand, no rigid formula they might be given
can solve problems whose shape we cannot yet define. Nor have they time to waste in pursuit of transitory
expedients, the ephemeral, the shallow or the merely popular.
The most versatile, the most durable, in an ultimate sense the most practical knowledge and intel-
lectual resources which they can now be offered are those impractical arts and sciences around which
the liberal arts education has long centered: the capacity to see and feel, to grasp, respond and act over
a widening arc of experience; the disposition and ability to think, to question, to use knowledge to
order an ever-extending range of reality; the elasticity to grow, to perceive more widely and more
deeply, and perhaps to create; the understanding to decide where to stand and the will and tenacity to
do so; the wit and wisdom, the humanity and the humor to try to see oneself, one's society, and one's
world with open eyes, to live a life usefully, to help things in which one believes on their way. This is
not the whole of a liberal arts education, but as I understand it, this range of goals is close to its core.
President John E. Sawyer '39
Induction Address (1961)
The longer history of education in our own culture has been such as to suggest the openness, resil-
ience, flexibility and power of that age-old tradition of education in the liberal arts that at its best is
consciously geared to no less inclusive an activity than that of living itself...[And] no education which
truly aspires to be a preparation for living can afford to ignore the fundamental continuities that exist
between the cultivation of specific areas of specialized knowledge, expertise or skill (without which
we could scarcely endure) and that more fundamental and wide-ranging attempt to penetrate by our
reason the very structures of the natural world, to evoke the dimensions and significance of the beauti-
ful, to reach towards an understanding of what it is to be human, of one's position in the universe, and
of one's relations with one's fellows, moral no less than material. Towards that attempt we seem im-
pelled by the very fiber of our being. In its total absence, while doubtless we survive, we do so as
something surely less than human.
The history, moreover, of that most American of educational institutions, the independent, free-
standing liberal-arts college, witnesses forcefully to the power of that central educational institution
when wedded to the other long-standing conviction that education is not a process that can wholly be
confined to classroom, laboratory, studio or library, but one to which the diverse experience and richly
variegated moments of life in a residential community must all combine to make their particular con-
tribution. Extracurriculum as well as curriculum; play as well as work; fellowship as well as solitude;
the foreign as well as the familiar; discomfort as well as ease; protest as well as celebration; prescrip-
tion as well as choice; failure as well as success.
President Francis Oakley
Induction Address (1985)
At Williams, with a spectacularly talented and devoted faculty and staff, great physical and finan-
cial wealth, and the absolute finest students in all of American higher education, we are obligated to
Mission and Objectives
­ 7 ­
realize a vision of educational excellence worthy of our extraordinary resources. That vision undoubt-
edly involves the optimal use of new technologies to enhance the special relationship between a stu-
dent and a faculty member; the breaking down of departmental boundaries, fostering cutting edge
interdisciplinary teaching and research; a way to link more effectively the education that takes place
within the classroom with the education that takes place in the dorm rooms and dining halls and on the
playing fields; a program that allows our students to venture out into the world in ways that reinforce
their classroom experiences; and a commitment to redouble our efforts to educate our students in an
environment that reflects the great strength of our diverse society and to keep the precious prize of a
Williams education open to the most talented students in the nation regardless of family background.
We have never wavered in understanding that our mission is to provide the highest quality under-
graduate education possible, centered on an appreciation and indeed a love of the liberal arts. We can
build on that legacy. This is a time for Williams to set a new standard of excellence in undergraduate
education for an entire industry crying out for guidance. Let history one day note that our community
had the courage to seize the moment.

THE CURRICULUM
Williams College offers a course of study leading to the degree of Bachelor of Arts. The course
requirements prescribe both the number of courses to be completed and the minimum grade level to
be achieved; the curriculum also requires that each student explore several fields of knowledge and
concentrate in one. The full requirements for the degree include meeting the minimum academic stan-
dards stated below, residing at the College, fulfilling the distribution requirement, completing a major,
and completing the physical education requirement.
The academic year is divided into two regular semesters and a Winter Study Program. The student takes
four courses in each semester and during January pursues a single program of study on a pass-fail basis.
The Winter Study Program, which began in 1967, is intended to provide students and faculty with a
dramatically different educational experience in the January term. The differences are in the nature of
the courses, the nature of the learning experience, and the change of educational pace and format from
the fall and spring semesters. These differences apply to the faculty and students in several ways: fac-
ulty can try out courses with new subjects and techniques that might, if successful, be used later in the
regular terms; they can explore subjects not amenable to inclusion in regular courses; and they can
investigate fields outside their usual areas of expertise. In their academic work, which is graded Hon-
ors, Pass, Perfunctory Pass, or Fail, students can explore new fields at low risk, concentrate on one
subject that requires a great deal of time, develop individual research projects, or work in a different
milieu (as interns, for example, or on trips outside Williamstown). In addition, Winter Study offers
studentsanopportunityformoreindependenceandinitiativeinalessformalsetting, more opportunity
to participate in cultural events, and an occasion to get to know one another better.
REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR OF ARTS DEGREE
Academic Requirement
To be eligible for the Bachelor of Arts degree a student must pass 32 regularly graded semester courses
and receive grades of C minus or higher in at least 19 of those semester courses, pass four Winter Study
Projects, fulfill the four-part distribution requirement, complete all requirements for the major including an
average of C minus or higher, and complete the physical education requirement.
Distribution Requirement
The distribution requirement falls into four parts. Please note that courses used to fulfill these require-
ments must be regularly graded.
1) DIVISIONAL REQUIREMENT--designed to ensure that in their course of study at Williams, stu-
dents take an appropriately diverse distribution of courses across the full range of the curriculum.
For the purposes of the requirement, courses are grouped into three divisions: Division I, Languages
and the Arts; Division II, Social Studies; and Division III, Science and Mathematics. A full listing of the
subjects in each division appears below.
Students must complete at least three graded semester courses in each division. Two in each division
must be completed by the end of the sophomore year. No more than two of the courses used to satisfy
the requirement may have the same course prefix. The courses must be taken at Williams or at pro-
grams under the direction of Williams College Faculty.
Courses that fulfill the distribution requirement in Division I are designed to help students become bet-
ter able to respond to the arts sensitively and intelligently by learning the language, whether verbal,
visual, or musical, of a significant field of artistic expression. Students learn how to develop the capacity
for critical discussion, to increase awareness of the esthetic and moral issues raised by works of art, and
to grow in self-awareness and creativity.
Courses which fulfill the Division II requirement consider the institutions and social structures that hu-
man beings have created, whether knowingly or unknowingly, and which in turn markedly affect their
lives. These courses are intended to help the students recognize, analyze, and evaluate these human
structures in order that they may better understand themselves and the social world in which they live.
Courses which fulfill the Division III requirement are intended to provide some of the factual and meth-
odological knowledge needed to be an informed citizen in a world deeply influenced by scientific
thought and technological accomplishment, and to cultivate skill in exact and quantitative reasoning.

Please note: Any Environmental Studies course that is also cross-listed with another subject carries dis-
tribution credit of that subject. Other Environmental Studies courses may fulfill distribution requirements
as indicated under individual course listings.
2) PEOPLES AND CULTURES REQUIREMENT--intended to help students to begin to understand
the cultural diversity of American society and the world at large, so that, as citizens of an increasingly
interconnected world, they may become better able to respond sensitively and intelligently to peoples of
varied social backgrounds and cultural frameworks. Courses which fulfill this requirement are thus de-
signed to familiarize students with some dimension of American cultural diversity or that of the non-
Western world. Each student must complete one graded semester course primarily concerned with : (a)
the peoples and cultures of North America that trace their origins to Africa, Asia, Latin America, Ocea-
nia, or the Caribbean; Native American peoples and cultures; or (b) the peoples and cultures of Africa,
The Curriculum
­ 10 ­
Asia, Latin America, Oceania, or the Caribbean. Students are urged to complete this course, which may
also be used to fulfill any of the other requirements, by the end of the sophomore year.
An asterisk following a course title indicates that the course may be used to meet the Peoples and Cul-
tures Distribution Requirement. A list of courses offered in 2005-2006 which meet the requirement is
on page 314.
3) QUANTITATIVE/FORMAL REASONING REQUIREMENT--intended to help students become
adept at reasoning mathematically and abstractly. The ability to apply a formal method to reach conclu-
sions, to use numbers comfortably, and to employ the research tools necessary to analyze data lessen
barriers to carrying out professional and economic roles. Prior to their senior year, all students must
satisfactorily complete a Quantitative/Formal Reasoning (QFR) course--those marked with a "(Q)."
Students requiring extra assistance (as assessed during First Days) are normally placed into Mathemat-
ics 100/101/102, which is to be taken before fulfilling the QFR requirement.
The hallmarks of a QFR course are the representation of facts in a language of mathematical symbols
and the use of formal rules to obtain a determinate answer. Primary evaluation in these courses is based
on multistep mathematical, statistical, or logical inference (as opposed to descriptive answers). A list of
courses offered in 2005-2006 which meet the requirement is on page 317.
4) WRITING REQUIREMENT--All students are required to take two writing-intensive courses: one by
the end of the sophomore year and one by the end of the junior year. Students will benefit most from
writing-intensive courses by taking them early in their college careers and are therefore strongly en-
couraged to complete the requirement by the end of the sophomore year. Courses designated as "writ-
ing intensive"--those marked with a "(W)"--stress the process of learning to write effectively. Such
courses include a substantial amount of writing (a minimum of 20 pages), usually divided into several
discrete assignments. Instructors pay close attention to matters of style and argumentation. Enrollments
are limited to 19. A list of courses offered in 2005-2006 which meet the requirement is on page 322.
One of the W courses may be an independent study that meets the writing intensive criteria.
Major Requirement
The Major Requirement is designed to assure that all Williams undergraduates will have the experience
of disciplined and cumulative study, carried on over an extended period of time, in some important field of
intellectual inquiry. Juniors are required to declare a major and the selection is normally made at the time of
registration in the spring of the sophomore year.
MAJOR FIELDS
Majors are offered in the following fields:
American Studies History
Anthropology Japanese
Art Literary Studies

GENERAL STRUCTURE OF MAJORS
1) A student ordinarily must elect at least nine semester courses in his or her major field. A particu-
lar major may also require an additional course and/or one Winter Study Project during the junior or
senior year.
The Curriculum
­ 11 ­
A student may also fulfill the minimum requirements for a major by taking eight semester courses
in the major field and two semester courses, approved by a major advisor, in associated fields. In inter-
departmental majors, such as Political Economy, a larger number of courses may be required.
2) A prescribed sequence of courses, supplemented by parallel courses, and including a major
seminar, is required in some major fields. Other majors ask the student to plan a sequence of elective
courses, including advanced work building on elementary courses in the field, and ending in a one- or
two- semester faculty-organized course or project in the senior year. All majors provide a system of
counseling to help students plan programs reflecting individual interests as well as disciplined and
cumulative patterns of inquiry.
Courses in many major programs require prerequisite courses in related areas. A full description of the
detailed structure of each major is found under the heading of that major.
CONTRACT MAJOR
Students who wish to undertake the coherent study of an interdisciplinary subject not covered by a regu-
larly offered major may propose to be contract majors. Procedures for arranging a contract major and for
honors work in such a major are described in the section, "Courses of Instruction." Students interested in
this option should begin consulting with the Dean's Office and with potential faculty advisors early in the
sophomore year. A student completing a contract major may not do so in conjunction with a second major.
For further details, see page 128.
TWO MAJORS
A student may complete two majors with the permission of both majors and the Committee on Aca-
demic Standing. Although a student may be granted permission to use a course from one major to fulfill a
particular requirement in the other, the student nevertheless must take the minimum number of courses in
each field without counting any course twice. A student may be a candidate for Honors in either or both of
the majors, but a course for Honors in one major may not be used for an Honors course in the other.
Physical Education Requirement
The Physical Education requirement provides students the opportunity of establishing and main-
taining a general level of fitness and well-being; of developing abilities in carry-over activities; of
discovering and extending their own physical capabilities; and of developing skills in activities with
survival implications, such as swimming, life saving, and water safety.
A swim test is required of all first-year students at the start of the academic year. Students who fail
to complete the test must pass a basic swim course given in the Physical Education program during the
first quarter of the year.
Students must complete four quarters of physical education by the end of the sophomore year. Stu-
dents must enroll in at least two different activities in fulfilling the requirement.
Participation in a fall or spring intercollegiate sport is equivalent to two activity units and participation in
a winter sport is equivalent to three units. A maximum of three credits may be attained while participating
in intercollegiate sports with the exception of a two sport athlete who can fulfill the physical education
requirement by totaling four units in two sports. Students may receive a maximum of two activity units for
participation in a club sport; the remaining two units must come from the physical education activity pro-
gram.
Residence Requirement
Students who begin college at Williams must spend a minimum of six semesters in residence at
Williams. Students transferring to Williams from other institutions must spend a minimum of four
semesters in residence at Williams, and those entering as sophomores are expected to spend six se-
mesters in residence. Students are considered to be in residence if they are taking a program of study
under the direction of the Williams College Faculty. Students must be in residence for both semesters
of the final year.
The degree requirements must be completed within eight semesters, including any semesters for which
a student receives credit while not in residence at Williams. Thus, semesters spent away on exchange or
other approved programs at other colleges are included in the eight semesters. Similarly, if a student from
the Class of 2007 or earlier requests, and the Committee on Academic Standing grants, degree credit based
on Advanced Placement scores, then these semesters are also included in the limit of eight.

ADDITIONAL CURRICULAR OPPORTUNITIES
Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate
At the discretion of the appropriate departments or programs, students presenting satisfactory
scores in Advanced Placement tests or International Baccalaureate higher level examinations may be
placed in advanced courses not regularly open to them and/or may receive course credit toward the
major or concentration. Therefore, if granted, this credit may be used as a prerequisite or in partial
fulfillment of the major or concentration requirements. AP and IB credit, however, may not be used to
reduce the normal course load of any semester, to make up a deficiency incurred at Williams, or to
satisfy the Distribution Requirement.
For members of the Class of 2007 or earlier, AP or IB credit (if in two or more subjects) may also be
used for acceleration, i.e. completion of the degree in fewer than four years. Starting with the Class of 2008,
this option is not available.
Certificate in European Languages
Students may pursue a Certificate in four European languages offered at Williams (French, German,
Russian, and Spanish). The program certifies a particular degree of proficiency, cultural literacy, and expe-
rience with the language in the context of one's college education. In order to gain the proficiency and
experience certified by the program, students must have taken a) at least five semesters of college language
(or the equivalent) and b) a standardized proficiency test administered by the departments. In addition,
students are required to gain familiarity with the culture in question by taking at least one course each in a)
the literature, music, art, or philosophy, and b) the history, economics, or politics of the cultural area. Stu-
dents must take seven courses altogether, up to two of which may be taken abroad. Please refer to the
respective language programs for details on the specific certificates.
Combined Program in Liberal Arts and Engineering
The 3-2 program enables qualified students to combine a liberal arts education at Williams with
undergraduate professional training in engineering. In this program, a student studies at Williams for
3 years, completing 24 courses and 3 Winter Study Projects. He or she then transfers to a leading engi-
neering school and studies for a Bachelor of Science degree, usually for 2 more years. Upon success-
ful completion of this program, the student receives a Bachelor of Arts degree from Williams and a
Bachelor of Science degree from the engineering school.
During their 3 years at Williams, 3-2 students must complete all of the normal requirements for a Wil-
liams degree, including a major and the distribution requirements. For students majoring in physics,
chemistry, computer science, or mathematics, the requirements for the senior year courses and major
exercise are waived for the Williams degree. Only students who have taken the prerequisite courses,
who have at least a B average in scientific subjects, and who have a good record in other subjects will
be recommended by their major department and approved by the Committee on Academic Standing
for this program.
Williams has a formal agreement with Columbia University that simplifies the application process to
Columbia's 3-2 engineering program. This program has an extensive list of prerequisite mathematics
and science courses, so it is necessary to plan course selections at Williams carefully. The booklet
"Choosing First Year Courses" includes a list of Williams courses recommended to prospective engi-
neers.
A popular alternative to the 3-2 program is to complete the Williams B.A. in the usual 4 years, ma-
joring in one of the sciences, and then go directly to a graduate program in engineering. Please see the
section of this catalog titled "Preparation for Graduate and Professional Study." Also, prospective en-
gineers at Williams have the opportunity to take undergraduate engineering courses at other institu-
tions through various exchange programs. For information about these opportunities, please see the
section titled "Exchange Programs."
The pre-engineering advisor, Professor Jefferson Strait, will be happy to assist students inter-
ested in any of the options leading to engineering careers. Many more details about pre-engineering
can be found in the Physics Department section of the College website.

Co-ordinate Programs Offering Concentrations
In addition to majoring in a field, a student may choose to concentrate elective courses on a single
topic or area. Normally, a student declares a concentration at the time of registration in the spring of
the sophomore year. Concentrations are offered in the following programs:
African-American Studies
Biochemistry and Molecular Biology
Cognitive Science
Environmental Studies
International Studies
Jewish Studies
Latina/o Studies
Leadership Studies
Legal Studies
Maritime Studies
Neuroscience
Science and Technology Studies
Descriptions of these programs appear under the appropriate heading in this publication. If the co-ordi-
nate program courses are directly related to the major, a student may be allowed to reduce the number of
courses required to complete the major.
Co-ordinate Programs
A number of programs do not formally offer concentrations, but do provide students with the op-
portunity to work in areas that cut across departmental and program lines. These are: Bioinformatics,
Genomics, and Proteomics; Materials Science Studies; and Performance Studies. They are listed in
this publication in alphabetical order.
These programs provide guidance only and do not appear on transcripts.
The Critical Reasoning and Analytical Skills (CRAAS) Initiative
To one degree or another, every class at Williams goes beyond its subject--be it mathematics, Ma-
chiavelli, or modernism--to teach intellectual skills that have wide application in other fields as well
as outside of the academy: scientific reckoning, expository writing, rhetorical analysis, oral presenta-
tion, and so on.
Courses offered under the CRAAS initiative foreground such analytical skills. While each CRAAS
class covers a different topic, all are aimed particularly at developing the processes necessary for ex-
cellence in a range of fields: techniques for analyzing ideas, data, texts or artworks; approaches to
interpreting, synthesizing, and developing arguments; strategies for presenting ideas and results.
CRAAS classes typically emphasize the practices of meta-analysis--self-criticism, editing, and re-
vision--with the goal of constant improvement. Many classes feature peer tutoring, small group
work, and intensive one-on-one engagement with the professor. Students should leave a CRAAS
course with a substantially heightened ability to approach problems, analyze texts, and craft argu-
ments in whatever discipline they may go on to explore.
A few CRAAS courses are restricted to advanced students, but the majority are open to all, and
some are specifically targeted for first -year students. Most have strictly limited enrollment. Because
these classes cultivate the general strategies of effective scholarship, students are encouraged to con-
sider taking a CRAAS course early in their academic careers.
A list of CRAAS courses offered in 2005-2006 is on page 312.
Cross-Enrollment Programs
A limited number of students may register at Bennington College or Massachusetts College of Liberal
Arts for courses not offered by Williams. Interested students should contact the Registrar's Office about
arrangements.
Experiential Education at Williams
Experiential education, involving "learning by doing" outside the classroom, has been a relatively
understated but successful part of the Williams curriculum for a number of years. In addition to the use
of traditional laboratory work in the natural sciences and studio work in art, faculty have been chal-
The Curriculum
­ 14 ­
lenging students to become more personally engaged in the Williams curriculum through field work,
whether in the form of research, sustained work on special projects or through placement with com-
munity organizations. Courses which include experiential learning provide students with opportuni-
ties to encounter firsthand the issues that they read and study about, requiring them to apply academic
learning to nonacademic settings and challenging them to use their experiences in those settings to
think more critically and deeply about what they are studying. Courses involving experiential educa-
tion as defined above range from fully integrated off-campus programs such as the Williams-Mystic
Maritime Studies Program (page 333) to courses involving one small field research project. The
amount and nature of the experiential component(s) varies according to the instructor's judgment. See
page 313 for a list of '05-'06 courses involving experiential education.
A range of non-credit experiential education opportunities is also available to interested stu-
dents. Community service, internships, research, and the Museum Associates Program of the Col-
lege Museum of Art all provide students the chance to "learn by doing" outside the classroom. In-
formation on each of these opportunities is provided below.
Community Service:
Opportunities to apply creative energy and initiative abound in community organizations in the Wil-
liams College area. Service ranges from tutoring or building homes with Habitat for Humanity, to working
with developing non-profit organizations such as Chrysalis, an advanced-stage AIDS residence. For more
information, go to the Lehman Community Service Council homepage on the College website at
<http://wso.williams.edu: 8000/orgs/lehman/> or contact Rick Spalding, College Chaplain and Coordina-
tor of Community Service (Richard.E.Spalding@williams.edu).
Internships and Research Opportunities:
A wide variety of summer internship opportunities are available to interested students through the Of-
fice of Career Counseling (OCC) and the Center for Environmental Studies (CES). Research opportunities
are also available through individual departments. Information about OCC's Williams College Alumni
Sponsored Summer Internships can be found at http://www.williams.edu/admin-depts/occ/ or by contact-
ing Ron Gallagher, Assistant Director of Career Counseling (Ronald.L.Gallagher@williams.edu). Infor-
mation about CES's summer internship and research opportunities can be found at www.williams.edu/
CES/resources/summeropps.htm or by contacting Sarah Gardner, Assistant Director of the Center for En-
vironmental Studies, Kellogg House (Sarah.S.Gardner@williams.edu). Information about research oppor-
tunities sponsored by individual departments is available from Department Chairs.
Museum Associates:
The Museum Associates Program of the Williams College Museum of Art provides students an
opportunity to broaden their knowledge of art and art history, to learn about the field of museum
education, and to develop valuable communication and public speaking skills while working with the
public. The only academic requirement is the completion of ART101-102. Applications are accepted
every spring. For more information, contact Rebecca Hayes, Director of Education at Rebec-
ca.L.Hayes@williams.edu.
For more information about experiential education at Williams College, visit the Experiential
Education website at or contact Paula Consolini, Coordinator of Experiential Education at
597-4588 (pconsoli@williams.edu)
Honors Program
Williams awards the degree with honors to those students who have demonstrated imagination,
initiative, and intellectual independence within the major. The Honors Program requires two or three
courses constituting a clearly interrelated pattern of study, whether in the form of a thesis, specializa-
tion within the major, or interdisciplinary study with courses from other programs or departments. At
least one of the courses must be in addition to the minimum number required for the major; one may
be a Winter Study Project. A student who is completing two majors may be a candidate for honors in
either or both of the majors, but a course for honors in one major may not be used as an honors course
in the other. Some programs also award honors for their concentrations.
Individual departments and programs describe special criteria, procedures, and patterns of study for
honors in the "Courses of Instruction" section. Students should consult with their departments on their hon-
ors options prior to the senior year. Before the student has begun the last of the required course units, the
The Curriculum
­ 15 ­
department or program determines whether the student is admitted to honors candidacy. The degree is
awarded with Honors or Highest Honors at the end of the senior year if, in the judgment of the department,
its criteria of excellence have been met.
Independent Study
When a particularly able student wishes to study a subject not covered by the normal offerings of the
College, arrangements may be made to undertake courses of independent study under faculty supervision.
Such arrangements are made with the appropriate department at the time of registration.
Study Away from Williams
Students may receive credit for work completed at other institutions or programs. Applications for
study elsewhere require the approval of the chair of thestudent'smajor,theDean's Office,and theCom-
mitteeonAcademic Standing.Studentsstudying away during the junior year should have already com-
pleted at least two courses in each division toward the divisional distribution requirement, the writing
and quantitative/formal reasoning requirements and the physical education requirement. Courses com-
pleted while away may be used toward the major with permission of the department or program and/or
to fulfill the peoples and cultures requirement. All other degree requirements must be met with courses
taken under the supervision of Williams faculty.
Williams participates in study abroad programs in Spain and France (in cooperation with Hamilton Col-
lege); in China (as part of the Associated Colleges in China); in Sweden (in cooperation with twelve other
colleges and the University of Stockholm); in Denmark (with the University of Copenhagen Danish In-
ternational Studies); and in Kyoto (the Associated Kyoto Program,runbyagroupofelevencolleges). Wil-
liams students may also receive credit for approved programs at a wide variety of other institutions, or for
work done directly in a foreign university or accredited four-year American university if acceptable evalu-
ation is possible. Students interested in study away should consult the Dean's Office. Students must submit
a pink petition and essay to the Dean's Office by March of the preceding academic year for which they
wish to study off campus. Students must be in good academic standing with no deficiencies and follow the
procedures as set out in the Guide to Study Abroad.
The Williams Tutorial Program
The Tutorial Program offers Williams students a distinctive opportunity to take a heightened form
of responsibility for their own intellectual development. No student is required to take a tutorial
course, but any student with the appropriate qualifications and interests is invited to do so.
Tutorials at the 100/200 level are designed primarily for sophomores; sophomores are usually giv-
en enrollment preference for such courses, though interested juniors and seniors (and, in some cases,
first-year students) are often welcome. Tutorials at the 300/400 level are designed primarily for jun-
iors and seniors (and, often, for majors in the discipline); first-year students and sophomores are wel-
come to apply, but are urged to consult the instructor before registering.
Tutorials place much greater weight than do regular courses--or even small seminars--on student
participation. They aim to teach students how to develop and present arguments; listen carefully, and
then refine their positions in the context of a challenging discussion; and respond quickly and cogent-
ly to critiques of their work. Tutorials place particular emphasis on developing analytical skills, writ-
ing abilities, and the talents of engaging in rigorous conversation and oral debate.
The ways in which particular tutorials are conducted vary across the disciplines, but here is a de-
scription of how most tutorials at Williams are organized. Tutorials are usually limited to ten students.
At the start of term, the instructor divides the students into pairs. Each pair meets weekly with the
instructor for roughly one hour. Many tutorial courses begin and end the term with a group seminar,
and in a few departments, instructors hold weekly group meetings of all tutorial members to provide
background information designed to facilitate the students' independent work. But the heart of every
tutorial course is the weekly meeting of the two students with the instructor.
At these weekly meetings, one student delivers a prepared essay or presentation (e.g., an analysis of
a text or work of art, a discussion of a problem set, a report on laboratory exercises, etc.) pertaining to
the assignment for that week, while the other student--and then the instructor--offer a critique. In the
following week, students switch roles. Typically, students write five or six essays (usually in the range
of 4-7 pages) during the term, and offer five or six critiques of their partners' work.
Since the program's inception in 1988, students have ranked tutorials among the most demanding--
and rewarding--courses they have taken at Williams. While not designed to be more difficult than other
The Curriculum
­ 16 ­
courses, tutorials are nonetheless challenging, with frequent writing assignments and the expectation
that students will be well prepared to participate actively and effectively in weekly discussions. At the
same time, students have consistently placed tutorials among the most enriching and consequential
courses they have taken. They have appreciated the close attention to their writing and argumentation
skills; the opportunity to be held accountable, in a detailed way, for the extended implications of their
ideas; the chance to develop their oral abilities as they engage in debate; and the close intellectual bonds
tutorials build between teachers and students, and students with each other. Many students have formed
important advising and mentoring relationships with their tutorial teachers.
Registration information: Students register for tutorials as they would for any other course (but
should first check the description for prerequisites and to see if permission of the instructor is re-
quired). (2) Because of limited enrollments and the special arrangements involved in organizing tuto-
rials, students are encouraged to determine, as early as possible, their interest in and commitment to
the course. Students may not drop or add a tutorial after the first week of class. (3) Tutorials may not be
taken on a pass/fail basis.
More information: Please see page 320 of this catalog for a list of tutorials offered in 2005-2006. Stu-
dents may obtain detailed information about particular tutorials from the course descriptions and the
instructors. (All tutorials have a "T" after the course number.) For general information, advice, or sugges-
tions about the program, please contact Professor William Wagner, Tutorial Program Director for
2005-2006, in Stetson.
Williams-Exeter Programme at Oxford University
Williams offers a year-long programme of studies at Oxford University in cooperation with Exeter Col-
lege, Oxford. Based at Ephraim Williams House, Williams' study center at Oxford, the Programme is de-
signed to offer the fullest possible integration of the students into the intellectual and social life of one of the
world's great universities. It makes full use of the Oxford tutorial system and the Oxford three-term calen-
dar is followed.
In addition to extensive opportunities to pursue British and Commonwealth studies, the Pro-
gramme also offers instruction in other fields for which Oxford is particularly noted or which are rep-
resented only marginally or infrequently in the Williams curriculum. Interested students should con-
sult the Dean's Office and the "Courses of Instruction" section of this catalog.
Williams-Mystic Maritime Studies Program
The William-Mystic Seaport Maritime Studies Program offers students a unique opportunity to
explore the ocean, to travel the Atlantic and Pacific Coasts, and to undertake original research of
their own design in the humanities and sciences. A term at Williams-Mystic satisfies both a semes-
ter's credit and one winter study requirement, as well as intensive writing course credit. Four Wil-
liams courses are offered as an integrated, multidisciplinary curriculum in the semester-long pro-
gram at Mystic Seaport, in Mystic, Connecticut: Maritime History, Literature of the Sea, Marine
Policy, and either Marine Ecology or Oceanography (see the American Maritime Studies section in
this catalog). Williams College faculty members serve as the Director and Marine Scientist. Travel
includes an offshore voyage on the open ocean sailing aboard a tall ship, a seminar along the Pacific
Coast, and a seminar on Nantucket Island, all of which are cross-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary
exercises. Students live in historic, cooperative, coed houses at Mystic Seaport, the world's largest
maritime museum, and have full access to world-class maritime collections, a maritime library,
well-equipped laboratory, and diverse coastal habitats (where field research can be undertaken in a
wide variety of environments, ranging from tidepools and salt marshes to sandy beaches and estu-
aries). Students also participate in maritime skills under professional instruction, with choices such
as celestial navigation, maritime art, music of the sea, boat building, or small boat handling and
sailing. Williams-Mystic seeks candidates who are willing to try new things and work in a compel-
ling academic environment. No sailing experience necessary, and all majors welcome--a typical
semester at Williams-Mystic is represented by 12 to 14 different majors spanning the sciences and
humanities. Sophomores, juniors, and seniors can attend. Interested students should contact Wil-
liams-Mystic at admissions@williamsmystic.org, call (860-572- 5359), visit the website (wil-
liamsmystic.org), or obtain a Williams-Mystic catalog from the Dean's office. Applications are on
the web and at the Dean's office. Financial aid and scholarships are available.

Williams in New York
Williams in New York is a one-semester study away program with a focus on experiential educa-
tion. It is distinctive, rigorous, and highly experiential, integrating traditional scholarship with on-
going fieldwork in related areas. Students attend classes and also spend 15 hours each week in a
workplace environment, gaining hands-on experience that provides them with new insights and
ideas which relate to their coursework. In turn, they bring this new-found knowledge into the work-
place and are able to analyze their experiences against an academic background. The fieldwork
placements are arranged in consultation with a Williams faculty member who serves as program
director. Each student is placed in a city organization or agency, where they work closely with non-
faculty supervisors throughout the semester. Classes are taught by the program director and other
professors from Williams or New York area colleges and universities. The program is headquar-
tered at the Williams Club in midtown Manhattan in close proximity to the New York Public Li-
brary, the City University of New York Graduate Center, Grand Central Station, and other New
York landmarks.

ACADEMIC STANDARDS AND REGULATIONS
Attendance
In order to give students a larger share of responsibility for their own education, Williams College does
not administer a general system of required classroom attendance. The College expects students to make
full use of their educational opportunities by regular class attendance and to assume the academic risks
incurred by absences.
Although no formal system of class attendance is maintained by the College, instructors may set such
standards of attendance as they feel are necessary for the satisfactory conduct of their courses. Students
who fail to meet these standards may be warned by the instructor and notice sent to the Dean that continued
absence will result in their being dropped from the course. A failing grade will be assigned to any course
dropped after the regular course change period. Students who do not attend the first class meeting in a
semester course or Winter Study Project may be required to withdraw by the instructor. Attendance is re-
quired at announced tests and final examinations unless the student is specifically excused by the instructor
or the Dean's Office. Satisfactory attendance in four quarters of activities approved by the Department of
Physical Education is required except for students excused by the Dean and the Director of Health.
Registration
Registration for fall and spring semesters and for the Winter Study Program takes place at designated
periods during the academic year. There may be a $5 per day processing fee for any registration changes
accepted after the announced deadlines.
New students register by mail in early summer; soon after arrival at Williams, they meet with their as-
signed Academic Advisors to discuss the curriculum and their course selections. All course changes for
new students are made with the approval of the Faculty Advisors. During the first two years of study, stu-
dents are limited in the number of courses they may take in one department or subject each semester. For
full details, see page 45.
Course Change Period
Course changes may be made during a designated period at the beginning of each semester. No course
changes may be made after that period except with the approval of the Committee on Academic Standing,
after consultation with the Dean's Office. During Winter Study, a second Winter Study Project may be
added if the instructor approves but the original Project may not be dropped. A processing fee of $5 per day
may be assessed for each course change accepted after the announced deadline.
First-year and first-semester transfer students may be permitted to withdraw from one course (incurring
a deficiency but no grade penalty) as late as the tenth week of the semester. Upperclass students also may
once in subsequent years withdraw from a course under the same conditions. A withdrawal, recorded on
the transcript as a "W," is granted only with the approval of the instructor and a dean and only if there is
complete agreement between the instructor and the dean that, despite conscientious effort to do the work,
continuation in the course would be detrimental to the overall educational interest or health of the student.
The deficiency thereby incurred must be removed in the normal manner. See references to making up defi-
ciencies on page 20.
Course Load
Students are required to take and complete four courses each semester. In exceptional cases, students
may, upon petition to the Committee on Academic Standing and with departmental approval at the time of
registration, elect a pattern of five semester courses in the fall semester and three in the spring or three in the
fall and five in the spring; a pass-fail course cannot be used as the fifth course in this pattern.
If a student with a disability believes that he/she is unable to pursue a full course of study, the student
may petition the Disabilities and Accommodations Advisory Group for permission to pursue a reduced
course load. Such a petition must be accompanied by a professional evaluation which addresses the stu-
dent's inability to maintain a full course of study and discusses the rationale for a reduced course load.
Upon consideration of a student's petition and supporting documentation, the Disabilities and Accom-
modations Advisory Group makes a recommendation to the Committee on Academic Standing which
renders decisions. Such cases are considered on an individual basis and may be initiated at any time during
the student's tenure at Williams.
Academic Standards and Regulations
­ 19 ­
Fifth Course Pass-Fail Option
Except in the case of the unbalanced course program described above, a student may, at the beginning of
any semester, enroll in a fifth course that must be specified as the pass-fail course. By the sixth week, a
student must decide whether to continue the course, and if so, whether on a pass-fail or regularly graded
basis. A form for designating the option chosen will be sent from the Registrar's Office. A processing fee
of $5 per day may be assessed for 5th course grading option designations accepted after the announced
deadline. A course graded "Pass" may not be used as one of the thirty-two semester courses required to
complete the degree, to fulfill distribution or major requirements, or to make up a deficiency. A pass-fail
course converted to a fifth regularly graded course may be used to fulfill distribution or major requirements
or to make up a deficiency incurred in a prior term. The grade received will be included in the calculation
of the student's cumulative grade-point average.
Winter Study Project
Students must take and pass a Winter Study Project in each of their four years. Winter Study Projects are
graded Honors, Pass, Perfunctory Pass, or Fail. All work for Winter Study Projects must be submitted by
the last day of the Winter Study Program; work may be accepted after this date only with the permission of
a dean. Students who fail their Winter Study Projects will be placed on Academic Probation by the Com-
mittee on Academic Standing and will be required to make up the deficiency (see page 20). Students who
fail through gross neglect of work will normally be required to resign. A student who receives a second
Perfunctory Pass grade in Winter Study will be required to pass a fifth course, which may be graded on the
regular A-E or pass/fail basis, in the following spring or fall semester.
Grading System and Records
Williams uses the following system of grades: A, excellent; B, good; C, fair; D, passing; E, failing.
These letters, with plus and minus value, have the following numerical equivalents in calculating grade
averages:
A+ = 4.33 B+ = 3.33 C+ = 2.33 D+ = 1.33
A = 4.00 B = 3.00 C = 2.00 D = 1.00 E = 0
A­ = 3.67 B­ = 2.67 C­ = 1.67 D­ = 0.67
A permanent record of each student's grades is kept and this official record forms the basis for any aca-
demic action by the College.
A transcript of a student's cumulative academic record is available from the Registrar's Office upon
written request. Transcripts will not be issued for students who are in financial arrears.
Provisions relating to student records, access to them, and safeguards on their use are in the Student
Handbook.
First-Year Student Warnings
In the middle of each semester, instructors report to the Registrar those first-year students whose grades
at that time are unsatisfactory. The students and their academic advisors receive notices of warnings as a
matter of routine. The Dean's Office will inform parents of students who receive two or more warnings
unless instructed not to do so by the student within three working days of the receipt of the warnings.
Extensions of Deadlines
Deadlines for course work are set by the instructor with the following limitations:
 for courses with final exams, the latest that written work may be due is 5:00 p.m. on the last
day of reading period.
 for courses without final exams, the latest that written work may be due is 5:00 pm. on the
third-to-last day of the exam period.
If work is due before these deadlines, the instructor may grant an extension up to these deadlines solely
at his or her discretion. Short extensions beyond these deadlines may be granted by a dean but only with the
concurrence of the instructor. No extensions will be granted beyond the examination period except in the
case of serious illness.
Instructors may require students who have missed announced quizzes or hour tests to present satis-
factory explanations to a dean before they are permitted to make up the exercises.
Academic Standards and Regulations
­ 20 ­
If a student is absent from a final examination, a make-up examination may be given only with the
permission of a dean and at a time determined by the dean.
Deficiencies
A student receives credit for a course by obtaining a grade of at least D minus. If the student fails a
course, he or she must make up the deficiency.
If a failure occurs in the first semester of a full-year course, the student may, with the consent of the
instructor, continue the course and receive credit for the second semester only. If a failure occurs in the
second semester of a full-year course, credit for passing the first semester may be retained only with the
approval of the Committee on Academic Standing.
A senior who incurs a failure in the first semester in a required major course may be dropped from the
College at midyear.
Normally deficiencies can be made up only by courses taken after the deficiencies have been incurred.
A student must make up a deficiency in one of these ways:
1) obtain a grade of at least C minus in a summer school course, approved in advance by the Registrar,
at a regionally accredited four-year college or university; (The grade will not, however, be included
in the calculation of the student's cumulative grade point average.)
2) pass an extra graded course at Williams in the semester following the failure;
3) in the case of afirst-semester failure ofayear-long language course, obtainagrade of at leastaCminus
in the work of the second semester of that course. The failure for the first semester will, however, re-
main on the student's record and will be included in the cumulative grade point average.
A deficiency must normally be made up before the start of the following academic year, or in the case of
a deficiency incurred in the spring semester, no later than the following fall semester. A student may, in
consultation with the Dean's Office, petition the Committee on Academic Standing with an alternate plan.
Separation for Low Scholarship
It is the policy of Williams College not to permit a student to remain in residence after it has become
evident that he or she is either unable or unwilling to maintain reasonable standards of academic achieve-
ment. At the end of each term, the Committee on Academic Standing reviews all academic records that fail
to meet the following minimum academic requirements:
For first-year students: Three grades of C minus or better and no failures each semester, and
at least Perfunctory Pass on the Winter Study Project
For upperclass students: Four grades of C minus or better each semester, and
at least Perfunctory Pass on the Winter Study Project
Students whose records fail to meet these minimum academic requirements or whose records otherwise
fail to show adequate progress may receive an academic warning, be placed on academic probation, or be
required to resign.
Students who are required to resign from the College for academic reasons are normally not permitted to
return for at least one year from the date of their resignation. A student who has been required to resign
from the College may petition the Committee on Academic Standing through the Dean for reinstatement
on two conditions only: all deficiencies must have been made up and a letter submitted to the Committee
that offers convincing evidence that the student is ready and able to complete work toward a degree at
Williams without further interruption.
When required to resign, students must vacate their rooms promptly. Financial aid students must also
see the Director of Financial Aid before leaving to discuss loan repayment and renewal of aid in the event
of readmission.
A student who fails to meet minimum academic standards in his or her final semester at Williams may
be required by the Committee on Academic Standing to meet them by earning grades of at least C minus
elsewhere before the B.A. will be awarded. If such work is required, it must be completed within three
years unless stipulated otherwise, and the courses must be approved in advance by the Registrar.
Withdrawal from the College in Good Standing
Students may request personal leaves of absence from a dean and, if granted, withdraw from the Col-
lege. Such time away, often as a period of reassessment and self evaluation, can prove to be educationally
Academic Standards and Regulations
­ 21 ­
beneficial. A withdrawal in good standing may be granted for not less than one semester and not more than
three years. Students who withdraw in good standing are readmitted with the approval of the Dean's Office
and are expected to complete the degree without further interruption.
Students may request permission from a dean to withdraw at any time. If a student is granted a personal
leave of absence after the semester begins, but before the end of the drop/add period, the transcript will list
the date of withdrawal as the day before the term began. If a personal leave is granted after the end of the
drop/add period, but before the end of the eighth week of the semester, the transcript will list the date of
withdrawal, but the semester will not count toward the maximum of eight allowed to complete the degree.
If a personal withdrawal is allowed after the eighth week of the semester, the transcript will list the date of
withdrawal and the courses in progress, each with a W; the semester will normally count toward the maxi-
mum of eight allowed to complete the degree and the student will incur deficiencies that must be made up
before returning to the College.
Refunds
Payment refund or credit in the event of withdrawal is described on page 28.
Eligibility for and Completion of Majors
To be eligible for any major, students must have received grades of C minus or better in each course in
the major taken in the first two years of college and Honors or Pass on any Winter Study Project taken in
the major department or program. A senior may enter a major only upon the approval of the department
chair and the Committee on Academic Standing.
All semester courses in the major must be taken on a regularly graded basis. In addition to passing each
major course and, where required, a major Winter Study Project, the student must maintain an average in
the major of 1.67 or higher. Seniors who have an average below 1.67 in the major field will normally not be
allowed to continue. A senior who receives a grade of E in the first semester of a required major course
may be dropped from the College at mid-year. A student who falls below these standards may continue in
the major only with the approval of the Committee on Academic Standing.
A senior major exercise is not required by every department but is by some. All departments requiring
such an exercise specify it as such in the description of their major programs in the "Courses of Instruction"
section, and all students in those departments must complete the exercise satisfactorily.
Eligibility for Extracurricular Activities
A student is eligible to represent the College in any athletic, dramatic, literary, or musical event and be in
the student government, or other organization as a member, substitute, or officer, unless he or she is de-
clared ineligible:
1) by the Dean;
2) by vote of the Discipline Committee; or
3) by vote of the Committee on Academic Standing because of a dangerously low record.
The Student Honor Committee may recommend to the Dean loss of eligibility as a penalty for a viola-
tion of the Honor Code.
Dean's List
All students who attain a semester average of 3.50 or higher in a program of four or more courses are
placed on the Dean's List for that semester.
Phi Beta Kappa Society
Students of the highest academic standing are eligible for election to membership in the Phi Beta Kappa
Society in accordance with the following rules:
1) The requirements for election to membership shall be a grade point average of 3.3 and Honors or
Pass in all required Winter Study Projects. There shall be two elections of new members for each class, at
the end of the junior and senior years.
2) At the end of the junior year, all students in the highest five percent of the class, ranked by cumulative
grade point average, shall be eligible for election provided they have met the requirements and have com-
pleted enough courses to be considered candidates for the B.A. degree in the following year. A student who
leaves Williams at the end of the junior year to attend graduate school may be elected under the above
procedures.
Academic Standards and Regulations
­ 22 ­
At the end of the senior year, all students not yet elected and in the highest 12.5 per cent of the class,
ranked by cumulative grade point average, shall be eligible for election provided they have met the require-
ments.
3) Students shall be eligible for election only if they have been students at Williams College for at least
two years.
4) Honorary members may be elected from distinguished alumni of at least twenty years' standing. No
more than one such member shall be elected each year.
5) Any student who shall have gained his or her rank by unfair means or who in the judgment of the
Dean of the College is not of good moral character is ineligible to election.
6) The name of a member elect shall be entered on the roll only after he or she has accepted the election
and has paid to the Treasurer the regular entrance fee.
7) Any undergraduate member who withdraws from the College before graduation or who falls short of
the minimum Phi Beta Kappa scholastic standing may, upon a two-thirds vote of the members present at
the annual meeting, be deprived of membership in the society.
8) Any undergraduate member who is expelled from the College shall be deprived of membership in
the Society.
9) While connected with Williams College as an officer of instruction or administration, any graduate of
Williams College who is a member of another chapter of Phi Beta Kappa shall be considered a regular
member of the Williams chapter.
10) While connected with Williams College as professor, associate professor or assistant professor, or
an officer of administration, any member of another chapter of Phi Beta Kappa shall have all the privileges
of the Williams chapter, including holding office and voting. While connected with Williams College, any
other officer of instruction or administration who is a member of another chapter shall have all the privi-
leges of the Williams chapter, except holding office and voting.
Awarding of Degrees
By vote of the Trustees, the degree of Bachelor of Arts is conferred at Commencement upon students
who have completed the requirements as to courses and grades to the satisfaction of the Faculty. The right
to a degree may, however, be forfeited by misconduct at any time prior to the conferring of the degree. No
degree in absentia will be conferred except by special vote of the Trustees on petition presented to the
Dean. Diplomas will not be authorized for students who have not paid College charges or have not re-
turned all books belonging to the library.
Graduation with Distinction
The Faculty will recommend to the Trustees that the degree of Bachelor of Arts with distinction be con-
ferred upon those members of the graduating class who have passed all Winter Study Projects and obtained
a four year average in the top:
35% of the graduating class -- Bachelor of Arts cum laude or higher
15% of the graduating class -- Bachelor of Arts magna cum laude or higher
2% of the graduating class -- Bachelor of Arts summa cum laude
­ 23 ­
ACADEMIC ADVISING
A variety of academic advice and counsel is provided to students during the course of their undergradu-
ate education. Instructors, departmental and administrative officers, and some special programs are avail-
able to help students explore and develop their academic interests and talents and take advantage of aca-
demic opportunities available through the College.
In the first year each student is assigned an academic advisor from the faculty or staff. This advisor
discusses course choices and academic requirements with the student. The Dean's Office coordinates this
advising program, reviews the academic progress of individual students, and--when appropriate--calls
students in to discuss their situations.
In the sophomore year, students continue their relationship with their first-year advisor and it is recom-
mended that they seek advice from deans, former advisors, and instructors, along with preprofessional and
other special advisors (see page 411). Sophomores are also encouraged to discuss major options and re-
quirements with faculty members from departments and programs in which they have an interest before
declaring a major in the spring semester.
The student-run Peer Advisor program provides additional advice and information for sophomore stu-
dents in particular, as well as for first-year students and any others with questions about particular courses,
departments, majors, or areas of study. Senior Advisors are nominated by departments and programs from
among the year's senior majors. During the course of the year the Senior Advisors hold several Course and
Majors Fairs, keep informed about any changes in faculty and curriculum in their departments, and gener-
ally make themselves available for consultation by students.
In the junior and senior years students are advised by faculty from their major departments or programs.
Each department or program determines its own advising system for its majors, although chairs are regu-
larly available for consultation.
ACADEMIC ASSISTANCE
Additional programs of academic assistance are also available through the Dean's Office. After confer-
ring with the instructor, a student needing extra help in a particular course may request a tutor recom-
mended to the Dean's Office by the department; costs of this tutoring are covered by the Dean's Office.
Students seeking to improve their writing skills in any course may take advantage of the Writing Workshop.
Trained and supervised by a coordinator, student writing tutors provide help with problems on papers al-
ready corrected and with drafts of papers in progress. The Math and Science Resource Center, a drop-in
help center staffed by student tutors, is also available to students of Biology 101, 102 and 202, Chemistry
151, 153, 155, 251, and 255, Mathematics 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105 and 106, Physics 131, 132, 141
and 142, and Statistics 101 and 201.
EXCHANGE AND STUDY ABROAD
Advising of exchange students and of Williams students wishing to study abroad in the junior year is
coordinated by the Dean's Office. Special orientation and information meetings are held during the fall
semester for new students and for students wishing to study abroad. Orientation and counseling of interna-
tional students is arranged by the International Student Advisor in the Dean's Office.

ACADEMIC HONESTY
All students are expected to be familiar with the Williams College Honor Code and to reaffirm their
commitment to the Statement of Academic Honesty at the beginning of each academic year. The Honor
Code covers all aspects of academic honesty, including the writing of papers and laboratory reports as well
as all quizzes, homework assignments, hour tests, and examinations.
Statement of Academic Honesty
As an institution fundamentally concerned with the free exchange of ideas, Williams College has al-
ways depended on the academic integrity of each of its members. In the spirit of this free exchange, the
students and faculty of Williams recognize the necessity and accept the responsibility for academic hones-
ty.
A student who enrolls at the College thereby agrees to respect and acknowledge the research and ideas
of others in his or her work and to abide by those regulations governing work stipulated by the instructor.
Any student who breaks these regulations, misrepresents his or her own work, or collaborates in the mis-
representation of another's work has committed a serious violation of this agreement.
Students and faculty are to report violations and alleged violations of this agreement. Such reports are to
be submitted to the Student Honor Committee, consisting of eight student members of the joint Faculty-
Student Honor System-Discipline Committee. This committee is responsible for determining the guilt or
innocence of the accused person or persons, and for recommending appropriate punishments to the Dean.
A committee of faculty members to be designated by the Faculty will sit with the Student Honor Commit-
tee in an advisory capacity.
A quorum of three-quarters shall be required for the Committee to meet. A vote of guilty by at least
three-quarters of those present is necessary for conviction. A recommendation for dismissal must be made
by unanimous vote of those present, and shall be carried out only with the assent of the President of the
College.
The Committee is responsible for informing the student body of the meaning and implications of this
statement. The aforementioned faculty committee shall be responsible for informing faculty members of
the meaning and implications of this statement.
Any amendments to this statement must be made through a student referendum in which two-thirds of
the student body votes, and in which two-thirds of those voting vote for the amendment. These alterations
must be ratified by the Faculty.
Adopted 1971
Guidelines
Instructors are encouraged to submit to the Honor Committee a written statement defining how the
Statement of Academic Honesty applies to their courses or laboratories, and to explain such guidelines to
their students. Instructors may set any type of final examination or hour test, ranging from closed-book,
alternate-seating classroom exercises to open-book, "take-home" examinations or papers, and any require-
ments for laboratory exercises. Some instructors encourage cooperation among students but others do not.
If a student is unsure how the Honor Code applies in a particular situation, it is ultimately the student's
responsibility to find out from his or her professor, or from a member of the Honor Committee, how the
Honor Code applies in that situation. An open and highly individualized system can last only as long as
both the students and the faculty work together to create a true academic community.
In written material, students are expected to avoid the possibility of even unintentional plagiarism by
acknowledging the sources of their work. Careful observance of accepted standards of reference and
attribution is required. The basic rules are summarized below. Students are further advised to consult a
recognized style manual to learn how to acknowledge sources correctly. While academic honesty does not
demand a footnote on statements of common fact, it does require that a student provide clear footnotes or
other appropriate documentation and give credit in the bibliography to ideas, interpretations, and facts that
particular sources have contributed to the student's final work.
Academic Honesty
­ 25 ­
The basic rules of attribution require that:
1) A direct quotation (whether a single word or a phrase, sentence, paragraph, or series of paragraphs)
must always be identified by quotation marks, by indenting and single spacing, or by reduced type size of
the quoted material, and a note must be used to state the exact source.
2) A paraphrase of the work of another must be acknowledged as such by a note stating the source.
3) Indebtedness to the specific ideas of others, or the summarizing of several pages, even though ex-
pressed in different words, must be acknowledged by a note stating the source.
4) Every instance of the use of another student's laboratory reports, computer programs, or other mate-
rial must be acknowledged by a note.
5) Even the use of a student's own previous work must be acknowledged; thus, a student must obtain
the prior permission of all instructors concerned before submitting substantially the same paper in more
than one course.
Procedures for Alleged Violations
Students or faculty members who have discovered a violation or a possible violation of the Honor Code
should report it promptly either to the faculty chair or to the student chair of the Honor Committee. As
soon as possible after receiving a report of an alleged Honor Code violation, the Student Honor Committee
will convene to hear the case. The person bringing the charge will present the evidence to the Committee in
the presence of the accused student, who may then speak in his or her own defense both with and without
the accuser present. After the accused student has left the proceedings, the Committee will determine inno-
cence or guilt and, if the latter, will recommend an appropriate penalty to the Dean. Depending on the
circumstances of the violation, penalties then imposed by the Dean may include such possibilities as a
directed grade of E in the course, disciplinary probation, or temporary or permanent separation from the
College.
­ 26 ­
EXPENSES
Within the limits of available funds, Williams endeavors to offer its educational opportunities to all who
qualify for admission. Income from its endowment and annual contributions from its alumni and friends
have enabled Williams to keep its tuition at about half the actual cost per student to the College.
Payment of Term Bills
College bills for one-half of all tuition and fees are mailed to parents twice a year (in mid-July and mid-
December) for payment on August 15 and January 15; a fee of $250 may be charged if payment is re-
ceived after these dates. Term bills must be paid before the semester's classes begin or the student will not
be permitted to enroll in classes or remain in residence at the College. Billing statements for accounts with
outstanding balances or current activity will be issued monthly and are due upon receipt.
All outstanding balances must be paid to the Bursar, and all books and materials must be returned to the
Library, before the student is entitled to a degree or a transcript.
College Bills
College charges for tuition, room, board, and fees for the academic year 2005-2006 are as follows:
Tuition $31,548
Room Fee (including telephone service) 4,330
Full Board 4,220
Student Activities Fee* 162
House Maintenance Fee (upperclass) or First-Year Dues 50
_______
$40,310
Other Expenses
Based on a study of expenses reported by financial aid students, a minimum normal budget for a college
year at Williams includes additional expenses estimated as follows:
Books 800
Clothing, Laundry, Recreation approximately 1200
_______
Estimated year's total, exclusive of travel expenses** $2,000
________________
*A student activities fee for support of non-athletic student organizations is charged to all un-
dergraduates as part of the College term bill. It includes, for example, subscriptions to the col-
lege newspaper, and admission to most drama productions and musical events on campus.
**Travel expenses are not included in figures listed above. The cost of two round-trip tickets is
added into each successful financial aid candidate's award.
Additional Items
A House Maintenance Fee of $50 per year is charged to upperclassmen as a part of the College term bill.
It is used to provide a base for the social and cultural programs of each residential House and to meet any
unusual maintenance expenses for the Houses. First-year class dues of $50 are charged at the rate of $25
each semester.
The Commonwealth of Massachusetts requires that, effective September 1, 1989, all full- and part-time
students enrolled in institutions of higher education located in Massachusetts must participate in a qualify-
ing student health insurance plan offered by the institution or in another health insurance program affording
comparable coverage.
Expenses
­ 27 ­
The College offers a qualifying student health insurance plan to all students. The College will allow
students to waive participation in this insurance plan if the student will certify in writing, before the begin-
ning of the academic year, that the coverage offered by an alternative program chosen by the student is
comparable to that of the qualifying program available at the College.
Information about the student health insurance program offered by the College, including current details
of its cost, is mailed to all students each year. Additional information about this program or about the Com-
monwealth's requirements is available through the Thompson Health Center at (413) 597-3166.
There may be a $5 per day processing fee for any registration changes accepted after the announced
deadlines. There is a charge of $25 for a lost key.
Payment of College Bills
A non-refundable deposit of $200 to reserve a place in the first-year class is required from all admitted
candidates (except certain financial aid recipients) by the Candidate's Reply Date of May 1. The deposit
appears as a credit on the term bill rendered in July.
College tuition statements for one half of all fees are mailed to the billing name(s) and addresses on
record twice a year--in July, payable by August 15, and in December, payable by January 15. Payment
may be made by check, money order, or wire transfer. Credit cards can not be used to pay tuition and fees.
A fee of $250 may be charged if payment is received after these dates.
Students who receive a scholarship(s) that was not awarded through the Williams Office of Financial
Aid must complete a Scholarship Information Sheet and mail it to the Financial Aid Office by early June.
Provisional credit will be posted to the semester bill for the following; anticipated disbursements of direct
loans for which a promissory note has been signed and returned to the Office of Financial Aid, anticipated
disbursements of outside loans approved by the lender, outside scholarships which have not yet been re-
ceived and applied against the student account and any remaining semester contract amount for the Ten
Month Payment Plan. If actual payment for the above provisional credits are not received by the date antic-
ipated, the provisional credit will expire and be removed from the student's account creating a balance due.
A check returned to the College for any reason such as "account closed" or "insufficient funds" will be
charged to the student's term bill and a "return check charge" of $20.00 will be assessed. The College
reserves the right to require that payment be made in the form of cash, cashier check or money order.
Students with bills still unpaid at the start of the semester who have not made satisfactory arrangements
with the Bursar will not be permitted to enroll in classes or remain in residence at the College. Furthermore,
if arrangements for payment after the start of the semester are approved by the Bursar and these expected
payments are not made on time, students may not be allowed to enroll for the next semester.
If efforts by the Bursar's Office to collect the monies owed are unsuccessful, the account could be
placed with a collection agency, and if the delinquency persists, the College's experience with the account
may be reported to a national credit bureau. It is the policy of the College to pass on to the debtor all reason-
able costs associated with collection of the debt through a collection agency. If at any time the student
believes information concerning payment delinquency is inaccurate, he/she should notify the College c/o
The Bursar's Office, P.O. Box 406, Williamstown, MA 01267.
There are several loan options available to parents through outside sources. These include the MassPlan
Loan through the Massachusetts Educational Financing Authority and the Federal Plus Loan Program.
Information on these loans can be found in the brochure A Guide to Borrowing for College.
Williams also offers an installment plan, administered by Tuition Management Services whereby the
yearly charges are paid in 10 equal installments starting in June, with no interest charges. There are no
income restrictions. Monthly payments will be the total cost (less any scholarships, Stafford or parent
loans) divided by 10. There is an administration fee for this program. Information on this program is sent
each spring to all parents or can be obtained by calling Tuition Management Services at (888) 216­4258.

Financial Aid
Williams has a substantial financial aid program to promote the greatest possible diversity in the social
and economic background of the student population. Students interested in financial aid policies and pro-
cedures should consult Williams College Prospectus, the Student Handbook, or the Office of Financial Aid.
Distinctive Undergraduate Scholarships
Williams College, through the Office of Financial Aid, administers over three hundred endowed schol-
arships, all of which are based on demonstrated need. Students who apply for financial assistance are auto-
matically considered for all these and other endowed scholarships. No separate application is required.
Limited space prohibits the complete listing of these, but some deserve special mention because of their

year to six to eight of the most promising scholars in the first-year class. Tyng Scholars are also eligible for
assistance for up to three years of graduate/professional study.
Alumni Funded Tutorials
Tutorials bring a professor and two students together in weekly sessions that epitomize President
James A. Garfield's (Class of 1856) legendary statement: "The ideal college is Mark Hopkins on
one end of the log and a student on the other." They forge student-professor bonds, teach students
about arguments, about arriving at and defending a position, and about responding on the spot to
questions, criticisms, and suggestions. They also promote critical reading, the writing of succinct
analyses, and oral defense.
The College acknowledges the Classes of 1953, 1954, and 1979 with deepest gratitude for support-
ing Tutorials with their generous 25th and 50th Reunion gifts. Williams is also pleased to recognize
the following individuals who have created generous endowments to support Tutorials in honor of
their 25th and 50th Reunions: Hugh Germanetti 1954, David A. Gray 1954, John D. Mabie 1954,
and John H. Simpson 1979.
A member of the Class of 1954 Reunion gift Purpose Committee says, "This is the essence of
education and eminently worthy of the full support of the 50th Reunion Class of 1954. I was always
aware of the benefit we each enjoyed as one student among only fifteen or eighteen in our usual
classes--would that we also could have had the benefit of regular two-on-one sessions with a pro-
fessor. I don't believe we could offer those who follow us anything richer than that experience."

PREPARATIONFORGRADUATEAND PROFESSIONALSTUDY
Although the principle function of Williams is to provide a broad and solid liberal education that will be
of lasting value no matter what the vocation a student may pursue, the College recognizes that no funda-
mental conflict exists between a liberal education and preparation for a professional career; on the contrary,
a foundation of liberal studies increases professional competence in any field. A student should plan his or
her program of study so as to provide as much educational breadth and enrichment as circumstances per-
mit. A student should also give serious consideration to post-college plans early in the college career.
Each departmental major provides the foundation for graduate study in the corresponding field. Stu-
dents should consult the departmental programs listed under "Courses of Instruction" for requirements,
and for special advice regarding preparation for graduate study. Students should also consult with the ap-
propriate departmental chairman or the special faculty advisors as early as possible in their college careers
to make certain they have taken all the necessary factors into consideration.
Particular attention is called to the foreign language requirements of graduate study. Candidates for the
degree of doctor of philosophy at almost all graduate schools are required to have a reading knowledge of
both French and German. Under certain circumstances another language may replace French. Many grad-
uate schools require also a knowledge of Latin for students of English and Romantic Languages. Candi-
dates for the master of arts degree are required to have a reading knowledge of either French or German.
Students should consult departmental chairmen or the faculty advisors for the requirements in specific
fields of study.
Visual Arts
Although requirements set by various art and architectural schools differ, the basic requirements for a
variety of visual arts fields are summarized in the pamphlet "Guide to the Studio Art Major," available
from the Department of Art office in the W.L.S. Spencer Studio Art Building or the Office of Admission. A
summary of the requirements of all art and architecture schools offering Master of Arts and/or Master of
Fine Arts is available in the bulletin of the College Art Association (CAA), "MFA Programs in the Visual
Arts: A Directory." According to the current edition:
Admission to MFA programs should be based on the nature, extent, and quality of undergraduate
preparation, including courses in studio, art history, and other academic subjects. Quality of studio
preparation can best be judged on the basis of careful evaluation of work done at the undergraduate
level; therefore, a portfolio review (usually represented by slides) is regarded as an absolute necessity
in the admission process.
While many institutions consider the BFA to be the standard qualifying degree, the fact that the
applicant has attended a BA- or BS-granting institution does not necessarily rule out acceptance in
most MFA programs. Whatever the undergraduate degree, most entering graduate students tend not
to be completely prepared in one or more of the areas cited above and will require remedial make-up
work...
Some institutions use the MA degree as a qualifying prerequisite for final acceptance into MFA
candidacy, allowing the student to apply the earned credits toward the higher degree. (pp. 139-40)
Students are advised to take into consideration not only current minimum requirements but also recom-
mended courses. A summary of the essential information required for curricular planning may be found in
the "Guide to the Studio Art Major" and in the pamphlet "Choosing First Year Courses."
Business Administration
Williams offers no special course in preparation for a business career for graduate study in business
administration. The qualities which are important to succeed in business, and which graduate business
schools are seeking, are an ability to reason and to express oneself logically and clearly in written and oral
exposition; a good understanding of the physical and social environment in which business operates; a
solid background in quantitative skills; and an appreciation of human motivations and goals. This means
that a broad liberal arts program is preferred over a highly specialized one.
Within this broad prescription it may be desirable to have at least one year of economics and one year of
mathematics (including statistics and calculus). For those interested in production management or opera-
Preparation for Graduate and Professional Study
­ 32 ­
tion research, additional work in any quantitative course and/or a course in computer science would be
helpful.
But there is no particular major at Williams that is designated as preparation for the business profession.
Students interested in futures in business are encouraged to undertake a broad educational program in the
arts, humanities, and sciences. It is important that one gets involved in extra-curricular activities and that
one holds a leadership position.
Students interested in graduate work in business administration should consult with the Director of the
Office of Career Counseling.
Engineering
Many Williams graduates enjoy productive careers in engineering, applied science, or technical
management. Successful engineers need to be able to communicate effectively, reason logically, and
understand both the technical and the social dimensions of a problem. A prospective engineer should
major in one of the sciences (usually physics, chemistry, computer science, or mathematics), while
pursuing a broad liberal arts education at Williams. Most often he or she will complete a Williams
B.A. in the usual four years and then go to an engineering school for professional training leading to a
master's degree or doctorate in engineering. While it may be necessary to make up a few undergradu-
ate engineering courses, the opportunities at Williams to participate in scientific research and the
breadth of a liberal arts education prepare Williams graduates to succeed in engineering graduate
study and in their careers.
The booklet "Choosing First Year Courses" contains a list of Williams courses recommended to
prospective engineers. Students interested in engineering also have the opportunity to take under-
graduate engineering courses at other institutions. Williams maintains formal exchange programs
with California Institute of Technology, Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth College, and
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Williams students can arrange to study at one of these leading engi-
neering schools for one or two semesters, typically during the junior year. Please see the "Exchange
Programs" section of this catalog for more information. The 3-2 program with Columbia University
offers another opportunity to study engineering at the undergraduate level. Please see the "Combined
Program in Liberal Arts and Engineering" section for information.
The pre-engineering advisor, Professor Jefferson Strait, will be happy to help plan course selections and
to discuss the possible paths to a career in engineering. Many more details about pre-engineering can be
found in the Physics Department section of the College website.
Law
Williams graduates regularly proceed directly to law schools on the strength of their liberal education.
No special courses are presented for pre-law students.
Students intending to study law should consult with the Pre-Law Advisor, Dawn Dellea, at the Office of
Career Counseling.
The Health Professions
Many Williams graduates elect to pursue a career in medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine, public
health, or other health-related fields. All are welcome to seek guidance from the Health Professions Office.
Students interested in medicine and related fields should pursue a broad liberal arts education, letting
enthusiasm for subjects be a guide. In most cases, a student should consider volunteer service and field-
specific internship experience in an effort to confirm interest in the chosen field. With careful planning, any
major can be studied.
In order to pursue a career in a health-related field, a student must pay particular attention to the courses
required for graduate school admission. In certain fields, upwards of twelve courses are listed as prerequi-
sites. The general requirements for many programs are outlined in "Choosing First Year Courses," but each
student considering advanced study in the health fields should plan on meeting with the Health Professions
Advisor early in the college career to ensure that planned coursework will meet specific admissions re-
quirements.
Charley Stevenson, the Health Professions Advisor, will be happy to discuss goals and specific steps
which might help a student realize them.
Preparation for Graduate and Professional Study
­ 33 ­
Pre-College and College Teaching/Research
A central qualification for careers in teaching at any level is proficiency in a major. Students interested in
college teaching and research should prepare themselves at Williams for graduate work in the subject of
their choice. Those interested in teaching at the elementary or secondary level should plan to attain state
certification and/or earn an MAT or M.Ed at a good graduate school. There are many opportunities to do
teaching internships and study education as an undergraduate while at Williams.
Students interested in college teaching should consult with the chairs of the departments in which they
intend to major. Those interested in teaching at the elementary and secondary level should consult with the
Director of the Program in Teaching or the Office of Career Counseling.
Teaching After Williams
There are many options for teaching after Williams, including independent and public school teaching.
Many states now offer streamlined programs to certify public school teachers, and many states offer wide
range of options for acquiring certification while you teach. Students who are interested in teaching are
encouraged to contact Susan Engel, the Director of the Program in Teaching at Williams, to find out how
they might participate in the program.
The Office of Career Counseling has a very active on-campus educational recruiting program that in-
cludes many private schools as well as Teach for America and similar programs. The program begins in
the fall and continues through the spring. Students interested in teaching at private elementary- or secon-
dary-level schools or participating in the Teach for America or similar programs directly after graduation
from Williams (certification is not required) should consult with the Office of Career Counseling.
Religious Study
There is no particular path through the Williams curriculum designed or recommended for students in-
tending to prepare for a career as a religious professional, enroll in a seminary or pursue theological educa-
tion. Most undergraduate liberal arts courses can be useful to the prospective minister, priest, rabbi, imam,
or teacher of religion. Ordination requirements vary widely depending on the particular religious commu-
nity or tradition; in some cases it may be possible to make progress on certain credentials in academic study
or field experience during the undergraduate years. A basic foundation in the study of religion is certainly
helpful--sacred texts, scriptural languages, history, philosophy, phenomenology and comparative studies,
etc. Students contemplating advanced academic work in religious studies in preparation for a career in
teaching or scholarship should give serious consideration to concentrated undergraduate study in the field.
Students with vocational interests that may include ordination or certification as a religious professional
are urged to make themselves known to one of the chaplains (or, where appropriate, one of the local clergy)
as soon as these interests begin to come into focus. Those interested in graduate academic programs in
religious studies should consult with the faculty advisor in that field.

GRADUATE PROGRAMS AT WILLIAMS
Master of Arts in Development Economics
The Center for Development Economics, which opened at Williams College in 1960, offers an intensive
one-year program in economic analysis and quantitative techniques leading to the degree of Master of Arts
in Development Economics. The program is specifically designed for economists from developing coun-
tries who have already embarked on professional careers in public agencies. The curriculum requires
courses in development economics, macroeconomics, public finance, and econometrics. CDE fellows
choose among other courses on related topics in lecture, seminar, and tutorial formats.
Fellows are normally nominated for the program by the public agencies from which they will be on
leave. A candidate must have a B.A. or B. Sc. degree of honors quality in economics, have two or more
years of relevant work experience, and have an effective command of spoken and written English. Wil-
liams undergraduates who satisfy course prerequisites, with the consent of the individual instructor, are
encouraged to take courses at the Center.
All communications relating to the degree of Master of Arts in Development Economics should be ad-
dressed to the CDE, Assistant Director, 1065 Main Street, Williams College, Williamstown, Massachusetts
01267, or e-mail cde@williams.edu.
Master of Arts in the History of Art
In cooperation with the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute, Williams College offers a two-year
course of study leading to the degree of Master of Arts in the History of Art. The objective of the program
is to offer to a small number of students a thorough professional preparation for careers in teaching and
museums, and to enable them to pursue further research whether independently or at other institutions of-
fering higher degrees. The curriculum consists of seminars in art historical subjects and an intensive study
of foreign languages in the context of the general literature of art. Problems of criticism, connoisseurship,
and conservation arising from the study of original works of art are fundamental to the program, and op-
portunities are provided for practical experience in museum work at the Clark Art Institute, the Williams
College Museum of Art, and the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art. The study of primary ma-
terials is further extended by field trips to other collections. The degree is normally awarded after two years
of resident graduate study. To earn the degree, students must take ten courses, of which at least six must be
graduate seminars (including ARTH 504). In connection with the preparation of a paper for the Graduate
Symposium, students will register for an eleventh course (ARTH 509), to be graded pass/fail, in their
fourth semester. A demonstration of proficiency in reading two foreign languages is required. Of these two,
German is required, and French is recommended. In January of the first year, students participate in a Eu-
ropean study trip with selected faculty; in January of the second year, students must complete a Qualifying
Paper. In addition to all course work, students must, at the end of the second year, present a shortened
version of the Qualifying Paper in a graduate symposium to be held on Commencement weekend. To enter
the program a successful applicant must have been awarded the degree of Bachelor of Arts or its equivalent
from an accredited institution. An undergraduate major in art is not required for acceptance to the program.
For further information, write: The Director, Graduate Program in the History of Art, Box 8, Williams-
town, Massachusetts 01267, telephone (413)458-9545, or email gradart@williams.edu.

COURSES OF INSTRUCTION 2005-2006
Please check online for the most up-to-date information (www.williams.edu/Registrar/catalog).
COURSE NUMBERING SYSTEM
Courses designated by a single number are semester courses.
Year courses are designated by an odd number and an even number joined by a hyphen; the work of the
two semesters constitutes an integral, indivisible course. Therefore, if a student does not pass the second
half of a year-long course, he or she forfeits credit for the first half and incurs a deficiency as a result of the
forfeiture. Students who register for a year course are required to do both semesters of that course within
the same academic year.
In some departments, course numbers have special meanings that are explained in their listings.
The (F) or (S) following a course's number indicates the semester, fall or spring, in which the course will
be offered.
THESE SYMBOLS ARE USED IN DEPARTMENTAL MASTHEADS TO INDICATE

AFRICAN-AMERICAN STUDIES (Div. II)
Chair, Professor JOY A. JAMES
Advisory Committee: Professors: E. D.BROWN, JAMES, D.L. SMITH. Associate Professor: MU-
TONGI. Assistant Professors: BEAN, CHAKKALAKAL, LONG.
African-American Studies is an interdisciplinary program that examines the history, the cultures, and the
social and political experiences of people of African ancestry in the Western Hemisphere. The program
draws on the vibrant and varied intellectual traditions that constitute the study of the African Diaspora.
All candidates for a concentration in African-American Studies must complete a total of five courses:
two required program courses (AAS 200 and AAS 400T) and three additional courses in two or more
departments and/or programs other than African-American Studies (see eligible electives listed below).
To maximize the benefits of the program, students are urged to consult with the program chair in order
to plan a course sequence that builds on a common theme or approach to the field. A coherent plan of study
might, for example, comprise courses that focus on a specific geographical area (e.g., the U. S., Africa, or
the Caribbean). Another approach would be to bring together courses from the Arts and Literature, or from
the Social Sciences, that integrate a specific methodology within African-American Studies. Alternatively,
a cluster of courses might be designed to explore various theoretical approaches to the subject of race.
Courses offered by the program:

HONORS PROGRAM IN AFRICAN-AMERICAN STUDIES
A candidate for honors in African-American Studies must maintain at least a B+ average in the con-
centration and be admitted to candidacy by the program faculty. In addition to the five courses normally
required for the concentration, an honors candidate will enroll in either AAS 491 or 492 plus a Winter
Study in his or her senior year, in order to complete a substantial written thesis or an equivalent project in
the performing or studio arts. A student wishing to become a candidate for honors in African-American
Studies should secure a faculty sponsor and inform the program chair in writing before spring registration
of her/his junior year.
An honors project should demonstrate creativity, depth, and intellectual rigor. A candidate for honors is
encouraged to pursue non-traditional projects, such as presentations in the performing arts, visual arts, or
creative writing, as well as more conventional research projects. The advisor will evaluate the honors proj-
ect, and the program faculty will then decide whether to confer honors.
AAS 200(S) The Study of Race and Social Structure: Race, Culture and Incarceration (Same
as Political Science 200)*
This introductory seminar for spring 2006 examines race, culture and incarceration. The United States has
the greatest incarceration and execution rates in the industrialized world--estimated at about 2 million,
with over 3000 on death row. Poor people and people of color comprise the majority of those imprisoned
due to the war on drugs and racial and economic bias in policing and sentencing. This course examines
intersections of democracy and captivity in penal societies. Students study literature and screen documen-
taries on: the 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution which abolished slavery while legalizing it for
prisoners; the 14th Amendment (originally designed to protect the emancipated but largely enforced to
protect corporations as "persons"); the convict prison lease system; contemporary critiques of prison sys-
tems; and penal narratives. (See: http://www.williams.edu/african-american-studies/democracy.htm).
Requirements: three 5-page critiques of readings; group presentation; final project.
No prerequisites. Enrollment is limited. Permission of instructor required.

This tutorial, which will serve as the AAS capstone seminar for the 2005-2006 academic year, will focus
on race, gender and violence in 20th-century American political culture. Study begins with the anti-lynch-
ing and anti-sexual violence campaigns at the turn of the 20th century, and explores cases throughout the
20th century that sparked political movements. We conclude with a review of constructions of cultural
memory through academe, media, and visual culture concerning contemporary controversial trials. As-

signed materials include film and documentaries, memoirs, academic texts, and readings by Ida B. Wells,
Mamie Till-Mobley, David Marriott. This tutorial is designed for juniors and seniors. It emphasizes analyt-
ical skills. Alternating weekly, each student delivers a 5-page essay on assigned readings or screenings,
while his or her partner responds with a 1- to 2-page written critique. Each student writes and presents five
essays and five response critiques.
Grades are determined as follows: 60% essays and response papers; 40% final paper (synthesis of essays to
explore one theme). An opening meeting for all students occurs at the start of the term, and a closing col-
lective session at the end of the semester.
Permission of the instructor is required for enrollment. AAS 400 is open to non-concentrators.
Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10).

Several courses in African-American Studies count for credit in the American Studies major. There-
fore, students in American Studies can easily complete requirements for an African-American Studies
concentration by electing one course in an African subject and by taking African-American Studies 491.
Another three courses must be chosen which satisfy both American Studies and African-American
Studies requirements.
AMERICAN STUDIES (Div. II)
Chair, Professor: SCOTT WONG
Faculty 2005-2006: Professors: KUNZEL*, M. REINHARDT. Associate Professor: KENT***. As-
sistant Professors: AUBERT, BEAN, L. JOHNSON, RÚA. Senior Lecturer: CLEGHORN.
GENERAL PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The American Studies Program uses interdisciplinary approaches to develop students' understanding of
the complexity of the culture(s) usually labeled "American." Examining history, literature, visual media,
performance, and other forms of expression, we explore the processes of cultural definition as contested by
diverse individuals and groups. We ask new questions about aspects of American life long taken for
granted; we also use American culture as a laboratory for testing classic and contemporary theories about
how cultures work.
NON-MAJORS, FIRST-YEAR STUDENTS, AND SOPHOMORES
American Studies 201 is open to non-majors including first-year students with Advanced Placement
credit in American History. All elective courses are open to students who meet the requirements of the
departments that sponsor those courses. Courses designated as junior or senior seminars are open to non-
majors with permission of the instructor.
RATIONALE FOR COURSE NUMBERING
The introductory course is offered at the 200 level to suggest the desirability of some preliminary train-
ing in college-level history, literature, sociology, or political science. The intermediate courses, designated
as Junior Seminars at the 300 level, are offered primarily for juniors, although they are open to sophomores
who have had 201 and will be away from campus during the spring of their junior year. 400 level courses
designated as Senior Seminars are designed for senior majors.
THE MAJOR
Required major courses:
American Studies 201
300 level courses designated Junior Seminar
400 level courses designated Senior Seminar
Elective courses:
Eight courses: five should be chosen from one of the specialization fields listed below, the other three
chosen from among any of the electives listed. Students are expected to take courses from at least two
disciplines when choosing the courses that make up their specializations. Students are also required
to take at least one course from a list of pre-1900 courses.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN AMERICAN STUDIES
Candidates for honors in American Studies will undertake a substantial, year-long independent project
during their Senior year. Applicants should have a consistent record of high achievement in courses taken
American Studies
­ 49 ­
for the major, and normally will have done work in the field of study of their proposed thesis. Students who
wish to write or produce an honors project should consult with a prospective faculty advisor in their junior
year. Formal application to pursue honors should be made by the time of spring registration in the junior
year. Students must submit a 1- to 2-page preliminary proposal describing the proposed project to the Chair
of the American Studies Program at this time. Final admission to the honors thesis program will depend on
the AMST advisory committee's assessment of the qualifications of the student and the merits and feasibil-
ity of the project. If the proposal is approved, they will be permitted to register for AMST 491, W30, and
AMST 492 the following year. The completed project is due in mid-April. Each student will present a short
oral presentation of his or her thesis at the end of spring semester.
ADVISING
All majors will be assigned a faculty advisor. Majors must meet with their advisor during the first week
of classes during the fall semester and at the time of the spring semester registration period in order to have
their courses and plans for the American Studies major approved. Both majors and non-majors are encour-
aged to talk at any time with the program chair or other affiliated faculty about the major.
AMERICAN STUDIES AND OTHER PROGRAMS
Students majoring in American Studies are encouraged to consider pursuing concentrations in African-
American, Environmental, and Women's and Gender Studies. Many of the courses counted for those con-
centrations may also earn credit toward the American Studies major.
STUDY AWAY FROM WILLIAMS
We encourage students to pursue cross-cultural comparative studies. A major in American Studies can
be combined with study away from Williams for a semester or a year if plans are made carefully. Many
courses that will be approved for College credit may also count toward the American Studies major if their
subject matter is American culture.
Students planning to be away in the junior year should have taken American Studies 201 before they
leave; those away for junior-year spring term should take American Studies 302 in their sophomore year.
Students should consult as early as possible with the chair or their advisor about their plans for fulfilling the
requirements of the major.
AMST 201(F,S) Introduction to American Studies
To be an "American" means something more than U.S. citizenship. In this course, we focus on the prob-
lems and possibilities of American identity. Access to Americanness is shaped by factors such as class,
race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, religion, and region--categories which themselves change in meaning
over time. Given the geographical, racial, and cultural diversity of the United States, the ways in which
Americans imagine nation inevitably vary over time, according to place, and among different individuals
and groups. Rather than a survey of any one aspect or period of American history, literature, or popular
culture, this course is an introduction to the interdisciplinary field of American Studies, a field defined both
by the range of texts we read (essays, novels, autobiographies, photographs, films, music, architecture,
historical documents, legal texts), and by the questions we ask of them: How have different Americans
imagined what it means to be an American? What ideas about national history, patriotism, and moral char-
acter shape their visions of Americanness? How do the educational system, mass media, government poli-
cies regarding citizenship and immigration shape American identities? How are boundaries of inclusion
and exclusion in the nation drawn? What uses have been made of the claim to an American identity, and
what is at stake in that claim? How have Americans imagined a national landscape, a national culture, and
to what ends?
Format: discussion. Evaluation will be based on a series of short critical essays and a group project.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 25 per section (expected: 25 per section). Preference given to sopho-
mores and first-year students with AP 5 in U.S. History. One section in the fall; one section in the spring.

AMST 302(S) Whiteness (Same as Women's and Gender Studies 302) (Junior Seminar)*
"Whiteness" is a course geared toward exploring the historical and performative fictive constructions of
"whiteness." We will begin by identifying aspects of "whiteness" supposedly unique to "white people,"
which have been often used to claim superiority and to establish a "white" standard. The course will be
organized around three units. As an introduction, Unit One will focus on examples of institutionalization of
white supremacy through legal and social regulations from the seventeenth century to present day (North-
ern Europe as "white"; Southern Europe as "dark"; the exclusion of non-white people from citizenship,
wealth, and power). Unit Two will concentrate on American literary and dramatic examples of texts sup-
portive and critical of "whiteness" as a desirable trait (Metamora: Last of the Wampanoags!, 1829; works
by Octavia Butler, Danzy Senna). Unit Three will look to contemporary popular culture and the perform-
ances of "whiteness," particularly film and television (Mi Vida Loca, Nurse Betty, Kill Bill, American Fam-
ily).

One way to write the cultural history of music is to trace the authority with which different people can say
"`You are hurting my ears' at any given historical moment." So writes Carlo Rotella, one of the historians
whose work we will read in this course as we approach American popular music as an object of cultural
studies. We will study particular performers and styles (e.g. Elvis, Selena, punk and hip hop), but we do so

in the context of the histories of labor; social migration; political and economic shifts; ideologies; and of the
culture industry. Moving from the late-nineteenth-century to the present, and through agrarian to industrial
to postindustrial social configurations, we will study music as a means of expressing resistance and accom-
modation and as the basis of community-formation and disruption. We will pay special attention to the
recent recovery by American musicians of folk musics originating outside of American borders: Celtic,
African and Cuban in the context of global capitalism and American hegemony. Texts include works of
history, cultural criticism and ethnomusicology; audio performance recorded in the field, in the studio, and
in concert; and documentary and fiction films. Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on a number of

below and record this choice when registering for the major. (This commitment can be revised, in consulta-
tion with the chair.) At least five electives will be taken from among those designated to support a special-
ization field. In extraordinary cases, students who wish to do so may be permitted to design their own spe-
cialization field. Fulfillment of concentrations in African-American Studies, Environmental Studies, and
Women's and Gender Studies may be used as the basis for individually designed specialization fields. All
such arrangements must be approved by the American Studies Committee.

ANTHROPOLOGY AND SOCIOLOGY (Div. II)
Chair, Professor MICHAEL F. BROWN
Professors: M. F. BROWN, D. EDWARDS, JACKALL*, JUST. Associate Professors: FOIAS*, NO-
LAN*. Assistant Professors: SHEVCHENKO, VALIANI. Visiting Assistant Professor: STANC-
ZAK. Bolin Fellow: CASTOR.
The Department of Anthropology and Sociology at Williams aims to help students achieve an inte-
grated understanding of biography, history, culture, and social structure in both traditional and modern so-
cieties.
Anthropology explores the full range of human experience by introducing students to the study of tribal
and peasant societies, especially those on the periphery of the West, as well as to the cultural complexities
of stratified, industrial societies such as our own. Integrated with the study of specific peoples is an ex-
amination of the various analytical schemes anthropologists have developed to understand them. Courses
offered in the department represent two of Anthropology's major subfields: sociocultural anthropology--
that is, the comparative study of human social life, institutions, and beliefs--and archaeology, the study of
the origins and lifeways of prehistoric peoples.
Sociology studies the social and institutional intricacies of modern industrial societies and the social
psychological dilemmas facing the individual in our epoch. Sociology courses introduce students to classi-
cal and contemporary social thought about men and women and society, to the systematic analysis of so-
cial institutions and social interaction, and to the social analysis of modern culture. The Sociology major at
Williams emphasizes the humanistic tradition of sociology, stressing qualitative approaches to understand-
ing how social reality is constructed.
MAJORS
The department offers separate majors in both Anthropology and Sociology, with a broad and diverse
array of courses in both disciplines. The department is committed, however, to the unity of the social
sciences. To this end, Anthropology and Sociology offer joint core courses in methodology and theory, as
well as several elective courses in common. All joint courses are designated "ANSO."
Requirements
For the degree in Anthropology or Sociology, students must complete a minimum of nine courses as
outlined below:
(1) Core Courses. Majors in both disciplines must take a sequence of four core courses. Three of these
are joint (ANSO) courses. The sequences are:
Anthropology Joint (ANSO) Sociology
ANTH 101 The Scope SOC 101 Invitation to
of Anthropology Sociology
ANSO 205
Ways of Knowing
ANSO 305
Social Theory
ANSO 402
Senior Seminar
(2) Elective Courses. Majors in Anthropology or Sociology must take five elective courses from the
course listings of their respective disciplines or from the joint ANSO listings. Two of the courses
chosen are normally at the 300 level or above. In close consultation with their departmental advisors,
students may take some selected courses from other disciplines to fulfill major requirements in either
Anthropology or Sociology.
(3) Majors in each wing of the department are allowed to count up to two courses in the other wing to-
wards fulfillment of their major requirements.
Anthropology and Sociology
­ 55 ­
STATISTICS AND DATA ANALYSIS
In addition to the nine total courses required for the major, it is recommended that Anthropology and
Sociology majors take Statistics 101 or a comparable course in statistics and data analysis.
AREA STUDIES CONCENTRATION
Students who wish to combine a major in Anthropology or Sociology with an Area Studies concentra-
tion are encouraged to do so. Courses taken to satisfy an Area Studies requirement may be counted toward
the major with prior approval of a student's departmental advisor. The only exception to this rule is the
Area Studies senior seminar, which cannot ordinarily be counted toward the Anthropology or Sociology
degree.
LANGUAGE STUDY, STUDY ABROAD, AND WINTER STUDY
Departmental advisors will help interested students integrate a major with study abroad, foreign lan-
guage study, or field research during the winter study period. The department encourages Williams stu-
dents to take advantage of established foreign study programs in Egypt, Japan, India, Hong Kong, and
other countries. Because some foreign study programs do not offer courses that can be counted toward the
Anthropology or Sociology degrees, however, sophomores planning to study abroad in junior year must
consult with the departmental advisor before declaring a major.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN ANTHROPOLOGY OR SOCIOLOGY
Honors and highest honors are normally awarded for the completion of a year-long research project that
has resulted in an original thesis of high quality. Students wishing to write an honors thesis should engage a
member of the department faculty as a Thesis Advisor as soon as possible and must submit a proposal for
the thesis for department approval no later than preregistration in the spring of the junior year. If the pro-
posal is approved, they will be permitted to register for Anthropology and Sociology 493-W31-494, during
which they will write and defend a thesis. If their overall work in the major continues to be of high quality
and the thesis is deemed of a similar quality, they may be awarded honors or highest honors in Anthropolo-
gy or Sociology.
ANTHROPOLOGY / SOCIOLOGY COURSES
JOINT CORE COURSES
ANSO 205(S) Ways of Knowing
An exploration of how one makes sense of the social world. Some of the key questions of the course are:
What are the philosophical and epistemological underpinnings of social inquiry? How does one frame in-
tellectual problems and go about collecting, sifting, and assessing field materials? What are the uses and
limits of statistical data? What is the importance of history to sociological and anthropological research?
How can one use archival and other documentary materials to enrich ethnographic research? What are the
empirical limits to interpretation? What is the relationship between empirical data and the generation of
social theory? How does the social organization of social research affect one's inquiry? What are the typi-
cal ethical dilemmas of fieldwork and of other kinds of social research? How do researchers' personal
biographies and values shape their work? We will approach these problems concretely rather than abstract-
ly through a series of case studies of how men and women in the world of affairs, ranging from detectives,
epidemiologists, and corporate lawyers, make sense of their worlds in order to act responsibly. We will also
draw upon the field experiences of departmental faculty in settings as diverse as the jungles of Guatemala,
the mountains of Sumbawa, Afghan refugee camps, Russian kitchens, big city police departments and dis-
trict attorney offices, corporate offices on Wall Street, and criminal drug courts across America and the
United Kingdom. There will also be some practical training in basic field methods, census and survey in-
terpretation, and archival research.
Requirements: a series of short papers and a final exam.
Prerequisites: Anthropology 101 or Sociology 101 or permission of instructor. Expected enrollment: 15.
Hour: 1:10-3:50 W SHEVCHENKO
ANSO 305(F) Social Theory
An introduction to social theory in anthropology and sociology, with strong emphasis on enduring works
by major thinkers--Marx, Weber, Durkheim, and Freud, among others--who have shaped views of soci-
ety in the West and beyond. Several key questions inform exploration of these works: What are the histori-
cal roots and principal attributes of modernity? From the perspective of modernity, how do social theorists
understand "the primitive"? Do society and culture have organizing rules? What role does human agency
play in the unfolding of social life? What are the possibilities and limits of scientific approaches to the study
of human social experience? In considering such questions, we will reconstruct the intellectual and social
histories of both disciplines, examining in particular how they abandoned common ground and language,
with sociologists gravitating toward paradigms of scientific predictability and anthropologists toward rela-
tivistic frameworks of interpretation. Finally, we will examine the migration of ideas from anthropology
and sociology to other disciplines and back again. The course emphasizes major differences between inter-
pretive frameworks as well as common elements that contribute to a deeper understanding of the social
world.
Format: seminar. Requirements: three 5- to 7-page essays.

This capstone seminar combines intensive discussion and individual research. The first half of the semester
will be dedicated to the discussion of a social issue central to the concerns of both anthropology and sociol-
ogy. The class will meet with the instructor in spring 2005 to decide on that topic. Then, in the second half
of the semester, students will pursue independent, original projects and produce a major term paper. To-
ward the end of the semester, students will present their projects to the seminar. Students who are not senior
majors in anthropology or sociology are admitted to this course only on the instructor's permission.
Format: seminar. Requirements: full participation, major research project and paper, class presentation.

ANTHROPOLOGY COURSES
ANTH 101(F,S) The Scope of Anthropology*
Is there such a thing as "human nature"? Why have human societies developed such a bewildering range
of customs to deal with problems common to people everywhere? This course addresses these questions
by introducing students to the comparative study of human social life and culture. Topics surveyed in the
course include economics, language and thought, kinship and marriage, law and politics, and the wide
variations in human belief systems, including religions. The course also considers the ways that anthropol-
ogy, a discipline that was until recently practiced almost exclusively by Westerners, approaches other soci-
eties in search of insights on our own customs and values. Ethnographic descriptions of both "simple"
tribal societies and complex modern ones are a prominent part of the readings.
Format: lecture/discussion of case studies and ethnographic films. Requirements: two short essays, a final
examination and class participation.
Enrollment limit: 30 (expected: 30). Preference given to first-year students and sophomores.

This course examines the potential of moving images to reveal aspects of culture normally obscured by the
written word. We will consider both the theory and practice of documentary film from its inception around
1900 to the present, paying particular attention to the way documentary filmmakers have approached the
representation of social reality in Western and non-Western cultural settings. Questions that we will consid-
er include: What is the relationship between written text and image, or between image and story? What is
the role of film in anthropology? What counts as a document?
Team-taught, through a mixture of lectures and discussions. Course requirement: Regular attendance at
film screenings and active class participation. Students will write a 5-page paper on an assigned topic and a

ANTH 233(S) Spiritual Crossroads: Religious Life in Southeast Asia (Same as Asian
Studies 233 and Religion 249)*
No region of the world presents a richer tapestry of religious beliefs, practices, and institutions than South-
east Asia. Buddhism, Hinduism, Christianity and Islam are all to be found and all of them interpenetrate
and contend with each other and with a deep undergirding of animism, shamanism, and mystical folk be-
lief systems. This course will survey these religious traditions through time and space, looking in particular
at the growing tension between religion and the state as fundamentalism and religious militancy have
spread into the region in recent times. All of Southeast Asia will be covered, but particular attention will be
devoted to Indonesia, where religious blending and the growth of new fundamentalism are both especially
marked.

ANTH 235(F) Cultural Politics in the Caribbean (Same as African-American Studies 235)*
Often only recognized as the home of reggae, the countries of the Caribbean have numerous rich and di-
verse cultures. This course will move beyond regional stereotypes to examine the role of cultural perfor-
mance--festivals, rituals, music and dance--in linking everyday practices of Caribbean people to larger
social forces: politics, citizenship and the economy. How do these postcolonial states mobilize culture in
building nations, constructing identities, and staking positions in the global economy? In the face of com-
modification, globalization, and competing interests, how do cultural practices express and reflect the lives
of people? Do cultural performances offer a critique of social and economic relations? In answering these
questions we will consider theories of culture, especially in reference to the African Diaspora and the Ca-
ribbean. We will explore the dynamics of classic anthropological theories of Caribbean society and culture
(e.g., respectability/reputation and stratification/plurality) by looking at popular and public cultural forms,
including Trinidad Carnival, Cuban Santería, and Jamaican Dancehall. Course materials will be drawn
from articles, ethnographies, DVDs and audio CDs.
Format: seminar. Requirements: active class participation, midterm, and final paper.

storytelling and ritual in the grieving process. Beginning with a consideration of the anthropological litera-
ture on conflict and conflict resolution in small-scale societies, we will move onto an investigation of a
number of contemporary crises and conflicts and their aftermaths. Among the topics we will read about
and discuss are cultural factors that enhance or minimize trauma; how traumatic events are remembered
and/or suppressed; the cultural foundations of mourning; the role of legal proceedings in the resolution of
conflict, especially the advent of truth and reconciliation tribunals in South Africa and other countries and
the applicability of these institutions in cultures without redemptive religious traditions; spatial aspects of
grieving and reconciliation, including the use of memorials and the transformations of battlefields into sites
of commemoration; how men and women cope with trauma and the role of storytelling and ritual for each;
the social psychology of post-traumatic stress disorder and the cultural factors that enhance or diminish this
syndrome; and the perpetuation of trauma on subsequent generations. Format: tutorial.
No prerequisites, although prior exposure to anthropology, sociology, political science, or philosophy wel-
comed. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Priority given to sophomores.

ANTH 328T(F) Emotions and the Self (W)*
Everyone everywhere experiences emotions, and everyone everywhere is faced with the task of conceptu-
alizing a self-hood and its place in the social world. This course analyzes a variety of recent attempts in the
social sciences to come to grips with topics that have long been avoided: the nature of the interior experi-
ence and an epistemological framework for its cross-cultural comparison. Exploring the borderlands be-
tween anthropology, sociology, and psychology, we will bring the tools of ethnographic analysis to bear on
central pan-human concepts: emotions and the self. By examining these phenomena as they occur in other
cultures, we will be better placed to apprehend and challenge the implicit (and often unconsciously held)
Anthropology and Sociology

assumptions about emotions and the self in our own culture, both in daily life and in academic psychologi-
cal theory. What are emotions? Are they things--neuro-physiological states--or ideas--sociocultural
constructions? How are they to be described; compared? What is the self? How are selves constructed and
constituted? How do various cultures respond to categories of emotion and self, and how can we develop a
sense of the relationship between self and emotion?

ANTH 364(F) Ritual, Politics, and Power (W)*
Power is distributed unequally in society, and one of the main avenues by which this distribution comes
about and is maintained is through ritual. History tells us that power is nothing until it is ritualized, for it is
only through ritual means that power can be concentrated, maintained, and transmitted. At the same time,
the converse is also true. For those contesting the way power is distributed in society, ritual provides a
necessary weapon for mobilizing support and undermining the legitimacy of those in charge. This course
looks at the relationship between ritual, politics and power from a variety of disciplinary perspectives and
in a number of different socio-cultural contexts. Beginning with the ethological and psychological study of
ritual, we will consider some of the ways in which anthropologists and sociologists in particular have
examined ritual's role in society, as well as the elementary forms of political ritual, such as rites of passage,
sacrifice, and kingship. We will investigate the extent to which rituals are similar in `traditional' and
`modern' contexts. We will also examine the role ritual plays in political resistance and the question of
whether and in what circumstances rituals are subversive or constitutive of the dominant structures of
authority.
Format: seminar. Requirements: one 5-page paper, a 20-page research paper and a take-home final. Prereq-

SOC 101(F,S) Invitation to Sociology
An introduction to sociological analysis. The course focuses on the relationship of individual men and
women to the social world and introduces students to systematic institutional analysis. Students will ex-
plore the intersection of biography, history, culture, and social structure as seen in the work of classical and
contemporary social thinkers, including Marx, Durkheim, Weber, Veblen, Simmel, and Goffman. Special
consideration will be given to the social and cultural problems of capitalism, rationality and irrationality in
modern institutions and organizations, the psychological dilemmas facing the individual in modern society,
and the problem of social order and conflict.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: a take-home midterm exam, a class presentation and a final.

SOC 208(F) Religion in Society (Same as Religion 277)
Early social theorists offered a variety of perspectives on the role of religion in modern social life. Analyses
ranged from an emphasis on religion's positive function in providing society with a source of cohesive
meaning and unity to more critical perspectives, which portrayed religion as an illusory source of legitima-
cy for the existing social order. Building on this legacy, more recent sociological assessments recognize
both the function religion serves in sustaining social arrangements as well as its more mobilizing role in
Anthropology and Sociology

fostering radical social upheaval. This course will focus on the second part of this continuum, that is,
religion's dynamic role in inspiring social mobilization and social change. It begins with an analysis of the
relationship between society and religion found in classic works on the Protestant Ethic and the growth of
American capitalism, and moves to more recent empirical analyses of changes among immigrant religious
communities in the United States. More active religious dynamism, while evident in American examples
such as domestic missionary movements and contemporary Christian Patriots, has developed worldwide.
Comparative cases of "radical religion" across the globe from Liberation theology in Central America to
the role of Islamic networks in the Iranian revolution require a new understanding of the assumed pro-
cesses of secularization. The course ends with a consideration of religion and violence as modes of destruc-
tive social change.

SOC 235(S) Racial Boundaries, Ethnic Identities*
Racial and ethnic labels are recognizable social shorthands that reveal significant differences across time
and space. This course considers the social, political, economic, and historical influences upon the ways in
which these boundaries and identities are constructed, contested, and reproduced over time. Labor mar-
kets, immigration, economic mobility, religion, and political ideologies are just some of the contributing
factors to the social construction of race and ethnicity. We will analyze a variety of racial and ethnic desig-
nations including whiteness as an often unacknowledged but equally constructed category. While focusing
predominantly on the United States, we will also consider global patterns that reconfigure these definitions
across borders.

SOC 245(F) Image and Representation
This course takes an historical view of photography and social thought by mapping various projects and
their critiques over the past century and a half. These include the photographic reflections of missionary
social hierarchies and Western morality in late nineteenth century global expansion; the photographic util-
ity in public policy, propaganda and social awareness from image muckrackers such as Jacob Riis and
Lewis Hine to the Farm Security Administration; and the representation of the "other" through the photo-
journalism of National Geographic. Beyond ideological influences and cultural bias in image composition
the course examines the ongoing technological developments that affect image manipulation and our pre-
sumption of authentic representation. Finally, social documentation and analysis within sociology is pri-
marily text-based. However, research utilizing photography and video is making significant contributions
to our empirical and theoretical understanding of the social world. Using an historical lens of the role and
use of photography for social representation, the course will critically survey a wide sample of contempo-
rary image-based social scientific research projects.

SOC 268(S) Space and Place
The perception of physical space is produced culturally and historically. Moreover, such understandings
and meanings of space are governed by cultural symbols, personal desires and identities, and institutional-
ized forms of power. This course will consider the process by which spaces (especially urban ones) are
produced and examine how "the production of space" has been connected to the following themes: knowl-
edge, power, and states; technology and the city; urban survival and resistance; architecture and urban de-
sign; capitalist production and the city; gender and space; maps, nationalism, and cartographic representa-
tions; and "globalizing" cities. Course participants will also view and critique representations of the city
appearing in film.

SOC 313(S) Food, Taste, and the Sociology of Production
A classic gastronomical challenge taunts, "Tell me what you eat and I'll tell you who you are." This implies
that food is an indicative medium of local, ethnic, religious, and perhaps most tellingly, class cultures. This
course reexamines these issues and extends the stated challenge to various social arenas such as immigra-
tion, globalization, mass production, and niche marketing. If, in common parlance, we are what we eat,
then what might we learn about a society in which a fish caught in Japan is served the same evening in
New York? What might we learn about the migration and transformation of food culture by ordering Thai
delivery in Massachusetts? Beyond the global patterns of taste, availability, and modes of consumption, we
must additionally ask questions about production. For example, telling us who we are if we eat fast food
hamburgers includes a full account of cattle ranching, feedlots, corporate meatpacking conglomerates, san-
itation, and mass marketing of brands. Finally, the course explores the gendered patterns that food produc-
tion and consumption transmit and reproduce.

SOC 315(F) Culture, Consumption, and Modernity
How do lifestyles, fashions and trends appear and evolve? Are we authors of our own taste? What struc-
tures our choices of goods and activities? What is it that gives meaning to objects and makes them desir-
able? Are there non-consumer societies in the modern world? How has globalization changed the ways
people consume in different parts of the globe? This course will explore the consumption and consumer
practices as products of modernity and will analyze the political, cultural and social agendas that have
transformed consumption over time. Politics of consumption (the way in which seemingly free and inde-
pendent consumption choices aggregate into the existing system of global capitalism) will be treated
alongside its symbolic element: the role of consumer practices in creating and articulating identities, build-
ing relationships and creating solidarities. It will look at money, fashion, advertising, arts, tourism, and
shopping in places as varied as nineteenth-century France, socialist Russia, postsocialist Hungary and in
contemporary United States, tracing both the mechanisms that structure patterns of consumption, and the
implications that these patterns have for the larger social order.

SOC 324(F) Memory and Identity
Our sense of self is inextricably tied to our understanding of our past, both as individuals and as members
of society. This sense of origins, however, is far from natural; it itself has its origins in the debates and
politics of the time, and evolves under an array of influences. This course analyzes discourses of collective
and individual identity and the mechanism involved in the formulation of the individual's sense of his or
her place in the world. Topics include: nations and nationalism, representations of individual and collective
pasts, collective memory and practices of remembrance, nostalgia and selective forgetting, narratives of
childhood and a "golden age," the invention of tradition, museums and memorials, biography and mem-
oirs, narratives of progression, and the making of national and family histories.

research project.

SOC 327(F) Violence, "Militancy," and Collective Recovery*
Is anyone capable of an act of violence? Does social experience condition people to be militant? How is
violence collectively experienced, remembered, or forgotten? This course will consider violence as con-
cept and event, from various vantage points and with geographical-historical references that include Asia,
Africa, Europe, and the Americas. Topics to be considered include the idea of organized violence and the
role of states; violence, collective memory, and public apologies; militias and cultural identity; mass media
and violence; suffering and gender. Readings draw from approaches to the study of violence that are
theoretical, analytical, comparative, ethnographic, and fictional. Authors to be considered include Wac-
quant, Mamdani, Said, Tilly, Stern, Venkatesh, Wagner-Pacifici, Foucault, DBC Pierre, and Malkki,
among other authors.
Participants will view visual representations of violence and examine the ways in which violence is used to
construct collective pasts.

SOC 332(S) Communism and Its Aftermath
Caught as we are in the fault lines separating the First World from the Third, it is easy to lose sight of the
fate of the Second. This course will explore the final decades of the Soviet period as well as the impact that
the collapse of state socialism has had on the inhabitants of the former Soviet bloc and on the political
Anthropology and Sociology, Arabic
­ 61 ­
imagination of the world at large. The class will draw on a variety of research perspectives and media in
order to grasp the peculiarities of late Soviet-style socialism and of the challenges and dilemmas that ac-
company the post-socialist project of simultaneously transforming the economic, political and cultural
realms of society. Topics include: socialist utopia in theory and practice, competing explanations for the
regime's collapse, formation of new elites and class cultures, gender and property in transition, civil society
and everyday political talk, historical politics and collective identities in the changing times.

SOC 345(S) Producing the Past (W)*
In response to the apparent rise in individual and collective celebrations of "traditional community" over
the past two decades, this course will examine how the past is mobilized in order to animate collective
identities, address contemporary grievances, and produce events in the present. We will consider the emer-
gence of modern forms of historical consciousness and writing and interrogate the modalities by which
they are produced. Participants will read critical works focused on a range of cultural settings, all of which
consider the production of the past in connection with the following topics: "community," nation, and
religion; collective memory; disciplinary knowledge and power; "tradition," race, and gender; genocide
and democracy; and constructing objects of inquiry.

This is a year-long course in which students will learn to read, write and converse in Arabic while becom-
ing familiar with the basic grammar of Modern Standard Arabic. Students will also be exposed to the
Egyptian variety of colloquial Arabic. This is a communicative-oriented course which revolves around the
daily practice of vocabulary, conversation and different grammatical structures in class. You will be ex-
pected to speak Modern Standard Arabic in class from an early stage. Students will also be expected to take
advantage of the technological resources available for the study of Arabic on the internet, as well as the
technological aids available as part of our textbooks for this course, Alif Baa and Al-Kitaab fii Ta'allum
al-'Arabiyya from Georgetown University Press.
Format: lectures, five hours a week. Evaluation is based on tests, daily homework, and active class partici-
pation.

Three routes are offered: the emphasis of the first is on the history of art, and that of the second is on
creative work in studio. The third route through the major allows students to take courses in both halves of
the department in more or less equal numbers.
Note: The Art History and Art Studio routes are strongly recommended for any prospective Art major
who is contemplating graduate study in Art History or Art Studio.

Any four additional Art Studio or Art History courses. At least one elective must be taken in each
wing of the department. At least one of the electives must be an Art History course concerned
with a period of Western or non-Western art prior to 1800.
Art History Route: The history of art is different from other historical disciplines in that it is founded on
direct visual confrontation with objects that are both concretely present and yet documents of the past. We
emphasize analysis of images, objects, and built environments as the basis for critical thought and visual
literacy. In addition to formal and iconographic analysis, we use the work of other disciplines to understand
visual images, such as social history, perceptual psychology, engineering, psychoanalysis, cultural studies,
and archaeology. Because of its concentration on visual experience, the Art History major increases one's
ability to observe and to use those observations as analytical tools for understanding history and culture.
ArtH 101-102 introduces students to a series of critical studies of important works selected from the
history of Western art from antiquity to the present. The critical approach of the introductory course is
Art
­ 63 ­
maintained in all further courses, especially by assigned study of original works in the Williams College
Museum of Art, Chapin Library, the Clark Art Institute, and Mass MoCA.
An introductory studio course, ArtS 100, in which no artistic talent or prior experience are assumed,
provides vital training in what is a visual as well as a verbal discipline. The requirement of a course in
non-Western art expands majors' geographic as well as cultural horizons, and the requirement of two
courses in art from periods prior to 1800 provides a necessary concentration on earlier moments in culture.
(As the late contemporary architect, Philip Johnson, said, "You cannot not know history.") The junior
course (ArtH 301) develops awareness of the theoretical implications, as well as the possibilities and limi-
tations of different art-historical methods. The requirement of a seminar or graduate course in the senior
year enables students to apply that knowledge of methodology to their most specialized work in the Art
History route.
Art Studio Route: The studio division of the Art major has been structured to foster the development of a
critical understanding of making art; to support creative interests and to develop students' perceptions and
imaginations as they investigate a variety of visual media. Drawing I, ArtS 100 serves as an introduc-
tion to the basic drawing and design principles which establish the foundation for the development of
visual expression. ArtH 101-102, an introduction to the history of Western art, provides part of the neces-
sary background in the critical analysis of art. The 200-level ArtS courses provide opportunities to learn the
elements of some of the principal visual arts media: architecture, painting, photography, printmaking,
sculpture, and video. These courses combine technical foundations in the medium with analysis of the
interrelation of visual form and content. The 300- and 400-level courses place a greater emphasis on the
application of appropriate visual skills and strategies to particular thematic concerns, and to the develop-
ment of the student's individual vision. All studio art seniors exhibit their work in the Williams College
Museum of Art as a part of the requirements for the major.
History and Practice Route: This route allows students to study in depth both the history of art and the
making of it. It offers considerable flexibility: students may propose courses of study that emphasize partic-
ular media, themes or methodological issues. To mention just three examples, students may design se-
quences of courses that focus on architecture, gender or narration in both the history of art and contempo-
rary practice. Students may take more courses in one wing of the department than the other, as long as the
minimum requirements in each wing are satisfied. The History and Practice route is especially well-suited
to students interested in arts-related careers outside of higher education, including work in art galleries, art
museums, and primary or secondary school education.
Unlike the history or studio routes, acceptance into the History and Practice route is not automatic. The
student must first submit a written application in two copies, one for each advisor from the two wings of the
department, as well as a list of proposed courses; this application must be approved by the art department.
The application must provide a narrative statement of the theme of the major, and why it cannot be accom-
modated in either history or studio. It is not enough to submit a list of courses; the student needs to show the
coherence and integrity of the plan of study, and how it develops the theme of the proposed major.
Some students will be attracted to both wings of the department but will not have a field of study that falls
between the two. In these cases, it is better for the student to choose between history and studio--taking
additional courses from the other wing as desired. In short, the History and Practice route is reserved for
students with a strong record of achievement who cannot be accommodated in the two wings of the depart-
ment.
History and Practice majors do not participate in the senior studio exhibition at the end of the year.
History and Practice Faculty Advisors: Michael Glier, Ann McCallum, and Ben Benedict in studio; E.
J. Johnson, Peter Low and Michael Lewis in history.
COURSE NUMBERS
First Digit
The introductory courses in both Art History and Studio have 100-level numbers and are prerequisites
for most other courses in the department. The distinction between 200- and 300-level offerings is ei-
ther one of difficulty or of the sequence in which material is best taken. Also, lecture courses with no
prerequisite have a 100- or 200-level number. The 400-level seminars and tutorials are intended for
advanced students, usually senior majors.
Middle Digit
Art Studio (ArtS)
Middle digit distinguishes introductory and general courses from those specialized in different media and
arts. 0 = introductory; 1 = general; 2 = architecture; 3 = drawing; 4 = painting; 5 = photography; 6 = print-
making; 7 = sculpture; 8 = video; 9 = independents, honors.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN ART
Students who wish to become candidates for the degree with honors must show prior evidence of supe-
rior performance in the major as well as research capabilities to carry out the proposed project.
Art
­ 64 ­
Art History:
In order for a project to be considered, the candidate (1) must have arranged for an advisor, and (in
consultation with the advisor) a second reader to supervise and evaluate the project (2) should normally
have had one course with the advisor. In addition, the topic must be within the advisor's areas of compe-
tence and should normally be related to course work which the student has done previously. In the case of
an interdisciplinary proposal, the second reader should normally come from the other discipline.
The student submits a 2-page proposal including a statement about the preparation for the project, a
description of the topic and a general bibliography. Following approval by the faculty advisor and second
reader, this proposal is reviewed by the entire Art faculty, who have the option to request revisions and to
refuse the proposal. Students should keep in mind that a thesis in Art History is not necessary for admission
to graduate study.
It is the responsibility of the candidate to select one of the following routes and to meet all deadlines.
Students who are not making satisfactory progress on their research and writing will not be allowed to
continue with the thesis. The completion of the requirements, however, will not guarantee a degree with
honors. The degree with honors will be awarded for projects demonstrating a high degree of scholarly
achievement and self-motivation. All proposals must be submitted according to the guidelines set out be-
low. The timetable for submission of work, including specific dates, is available in the Art Department
office.
Students may select one of the following options:
1) Full-Year Thesis: Research and writing will be carried out during both semesters and WSP of the
senior year (students should register for ArtH 493-W31-494). The thesis topic, advisor and second
reader must be determined by April 15 of junior year. Students who are on overseas programs
junior year are advised to make arrangements prior to their departure, but they may submit a final
proposal two weeks before the fall semester of senior year if they have made the necessary ar-
rangements. After the thesis is submitted, the candidate for honors shall present an oral defense
before faculty and peers.
2) Half-Year Thesis: Research and writing will be carried out during fall term and winter study or dur-
ing winter study and spring term (Students should register for ArtH 493-W31 or W31-ArtH 494).
For students who choose to complete themini-thesis in the fall, proposals must be submitted by
April 15 of the junior year. For those planning to complete the mini-thesis in the spring, proposals
must be submitted by November 1.
A student's project is judged by two members of the department, the advisor and second reader; in the
case of an interdisciplinary project, a member of the Art Department and a member of the other relevant
department or program functions as advisor and second reader. In rare cases, a third reader may be ap-
pointed by the department at the request of the advisor or second reader.
All routes require that one course and one WSP, in addition to the ten required courses for the major, be
dedicated to the honors project.
Art Studio:
Studio art concentrators who wish to be candidates for honors are required to add a 200-level course,
and to take the 400-level senior tutorial. An additional 300-level tutorial or 200-level course must be added
for a total of twelve courses.
Honors candidates enrolled in the senior tutorial must "evidence" prior experience in the media chosen
for the honors work. This "evidence" may consist of one or more 200-level courses in the medium, course
work at the 300 level and/or a slide portfolio demonstrating the student's proficiency in the media chosen
for the honors project. This work is presented to the senior tutorial instructor at the start of the spring semes-
ter.
At the end of the spring semester of the senior year, the honors candidate will orally defend his/her work
in the senior exhibition at WCMA. The entire studio faculty will attend the defense. Based on the work and
the oral defense, the studio faculty (as a whole) will designate honors, high honors or no honors.
History and Practice:
The route to honors is a combination of the Art Studio and Art History honors routes. At the beginning
of senior year, a candidate for honors in History and Practice makes a proposal to two faculty members,
one faculty advisor from each wing of the department. If both advisors agree to supervise the project, the
candidate enrolls in independent study and works through the fall semester and winter study. The progress
of the project is assessed by both advisors at the end of winter study; if the project is not well enough devel-
oped, the advisors may end it at that time. If the project is allowed to move forward, the student enrolls
either in ArtS 418T Senior Tutorial, if the project is primarily a matter of making art, or in an Honors
Independent Study, if it is primarily a writing project. The final project is submitted to the two advisors,
who will determine whether or not it will receive honors.

ARTH 201(F) American Landscape History (Same as Environmental Studies 201)
This is a survey course stressing the description and historical geography of regional, vernacular American
settings, with the goal of discerning a national style of spatial or landscape organization. Among the hu-
man-altered environments to be studied are: forestlands, rangelands, croplands, outdoor recreational sites,
mines and quarries; small towns, milltowns, central business districts, and suburbs; power and utilities;
housing, industry, commerce, and institutional uses such as the American college campus; water, road, and
rail corridors as examples of circulation nets. Primary evidence will be visual.
One afternoon meeting each week provides discussion and field- or site-visit opportunities, and enables
classmembers to obtain a first-hand familiarity with a rural-urban gradient of representative land uses and
occupants of the Hoosic-Hudson watershed and Taconic upland region surrounding Williamstown, as well
as experience with interviewing and field study methodologies.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: four term paper installments on the documentation of an evolv-
ing landscape site or behavior, short class presentation on research, as its "landscape" or type comes up for
class or lecture consideration, and an obligatory all-day field trip.

ARTH 202(S) Reading the Renaissance: Interpreting Italian Renaissance Art and History
Many works of Renaissance art, such as Botticelli's Birth of Venus, Leonardo's Mona Lisa, and Michelan-
gelo's David, are remarkably familiar to us. But even as they live in our cultural consciousness, we may
perceive them as elevated and remote masterpieces of western culture, housed away in museums halfway
around the world. Just what is it that makes these objects so admired and important? And what might we all
have to gain, intellectually, by considering them? We will focus in depth on a series of individual works of
art, learning and honing skills of observation, visual and contextual analysis, and written and oral expres-
sion. But we will also step back from the objects to explore and balance different approaches and points of
view and to consider, more broadly, different issues that can factor into the very act of interpretation. The
goal of the course is that students emerge from it with a rich understanding of the selected works in ques-
tion, as well as a mindfulness of the ways in which the Renaissance period might inform our aesthetic
perceptions and our critical understanding of the construction of the past.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on several short writing assignments as well as group projects,
presentations, and debates.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 16 (expected: 16). Preference to freshmen, then sophomores.

ARTH 205(F) History of Photography
Although based on a set of distinct technical processes, since its disclosure to the world in 1839, photogra-
phy's identity has remained contested. In this introduction to the history of photography from its earliest
manifestations until the present, we will explore the specific physical and conceptual characteristics of the
medium as well as the different and at times conflicting contexts in which photographers have lived and
worked and in which their images have been used and have come to acquire meaning. We will begin with
an introduction to some of the critical tools that have been used to analyze photographs. The rest of the
class will be comprised of thematic sections that address different attributes and uses of the medium and
Art
­ 66 ­
will include substantial hands-on demonstrations of photographic processes. Through this organization,
students will become familiar with the traditional history and practice of photography as well as more re-
cent critiques that are indebted to larger theoretical concerns surrounding visual representation and cultural
production. Since the course is designed with a studio component, students will have the opportunity to
work within a lab as well as a classroom setting. Evaluation will be based on two short projects, a midterm,
and a take home final exam.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: class discussion, a midterm, a final, and two short papers.

ARTH 206(F) French Impressionism, the Later 1860s-1886
This course will survey the rise of a new style and ideology of painting (which embraced landscape, por-
traiture and genre painting) based in and around the city of Paris in the final years of the Second Empire. A
loosely-affiliated assembly of young artists attained a group identity through a series of eight irregularly
held exhibitions (between 1874 and 1886). This course will follow what was eventually dubbed "Impres-
sionism" by a wise-cracking art critic through to the moment of the dissolution of the exhibiting society in
1886. The art historical literature on this very consequential "event" in the history of modernist painting is
voluminous, diverse and contradictory. The goals of the course will hence be twofold: it will acquaint stu-
dents with the rise and development of Impressionist art, and will at the same time survey the historiogra-
phy of the movement, by looking at its interpretation in the art criticism of the 1870s through to the work of
early 21st-century art historians. Impressionist art works in the collection of the Clark Art Institute will
constitute our laboratory.
Format: lecture/discussion. Each member of the class will choose one of the artworks in the collection and
write a (10-page) paper on it. There will also be regular class discussions of the assigned readings, and
midterm and final exams. We will also endeavor to visit the collections of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts
or the Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York City).
Prerequisites: ArtH 101-102. Enrollment limit: 40 (expected: 40). Preference given to Art History majors.

ARTH 209T(F) The Works of Modernist and Contemporary Landscape Architects (W)
Successive ways nature and the city are understood have affected the field of landscape architecture, first
distinguished as a profession, differing from landscape gardening, by Frederick Law Olmsted in the last
quarter of the nineteenth century. The field's purview has considerably broadened, beyond attendant
grounds or parks, to larger entities such as watersheds or regions or campuses, with their land use and
circulation patterns and their "growth nodes." Today the remediation of "brownfields" and other urban
detritus is an increasing source of commissions. Possibly no discipline has recently influenced landscape
architecture as much as plant ecology, with the landscape profession's becoming a manifestation of "ap-
plied ecology." This tutorial course will ponder the work of such deliberate outdoor shapers as Swedish
park and playground designers, a Brazilian's "painting" grounds with flowers, and a Canadian's re-creat-
ing indigenous vegetation (as in a permanent "work of art" outside the National Gallery of Art in Ottawa).
Formalist, naturalistic, and other styles, or works, likely receiving our attention in the United States will
include: a schema for shaping urban sprawl; Afro-American community planning in Oakland (as an exam-
ple of "process"); the grassing-over of roofs at Ford's River Rouge plant; and the rehabilitation of aban-
doned sites like a former elevated rail spur in New York City--all these landscape compositions, or pro-
posals, being the works of acclaimed "masters" or "rising" practitioners..
Requirements: Students will meet with the instructor in pairs for an hour each week; they will write a five-
page paper every other week (five in all), and comment on their partners' papers in alternate weeks. Em-
phasis will be placed on developing skills in viewing in our mind's eye, and articulating verbally, the com-
plexities of sometimes extensive outdoor spaces and in interpreting these designs, as well as constructing
arguments and responding to them, in both written and oral critiques. There will be an obligatory all-day
field session to Boston (in the company of a current practitioner, Nancy Shapero '81).
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10).

ARTH 210(F) The Age of Caravaggio and Bernini
The art and architecture of seventeenth-century Italy is often described as dynamic, colorful, theatrical and
extravagant. The works of Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio, and of Gianlorenzo Bernini certainly fit
this description. Although his career spanned less than twenty years, Caravaggio's approach to painting
influenced generations of artists both within and outside of Italy. Bernini, on the other hand, enjoyed a long
career, and dominated the seventeenth-century as Michelangelo had dominated the 16th. This course will
consider Caravaggio, Bernini, and a number of their contemporaries as practitioners of a style that re-
sponded to cultural, religious, social and intellectual forces. We will also discuss works by artists such as
the Carracci, Pietro da Cortona, Borromini, and Poussin.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements will consist of four short papers, two exams during the term, plus
a final exam (and, of course, participation in class and regular attendance). Students will be evaluated on
the basis of papers and exams.

This course will explore the nature and history of art in Venice by considering the most renowned Venetian
painter of the sixteenth century, Titian, as well as a number of his contemporaries, and the cultural climate
in which they worked. While particular emphasis will be given to painting, we will devote a good deal of
time to architecture and sculpture as well. Artists to be covered include the Bellini, Giorgione, Veronese,
Tintoretto, Jacopo Bassano, Palladio and Jacopo Sansovino.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements will consist of four short papers, two exams during the term, plus

ARTH 212(S) Art of Modern and Contemporary China*
This course will examine major issues in the art world of twentieth century China, as the nation and its
artists have struggled with the challenges of modernizing a traditional society. We will begin with the late
nineteenth and early twentieth century, to examine two schools in which modern and traditional painting
meet, the Shanghai and Lingnan schools. We will then focus on the modernity vs. tradition debates of the
Republican period, in which partisans of wholesale Westernization and preservers of the National Essence
contended. The discussion will then proceed to topics such as: China's Seduction by the West:Modern
Chinese Oil Painting in the 1920s and 1930s; China Roars: The Rise and Fall of the Avant-Garde Woodcut
Movement; Commercial Art and China's Modernization; The Victory of Socialist Realism: Oil Painting
and the New Guohua, 1950-1965; Idol and Ideal: Art in the Cultural Revolution and Post-Mao Era; Re-
opening to the West: The New Wave Movement, 1984-1989; The New Cosmopolitan Era: Art from 1990
to present. We will conclude with a look at some hot topics in the Chinese art world today, including art and
technology, urban reconstruction, and art for the 2008 Olympics. Students will be encouraged to relate
written work to the current Chinese art exhibition at the Williams College Museum of Art.
Format: lecture. Requirements: class discussion, two examinations, mid-term essay, and a 10- to 12- page

ARTH 221(F) The Gothic Revival
The Gothic Revival was once written off as a passing fad for pointed arches and pinnacles, but we now
recognize it as one of the major cultural and social movements of the nineteenth century. During its years of
greatest influence, it subjected every aspect of art, belief, society and labor to intense intellectual scrutiny,
using the Middle Ages as a platform from which to judge the modern world. This lecture course will look
at the Gothic Revival in Europe and America as a response to the industrial revolution and modernity.
Students will prepare a semester-long research paper. Possible topics include ideas about the origin and the
development of the Gothic; its political meaning; the literary background to the revival; new building types
and new materials; the relationship of the Gothic to the decorative arts; and the doctrine of morality in
architecture.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on the research paper; oral presentations and class

ARTH 224(F) Romanesque and Gothic Art and Architecture: The Medieval Church in
Context
The goal of this course is to survey the major works of ecclesiastical architecture, sculpture and stained
glass produced in France between approximately 1050 and 1400. These works were not created in
isolation from their surroundings; thus we will attempt to understand them not only stylistically, but also in
their original functional, social, and sometimes even political settings. The course will emphasize the
abbey church and the cathedral, the two major ecclesiastical buildings of this period, as heterogeneous
Art
­ 68 ­
entities that used architecture, sculpture, stained glass and other media, in conjunction with church ritual, to
render their sacred spaces distinct from, and elevated above, the world outside. We will furthermore try to
appreciate the special centrality of the abbey church and the cathedral in high medieval society. Sites for
contact with God and for the development of advanced learning, they could also serve as critical
determinants of local economic and political life, and as focuses of pilgrimage, trade, and international
cultural exchange.

A social history beginning with art of the pre-Revolutionary period and ending with realism. Major topics
include changing definitions of neoclassicism and romanticism, the impact of the revolutions of 1789,
1830, and 1848, the Napoleonic Empire, the shift from history painting to scenes of everyday life, land-
scape painting as an autonomous art form and attitudes toward race and sexuality. The course stresses
French artists such as Greuze, Vigée-Lebrun, David, Ingres, Delacroix, Géricault, Corot, and Courbet, but
also includes Goya, Constable, Turner, and Friedrich.

III; changing attitudes toward city and country in Impressionist and Symbolist art; the impact of imperial-
ism and international trade; the gendering of public spaces, and the prominent place of women in represen-
tations of modern life. The course addresses vanguard movements such as Impressionism and Post-Im-

of the social, ideological and economic forces that shaped it. Special attention will be paid to such themes
as the Puritan legacy and attitudes toward art; the making of art in a commercial society; and the tension
between the ideal and the real in American works of art.

Such revolutionary artistic movements as Cubo-Futurism, Suprematism, and Constructivism profoundly
influenced the development of twentieth-century art throughout the Western world--just as the 1917 Rus-
sian Revolution upset the world's political balance. This course will investigate Russian art within a cultur-
al framework and explore the relationship between artistic production and politics. We will begin with a
brief overview of important developments in Russian art that prefigured the twentieth-century artistic revo-
lution: the introduction of icons from Byzantium, the founding of St. Petersburg and the rise of Western-
style portraiture, and the fin-de-siecle movements that united painting with music and ballet. However, the
focus of the course will be 1910-1930, when radical innovation was the order of the day and revolutionary
ideas sparked entirely new conceptions of art. We will then look at the Socialist Realist style of the Stalin
era, Soviet dissident art and Moscow conceptualism, ending the semester with an exploration of current
trends in post-Soviet Russian art.

some of the most spectacular monuments (e.g. the Taj Mahal and the blue tiled mosques of Isfahan) and
refined manuscript painting ever known. We will look at these art forms from the tenth to the twentieth
centuries, highlighting the patronage of key dynasties, including the Timurids of Samarqand and the
Mughals of India. An important issue throughout the course will be the impact that Islam has had on the
artistic traditions of this region.

ARTH 312(S) Distant Encounters: East Meets West in the Art of the European Middle
Ages
This lecture course investigates the rich artistic consequences--in architecture, manuscript illumination,
mosaic, sculpture, panel painting, fresco, metalwork, and other minor arts--of European contact with the
Eastern Mediterranean between approximately 300 and 1450 AD. From the beginnings of Christianity,
pilgrims from Europe made the long journey to sacred sites in the Holy Land (extending across parts of
present-day Egypt, Israel, Syria, and Turkey). When these sites became less accessible with the spread of
Islam in the seventh century, Europeans sought to recreate the sites at home. Later, from 1095 onward,
Christian Europeans attempted to reclaim and hold the Holy Land from non-Christians by force, through
an ill-fated series of five major and several lesser "crusades." Over the centuries, before, during, and after
the Crusades, exposure to the peoples, ideas, and cultures of the Eastern Mediterranean also came through
trade and through the travel and settlement of non-Europeans in Europe itself, particularly in Spain, Sicily,
and Venice. The course aims to survey artistic production within each of these different contexts of East-
West encounter.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: two to three short papers, midterm, and final exam.
No prerequisite, but previous coursework in medieval art helpful (ArtH 101-102, 223, or 224). Enrollment

ARTH 308(S) Photography in Contemporary Art
Since its inception in 1839, claims for photography's status as art have been made largely in terms of its
imitation, extension, or rejection of painting. Beginning in the 1960s, this relationship changed as artists
began to exploit photography's conceptual, performative, and even sculptural properties. To come to terms
with photography's new position in the art world, the class will critically consider the role of photography
in contemporary art making practices from the 1960s onwards. As part of our course discussions and read-
ings, we will focus on artists who have used photography to examine issues surrounding the body,
memory, the landscape, history, the nature of representation, and media culture, among others. As part of
the class, we will also consider the extent to which developments in feminism, multiculturalism, and criti-
cal theory have influenced these investigations. Since the course is designed to coincide with an exhibition
of contemporary photography at the Williams College Museum of Art, students will have the opportunity
to work within a museum as well as a classroom setting.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on a class presentation, two short papers that will be developed
into a final research paper, and class participation.
Prerequisites: ArtH 101-102 or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 12 (expected: 12). Preference

ARTH 374(F) In Pursuit of Clouds and Mists: Landscape Painting in Chinese Art*
In no other cultural tradition has landscape played a more important role in the arts than that of China. In
China, nature imagery has long been read as a metaphor for the individual's values and beliefs. Some flow-
ers and plants may symbolize moral values, and hermitages in the wilderness can suggest political protest.
In the course of surveying the evolution of landscape in Chinese art, this undergraduate seminar will ad-
dress several critical questions, including: Under what sorts of conditions does landscape arise as a genre?
What kinds of issues have been addressed through the landscape genre? What sorts of social groups have
supported the landscape genre and what sorts of values can be encoded, debated, or negotiated through the
forms of landscape? An exhibition of Chinese landscape painting at WCMA will provide examples for the
class. In addition, we shall read secondary sources on landscape painting in Western art so as to provide a
basis for comparative discussion.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation: short writing assignments, painting, group projects, quiz, oral pre-
sentation and class participation.
No prerequisites:. Enrollment limit: 16 (expected: 16). Preference given to Art History majors.

ARTH 405(S) Seminar in Architectural Criticism (W)
How does one judge a building? According to its structural efficiency or its aesthetic qualities? Its social
responsibility--or just its pizzazz? Depending on the building, and the critic, any of these questions might
be pertinent, or impertinent. This seminar explores architectural criticism, that curious genre between liter-
ature and architecture, and looks at its history, nature and function. We will read and discuss classic reviews
by historical and contemporary critics as John Ruskin, Mariana van Rensselaer, Lewis Mumford, Ada
Louise Huxtable and Herbert Muschamp. Insights gained from these discussions will be applied by stu-
dents to writing their own reviews, which will likewise be discussed in class. Early assignments will con-
centrate on mechanics: how to describe a building vividly and accurately, how to balance description and
interpretation judiciously, how to compare. Subsequent ones will be more synthetic, encouraging students
to write bold, lively and critical essays. The ultimate goal is to develop a distinctive and effective voice, and
to gain a better understanding of the nature of criticism in general.
Format: seminar. Requirements: Students will write and revise six papers (5-7 pages) during the semester.
Prerequisites: ArtH 101-102 and consent of instructor. Enrollment limit: 11 (expected: 11). Preference giv-

ARTH 422(S) Making the Stones Speak: The Emergence and Development Of the
Romanesque Sculpted Portal
Beginning around the year 1000, European Christendom experienced a great ecclesiastical building boom.
According to a contemporary chronicler, "it was as if the whole earth, having cast off the old by shaking
itself, were clothing itself everywhere in the white robe of the church." During the course of the eleventh
century, the designers of these structures fashioned a new architectural language that we now label "Ro-
manesque." One of the most innovative and dramatic aspects of this new language was its assimilation of
monumental sculpture, absent in Europe since the fifth century. The focus of attention in this regard was
the portal, which marked the threshold between the profane realm of the outside world and the sacred
space of the church. This seminar will investigate the antecedents and origins of the Romanesque sculpted
portal and examine in detail its greatest manifestations. Emphasis will be placed on understanding these
often complex sculptural schemes within their original functional and physical contexts. What role did this
imagery play in structuring the medieval visitor's overall experience of the church? And what did it mean
to have this imagery carved into the very fabric of "God's temple"?
Format: seminar. Requirements: class discussion, class presentation, 15- to 20-page research paper.

ARTH 451(F) Ideal Bodies: The Modern Nude and Its Dilemmas (Same as Women's and
Gender Studies 451)
The nineteenth century is so dominated by the female nude that the very term "nude" has come to stand for
the female body. And yet, the history of the nude during this period is not devoid of male bodies. How did
the female body come to so dominate representations of the nude? And how did the increasing challenge to
the ideal (i.e., Realism, photography, Impressionism) affect the credibility of the nude? Required readings
include Kenneth Clark's classic study The Nude: A Study in Ideal Form (1956) and Lynda Nead's The
Female Nude: Art, Obscenity and Sexuality (1992), with special attention to texts which show how the
nude and the discourse of the ideal function to obscure social issues. We will explore the ways in which
certain types of bodies have been defined in opposition to the white western ideal, and thereby exoticized
or marginalized. Our prime focus is the work of David, Ingres, Géricault, Courbet, Manet, and Renoir but
more popular nineteenth-century images as well as selected works by artists working today will be dis-
cussed.
Evaluation will be based on biweekly 1-page papers, short reports, an oral presentation and a 10- to
20-page paper.
Prerequisites: ArtH 101-102. Enrollment limited to 12. Preference given to senior Art majors, Women's and

ARTH 470(S) American Orientalism, Then and Now*
"Orientalism," according to Edward Said, refers to asymmetrical relationships between "East" and "West"
by which the latter represents and controls the former. This course is about the visual manifestations of
those dynamics as they exist between the United States and the Islamic world during the period from 1870
to the present; during this period, America emerged on the world stage, consumer culture coalesced and the
mechanical reproduction of images became a formative force in American visuality. With reference to
painting, photography, film, advertising and fashion, we will explore the American Orientalism as it
changes over time in response to social and political circumstance.
Students will be working with two exhibitions at WCMA and will be expected to produce a major term
project.

ARTS 100(F,S) Drawing I
The process of drawing develops a heightened awareness of the visual world. Your subjective experiences
and your objective experiences combine to form a larger perceptual understanding of the environment in
which you live. Drawing allows you an alternative use of these processes and provides a format for stating
what you know about the world. Drawing is an excellent means for improving your skills in observing,
seeing distinctions, and creating new meanings from your perceptions. This is an introductory course
which will investigate the properties of making an image on the two-dimensional page. While drawing is
an essential basis for much of the artmaking process, its use is not limited to artists. Design, illustration,
engineering, and science are among the many fields which incorporate drawing.
There are three to five sections of ArtS 100 offered each semester. Although individual faculty members
teaching beginning drawing do not follow a common syllabus, they share common goals. Syllabi for each
section are available from the secretary's office in the W. L. S. Spencer Art Building.
Evaluation will be based primarily on the quality and quantity of work produced as well as some attention
to the student's progress. Lab fee.

This drawing course will continue to investigate the techniques, principles of organization, and ideas which
were introduced in the Drawing I course. Having become more familiar with the drawing process, students
will be encouraged, through selected problems, to expand and challenge the conventions of markmaking.
As with any discipline, familiarity with the rules allows the users to seek alternatives and develop defini-
tions of how the drawing process can best be suited to their own visual vocabulary. The range of exercises
could include traditional materials on paper as well as combinations of materials more commonly associat-
ed with non-art disciplines, i.e., computers, industrial materials, literature, etc.
Evaluation will be based on evidence of each student's progress, as shown in a portfolio of drawings made

ARTS 310T(S) Appearance/Disappearance
Appearance and disappearance are conditions that intuitively and intellectually link a subject to its sur-
rounding environment. We are made aware of things appearing (or disappearing) by the degrees and kinds
of contrasts exhibited by the subject (ideas or objects) in relation to its ground (ephemeral or material). The
particular array of relationships between subject and ground constructs diverse kinds of evidence. From
medical research in the imaging processes of the internal body to the forensic cues offered by the "black
box" in-flight recording; from the military use of camouflage to the video taped "appearances" of Osama
bin Laden; from the inability of an eating disorder patient to recognize a self image to the masquerades we
willingly wear-appearance and disappearance have governed the evidences of our actions, beliefs and
identities.
This image-based studio examination of the subject will look at material that has been shaped by its link
with our central theme. Each of five studio projects will successively build a cumulative view of how ap-
pearance and/or disappearance might shift a viewer's ability to render any point of view. While work in a
variety of media will be encouraged, most of the studio exercises will be two-dimensional or low-relief in
their final presentation.
Format: tutorial. Evaluation will be on the basis of the technical and conceptual strengths of the portfolio,

ARTS 380T(S) Between Art and Cinema
This tutorial will engage visual, kinesthetic, and narrative issues that emerge from new hybrid forms of
contemporary art and cinema. Students will look at recent cinema and gallery-based video installation, and
will read criticism that considers relationships among architecture, landscape, the pictured body, the body
of the viewer, and the phenomenology of the moving image. Some of the topics to be considered will draw
on recent scholarship about traditional cinematic forms: how can the picturing of space and motion pro-
duce feeling? How do the face and the gesture of the body register emotion? How does language relate to
these visual and kinesthetic properties of the moving image? How does cinema use these elements in the
service of storytelling and story structure? Other topics will pertain specifically to the ways in which con-
temporary installation art has brought these questions of space, motion, and narrative away from the forms
and architectures of traditional cinema: How do contemporary video practices relate to histories of cinema,
sculpture, and theater?
Format: tutorial. Each week, one student in each tutorial pair will produce a short work that responds to a
particular assignment related to that week's screening and reading. Students will each realize five video
projects, both in traditional single-screen formats and in multiple-screen installation formats. The class will

GRADUATE COURSES IN ART HISTORY
Requirements for the Degree of Master of Arts in Art History
The degree is normally awarded upon successful completion of two years of resident graduate study. To
earn the degree the student must earn a grade of at least B- in each of ten courses, at least six of which must
be graduate seminars (including ArtH 504). There is a geographical/chronological distribution requirement
that these ten courses must fulfill (details available from the Graduate Program Office.) In connection with
the preparation of a paper for the Graduate Symposium, students will register for an eleventh course (ArtH
509), to be graded pass/fail, in their fourth semester.
In addition to completing the required courses, students must participate in a group study trip to Europe
during winter study period in the first year, complete a Qualifying Paper in January of the second year, and
satisfy the language requirement in the manner described below (see "Language Courses").
Senior art majors may enroll in graduate seminars, space permitting, with the permission of instructor.
ARTH 503(S) Studies in Decorative Arts, Material Culture, Design History, 1700-2000
The course will explore the methods, goals, and theoretical framework in which three-dimensional,
functional objects have been and are interpreted. Class discussion will include distinction between "fine
arts," "decorative arts," and "design"; role and limitation of connoisseurship; the current relationship of
object study to aesthetics, social history, history of technology, anthropology, sociology, gender and ethnic
studies; the effect of the market on history and scholarship; and current theories on the role of objects in
human life.
Requirements: students will be responsible for leading class discussions of selected readings, one 20-page
paper, two 3-page papers and an oral presentation on the main research topic. Enrollment limit: 10.

which this disciplinary tradition has been challenged by recent critical theory. It will begin its study with the
"founders" of the field and end with issues and problems that generated the "new art history" twenty years
ago and "visual studies" in the last decade. Topics to be covered include: style, iconography/iconology,
semiotics, identity politics, formalism, deconstruction, phenomenology, psychoanalysis, feminism, Marx-
ism, and gender studies. Resident Clark Fellows will occasionally talk to us on perspectives of their choice.
Each student will write one short mid-term paper and a longer concluding essay, as well as present a couple
of the readings to the class. Limited to and required of first-year students in the Graduate Program in the
History of Art.
Hour: 1:10-3:50 T HOLLY
ARTH 506(F) The Print: History, Theory, and Practice
Centered around the Clark Art Institute's print collection, this seminar will introduce its participants to the
study of European prints with an emphasis on woodcut, engraving, and etching during the 15th-17th cen-
turies. We will review the various methods of printmaking as well as the primary elements of print con-
noisseurship. Through a series of close readings of historical texts, we will explore aspects of artistic prac-
tice, theory, and collecting.
Requirements: each participant will lead discussions of several reading assignments, in addition to a final
presentation and term paper. Enrollment limit: 11. Preference given to second-year students in the Gradu-
ate Program in the History of Art.

ARTH 508(S) Art and Conservation: An Inquiry into History, Methods, and Materials
This course is designed to acquaint students with observation and examination techniques for works of art,
artifacts, and decorative arts objects; give them an understanding of the history of artist materials and meth-
ods; and familiarize them with the ethics and procedures of conservation. This is not a conservation train-
ing course but is structured to provide a broader awareness for those who are planning careers involving
work with cultural objects. Class format will include slide presentations, lectures, gallery talks, hands-on
opportunities, technical examinations, and group discussions. Sessions will be held at the Williamstown
Art Conservation Center, Williams College, Clark Art Institute, and the Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller
Empire State Plaza Art Collection in Albany. Examination questions may be formulated from exhibitions
at these locations.
Six exams will be given. Exams scores will be weighed in proportion to the number of sessions covered by
the exam (e.g., the paintings exam, derived from six sessions of the course, will count as 25% of the final
grade). There is no overall final exam. Some exams may be designated "open book"; however, all work
should be a student's individual effort.
Enrollment limit: 12. Does not satisfy the undergraduate seminar requirement.
Hour: 6:30-8:30 p.m. TR Staff of Williamstown Art Conservation Center
ARTH 509(S) Graduate Student Symposium
This course is designed to assist qualified fourth-semester graduate students in preparing a scholarly paper
to be presented at the Graduate Program's annual spring symposium. Working closely with a student/facul-
ty ad hoc advisory committee, each student will prepare a twenty-minute presentation based on the Quali-
fying Paper. Special emphasis is placed on the development of effective oral presentation skills.
Requirements: each student is required to present three dry runs and a final oral presentation at the sympo-
sium.
Prerequisites: successful completion and acceptance of the Qualifying Paper.

ARTH 531(F) Renaissance Linear Perspective: How one Small, now Lost
Fifteenth-century Painting Changed not only the Way We in the West Draw Pictures, but
even the Way We See the Phenomenal World
Why was it that linear perspective was first, and only conceived in Western Europe? How and why did it
transform Western Art; and what were its unintended consequences for Western science? This seminar will
examine the rationale behind Florentine engineer and architect Filippo Brunelleschi's original perspective
demonstration in 1425; how he constructed his first picture of the Florentine Baptistery, and who were the
earliest artists to apply his new geometric rules to their paintings and sculptures. We will then investigate
how Brunelleschi's perspective began to appeal to mathematicians and natural philosophers, eventually
making it possible for Galileo Galilei to recognize through his telescope for the first time ever, the moun-
tains and craters of the moon.
Required of each student: at least two oral presentations in class, plus a single term paper due at the end of
term.

ARTH 548(S) Art about Art: 1400-2000
This thematic seminar will focus on depictions through which artists referred to their own profession and
its products. Images to be discussed include legends of the origin of art, self-portraits and other portraits of
artists, scenes of contemporary and historical artists in their studios, as well as finished art on display. While
tracking the major changes in imagery from the end of the Middle Ages through the twentieth century
(with some reference to earlier developments) we will analyze specific images, comparing their implica-
tions with both the social conditions and the theoretical positions then current. Requirements: two 9- to
10-page papers, one 3-page paper and an oral presentation on the main research topic.
Enrollment limit: 15.

ARTH 551(F) Winslow Homer
In this seminar we will explore the life and art of Winslow Homer. Paintings, prints, watercolors, and
photographs in the collection of the Clark Art Institute--which will largely be on view for most of the
fall--will focus our discussions and provide the basis for understanding Homer's art-making and his place
within the art-culture of his day. A consideration of his subjects will necessarily intersect with many of the
Art
­ 78 ­
nation's most pressing issues during his era: the Civil War and Reconstruction; the rise of middle-class
leisure; the relation of man to the environment.
Students' responsibilities will include class discussion, two short papers, an oral presentation (and response
to someone else's), and a final research paper.
Enrollment limit: 10. Preference given to graduate students in the history of art.

ARTH 554(F) Critical Texts in Art and Urban Modernity, 1800-1900
The publication of The Nineteenth-Century Visual Culture Reader, Vanessa R. Schwartz and Jeannene M.
Przyblyski (eds.), in 2004 enables and inspires this seminar: a (re)visitation of the critical primary and sec-
ondary texts which are (apparently) vital to the interpretation of nineteenth-century urban art--painting,
printmaking and photography--especially (but not exclusively) in Paris. The goal of the class will be to
analyze the relationship and links between practices of visual modernism and theories of urban modernity;
technological modernity will be a leitmotiv. The touchstone primary texts will be the apposite writings of
Charles Baudelaire, Karl Marx, Sigmund Freud, Georg Simmel, Siegfried Kracauer and Walter Benjamin.
Secondary texts will include the work of Jonathan Crary, Wolfgang Schivelbusch, T.J. Clark, Pierre Nora,
Sharon Marcus, Debora Silverman and others. Close reading and lively (well-informed) participation in
weekly discussions will be the spines of the course. In her/his final paper (about 15 pages in length), each
seminar member will test the analytical force of the writings of one or more scholars by using them to read
a corpus of nineteenth-century urban art works, to which they have not been applied hitherto.

In conjunction with the exhibition of the same name, this course will explore the many facets of "moving
pictures" in late nineteenth and early twentieth-century American art. We will concentrate on the illusion of
movement in the still arts (painting, drawing, prints, etc. of the Impressionist and Ashcan eras), the art and
science interface of chronophotography (highlighting Muybridge, Marey, and Demeny), and the early
films of Edison, the Lumières, and other pioneering filmmakers and their artistic context. Theories of per-
ception, social and science history, and contemporary literature will provide a broader lens through which
we will take a new look at the art and film history of this period. In addition to the analysis of readings, and
a short and long paper, we will practice some rudimentary filmmaking to understand its artistic process.

ARTH 569(S) Film as Art: Cinema in the Weimar Republic
This seminar will explore the effort, in Weimar writing on film and film production itself, to raise the status
of cinema from a low-brow mass entertainment medium to a visual art form worthy to stand alongside
traditional painting. As Rudolf Arnheim argued in Film als Kunst (1931), "in film one continues to work
with the means and devices of traditional art, [and] one can speak just as seriously about Charlie Chaplin,
Greta Garbo, editing, and panning as one does about Titian, Cézanne, Baroque and pleinairism." The semi-
nar will focus precisely on this constitution of film as a primarily visual medium, in which, to paraphrase
Arnheim again, the most profound spiritual content is conveyed by light, framing, physiognomy, and edit-
ing rather than by the word or the story line, which, it was conceded, often approached kitsch. Topics will
include: "Expressionism" in film, the return of physiognomy, set design, the transition from silent film to
sound film. During the first half of the semester there will be weekly readings in both German and English,
hence a good reading knowledge of German is a prerequisite for enrollment.

This course will explore in depth primary and secondary writings on the art of modern and contemporary
China, both critical and art historical. We will examine the viewpoints, purposes, and agendas of writers
and artists who have constructed the history of modern Chinese art. We will conclude with a brief consider-
ation of the construction of the field of art history in twentieth century China. Students in this seminar are
urged to concurrently enroll in Modern and Chinese Art. Requirements: reading reviews, class discussion,
and a research paper. Research topics related to the current Chinese art exhibition at the Williams College
Museum of Art are strongly encouraged. Enrollment limit: 12.

ARTH 597(F), 598(S) Undergraduate Courses Taken for Graduate Credit
LANGUAGE COURSES
Reading proficiency in two European languages is required for the M.A. degree in Art History at Wil-
liams, and provision for attainment of this qualification is an integral part of the program of study. Of these
two, German is required, and French is recommended. Elementary and intermediate undergraduate
courses offered by the language departments are open to graduate students, and the graduate program of-
fers advanced, one-semester courses in French and German art-history readings. A student who begins
elementary language study after enrollment in the program should expect to take a sequence of courses.
Details may be obtained from the Graduate Program office. Entering students with some previous lan-
guage background will be asked to take a standard reading examination for purposes of placement. Stu-
dents should aim to complete all language work no later than the end of the third semester.
To satisfy the requirement in each of the two required languages, a student must: (a) score 700 or better
on the SAT II reading examination upon enrollment in the program or, (b) complete punctually and satis-
factorily (B- or better) all assignments and tests in the advanced courses. The same standards and expecta-
tions apply to language courses as to other courses and seminars.
Second-year students who have successfully completed German 511-512 and have independently de-
veloped their German language skills during the summer may, before the commencement of their third
semester of study, arrange to take a two-hour translation examination administered by the Graduate Pro-
gram. Students who pass the examination are exempted from German 513.
If appropriate to his or her course of study, a student may petition to substitute another language for
French. Instruction in Italian, Spanish, Russian, Latin, and Greek is regularly offered in the undergraduate
curriculum, whereas independent arrangements must be made for Dutch and other languages.
GERM 511(F)-512(S) Reading German for Beginners (Same as German 111(F)-112(S))
This course is for students who have had no previous study of German.
GERM 513(F) Readings in German Art History and Criticism
Texts are selected from characteristic works of art history and criticism and from the specialized literature
required in concurrent seminars.
Prerequisites: German 511-512 with a final grade of B- or above, or appropriate score on SAT II exam
upon matriculation.
RLFR 511(F) Intensive Grammar and Translation
An intensive grammar course for students interested either in developing or in improving their basic read-
ing skills in French. Emphasis will be on a general review of grammar and sentence structure as well as on
developing a wide range of vocabulary centered around art history.
RLFR 512(S) Readings in French Art History and Criticism
An advanced translation course specializing in art history. Texts will be selected from fundamental works of
art history and criticism and from the specialized literature required in concurrent art seminars in the Gradu-
ate Program in Art History.

STUDY ABROAD
Students intending to major in Asian Studies are encouraged to study in Asia during one or both semes-
ters of their junior year. Williams sponsors study abroad programs in China and Japan. Opportunities to
study in India, Indonesia, Korea, Taiwan,Thailand, and other Asian countries are also available. Prospec-
tive Asian Studies majors who are planning to study abroad should discuss their plans with their advisor as
far in advance as possible. Up to eight courses taken overseas can count toward graduation, and up to four
courses taken overseas may be counted toward the major.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS
Students interested in writing an honors thesis in Asian Studies, Chinese, or Japanese should submit a
proposal to the department chair when they register for courses in the spring of their junior year. The pro-
posal should include a statement of the topic, a general description of the types of materials available for
study and how the study will be carried out, and the name of the faculty member who will serve as advisor.
Admission to the honors thesis program will normally be limited to students who have maintained at least a
B+ average in their courses for the major.
Students admitted to the program should register for ASST 493-W31-494, CHIN 493-W31-494, or
JAPN 493-W31-494. They will be expected to turn in the final draft of their thesis shortly after spring
break and to discuss their results formally with their faculty graders. Their final grades in the three courses
listed above and the award of Honors, Highest Honors, or no honors will be determined by the quality of
the thesis and the student's performance in the oral defense.
THE ASIAN STUDIES ENDOWMENT
The Linen summer grants for study abroad, the Linen visiting professorships, and several other pro-
grammatic activities in the department are supported by an endowment for Asian Studies established by
family and friends in memory of James A. Linen III, Class of 1934, Trustee of the College from 1948 to
1953 and from 1963 to 1982.

Asian Studies
­ 82 ­
mester in advance and present a proposal to the Coordinator or the professor with whom they wish to study
by the first day of pre-registration week. Those students entering with proficiency in Chinese should see
the Coordinator concerning placement.
The department also offers courses in English on Chinese literature and culture in translation for stu-
dents who wish to become acquainted with the major achievements in Chinese literary, intellectual and
cultural history. For the purpose of the distribution requirement, all courses in Chinese are considered Divi-
sion I.
CHIN 101(F)-W88-102(S) Basic Chinese*
An introduction to Mandarin, the language with the largest number of native speakers in the world, which
is the official language of China and Taiwan, and one of the official languages of Singapore. Course objec-
tives are for the student to develop simple, practical conversational skills and acquire basic proficiency in
reading and writing in both the traditional and the simplified script at about the 500-character level. The
relationship between language and culture and the sociolinguistically appropriate use of language will be
stressed throughout. Both audio and video materials will be employed extensively.
Format of spoken classes: dialog performance, drills, communicative exercises. Format of written classes:
oral reading, questions and discussion in Chinese, translation and explanation in English. Evaluation is
based on classroom performance, homework, quizzes, unit tests, and an oral and written final exam.
No prerequisites. No Enrollment limit (expected: 10). This is a rigorous, semi-intensive introduction to lis-
tening, speaking, reading, and writing. Students desiring a less demanding course in spoken Chinese only
should register for Chinese 111-112. Students who have taken Chinese 111-112 or who possess prior back-
ground but are not yet ready for Chinese 201 due to insufficient preparation in reading and writing should
speak with the Coordinator about taking Chinese 121-122.
Credit granted only if both semesters and the winter study sustaining program are taken.

CHIN 121(F), 122(S) Basic Written Chinese*
This course constitutes the written component of Chinese 101-102. For students who have previously tak-
en CHIN 111-112, or for those who already possess some prior background in spoken Mandarin from high
school, Chinese heritage weekend school, home, or overseas residence but are not yet ready for Chinese
201 due to insufficient preparation in reading and writing.
Evaluation is based on classroom performance, homework, quizzes, unit tests, and a final exam.
Prerequisites: Chinese 111-112 or permission of the instructor. No enrollment limit (expected: 10 per sec-
tion). Not open to students who have completed Chinese 101-102.

CHIN 131(S) Basic Cantonese*
An introduction to Standard Cantonese, a major regional language of southern China which is spoken by
over 50 million people in Hong Kong, Macao, Guangdong, and Guangxi as well as by many overseas
Chinese in Southeast Asia, Hawaii, and North America. Due to the pervasive influence of Hong Kong as
well as the economic transformation of Guangdong Province, the prestige of Cantonese within China has
been rising steadily over the past two decades. Our focus in this course will be on developing basic
listening and speaking skills, though we will also study some of the special characters which have been
used for centuries to write colloquial Cantonese. Since students will ordinarily possess prior proficiency in
Mandarin, a closely related language, we should be able to cover in one semester about as much as is
covered in the first two to three semesters of Mandarin.
Evaluation will be based on classroom performance, quizzes, tests, and a final exam.
Prerequisites: Chinese 202 or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 12 (expected: 8).

CHIN 219(F) Popular Culture in Modern China*
This course introduces students to a variety of forms of popular culture in modern China and possible ways
of reading them using Cultural Studies methods. Rather than taking a chronicle approach to tracing the
history of popular culture in China, we will adopt a generic approach to examine different forms of popular
culture in modern and contemporary China. The forms of popular culture studied will include popular
readings (fiction and other reading matter), newspapers, magazines, advertisements, propaganda posters,
popular music, television shows, film, and popular religious movements. This course will give particular
attention to popular culture in mainland China, though popular culture in Taiwan will also be discussed.
We will explore such themes as the definitions of "popular culture," globalization and cultural trends, the
encoding and decoding strategies of a popular "text," as well as the political, ideological and sociological
messages behind a popular "text." All readings in English.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on regular in-class participation, two short (5-page)

CHIN 224(F) Cultural Foundations: The Literature and History of Early China (Same as
Comparative Literature 220 and History 315)*
The early history of China witnessed many of humankind's most influential accomplishments, from the
development of a civil bureaucracy to the invention of printing, the compass, and gunpowder. It also saw
the composition and spread of literary works and styles that continue to be both read and emulated up to the
present day not only in China but throughout the world. The acute awareness of early history and literature
that runs through modern Chinese culture, in its many manifestations and locales, is arguably unrivaled in
the modern world. To understand modern China, one must understand the past that continues to shape it
today. The traditional view in China was that "literature, history and philosophy cannot be separated." Ac-
cordingly, this course will look at both the history and literature of China from the 2nd millennium B.C. to
the late 13th century A.D. Each week we will first read and discuss scholarship on the history and culture
of a given historical period. In the following class we will read selections of primary writings (in English
translation) from the same period and analyze them in their historical and cultural context. These writings
will range from poems and short narratives to philosophical works and political tracts. Our goal is to under-
stand not only what modern scholarship says about early China, but what the people living in that period
and culture had to say about themselves and their world. All readings in English.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: one short paper (5-7 pages), one longer paper (10-12 pages),
take-home midterm, and final exam. Participation in class discussions expected.
No prerequisites. No enrollment limit (expected: 15). Open to all.
Hour: 1:10-2:25 MR NUGENT
CHIN 235(S) China on Screen (Same as Comparative Literature 235)*
From short films shown in teahouses in the late 19th century to international blockbusters in the early 21st,
Chinese films have served as an important medium for both the internal development of Chinese cultures
and the presentation of those cultures to the world. In this course we will survey a wide range of works
from socially progressive films of the 1930s and 1940s to the martial arts hits of the last decade. These will
include not only films from mainland China, but from Hong Kong and Taiwan as well. We will use these
films as a way to talk about such issues as visual culture, nationalism, technology, sexuality, social change,
and the representation of China on the world stage. All readings are in English and all films are subtitled in
English.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: one short paper (5-7 pages), one longer paper (10-12 pages),
take-home midterm, and final exam. Participation in class discussions expected.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 30 (expected: 30). Preference to Asian Studies majors and then to jun-

CHIN 301(F), 302(S) Upper-Intermediate Chinese*
Although the oral skills will continue to receive attention, there is at this level increased emphasis on read-
ing and writing. A major goal of the course will be developing students' reading proficiency in standard
written Chinese, the grammar and vocabulary of which differ considerably from the colloquial written
Chinese which was introduced during the first two years of instruction. About half of the course will be
devoted to newspaper reading, with the remainder consisting of several modules that may include short
selections from modern Chinese fiction, films, or other types of performance literature. Both simplified and
traditional character texts will be used. Conducted in Mandarin.
Requirements: three 50-minute classes plus a conversation session; primarily reading and discussion; stu-

audiotapes, videotapes, and films featuring Chinese speakers from various segments of society; and (for
reading) newspaper and magazine articles dealing with Chinese politics and economics as well as selec-
tions from modern Chinese literature. Conducted in Mandarin.

CHIN 412(S) Introduction to Classical Chinese*
Classical or "Literary" Chinese was the standard written language of China from around the seventh centu-
ry BC until the 1920s and served for many centuries as an important written language in Japan, Korea, and
Vietnam as well. Moreover, remnants of Classical Chinese are still used frequently in Modern Chinese, in
both writing (e.g., newspaper, road signs and academic writing) and speech (e.g., proverbs and aphorisms).
This course will serve as an introduction to the basic grammar and vocabulary of Classical Chinese. We
will focus on stories and anecdotes from works from the Spring and Autumn (770-481 B.C.) period
through the Han Dynasty (202 B.C. -220 A.D.), as they served as the foundation for the language. While
the main objective is to develop reading proficiency in Classical Chinese, the course will also serve to
enhance proficiency in Modern Chinese through classroom discussion in Mandarin, translation of Classi-
cal Chinese into Modern Chinese, and comparison of Classical Chinese and Modern Chinese vocabulary
and grammar. Conducted primarily in Mandarin.
Evaluation will be based on classroom performance, homework, tests, and a final exam.
Prerequisites: Chinese 301 or permission of instructor. No enrollment limit (expected: 12).

COURSES IN JAPANESE (Div. I)
The department regularly offers four levels of language instruction in Modern Japanese, designed to
enable the student to become proficient in aural comprehension, speaking, reading, and writing. Courses
on Japanese literature in translation and film are also offered. The course numbering system for Japanese is
sequential. Students move from Japanese 101-102 to 201, 202, 301, 302, 401, and 402. Independent study
(Japanese 497, 498) may be offered for students who have completed 402 or the equivalent, depending on
student needs and available resources. Students interested in pursuing independent study must contact the
Coordinator of the Japanese Program one semester in advance and present a proposal to the professor with
whom they wish to study by the first day of pre-registration week. Those students entering with proficiency
in Japanese should see the Coordinator concerning placement. For the purpose of the distribution require-
ment, all courses in Japanese are considered Division I unless otherwise noted.

(See under History for full description.)
Satisfies one semester of the Division II distribution requirement.
JAPN 255(F) Love and Death in Modern Japanese Fiction (Same as Comparative
Literature 255)*
The thing that surprises many first-time readers of modern Japanese fiction is its striking similarity to West-
ern fiction. But equally surprising are the intriguing differences that lie concealed within that sameness.
This courses charts these similarities and differences by reading Japanese fiction about love and death--
two universal human experiences that are nevertheless highly inflected by specific cultures. The course
begins with tales of doomed lovers that were popular in the 18th-century kabuki and puppet theaters, and
that still feature prominently in Japanese popular culture, from comics to tv dramas. From there we move
on to examine a range of other relationships between love and death, including parental love and sacrifice,
martyrdom and love of country, sex and the occult, and romance at an advanced age. Texts may include
plays, novels and short stories by authors like Chikamatsu, Kawabata, Kôno, Mishima, Murakami Haruki,
Ôe, Tanizaki, and Tsushima, as well as films by Imamura, Ôshima, and Shinoda. The class and the read-
ings are in English.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: two in-class exams and two 5-7 page papers emphasizing origi-
nal, creative, and convincing readings of the class texts.
No prerequisites. No familiarity with Japanese language or culture is required. No enrollment limit (ex-
pected: 15). Open to all.

JAPN 256(S) Confession and Deception in Japanese Literature (Same as Comparative
Literature 250) (W)*
Situated at the origins of Japanese literature are the beautiful and revealing diaries of ladies in waiting at the
tenth- and eleventh-century imperial court. Since that time, the Japanese literary tradition has valued con-
fessional writing of many kinds, from Sei Shônagon's Pillow Book and other classical and medieval dia-
ries to the haiku master Bashô's eighteenth-century travel journals. This continues into the modern period,
with authors like Mishima Yukio and Tanizaki Jun'ichirô writing novels that are sometimes thinly dis-
guised autobiographies, other times completely fictional diaries. We will look at a selection of these texts,
as well as some modern documentary film, and ask what it means for these authors to write from their own
experience, and also what new things we can reveal in their work by writing about it ourselves. This is a
writing-intensive class, in which students will practice developing interesting, original ideas about the liter-
ary texts and constructing convincing readings to support them. The class and the readings are in English.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: one in-class exam and two short papers, plus a number of short-
er writing and revision assignments related to the papers.
No prerequisites. No familiarity with Japanese language or culture is required. Enrollment limit: 19 (ex-
pected: 19).

JAPN 260(S) The Chrysanthemum and the Skyscraper: Japanese Theatre and its
Contemporary Context (Same as Comparative Literature 261)*
Japan's rich and varied performance traditions, old and new, born of different historical settings, coexist to
this day and compete for the attention of audiences, domestically and abroad. The forms to be considered
(Nohgaku, Kabuki, Bunraku, Shingeki and Butoh, among others) are all dynamic. Each has transformed
itself in response to evolving social conditions. This course examines these performance traditions, consid-
ers how each reflects the social, cultural, and political context of its birth, and poses the question: "Of what
relevance is this to a contemporary audience?" Some of the other questions we will explore include: How
have these performing traditions transformed themselves throughout history? What do we mean by `tradi-
tional' vs. `contemporary'? How are traditional and contemporary performance genres interacting with
each other? And how have the central themes of these works evolved? All readings and discussion will be
in English.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: active class participation, presentations, written journals, two
short papers, and one longer paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 17 (expected: 17). Open to all.

ASTRONOMY (Div. III)
Chair, Professor JAY M. PASACHOFF
Professors: KWITTER, J. PASACHOFF. Observatory Supervisor/Instructor: SOUZA.
How long will the Sun shine? Are there planets like Earth among the many circling other stars? How did
the universe begin and how has it evolved over its 14 billion-year history? Astronomy is the science that
asks and tries to answer questions like these. We have come a long way toward understanding what makes
the sky appear as it does and how the Universe is fashioned. The Astronomy Department offers courses for
anyone who is interested in learning about the Universe, and who would like to be able to follow new
astronomical discoveries as they are made. All courses in Astronomy satisfy the Division III requirement.
The Astrophysics major, administered jointly with the Physics Department, and the Astronomy major, are
described below.
The beginning astronomy courses are offered on two levels. Astronomy 101, 102, 104, and 330-range
courses are intended primarily for non-science majors, and have no prerequisite. Astronomy 111 is de-
signed for students with some exposure to or interest in physics. It has a prerequisite of one year of high
school physics or permission of the instructor, and a corequisite of Mathematics 104 or equivalent back-
ground in calculus.
Most of the astronomy courses take advantage of our observational and computational facilities includ-
ing a 24" computer-controlled telescope with sensitive electronic detectors, and our own computer net-
work for image processing and data analysis. The Astronomy Department homepage can be found at
http://www.williams.edu/Astronomy.
ASTROPHYSICS MAJOR
The Astrophysics major is designed for students who want a rigorous introduction to the field, and in-
cludes not only those who plan graduate study in astronomy, astrophysics, or a closely related area, but also
those interested in a wide variety of careers. Alumni are not only astronomers but also computer scientists,
geologists, teachers, doctors, lawyers, business school professors, and so on. In recent years, many astro-
physics majors have had a second major in fields as wide ranging as mathematics, geosciences, economics,
and art history. This major emphasizes the description of the Universe and its constituents in terms of
Astronomy, Astrophysics
­ 87 ­
physical processes. Potential Astrophysics majors should consult early with members of the Astronomy
and Physics Departments to determine their most appropriate route to and through the major. An essential
ingredient in such students' undergraduate training is experience in physics and mathematics. Therefore,
the major normally will begin in the first year a student is at Williams with Physics 131, 141, or 151 and
Mathematics 104 or 105 or 106 in the fall. Students with very good background placing them out of Phys-
ics 142 and out of Mathematics 104 may choose to take Physics 201 and Mathematics 105 or 106 instead.
Astronomy 111 will often be taken in the fall of the sophomore year; however, many students take it in the
fall of their first year at Williams, along with physics and math. Students who might place out of physics
courses should read the section on placement under Physics. Students who place out of Physics 131 or 141
into Physics 142 or 151 should particularly consider taking Astronomy 111 in the fall of their first year.
In addition to the major courses described below, other courses in geosciences, mathematics, and com-
puter science may also be appropriate.
MAJOR REQUIREMENTS FOR ASTROPHYSICS
Astronomy 111 Introduction to Astrophysics

The total number of courses required for the Astrophysics major, an interdisciplinary major, is eleven.
Students entering with Advanced Placement in physics and/or mathematics may obtain credit toward the
major for the equivalent of Physics 141 and/or Mathematics 104 and/or 105 or 106 taken elsewhere, but at
least 8 courses in astronomy, physics, and mathematics must be taken at Williams. There are some aspects
of astrophysics that are closely related to chemistry or geosciences. In recognition of this relation, certain
advanced courses in those departments can be accepted for credit toward the Astrophysics major on a two-
for-one basis. It is not possible to double major in Astrophysics and Physics.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN ASTROPHYSICS
The honors degree in Astrophysics will be awarded on the basis of a senior thesis presenting the results
of an original observational, experimental, or theoretical investigation carried out by the student under the
direction of a faculty member in Astronomy or Physics. There are no specific grade requirements (other
than College-wide requirements for remaining in good academic standing) for entry into the thesis research
program; however, a student wishing to do a thesis should have demonstrated both ability and motivation
for independent work in previous courses and in any earlier research involvement. Students doing theses
will normally choose a topic and an advisor early in the second semester of their junior year and usually
begin their thesis work during the summer. During the senior year, those students whose proposals have
been approved will elect two courses and a winter study project in addition to the minimum requirements
for the major. Preparation for the thesis will occupy at least one course (Astrophysics 493) and the winter
study project (Astrophysics 031). At the end of the winter study period, the departments will decide, in
consultation with each student, whether to admit that student to honors candidacy. Both a written thesis and
an oral presentation to faculty and fellow students are required. The degree with honors will be awarded to
those who meet these requirements with distinction. The degree with highest honors will be awarded to
those who fulfill the requirements with unusually high distinction.
Astronomy, Astrophysics
­ 88 ­
The departments will be flexible with regard to the number and timing of courses devoted to thesis re-
search within the general guidelines of two courses and a winter study project over and above the mini-
mum major requirements and the written and oral presentations, especially in cases of students with ad-
vanced standing and/or summer research experience. Students considering unusual requests are urged to
consult with potential advisors or the department chairs as early as possible.
ASTRONOMY MAJOR
The Astronomy major is designed for students with an interest in learning about many aspects of mod-
ern astronomy, but who do not choose to take the advanced physics courses of the astrophysics major. It is
also appropriate as a second major for students concentrating in another field. The Astronomy major em-
phasizes understanding the observed properties of the physical systems that comprise the known Universe,
from the Sun and solar system, to the evolution of stars and star clusters, to the Milky Way Galaxy, to
external galaxies and clusters of galaxies. Because some knowledge of physics and calculus is necessary to
understand many astronomical phenomena, the Astronomy major requires the first two semesters each of
the physics and calculus that are also required of Physics majors and Astrophysics majors.
There are several possible routes through the Astronomy major, depending on preparation and interest.
Students considering a major in Astronomy should consult with members of the department early and
often. A first-year student, unsure about choosing between Astronomy and Astrophysics, may wish to take
not only Astronomy 111 but also Physics 131, 141, or 151 and Mathematics 104 (if necessary) in the fall.
Students who might place out of physics courses should read the section on placement under Physics.

and/or Mathematics 105 or 106 taken elsewhere. There are some aspects of astronomy that are closely
related to chemistry or geosciences. In recognition of this, certain advanced courses in those departments
can be accepted for credit toward the Astronomy major.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN ASTRONOMY
The honors degree in Astronomy will be awarded on the basis of a senior thesis presenting the results of
an original observational, experimental, or theoretical investigation carried out by the student under the
direction of a faculty member in Astronomy. There are no specific grade requirements (other than College-
wide requirements for remaining in good academic standing) for entry into the thesis research program;
however, a student wishing to do a thesis should have demonstrated both ability and motivation for inde-
pendent work in previous courses and in any earlier research involvement. Students doing theses will nor-
mally choose a topic and an advisor early in the second semester of their junior year and usually begin their
thesis work during the summer. During the senior year, those students whose proposals have been ap-
proved will elect two courses and a winter study project in addition to the minimum requirements for the

ASTRONOMY COURSES
COURSES FOR NON-MAJORS WITH NO PREREQUISITES
ASTR 101(F) Stars: From Suns to Black Holes
What makes a star shine? For how long will the Sun keep shining? What are black holes and how can they
form? Astronomy 101, a non-major, general introduction to the part of contemporary astronomy that in-
cludes how stars form and how they end their existence, will provide answers to these questions and more.
The course gives special attention to the exciting discoveries of the past few years. Topics include modern
astronomical instruments such as the Hubble Space Telescope, the Spitzer Space Telescope, the Chandra
X-ray Observatory, the new generation of 8- and 10-meter mountaintop telescopes, and results from them;
how astronomers interpret the light received from distant celestial objects; the Sun as a typical star (and
how its future will affect ours); and our modern understanding of how stars work and how they change
with time. We will also discuss how pulsars and black holes result from the evolution of normal, massive
stars and how giant black holes are at the center of galaxies and quasars. We will discuss the discovery of
planets around stars other than the Sun. This course is independent of and on the same level as Astronomy
102 and 104, though students who have taken those courses are welcome.
Observing sessions will include use of the 24 telescope and other telescopes for observations of stars, star
clusters, planets and their moons, nebulae, and galaxies, as well as daytime observations of the Sun.
Format: lecture (three hours per week), observing sessions (scattered throughout the semester), afternoon
labs (four times per semester), and a planetarium demonstration. Evaluation will be based on two hour
tests, a final exam, an observing portfolio, and laboratory reports.

What makes Earth different from all the other planets? Did Mars ever have running water? What is Pluto?
Will asteroids or comets collide with the Earth? What is a solar eclipse like? Astronomy 102, a non-major,
general introduction to the part of contemporary astronomy that comprises the study of the solar system,
will provide answers to these questions and more. We will cover the historical development of humanity's
understanding of the solar system, examining contributions by Aristotle, Ptolemy, Copernicus, Galileo,
Newton, and others. We will discuss the discovery of planets around stars other than the Sun. The course
gives special attention to exciting discoveries of the past few years by space probes and by the Hubble

moved the sun into the center. Galileo's breakthrough observations of the sky with the new-fangled tele-
scope led to hundreds of years of improving observations. In a seminar format, week by week, we will
discuss each of the following topics (and look at original first-editions in the Chapin Library): Copernicus
and rare-book variations and annotations; Galileo and his discoveries; mapping the sky and constellations
1540 to the present through star atlases; William and Caroline Herschel and the discovery of a new planet;
asteroids from 1 Ceres to 5100 Pasachoff, contemporary surveys, the extinction of the dinosaurs, and pos-
sible dangers to the Earth and its inhabitants; astronomy teaching from when Williams College students
first built its Hopkins Observatory through the Committee of Ten to the Journal of Astronomy Education
Research; planetariums from pasted stars to optomechnical and digital 21st-century projection; woman
astronomers and astronauts and their reception and roles; transits of Venus: from Horrocks and Capt. Cook
through the 2004/2012 pair; the launch of Sputnik and the race to the Moon; the formation of NASA and
its transformation through space shuttles and the International Space Station; the past, present, and future of
the Hubble Space Telescope; NASA's "Great Observatories," including not only Hubble but also the
Astronomy, Astrophysics
­ 90 ­
Chandra X-ray Observatory and the Spitzer Space Telescope; NASA's "Vision" of sending astronauts to
the Moon and Mars; advances in ground-based observatories and telescopes; mapping the Universe
through projects like the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and 2dF; and the discovery that the Universe's expan-
sion is accelerating and its ramifications. We consider the role of individual leadership in the various topics.
Format: seminar, one three-hour meeting a week. Planetarium demonstration, with individual planetarium
work on request. Evaluation will be based on two 10-page papers and participation in discussions.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 10). Preference will be given to juniors and seniors and
to those with backgrounds in science, history of science, or philosophy. Non-major course. Does not count
toward the Astronomy, Astrophysics, or Physics major.

ASTR 402(F) Between the Stars: The Interstellar Medium (W)
The matter between the stars--the interstellar medium--manifests itself in many interesting and
unexpected ways, and, as the detritus of stars, its properties and behavior hold clues to the history and
future evolution of both stars and the galaxies that contain them. Stars are accompanied by diffuse matter
all through their lifetimes, from their birthplaces in dense molecular clouds, to the stellar winds they eject
with varying ferocity as they evolve, to their final fates as they shed their outer layers, whether as planetary
nebulae or dazzling supernovae. As these processes go on, they enrich the interstellar medium with the
products of the stars' nuclear fusion. The existence of life on Earth is eloquent evidence of this chemical
enrichment.
In this course we will study the interstellar medium in its various forms. We will discuss many of the
physical mechanisms that produce the radiation we observe from diffuse matter, including radiative
ionization and recombination, collisional excitation of "forbidden" lines, collisional ionization, and
synchrotron radiation. This course will be both writing- and observing-intensive. Weekly short papers will
be assigned; these papers will be thoroughly edited by the professor and returned so that comments can be
absorbed for future submissions. In class, students will present key ideas from the assigned reading and
will solve relevant problems. Throughout the semester students will also work in small groups to design,
carry out, analyze, and critique their own observations of the interstellar medium using the equipment on
our observing deck.

Bioinformatics, genomics, and proteomics are rapidly advancing fields that integrate the tools and
knowledge from biology, chemistry, computer science, mathematics, physics, and statistics in research at
the intersection of the biological and informational sciences. Inspired by the enormous amount of biologi-
cal data that are being generated from the sequencing of genomes, these new fields will help us pose and
answer biological questions that have long been considered too complex to address. Research in genomics,
proteomics, and bioinformatics will also significantly impact society affecting medicine, culture, econom-
ics, and politics.
The Bioinformatics, Genomics, and Proteomics curriculum involves faculty from the biology, chemis-
try, computer science, mathematics/statistics, and physics departments and was designed to provide stu-
dents with an understanding of these revolutionary new areas of investigation. The introductory level
courses, Computation and biology and Statistics for Biologists are accessible to all students interested in
gaining familiarity with the power of genomic analysis. Students interested in graduate work in bioinfor-
matics, genomics, and proteomics should take the core courses and five of the recommended courses. In-
terested students are also encouraged to participate in independent research with members of the advisory
faculty as they explore the development of these new fields.

Biochemistry and molecular biology are dynamic fields that lie at the forefront of science. Through elu-
cidation of the structure and function of biologically important molecules (such as nucleic acids, lipids,
proteins, and carbohydrates) these disciplines have provided important insights and advances in the fields
of molecular engineering (recombinant DNA technology, "intelligent" drug design, "in vitro evolution"),
genomics and proteomics, signal transduction, immunology, developmental biology, and evolution.
The Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Program is designed to provide students with an opportunity
to explore living systems in molecular terms. Biochemistry and molecular biology are at the interface be-
tween the chemical and biological methods of looking at nature; therefore, the program draws heavily
from these disciplines. While chemistry is concerned with the relationship between molecular structure
and reactions, and biology focuses on cells and organisms, biochemistry and molecular biology probe the
details of the structures and interactions of molecules in living systems in order to provide the foundation
for a better understanding of biological molecules both individually and as members of more complex
structures.
PROGRAM
While aspects of biochemistry and molecular biology can be very diverse, a common set of chemical
and biological principles underlie the more advanced topics. With this in mind, the program has been struc-
tured to provide the necessary background in chemistry and biology and the opportunity to study the many
facets of the modern areas of the biochemical sciences. Students interested in the Biochemistry and Molec-
ular Biology Program should plan their course selection carefully. Since it is expected that Biochemistry
321 and 322 would be taken in the junior year, students are advised to take the prerequisites for those
courses in both chemistry and biology during their first two years at Williams. While the program is open
to all students, it is expected that it will appeal primarily to majors in biology and chemistry because of the
number of courses required in those fields. In addition to taking the required courses, students planning to
complete the Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Program are strongly encouraged to elect courses in
mathematics and physics.
The following interdepartmental courses serve as the core of the Biochemistry and Molecular Biology
Program.
BIMO 321 and 322 provide a comprehensive introduction to biochemistry. BIMO 322 is a new require-
ment and applies to 2007 graduates and beyond. BIMO 401, the capstone course for the concentration,
provides students the opportunity to examine the current scientific literature in a wide variety of BIMO-re-
lated research areas.
BIMO 321(F) Biochemistry I--Structure and Function of Biological Molecules (Same as
Biology 321 and Chemistry 321)
This course introduces the basic concepts of biochemistry with an emphasis on the structure and function
of biological macromolecules. Specifically, the structure of proteins and nucleic acids are examined in de-
tail in order to determine how their chemical properties and their biological behavior result from those
structures. Other topics covered include enzyme kinetics, mechanism and catalysis and regulation; the mo-
lecular organization of biomembranes and membrane transport; and the principles of recombinant DNA
technologies. In addition, the principles and applications of the methods used to characterize macromole-
cules in solution and the interactions between macromolecules are discussed. The laboratory provides an
opportunity to study the structure of macromolecules and to learn the fundamental experimental tech-
niques of biochemistry including electrophoresis and chromatography.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, four hours per week. Evaluation will be based on three
hour exams, a final exam, problem sets and performance in the laboratories including lab reports.
Prerequisites: Chemistry 251/255 and Biology 101. No enrollment limit (expected: 25).
Hour: 10:00-10:50 MWF Lab: 1-5 M,W KAPLAN
BIMO 322(S) Biochemistry II--Metabolism (Same as Biology 322 and Chemistry 322) (Q)
This lecture course provides an in-depth presentation of the complex metabolic reactions which are central
to life. Emphasis is placed on the biological flow of energy including alternative modes of energy genera-
tion (aerobic, anaerobic, photosynthetic); the regulation and integration of the metabolic pathways includ-
ing compartmentalization and the transport of metabolites; and biochemical reaction mechanisms includ-
ing the structures and mechanisms of coenzymes. This comprehensive study also includes the biosynthesis
and catabolism of small molecules (carbohydrates, lipids, amino acids, and nucleotides). Laboratory ex-
periments introduce the principles and procedures used to study enzymatic reactions, bioenergetics, and
metabolic pathways.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, four hours per week. Evaluation will be based on several
exams, an oral presentation, and performance in the laboratories including lab reports that emphasize con-
Biochemistry and Molecular Biology

ceptual and mathematics analysis of the data generated.
Prerequisites: Biology 101 and Chemistry 251/255. No enrollment limit (expected: 36).
Hour: 10:00-10:50 MWF Lab: 1-5 M,W SWOAP
BIMO 401(S) Topics in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology
This seminar course involves a critical reading, analysis, and discussion of papers from the current bio-
chemistry and molecular biology literature. Specific topics vary from year to year but are chosen to illus-
trate the importance of a wide range of both biological and chemical approaches to addressing important
questions in the biochemical and molecular biological fields.
Format: seminar, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on class discussions and presentations,
several short papers, and a final paper.
Prerequisites: Biology 202 and BIMO 321. Enrollment limit: 12 (expected: 8). Preference given to those
completing the BIMO program; open to others with permission of instructors.
Hour: TBA LOVETT and DEWITT
To complete the concentration in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, a student must complete all of the
required courses listed below, take one elective not within the student's major from the list below, and at-
tend at least eight Biology and/or Chemistry Department colloquia. Since the Chemistry Department
counts two biology courses and the Biology Department counts two chemistry courses toward the majors
(each of which can be completed with only eight other courses), a student majoring in either chemistry or
biology would have to take only two or three additional courses to complete the program.

Chair, Professor MARSHA ALTSCHULER
Professors: ALTSCHULER, ART, DEWITT, J. EDWARDS**, D. LYNCH, H. WILLIAMS, ZOT-
TOLI. Associate Professors: RAYMOND**, ROSEMAN, SAVAGE, SWOAP. Visiting As-

SON, MORALES, TING, WILDER. Professor of Marine Science for the Williams-Mystic Pro-
gram: CARLTON. Instructors: DEAN, MACINTIRE.
The Biology curriculum has been designed to provide students with a broad base for understanding
principles governing life processes at all levels, from biochemistry and cell biology to physiology to ecolo-
gy and behavior. Courses emphasize fundamentals common to all subdisciplines including the coupling of
structure to function, the transfer of energy in living systems, communication, and the molding of diversity
by the evolutionary process. In upper-level courses and in independent and honors research, students have
the opportunity to investigate areas at the frontiers of modern biology.
Although the Biology major is specifically designed to provide a balanced curriculum in the broader
context of the liberal arts, it is also excellent preparation for graduate studies in the life sciences and in the
health professions.
MAJOR REQUIREMENTS
In order to make the major accessible to students with diverse interests, required courses are kept to a
minimum. The Biology major is satisfied by nine courses, as follows:
Biology 101 The Cell
Biology 102 The Organism
Biology 202 Genetics
Any two 300-level courses, each of which must have a laboratory associated with it.
Any one 400-level course other than 493-494.
Any other three courses or any other two courses and two semesters of Organic Chemistry.
NOTE: Independent study courses and AMS 311 (Same as Biology 231) do not fulfill the 300-level or
400-level course requirements. Both WIOX 215, Biology: Ecology of Flowering Plants, and WIOX 216,
Biology: Evolution, in the Williams Oxford Program qualify for major credit.
Distribution Requirement
In order to ensure that majors broaden their knowledge of biology, one of the elective courses for the
major must include an upper-level course covering biological processes at levels of organization above the
cell. Courses that satisfy this distribution requirement are indicated in the individual course description.
COURSE SELECTION AND PLACEMENT
It is preferable for students who plan to major in biology, or think they may be interested in doing so, to
take Biology 101, 102 during their first year at Williams. It is also possible to begin the Biology major
during the sophomore year, although students should understand that it may require taking two or more
biology courses during several semesters.
Students interested in biology, whether or not they intend to major in it, are encouraged to take Biology
101, 102. It is also possible, with permission of the instructor, to take Biology 203 Ecology, Biology 204
Animal Behavior, Biology 220 Field Botany and Biology 225 Natural History of the Berkshires without
prerequisite. Other biology courses designed specifically for students who do not intend to take additional
upper-level courses in biology include Biology 134 The Tropics: Biology and Social Issues and Biology
133 Biology of Exercise and Nutrition. All of these courses satisfy the Division III distribution requirement;
in addition, Biology 134 satisfies the Peoples and Cultures distribution requirement.
Beginning students should normally enroll in Biology 101 and 102. Students with unusually strong
backgrounds in biology, such as those with outstanding performance on the College Board Biology Ad-
vanced Placement Test, may be permitted to elect a sophomore-level course in lieu of Biology 101 and/or
Biology 102 upon successful completion of a departmental qualifying exam, administered during First
Days.
COURSES RELATED TO THE BIOLOGY MAJOR
Students planning to pursue their interest in biology and related fields after completing their undergradu-
ate degrees are strongly encouraged to take one year of chemistry, at least one semester of mathematics (a
course in statistics is recommended), and one semester of physics. Students may wish to check the require-
ments for graduate admission at relevant universities, and are also encouraged to consult with the Biology
Department's graduate school advisor about prerequisites for admission to graduate programs.
BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
Students interested in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (BIMO) should consult the general state-
ment under Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.
BIOINFORMATICS, GENOMICS AND PROTEOMICS
Students interested in Bioinformatics, Genomics and Proteomics (BiGP) should consult the general
statement under Bioinformatics, Genomics and Proteomics. Biology majors interested in this field are
Biology
­ 95 ­
strongly encouraged to enroll in Life as an Algorithm (Computer Science 106/Biology 106) and Integrative
Bioinformatics, Genomics, and Proteomics (Biology 319).
NEUROSCIENCE
Students interested in Neuroscience (NSCI) should consult the general statement under Neuroscience.
ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
Students interested in Environmental Studies (ENVI) should consult the general statement under Envi-
ronmental Studies.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN BIOLOGY
In order to be recommended for the degree with honors, a Biology major is normally expected to have
completed the equivalent of two semesters and a winter study (031) of independent research culminating in
a thesis which demonstrates outstanding achievement of an original and innovative nature. Although the
presentation of a thesis and associated oral presentation in the fall and poster defense in the spring are re-
quired for consideration for a degree with honors, their completion should not be interpreted as a guarantee
of a degree with honors. The principal considerations in admitting a student to the program of independent
honors research will be mastery of fundamental material and skills, ability to pursue independent study
successfully, and demonstrated interest and motivation. Students interested in participating in the honors
program should consult with the department early in the spring semester of the junior year; approval must
be received before spring registration in the junior year.
The minimum course requirements for a degree with honors in Biology are Biology 101, Biology 102,
Biology 202, two 300-level biology courses (each of which must have a laboratory associated with it), one
400-level biology course, Biology 493, Biology 494, WSP 031, and any other two courses in biology (or
any other one course and two semesters of Organic Chemistry).
In addition to the normal honors route, which includes two semesters (Biology 493-494) and a winter
study of research (WSP 031) during senior year, students have the option, subject to the approval of their
thesis advisor, to begin the honors research during winter study junior year or during the second semester
junior year. Students beginning honors in winter study of junior year would take Biology 494 in the spring
of their junior year followed by Biology 493 in the fall of their senior year; students beginning honors
during the second semester of junior year would take Biology 494 that semester, followed by Biology 493
in the fall of senior year and winter study research in the winter of the senior year.
CREDIT FOR COURSES AT OTHER INSTITUTIONS
Students who enroll in study away programs may receive credit for up to two 200-level electives to-
wards the biology major upon approval of the course syllabi by the Biology Department's study abroad
coordinator.
Students wishing to satisfy prerequisites for courses offered by the Biology Department with courses
taken at other institutions should consult, in person, with a member of the Biology Department, prior to
registering for the course that requires a prerequisite. Such consultations will include a review of the course
syllabi and the transcripts of the relevant previous college work, and students should bring these materials
with them.
BIOL 101(F) The Cell

BIOL 133(F) Biology of Exercise and Nutrition
This class, intended for the non-scientist, focuses on the impact of exercise and nutrition on the human
body. We will discuss topics such as how different types of training influence exercise performance; the
changes that occur in the cardiovascular system during an exercise routine; the inherent limits of the body
to perform aerobic and anaerobic tasks; and long-term health consequences of a lifetime of activity or
inactivity. We will also examine how nutrition and metabolism affect body composition. For example, we
will rigorously and scientifically scrutinize the use of "fad" diets as a means to lose weight.
Format: course work will consist of lectures and six hands-on laboratory exercises. Evaluation will be
based on exams and lab reports.

BIOL 202(F) Genetics (Q)
Genetics, classically defined as the study of heredity, has evolved into a discipline whose limits are contin-
ually expanded by innovative molecular technologies. This course covers the experimental basis for our
current understanding of the inheritance, structures, and functions of genes. It introduces approaches used
by contemporary geneticists and molecular biologists to explore questions about aspects of biology rang-
ing from embryonic development to aging. The laboratory part of the course provides an experimental
introduction to modern genetic analysis. Laboratory experiments include linkage analysis, bacterial trans-
formation with plasmids, DNA restriction mapping, and computer-based cloning.
Format: lecture/laboratory, six hours per week. Evaluation will be based on biweekly problem sets, weekly
laboratory exercises and laboratory reports, and three examinations; 90% of the final grade is determined
by performance on written exercises and exams.
Prerequisites: Biology 101 and 102. No enrollment limit (expected: 85).

the distribution and abundance of plants and animals in natural systems. The course begins with an overall
view of global patterns and then builds from the population to the ecosystem level. An emphasis is given to
basic ecological principles and relates them to current environmental issues. Selected topics include popu-
lation dynamics (competition, predation, mutalism); community interactions (succession, food chains and
diversity) and ecosystem function (biogeochemical cycles, energy flow).
Format: lecture/laboratory, six hours per week. Evaluation will be based on problem sets, lab reports, hour
exams, and a final exam.

BIOL 204(S) Animal Behavior
Making sense of what we see while watching animals closely is both an enthralling pastime and a
discipline that draws on many aspects of biology. Explanations can be found on many levels: evolutionary
theory tells us why certain patterns have come to exist, molecular biology can help us understand how
those patterns are implemented, neuroscience gives insights as to how the world appears to the behaving
animal, endocrinology provides information on how suites of behaviors are regulated. The first part of the
course focuses upon how descriptive studies provide the basis for formulating questions about behavior as
well as the statistical methods used to evaluate the answers to these questions. We then consider the
behavior of individuals, both as it is mediated by biological mechanisms and as it appears from an
evolutionary perspective. The second half of the course is primarily concerned with the behaviors of
groups of animals from a wide variety of vertebrate and invertebrate species, concentrating upon the
stimuli, responses, and internal mechanisms that maintain social systems and on the selection pressures
that drive animals toward a particular social system.

BIOL 206T(S) Genomes, Transcriptomes and Proteomes (W)
While determining the complete DNA sequences of organisms continues at an impressive pace, a suffi-
cient number of eukaryotic and prokaryotic genomes have been sequenced to consider what has been
learned, and, more importantly, what do we hope to learn in the post-genomic era. This tutorial course,
intended for sophomores, examines the progress and limitations of genome analyses in enhancing our un-
derstanding of biology, as well as more recent investigations employing DNA, RNA and protein sequence
information to gain insights into fundamental biological processes. Initially in the course, the experimental
approaches and tools used to obtain and analyze DNA sequences are considered. Subsequently, topics
based on recent articles exploring (i) comparative genomic analyses, (ii) genome-wide changes in expres-
sion and mRNA levels (transcriptomes), and (iii) efforts to analyze proteomes and protein-protein interac-
tions in cells are examined.
The format includes two meetings per week, one general group meeting and one tutorial meeting between
two students and the instructor. Evaluation is based on five tutorial papers (4-5 pages each), five critiques,
tutorial presentations and general participation.

Developmental biology has undergone rapid growth in recent years and is becoming a central organizing
discipline that links cells and molecular biology, evolution, anatomy and medicine. We are now beginning
to have a molecular understanding of fascinating questions such as how cells decide their fate, how
patterns are created, how male and females are distinguished, and how organisms came to be different. We
have also discovered how the misregulation of important development regulatory genes can lead to a
variety of known cancers and degenerative diseases in humans. In this course we will examine these and
related topics combining a rich classical literature with modern genetic and molecular analyses.

BIOL 308(F) Integrative Plant Biology: Fundamentals and New Frontiers
Plants are one of the most successful groups of organisms on Earth and have a profound impact on all life.
Successful use of plants in addressing global problems and understanding their role in natural ecosystems
depends on fundamental knowledge of the molecular mechanisms by which they grow, develop, and re-
spond to their environment. This course will examine the molecular physiology of plants using an integra-
tive approach that considers plants as dynamic, functional units in their environment. Major emphasis will
be on understanding fundamental plant processes, such as photosynthesis, growth and development, water
transport, hormone physiology, and flowering, from the molecular to the organismal level. Environmental
effects on these processes will be addressed in topics including photomorphogenesis, stress physiology,
mineral nutrition, and plant-microbe interactions. Frequent discussions of original research papers will ex-
amine the mechanisms plants use to perform these processes and explore advances in the genetic engineer-
ing of plants for agricultural, environmental, and medical purposes. Laboratory activities stress modern
approaches and techniques used in investigating plant physiological processes.

BIOL 310(S) Neural Development
Development can be seen as a tradeoff between genetically-determined processes and environmental stim-
uli. The tension between these two inputs is particularly apparent in the developing nervous system, where
many events must be predetermined, and where plasticity, or altered outcomes in response to environmen-
tal conditions, is also essential. Plasticity is reduced as development and differentiation proceed, and the
potential for regeneration after injury or disease in adults is limited; however, some exceptions to this rule
exist, and recent data suggest that the nervous system is not as hard-wired as previously thought. In this
course we will discuss the mechanisms governing nervous system development, from relatively simple
nervous systems such as that of the roundworm, to the more complicated nervous systems of humans,
examining the roles played by genetically specified programs and non-genetic influences.
Format: lecture/discussion/laboratory, six hours per week. Evaluation will be based on exams, short papers
and lab reports.

What can computational biology teach us about cancer? In this capstone experience for the Genomics,
Proteomics, and Bioinformatics program, computational analysis and wet-lab investigations will inform
each other, as students majoring in biology, chemistry, computer science, mathematics/statistics, and phys-
ics contribute their own expertise to explore how ever-growing gene and protein data-sets can provide key
insights into human disease. In this course, we will take advantage of one well-studied system, the highly
conserved Ras-related family of proteins, which play a central role in numerous fundamental processes
within the cell. The course will integrate bioinformatics and molecular biology, using database searching,
alignments and pattern matching, and recombinant DNA techniques to reconstruct the evolution of the
RAS gene family by focusing on the gene duplication events and gene rearrangements that have occurred
over the course of eukaryotic speciation. By utilizing high through-put approaches to investigate genes
involved in various signal transduction pathways, students will identify pathways that are aberrantly acti-
vated in mammalian cell lines carrying a mutant, constantly active Ras protein. This functional genomic
strategy will be coupled with microscopic examination of tissue sections from a variety of human colon
tumors, using phosphorylation-state specific antisera, to test our hypotheses. Proteomic analysis will
introduce the students to de novo structural prediction and threading algorithms, as well as data-mining
approaches to identify specific amino acids involved in protein-protein contacts. Site-directed mutagenesis
and mass spectrometry will be used to study networks of interacting proteins in normal colon and colon
tumor tissue.
Format: lab, with one-hour of lecture per week. Evaluation will be based on lab participation and several

ation. The course will draw heavily upon the experiences that students have had in other biology courses.
Topics will include: the relationships among diversity, ecosystem function, sustainability, resilience, and
stability of biological resource systems, nutrient pools and processing in human-dominated ecosystems.
Four field trips will be taken to biological resource sites in the region. These experiences will serve as
introductions to readings and the topics of papers to be written by student participants. Each student will
write four papers that deal with questions requiring extensive reading of primary resources. Paper presenta-
tions will alternate with serving as a critic of other student papers. Students will be given the opportunity to

BIOL 413(S) Molecular Basis of Biological Clocks
Circadian rhythms have been described in all organisms studied, including humans, a wide range of other
eukaryotes and several prokaryotes. With periods of about 24 hours, these rhythms regulate biochemical,
cellular, physiological and behavioral activities. Circadian rhythms are generated by cellular clocks--
genetically determined internal pacemakers that maintain their oscillations in the absence of environmental
cues but may be reset by periodicities in the environment, especially the light-dark cycle. Only recently
have we begun to understand how circadian rhythms are generated and controlled at the cellular level. This
course will explore the basic biochemical features of biological clocks with the aim of understanding their
crucial role in regulating key biological parameters, such as enzyme levels, levels of hormones and other
regulatory molecules, and activity and sleep cycles. Class discussions will focus on readings in the original
literature. Format: discussion, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on class participation and
several short papers.

BIOL 414(F) Life at Extremes: Molecular Mechanisms
All organisms face variability in their environments, and the molecular and cellular responses to stresses
induced by environmental change often illuminate otherwise hidden facets of normal physiology. More-
over, many organisms have evolved unique molecular mechanisms, such as novel cellular compounds or
macromolecular structural modifications, which contribute to their ability to survive continuous exposure
to extreme conditions, such as high temperatures or low pH. This course will examine how chaperonins,
proteases, and heat- and cold-shock proteins are regulated in response to changes in the external environ-
ment. We will then consider how these and other molecular mechanisms function to stabilize DNA and
proteins -and, ultimately, cells and organisms. Other extreme environments, such as hydrothermal vents on
the ocean floor, snow fields, hypersaline lakes, the intertidal zone, and acid springs provide further exam-
ples of cellular and molecular responses to extreme conditions. Biotechnological applications of these mo-
lecular mechanisms in areas such as protein engineering will also be considered. Class discussions will
focus upon readings from the primary literature.

BIOL 416(S) Epigenetics
After decades of studies emphasizing the role of DNA in heredity, scientists are now turning their attention
from genetics to a variety of heritable phenomena that fall under the heading of epigenetics, heritable
changes that do not result from an alteration in DNA sequence. Research reveals that stable changes in cell
function can result from, for example, stable changes in protein conformation, protein modification, DNA
methylation, or the location of a molecule within the cell. Using readings from the primary literature, we
will explore the epigenetic nature and molecular mechanisms underlying a diverse array of phenomena
such as prion propagation, genetic imprinting, dosage compensation, transvection, centromere formation,
synapse function, and programmed genome rearrangements. The significance of epigenetic processes for
development, evolution, and human health will be discussed.
Format: discussion, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on class participation and several short

evolution. In this course we will discuss current issues in evolutionary genetics including the molecular
basis of adaptation and diversification, genome evolution, the genetics of speciation, and the interpretation
of population genetic patterns of variation. Class discussions will focus on readings from current primary
literature.

MAJOR
Through a variety of individual courses and sequential programs, the department provides an opportuni-
ty for students to explore the nature and significance of chemistry, an area of important achievement in our
quest for knowledge about ourselves and the world around us. The student of chemistry is able to become
aware of the special viewpoint of chemists, the general nature of chemical investigation, some of its impor-
tant results, how these results are expressed, and something of their significance within the fields of science
and in the area of human endeavor as a whole.
A major in chemistry can be achieved in several ways, preferably beginning in the student's first year at
Williams, but also beginning in the sophomore year. Building on a foundation in general chemistry, organ-
Chemistry
­ 102 ­
ic chemistry, and physical chemistry, a student elects additional advanced courses to complete a major that
is consistent with his or her background in other sciences, interests, and goals. A student's program might
emphasize biochemistry, organic chemistry, physical chemistry, or inorganic chemistry, with additional
courses available in analytical chemistry, environmental science, and materials science. Students consider-
ing a major in chemistry should consult with a member of the department as early as possible in order to
plan a program which best suits their interests and abilities and which makes full use of their previous
preparation.
Usually the requirements for the major are fulfilled by completing "Required Courses" and the ap-
propriate number of "Elective Courses." Starting at the 300 level, at least three of the courses taken must
have a laboratory component. In addition, the department has a number of "Independent Research
Courses" which, while they do not count toward completion of the major, provide a unique opportunity to
pursue an independent research project under the direction of a faculty member.

aAll students begin their study in the department with either Chemistry 151, 153, or 155. Placement at the
introductory level is based upon performance on the departmental placement test results and consultation
with the chair; results of the College Board Advanced Placement Test or the International Baccalaureate
Exam are also taken into account. The first year is completed with Chemistry 156. In the second year at
the introductory level, students take Chemistry 251 (or 255) and Chemistry 256 (those students who com-
plete 155 are exempted from 256).
bStudents wishing to pursue a research-based version of the laboratory program in Chemistry 251 may
elect 255 after consultation with the chair.
cChemistry 256 is the fourth course in the Department's Introductory-level sequence. This course is a pre-
requisite (or co-requisite) for all Quantitative and Advanced-level electives.
dTo complete the major in Chemistry, students must elect any one of Chemistry 361, 364, 366, or 367. The
course elected, in consultation with the chair or major advisor, will depend on the student's future plans.
eChemistry 361 and 366 are strongly recommended for anyone considering graduate school in chemistry.
fChemistry 367 and 324 are strongly recommended for anyone considering graduate school in biochemis-
try.
gThe Chemistry major requires either nine semester chemistry courses or eight semester chemistry courses
plus two approved courses from among the following: Biology 101, 102; Computer Science 134; Mathe-
matics 103, 104, 105; Physics 131, 132; or any courses in these departments for which the approved
courses are prerequisites. No more than two advanced-level organic courses may be counted toward
completion of the major.
Completion of any one of the advanced-level elective courses will satisfy the College requirement that a
student complete a major seminar.

For the purpose of assisting students in selecting a program consistent with their interests, the following
groupings of electives and faculty advisors are suggested. However, a case can be made for selecting
courses from the different groups.
Biochemistry: Chemistry 321, Chemistry 322, Chemistry 324, Chemistry 341, Chemistry 342, Chemis-
try 344, Chemistry 367, Chemistry 436T, Chemistry 464T (Students interested in biochemistry should
consult with Ms. Gehring, Mr. Kaplan, or Mr. Lovett.)
Organic Chemistry: Chemistry 324, Chemistry 341, Chemistry 342, Chemistry 344, Chemistry 346
(Students interested in organic chemistry should consult with Ms. Goh, Mr. Markgraf, Mr. Richardson,
or Mr. Smith.)
Physical and Inorganic Chemistry: Chemistry 332, Chemistry 335, Chemistry 361, Chemistry 364,
Chemistry 366, Chemistry 368, Chemistry 436T, Chemistry 464T (Students interested in physical
chemistry should consult with Mr. Bingemann, Mr. Chang, Mr. Peacock-López, or Mr. Thoman. Stu-
dents interested in inorganic chemistry should consult with Mr. Hasanayn or Ms. Park. Students inter-
ested in materials science should consult with Ms. Goh or Ms. Park.)
The Chemistry major provides excellent preparation for graduate study in chemistry, biochemistry,
chemical engineering, environmental science, medicine, and the medical sciences. The major can also be
useful to those whose later professional or business careers may be related to chemical materials or pro-
cesses. While any accepted route through the major would permit a student to proceed to graduate study in
chemistry, three electives should be considered a minimum, and the particular importance of Chemistry
321, 335, 361, 364, and 366 as preparation for advanced study should be noted. In addition, at least a se-
mester of research and courses in computer science are strongly recommended.
Students with principal interests outside of the sciences may extend a secondary school foundation in
chemistry by electing a basic two-semester introductory course of a general nature or they may elect se-
mester courses designed for non-majors. All courses in chemistry satisfy the distribution requirement.
The department is accredited by the American Chemical Society (A.C.S.), a professional body of aca-
demic, industrial, and research chemists. The A.C.S. suggests the following courses for someone consider-
ing graduate study or work in chemistry or a related area. Students completing these courses are designated
Certified A.C.S. Majors: 151 (153 or 155), 156, 251 (255), 256, 335, 361, 364, 366, 493-494; and at least
two courses from 321, 322, 342, 344, 368, BIMO 401.
BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
Students interested in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology should consult with the general statement
under Biochemistry and Molecular Biology in the Courses of Instruction. Students interested in biochem-
istry are also encouraged to complete the biochemistry courses within the chemistry major by taking 321,
322, 324, and 367 in addition to the first and second year required courses.
BIOINFORMATICS, GENOMICS, AND PROTEOMICS
Students interested in Bioinformatics, Genomics, and Proteomics should consult the general statement
under Bioinformatics, Genomics, and Proteomics in the Courses of Instruction. Students interested in these
areas are also encouraged to complete the biochemistry courses within the chemistry major by taking 319,
321, 322, 324 and 367 in addition to the first and second year required courses.
MATERIALS SCIENCE
Students interested in Materials Science are encouraged to elect courses from the Materials Science pro-
gram offered jointly with the Physics Department, and should consult the information on page 221 describ-
ing this option.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN CHEMISTRY
The degree with honors in Chemistry provides students with an opportunity to undertake an indepen-
dent research project under the supervision of a faculty member, and to report on the nature of the work in
two short oral presentations and in a written thesis.
Chemistry majors who are candidates for the degree with honors take the following in addition to a
major listed above:
Chemistry 493-W31-494 Senior Research and Thesis
The principal considerations in admitting a student to a program of independent research are mastery of
fundamental materials and skills, ability to pursue independent study successfully, and demonstrated stu-
dent interest and motivation. In addition, to enroll in these courses leading to a degree with honors, a stu-
dent must have a B- average in all chemistry courses or the permission of the chair. At the end of the first
semester, the department reviews the student's progress and determines whether the student is a candidate
for a degree with honors. The designation of a degree with honors in Chemistry or a degree with highest
honors in Chemistry is based primarily on a departmental evaluation of the accomplishments in these
courses and on the quality of the thesis. Completion of the research project in a satisfactory manner and
preparation of a well-written thesis usually results in a degree with honors. In cases where a student has
demonstrated unusual commitment and initiative resulting in an outstanding thesis based on original ex-
perimental results, combined with a strong record in all of his or her chemistry courses, the department
may elect to award a degree with highest honors in Chemistry.

COURSES FOR NON-MAJORS WITH NO PREREQUISITES
CHEM 111(S) Fighting Disease: The Evolution and Operation of Human Medicines
The past decade has seen an explosion in the number of pharmaceuticals available to doctors and their
patients. Pills are now available to treat conditions as varied as depression and baldness, and a cure for the
common cold is in development. A visit to the doctor now seems incomplete without a prescription.
Changes in Food and Drug Administration and health insurance policies combined with the tremendous
increase in advertisement of prescription drugs have also placed a larger burden on consumers in deciding
which drugs to take, as well as in paying for the medication.
This course focuses on understanding, at a biochemical level, how several drugs work their curative magic
as well as how they may lead to undesired side effects. We examine the processes through which drugs are
discovered or created and how they are then brought to consumers. Topics range from the discovery of
aspirin and the effect of World War II on the discovery of cheap treatments for malaria to advances in
protease inhibitors and combination therapies which have dramatically extended the lives of AIDS pa-
tients. The main focus of the course is basic concepts in medicinal chemistry and biology which underlie
the action of any drug. We also explore the connections between basic research, biotechnology companies,
multinational pharmaceutical firms, patent attorneys, regulatory agencies, doctors, and insurers which
eventually lead to the availability of a given drug.
This course is designed for the non-science major who does not intend to pursue a career in the natural
sciences. Principles in organic chemistry and biochemistry will be developed as needed.
Format: lecture, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on problem sets, class participation, a mid-
term, a final project, and a final exam.
No prerequisites, but high school-level preparation in biology or chemistry is recommended. Students who
have not taken any high school biology or chemistry courses should contact the instructor before enrolling.
Students who have taken Chemistry 156 are not eligible. Enrollment limit: 40 (expected: 30).

CHEM 341(F) Toxicology and Cancer (Same as Environmental Studies 341)
What is a poison and what makes it poisonous? Paracelcus commented in 1537: "What is not a poison? All
things are poisons (and nothing is without poison). The dose alone keeps a thing from being a poison." Is
the picture really this bleak; is modern technology-based society truly swimming in a sea of toxic materi-
als? How are the nature and severity of toxicity established, measured and expressed? Do all toxic materi-
als exert their effect in the same manner, or can materials be poisonous in a variety of different ways? Are
the safety levels set by regulatory agencies low enough for a range of common toxic materials, such as
mercury, lead, and certain pesticides? How are poisons metabolized and how do they lead to the develop-
ment of cancer? What is cancer and what does it take to cause it? What biochemical defense mechanisms
exist to counteract the effects of poisons?
This course attempts to answer these questions by surveying the fundamentals of modern chemical tox-
icology and the induction and progression of cancer. Topics will range from description and quantitation of
the toxic response, including risk assessment, to the basic mechanisms underlying toxicity, mutagenesis,
carcinogenesis, and DNA repair. A basic understanding of organic chemistry will be required.

loids. Modern synthetic reactions are surveyed with an emphasis on the stereochemical and mechanistic
themes that underlie them. To meet the requirements for the semester's final project, each student chooses
an article from the recent synthetic literature and then analyzes the logic and strategy involved in the pub-
lished work in a final paper. A summary of this paper is also presented to the class in a short seminar.

man worlds from various perspectives: art, archaeology, philosophy, religion, and especially literature and
history. Courses are of two types: language (Greek and Latin) and translation (Classical Civilization). The
100-level language courses are intensive introductions to Greek and Latin grammar; the 200-level lan-
guage courses combine comprehensive grammar review with readings from Greek or Latin texts of pivotal
historical periods; the 400-level language courses explore in depth selected authors or topics and the meth-
ods of analysis appropriate to each of them. Courses in which texts are read in translation provide both
introductory surveys and opportunities for more specialized study of the ancient Greco-Roman world from
earliest historical times through late antiquity.
MAJOR
Majors and prospective majors are encouraged to consult with the department's faculty to ensure a well-
balanced and comprehensive selection of Classics courses appropriate to their individual interests. A
course or courses in ancient history are strongly recommended. Majors may also benefit from advice on
courses offered in other departments which would complement their particular interests in Classics. A
reading knowledge of French, German, and Italian is useful for any study in Classics and is required in at
Classics
­ 110 ­
least two of these modern languages by graduate programs in classics, ancient history, classical art and
archaeology, and medieval studies.
The department offers two routes to the major: Classics and Classical Civilization.
Classics: (1) Six courses in Greek and/or Latin, with at least two 400-level courses in one language; (2)
Three additional courses, elected from the offerings in Greek, Latin, or Classical Civilization or from ap-
proved courses in other departments.
Classical Civilization: (1) Either Classics 101 or 102, and either Classics 222 or 223; (2) Three addition-
al courses from the offerings in Classical Civilization or from approved courses in other departments. (3)
Three courses in Greek or Latin with at least one at the 400 level, or four courses in Latin at any level. (4) A
senior independent study is normally required to complete the Classical Civilization major. Several of the
courses elected, including the independent study, should relate to each other in such a way as to reflect a
concentration on a particular genre, period, or problem of Greek and Roman civilization, including topics
in ancient art and archaeology, religion in the Greco-Roman world, and ancient philosophy.
In addition to the courses in Classical Civilization, appropriate courses from other departments or from
approved study abroad programs may be elected for the major. Examples of such courses, which may vary
from year to year, are ArtH 412 (Monsters and Narrative: Greek Architectural Sculpture), ArtH 511 (Dio-
nysos in Greek Art, Poetry, and Ritual), Political Science/Philosophy 231 (Ancient Political Theory), and
appropriate courses at the Intercollegiate Center for Classical Studies in Rome or at another approved over-
seas program.
Senior Colloquium: In lieu of a semester-long major seminar, majors will participate in the Senior Col-
loquium, a student-faculty discussion group that meets several times each semester during the senior year.
Each meeting features a short presentation by a senior major followed by discussion, all in an informal
setting.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN CLASSICS
Students who wish to be considered for the degree with honors will normally present a thesis or pursue
appropriate independent study in the fall and winter study of their senior year. The thesis or independent
study offers students the opportunity to work in depth on a topic of their choosing and to apply and develop
the techniques and critical methods with which they have become acquainted during their regular course
work. It may also include relevant work with members of other departments. In order to write a thesis,
students normally must have a minimum GPA of 3.3 in their major courses and must submit a thesis pro-
posal before the end of the spring semester of their junior year that earns departmental approval. To be
awarded the degree with honors in Classics, the student is required to have taken a minimum of ten semes-
ter courses in the department (not including the thesis or independent study) and to have demonstrated
original or superior ability in studies in the field both through course work and through the thesis or equiva-
lent independent study.
COURSE NUMBERING SYSTEM
Language Courses: The numbering of courses through the 200 level reflects the prerequisites involved.
The only prerequisite for any 400-level course is Greek 201 or Latin 202, or equivalent language prepara-
tion. The numbering of the 400-level courses partially reflects the order in which they are offered over a
two-year period for Greek and a three-year period for Latin. It also indicates a good order in which to take
the 400-level courses but not an essential order, and individual students may enter the sequence at any
point. While not every student will take every course, the rotation of 400-level courses is arranged to permit
exposure, in a three- to four-year period, to most of the important periods and genres of classical studies.
Classical Civilization Courses: The numbering of these courses often suggests a recommended but
rarely necessary sequence of study within a given area of classical studies. Most of the translation courses
do not assume prior experience in Classics or a cross-listed field.
CLASSICAL CIVILIZATION
CLAS 101(F) Greek Literature (Same as Comparative Literature 107)
From the Homeric epics of the eighth century to the tragedies of fifth century Athens, the literature of the
archaic and classical Greek world was produced by and for a "performance society" in which genres like
epic and lyric, iambics and elegy, victory odes for athletes and hymns for the gods, comedy and tragedy,
history and oratory and even philosophy, all developed out of the numerous and varied occasions at which
both poetry (usually accompanied by music and very often by dance) and prose were performed. As we
read in translation Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, Hesiod's Theogony and Works and Days, several Homeric
Hymns, selections from poets like Archilochus, Sappho, Solon and Pindar, tragedies by Aeschylus,
Sophocles and Euripides, comedies by Aristophanes, brief selections from the histories of Herodotus and
Thucydides, and perhaps a Platonic dialogue, we will attend to the performance contexts in which these
works were first produced, from the small drinking party to large festivals, and to the different kinds of
audience each "genre" presupposes and, indeed, implicitly constructs. Our chief aim in doing so will be to
enrich our readings of individual texts and to provide a framework for exploring some of the issues that
persist in a literature produced over four turbulent centuries of social and political change, for example: the
godlike in humans and yet our human limitations, particularly our mortality; whether the family and
Classics
­ 111 ­
community that survive us or the "fame" of poetry can provide adequate compensation for individuals'
mortality; gender constructions and their relation to "genres"; changing conceptions of community and of
the individual's and family's relation to it as various types of the polis ("city-state") develop.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on short response papers, two or three 5- to 7-page
papers, and a final exam.

(www.williams.edu/Registrar/catalog/depts/clas/clas102.html)
CLAS 103(S) Greek and Roman Drama: Renewal and Transformation (Same as Comparative
Literature 109 and Theatre 311)
The reading list for this course includes many of the major tragedies of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euri-
pides, several comedies of Aristophanes, a representative sampling of Greek and Roman New Comedy
(Menander, Plautus, Terence), and a play of Seneca. One focus of the course will be on themes of renewal
and transformation, whether with reference to the plays themselves or to the ongoing process by which
drama, whether ancient or modern, undergoes constant metamorphosis as it is performed and reworked in
different times and places. In keeping with this latter emphasis, we shall read several twentieth-century
plays based on ancient myth or ancient models (Anouilh's Antigone, Sartre's The Flies, Eliot's The Family
Reunion, Kane's Phaedra's Love), and students will be encouraged to create their own transformations of
ancient myth and ancient models in media of their own choosing.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on contributions to class discussion, submission of
weekly one-page response papers, a 5- to 10-page paper, a creative project, and a mid-term and final exam.
Students taking the course as Theater 311 will be expected to undertake an additional project, to be deter-
mined in consultation with the instructor.

CLAS 224(S) Helen, Desire and Language (Same as Comparative Literature 244 and
Women's and Gender Studies 224) (W)
When Homer's Iliad introduces us to "Helen of Troy," she is a perfectly beautiful and baleful cause of the
Trojan War and, simultaneously, among its most sympathetic and innocent victims. In her struggle to be a
desiring agent and not simply the passive screen onto which others project their own desires, Helen stands
both inside the narrative, as a character created by it, and outside, as a commentator on the story and her
own role in it. Through Helen as much as any other character, the Iliad explores the relation between logos
and eros. Because Helen remains a key figure in Greek discourse of language and desire, and of death, loss,
memory, repetition and substitution, we will focus on texts in which Helen figures prominently, including
the Iliad and Odyssey, lyric poems by Sappho, Alcaeus, and Steisichorus, Aeschylus's Oresteia, Euri-
Classics
­ 112 ­
pides's Helen, and Gorgias' Encomium of Helen, and we will consider Helen in the graphic arts and
religious cults. We will also venture into texts and arenas where Helen herself is not prominent or even
mentioned but where thematics familiar from stories involving her are at play, e.g. Hesiod on the Muses,
Pandora, Aphrodite, and Metis, several tragedies by Sophocles and Euripides, the Athenian cult of Persua-
sion, women's roles in familial and communal cults, and (if time permits) Plato's Symposium or Phaedrus.
Among the questions we will ask: Why do discussions of logos regularly become discussions of eros, and
vice-versa? Why do "feminine" activities--weaving, storing and preparing food, bearing children, caring
for the dead--and why do traits particularly associated in Greek culture with females--lying and seduc-
tiveness, for instance--figure prominently in the discourse of logos and eros? Does this discourse engen-
der as "feminine" poets, texts, and characters who, like Achilles and Odysseus as well as Helen, become
"poets" within the texts that have created them? Where is "masculinity" located in this discourse?
Format: discussion with some short lectures. Requirements: active participation in class discussion, one or
two oral presentations, several shorter papers and a longer final paper (more than 20 pages total). Students
may devise a final paper involving later literature either about Helen or otherwise relevant to the issues in
this course.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 10). Preference will be given to students who have pre-
viously studied some of the literature being read and to majors in Classics, Comparative Literature, Liter-
ary Studies, English and other literatures and in Women's and Gender Studies.

GREEK
CLGR 101(F)-102(S) Introduction to Greek
This full-year, intensive course presents the fundamentals of Greek grammar, syntax, and vocabulary and
introduces students, in the second semester, to works of the classical period (usually Xenophon and Euri-
pides).
This course is designed for students who are beginning Greek or have studied less than two years of Greek
in secondary school. Credit is granted for the first semester only if the second semester is taken as well.
Students with some previous experience in Greek may want to enroll in CLGR 102 only. (Consult the de-
partment.)

CLGR 201(F) Intermediate Greek
Reading of selections from Hesiod and from Plato, combined with grammar review. The primary goal of
this course is to develop fluency in reading Greek. We will also read the texts closely to explore important
continuities and changes in Greek culture between the archaic and classical periods. The emphasis will
vary from year to year, but possible subjects to be explored include: the education and socialization of the
community's children and young adults; religion and cult practices; the performative aspects of epic (and
choral) poetry and of prose genres like oratory and the philosophical dialogue; traditional oral poetry and
storytelling and the growth of literacy; the construction of woman, of man; the development of the classical
polis.

Hour: 2:35-3:50 MR HOPPIN
CLGR 402(S) Homer: The Iliad
From the early archaic era through the classical and beyond, Homer's Iliad and Odyssey simultaneously
influenced and reflected Greek conceptions of community, leadership, war, heroism, family, loyalty, the
gods, justice, and much more. And nearly all of subsequent Greek literature, both poetry and prose,
developed in varying degrees of dialogue with these early epic texts. In this course we will explore
Homeric values, narrative style, language, and effect by reading extensive selections from the Odyssey in
Greek, and the entire epic in translation.
Format: recitation/discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, oral reports, a paper or
papers, perhaps a midterm, and a final exam.
Prerequisites: Greek 201 or permission of instructor. Greek 402 is offered alternately as a course on the
Iliad and the Odyssey. Students who have taken Greek 402 on the Iliad may elect this course as well.

Hour: 2:35-3:50 TR PORTER
CLGR 403(F) Poetry and Revolution in Archaic Greece
The age of experiment, of lyric, of tyranny, of migration and discovery, of the personal voice: it takes many
images to describe the profound changes in Greek society, thought, and self-expression during the archaic
era (roughly 800 to the Persian invasion of 479). We will first read selections from the lyric poets (e.g.
Archilochus and Sappho, Tyrtaeus and Solon), whose concise and expressive poems reflected
contemporary culture in a way the archaic epics did not. Their poems create for modern readers, as they did
for the Greeks, a powerful sense of the poet's personal presence and engagement with his (or her)
audience. A similar intimacy characterizes the writings of many of the pre-Socratics, from which we will
next read some selections. Confident in the ability of the human mind to understand both the human and
the physical world, the pre-Socratics anticipated what came to be known as philosophy and natural science.
We will then turn to other writers who spoke directly about the political upheavals of the archaic age,
focussing on the "tyrant narratives" of Herodotus. Throughout the semester we will also consider such
significant material changes in the archaic era as the development of monumental public sculpture, the
evolution of the temple, and the undertaking of vast building programs, all of which transformed the visual
scale of the Greek cities and their citizens' sense of self and community.
Format: recitation/discussion. Evaluation will be based on daily translations and contributions to class
discussion, several translation quizzes, an oral presentation, a final paper, and a final exam.

LATIN
CLLA 101(F)-102(S) Introduction to Latin
This is a full-year course on the fundamentals of the Latin language. The first semester and part of the
second emphasize learning basic grammar; the rest of the second semester is devoted to reading selections
from Latin poetry (including Vergil's Aeneid and some Medieval Latin poetry, e.g., the Carmina Burana)
and from Latin prose (e.g., Pliny's Letters and/or the Vulgate Bible). This course is designed for the student
with no previous preparation in Latin or who has had only a little Latin and wishes a refresher. Credit is
granted for the first semester only if the second semester is taken as well. Students with some previous
experience in Latin may want to enroll in CLLA 102 only: consult the department.

at developing fluency in reading Latin. At the same time it acquaints students with one of the most turbu-
lent and important periods in Roman history and attends to the development of their interpretative and
analytic skills.

while acquainting them with a vitally important period in Roman history. More than Latin 201, however,
this course attends to the development of students' analytic and interpretive skills. We will read selections
from Ovid's Metamorphoses and from such early imperial prose as Livy's account of the early republic or
Petronius' Satyricon.
Format: recitation/discussion. Evaluation will be based on preparation for each class, classroom perfor-
mance, quizzes, a midterm and a final exam. Several oral presentations and short essays may be required as
well.
Prerequisites: Latin 201 or permission of instructor; some first-year students may be advised to enroll in
Latin 202 rather than Latin 201: consult the department. Enrollment limit: 12 (expected: 6-10).
Hour: 1:10-2:25 MR DEKEL
CLLA 402(S) Roman Letters
This course will explore the ancient Roman epistolary tradition. Through selections from the three major
surviving collections of letters by Cicero, Pliny, and Seneca, as well as modern critical approaches to the
genre, we will investigate the formal and stylistic conventions and innovations of Roman personal, politi-
cal, and philosophical letter writing. We will also consider the problem of distinguishing real correspon-
dence from literary fabrication, as well as issues related to self-presentation, friendship, and the role of
letters in Roman public and private life. Finally, we will turn to the poetic appropriation of this tradition in
Ovid's Heroides, a collection of fictional letters from mythological heroines.
Format: discussion/recitation. Evaluation will be based on class participation, a midterm exam, a short pa-
per, and a final exam.

CLLA 404(F) Vergil's Aeneid
Although he used the Iliad and Odyssey as literary models, Vergil created a thoroughly Roman--and
Italian--epic with the Aeneid, a poem which addresses contemporary politics (the principate of Augustus)
through the figure of Aeneas, the mythical hero of Troy. We will pay close attention to the political as well
as the literary background of Rome's greatest literary achievement, and one of the major issues we will
explore is the degree to which Vergil's Aeneid provides a new model of the Roman military and political
leader.
Evaluation will be based on contributions to class, a midterm exam, and a final paper.

COGNITIVE SCIENCE (Div. II)
Chair, Associate Professor ANDREA DANYLUK
Advisory Committee: Professors: GERRARD, KIRBY*, H. WILLIAMS. Associate Professor: DA-
NYLUK. Assistant Professors: CRUZ, ZAKI*.
Cognitive science is concerned with how humans, non-human animals, and computers acquire, repre-
sent, manipulate, and use information. As an interdisciplinary field it combines research and theory from
computer science (e.g., artificial intelligence), cognitive psychology, philosophy, linguistics, and neurosci-
ence, and to some extent evolutionary biology, math, and anthropology. Complex issues of cognition are
not easily addressed using traditional intra-disciplinary tools. Cognitive researchers in any discipline typi-
cally employ a collection of analytic and modeling tools from across traditional disciplinary boundaries.
Thus, the methods and research agenda of cognitive science is broader than those of any of the fields that
have traditionally contributed to cognitive science. The Cognitive Science Program is designed to provide
students with the broad interdisciplinary foundation needed to approach issues of cognition.
THE CONCENTRATION
The concentration in Cognitive Science consists of six courses, including an introductory course, four
electives, and a senior research project.
Minds, Brains, and Intelligent Behavior (COGS 222) is the entry-point into the concentration, and
provides an interdisciplinary perspective on issues of cognition. Ideally, it should be taken before the end of
the sophomore year. Emphasizing the highly interdisciplinary nature of the field, the four electives must be
distributed over at least three course prefixes. In the fall of the senior year, concentrators will conduct inter-
disciplinary Research in Cognitive Science (COGS 493), supervised by members of the advisory commit-
tee from at least two departments.
REQUIRED COURSES
Cognitive Science 222 Minds, Brains, and Intelligent Behavior: An Introduction to Cognitive Science

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN COGNITIVE SCIENCE
Formal admission to candidacy for honors will occur at the end of the fall semester of the senior year
and will be based on promising performance in COGS 493. This program will consist of COGS
W31-494(S), and will be supervised by members of the advisory committee from at least two departments.
Presentation of a thesis, however, should not be interpreted as a guarantee of a degree with honors.
COGS 222(S) Minds, Brains, and Intelligent Behavior: An Introduction to Cognitive Science
(Same as INTR 222, Philosophy 222 and Psychology 222) (Q)
This course will emphasize interdisciplinary approaches to the study of intelligent systems, both natural
and artificial. Cognitive science synthesizes research from cognitive psychology, computer science, lin-
guistics, neuroscience, and contemporary philosophy. Special attention will be given to the philosophical
foundations of cognitive science, information theory, symbolic and connectionist architectures, the neural
basis of cognition, perception, learning and memory, language, action, reasoning, expert systems, and arti-
ficial intelligence.

Students motivated by a desire to study literature in the broadest terms, as well as those interested in
particular examples of literary comparison, will find an intellectual home in the Program in Comparative
Literature. The Program in Comparative Literature gives students the opportunity to develop their critical
faculties through the analysis of literature in its international and multicultural context. By crossing nation-
al, linguistic, historical, and disciplinary boundaries, students of Comparative Literature learn to read texts
for the ways they make meaning, the assumptions that underlie that meaning, and the aesthetic elements
evinced in the making. Students of Comparative Literature are encouraged to examine the widest possible
range of literary communication, including the metamorphosis of genres, forms, and themes.
Whereas specific literature programs allow the student to trace the development of one literature in a
particular culture over a period of time, Comparative Literature juxtaposes the writings of different cultures
and epochs in a variety of ways. The rubrics of the Program's core courses--Literary Genres, Literary
Movements, Literature and Theory, and Cultural Studies--introduce the student to a variety of critical
methods. Because interpretive methods from other disciplines play a crucial role in investigating litera-
ture's larger context, the Program offers courses intended for students in all divisions of the college and of
all interests. These include courses that introduce students to the comparative study of world literature and
courses designed to enhance any foreign language major in the Williams curriculum. In addition, the En-
glish Department allows students to count one course with a COMP prefix as an elective within the English
major.
The Program supports two distinct majors in Comparative Literature and Literary Studies. The major in
Comparative Literature requires advanced work in at least one language other than English and is strongly
recommended for students contemplating graduate study in the discipline. Both majors provide a strong
basis for any career demanding analytical, interpretive, and evaluative skills and allow the student, within a
framework of general requirements, to create a program of study primarily shaped by the student's own
interests.
MAJORS
Comparative Literature
The Comparative Literature major combines the focused study of a single national-language literature
with a wide-ranging exploration of literary forms across national, linguistic, and historical boundaries.
Each student declaring the major must select a single foreign language as his or her specialty, although the
serious study of literature in foreign languages other than the student's specialty is strongly encouraged.
The languages currently available are French, German, Ancient Greek, Latin, Russian, and Spanish. Each
student will also be paired with a faculty advisor with whom the student will meet each semester to discuss
how best to fulfill the requirements for the major.
Eleven courses are required for the major:
Comparative Literature 111 The Nature of Narrative (Literary Genres)
Any three of the following core courses:
Comparative Literature 223/English 203 Reading Films (Literary Genres)
Comparative Literature 232 European Modernism (Literary Movements)
Comparative Literature 244/Classics 224/Women's and Gender Studies 224 Helen Desire and Lan-
guage (Literature and Theory)

Comparative Literature 343/English 373 Modern Critical Theory (Literature and Theory)
Comparative Literature 344/Religion 304 From Hermeneutics to Post Coloniality (Literature and
Theory)
Three literature courses in the student's specialty language, in which texts are read in the original. At
least one of the three must be above the 200-level.
Three courses in which most of the course work concerns literature other than that of the student's
specialty language or literary theory. These courses may be selected from Comparative Literature of-
ferings or from other departments and must be approved by the student's major advisor. Only one may
be in English or American literature. Among the offerings of other departments that are possible, the
following employ readings in English translation and are especially appropriate to the major:
English 117, 126, 202, 216, 219, 220, 341, 342, 345, 361, 371, 372
Linguistics 101, 121
Religion 210, 401
Theatre 210, 211, 330, 331
Comparative Literature 402 Senior Seminar (variable topics)
Students who are considering a major in Comparative Literature should aim to acquire intermediate-
level proficiency in their specialty language by the end of the sophomore year. They should also complete
core course requirements by the end of their junior year. Students pursuing the Comparative Literature
major are strongly encouraged to study abroad during their junior year and may receive major credit for up
to 4 courses taken during study abroad. At least three courses towards the major must be at the 300 level or
above. Students are expected to take the version of 402 offered in their senior year, even if they have pre-
viously taken 402.
Literary Studies
The Literary Studies major allows for a wide-ranging exploration of literary forms across national, lin-
guistic, and historical boundaries. Unlike the major in Comparative Literature, the Literary Studies major
does not require the student to choose a specialty language, although the serious study of literature in one or
more foreign languages is strongly encouraged. Each student will be paired with a faculty advisor, with
whom the student will meet each semester to discuss how best to fulfill the requirements for the major.
Eleven courses are required for the major:
Comparative Literature 111 The Nature of Narrative (Literary Genres)
Any four of the following core courses:
Comparative Literature 223/English 203 Reading Films (Literary Genres)
Comparative Literature 232 European Modernism (Literary Movements)
Comparative Literature 244/Classics 224/Women's and Gender Studies 224 Helen Desire and Lan-
guage (Literature and Theory)
Comparative Literature 251T War in Modern Literature (Cultural Studies)
Comparative Literature 252 Modern Women Writers and the City (Cultural Studies)
Comparative Literature 253 Literature and the Body (Cultural Studies)
Comparative Literature 329/English 379 Contemporary World Novel (Literary Genres)
Comparative Literature 340 Literature and Psychoanalysis (Literature and Theory)
Comparative Literature 343/English 373 Modern Critical Theory (Literature and Theory)
Comparative Literature 344/Religion 304 From Hermeneutics to Post Coloniality (Literature and
Theory)
Five courses devoted to literature or literary theory that cover at least three different national/cultural tradi-
tions. The courses may be selected from Comparative Literature offerings or from other departments and
must be approved by the student's major advisor. Of the courses taken outside of the Program in Compara-
tive Literature, no more than two may have the same course prefix. Students are strongly encouraged to
include courses in a foreign language among these five. Among the offerings of other departments that are
possible, the following employ readings in English translation and are especially appropriate to the major:
English 117, 126, 202, 216, 219, 220, 341, 342, 345, 372
Linguistics 101, 121
Religion 210, 401T
Theatre 210, 211, 330, 331
Comparative Literature 402 Senior Seminar (variable topics)
Students who are considering a major in Literary Studies should aim to complete core course require-
ments by the end of their sophomore year. Students who choose to study abroad during their junior year
may receive major credit for up to 4 courses taken during study abroad. At least three courses towards the
Comparative Literature
­ 118 ­
major must be at the 300 level or above. Students are expected to take the version of 402 offered in their
senior year, even if they have previously taken 402.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN COMPARATIVE LITERATURE OR LITERARY STUDIES
To achieve honors in Comparative Literature or Literary Studies, a student must prepare a thesis, usually
50-75 pages long, during the senior year (COMP 493-W31-494 or LIT 493-W31-494). The topic of the
thesis must be comparative and/or theoretical in approach. Those majoring in Comparative Literature must
include a significant amount of material in the literature of the student's specialty language. Students must
apply to the Program's advisory committee for permission to pursue an honors thesis during the spring
semester of the junior year.

COMP 252(F) Modern Women Writers and the City (Same as Women's and Gender Studies
252)
Ambivalence has always been a vital part of literary responses to city life. Whether they praise the city or
blame it, women writers react to the urban environment in a significantly different way from men. While
male writers have often emphasized alienation and strangeness, women writers have celebrated the mobil-
ity and public life of the city as liberating. We will look at issues of women's work, class politics, sexual
freedom or restriction, rituals of consumption, the conservation of memory by architecture, and communi-
ty-building in cities like London, New York, Berlin, Paris. We will examine novels and short stories about
the modern city by writers as diverse as Virginia Woolf, Gertrude Stein, Anzia Yezierska, Ann Petry, Jean
Rhys, Marguerite Duras, Margaret Drabble, Ntozake Shange, Verena Stefan and Jhumpa Lahiri and Ed-
widge Danticat. We will consider theoretical approaches to urban spaces by feminists (Beatriz Colomina,
Elizabeth Wilson), architectural historians (Christine Boyer) and anthropologists and sociologists (Janet
Abu-Lughod, David Sibley, Michael Sorkin). Several contemporary films will be discussed. All readings
in English.
Format: Lecture and discussion. Requirements: Two short papers and one final paper.

COMP 257(F) Baghdad*
Some consider Baghdad to be a specter of civil-war Beirut, but behind the deluge of grim news is a rich,
complex heritage. Baghdad has a long history as an intellectual milieu, literary setting and muse. This city
Comparative Literature
­ 120 ­
became a major cultural center when the Islamic Caliphate was moved there in the eighth century CE. The
multiplicity of intellectual and artistic currents that flourished in Baghdad under the Abbasids would pro-
duce one of the earliest modernizing movements in poetry, a challenge to the early Islamic tradition, a
wealth of translation activity and a general cultural vibrancy in a multicultural, multilingual context. The
texts of the Golden Age of Baghdad would become fundamental to the Arab and Islamic cultural heritage
while the city itself would continue to exert a strong creative influence in both the Middle Eastern and
European artistic traditions. This influence continues to this day as Arabs and Muslims look to Baghdad as
a fundamental part of their cultural heritage while Westerners continue to be intrigued and haunted by this
city. In this course we will read early texts written in or about Baghdad including examples from 1,001
Nights and from works written by al-Ma'arri, al-Mutanabbi, Abu Nuwas, al-Ghazali and al-Hallaj. We will
also read more recent texts that engage this city including works by Jabra Ibrahim Jabra and Buthaina Al
Nasiri. In addition to these texts, we will also view films including Sindbad movies, The Thief of Baghdad
and Aladdin. The texts for this course include examples from both "high" and popular culture. These
works are by both natives of Baghdad and by outsiders, including the producers of Hollywood orientalist
fantasies.
Requirements: active class participation, two short-answer quizzes, two 4- to 6-page papers and a final 6-
to 8-page paper.

Utopia, paradise, shipwreck, abandonment, exile, death: From Shakespeare's The Tempest to Gilligan's
Island, from Robinson Crusoe to Survivor, the Western fascination-even obsession-with the island as si-
multaneously a place of solace and a site of imprisonment stretches across the centuries. We can read these
constructed sites as canvases of desire, places where the West can play out its dramas and test its confine-
ments, but our understanding of the island can not be divorced from the historical and material contact that
has allowed this imagination such freedom and popularity: histories of imperialism and unequal global
power relations. In this class, we will read Western literary islands alongside islands constructed by Carib-
bean and non-Western writers in French and English. What happens when the island starts writing back?
How do writers respond to reifications of their world? What does the island symbolize in their imagina-
tions, both personal and national? Readings will include: Shakespeare's The Tempest and Aimé Césaire's A
Tempest, Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe, J. M. Coetzee's Foe and Michel Tournier's Friday, Homer's
The Odyssey and Derek Walcott's Omeros, and writings by Jamaica Kincaid, Maryse Condé, Edouard
Glissant and Daniel Maximin.

COMP 402(S) Migration and National Identity in Literature and Film: Europe and the
Americas*
In this course we will examine literary and cinematic reflections upon the national self and the immigrant
other. The theoretical point of departure for this examination centers around the entrenched relationship
between nation and narration as discussed by literary critics such as Homi Bhabha. Do immigrants and
their cultures fit in the national narrative? How can the nation be re-written and re-imagined to accommo-
date an assortment of voices and experiences? Many of the texts and films of this course challenge what the
renowned Latin Americanist Doris Sommer has termed "foundational fictions" of the nation. Amid the
friction often occasioned by differences, immigrant communities in the Americas and Europe have in-
creasingly striven to define themselves and their relationship to their host nations as an alternative to na-
tionalist political rhetoric which often portrays them in highly restrictive, often exclusionary ways. Along
with theoretical texts, the readings for this course include works by Milton Hatoum, Tahar Ben Jelloun,
Nélida Piñón, Sandra Cisneros, Firoozeh Dumas, Jhumpa Lahiri and Chang-Rae Lee. Films include My
Beautiful Launderette, Raising Victor Vargas, His Secret Life and Mi Vida Loca.
Format: seminar. Requirements: active class participation, two oral reports, one 5-page paper and a

Computers play an enormously important role in our society. General-purpose computers are used
widely in business and industry and are found in an increasing number of homes. Special-purpose comput-
ers are found in everything from automobile engines to microwave ovens. Understanding and exploiting
the great potential of computers is the goal of research in computer science. Among the many fascinating
research projects in progress in computer science today are investigations of: ways to focus more computa-
tional power on a problem through the simultaneous use of many processors in parallel; revolutionary
computer languages designed to simplify the process of constructing complex programs for computers; the
use of computer-generated graphic images in the arts and as a tool for visualization in the natural sciences;
and the use of digital methods in global communications. The Computer Science Department at Williams
seeks to provide students with an understanding of the principles underlying computer science that will
enable them to understand and participate in these exciting developments.
The department recognizes that students' interests in computer science will vary widely. The depart-
ment attempts to meet these varying interests through: (1) its major; (2) a selection of courses intended
primarily for those who are interested in a brief introduction to computer science or who seek to develop
some specific expertise in computing for application in some other discipline; and (3) recommendations
for possible sequences of courses for the non-major who wants a more extensive introduction to computer
science. These offerings are discussed in detail below.
MAJOR
The goal of the major is to provide an understanding of algorithmic problem-solving as well as the con-
ceptual organization of computers and complex programs running on them. Emphasis is placed on the
fundamental principles of computer science, building upon the mathematical and theoretical ideas under-
lying these principles. The introductory and core courses build a broad and solid base for understanding
computer science. The more advanced courses allow students to sample a variety of specialized areas of
computer science including graphics, artificial intelligence, computer networks, software engineering,
compiler design, and operating systems. Independent study and honors work provide opportunities for stu-
dents to study and conduct research on topics of special interest.
The major in Computer Science equips students to take advantage of awide variety of career opportuni-
ties. Thus the major can be used as a preparation for a career in computing, for graduate school, or simply
to provide an in-depth study of computer science for the student whosefuturecareerwillonlytangentially
be related to computer science.
MAJOR REQUIREMENTS
Required Courses in Computer Science
A minimum of 8 courses is required in Computer Science, including the following:
Introductory Courses
Computer Science 134 Digital Computation and Communication
Computer Science 136 Data Structures and Advanced Programming
Core Courses
Computer Science 237 Computer Organization
Computer Science 256 Algorithm Design and Analysis
Computer Science 334 Principles of Programming Languages
Computer Science 361 Theory of Computation
Electives
Two or more electives (bringing the total number of Computer Science courses to at least 8) chosen
from 300- or 400-level courses in Computer Science. At least one of these must be a course designated
as a PROJECT COURSE. Computer Science courses with 9 as the middle digit (reading, research, and
thesis courses) will normally not be used to satisfy the elective requirements. Students may petition the
department to waive this restriction with good reason.
Required Courses in Mathematics
Mathematics 251 Discrete Mathematics
and any other Mathematics course at the 200-level or higher
Computer Science
­ 123 ­
Students considering pursuing a major in Computer Science are urged to take Computer Science 134
and to begin satisfying their mathematics requirements early. Note in particular that Discrete Mathematics
covers material complementing that in the introductory courses (Computer Science 134 and 136) and is a
prerequisite for many advanced courses.
Students who take Computer Science 105, 106, 108 or 109 may use that course as one of the two elec-
tives required for the major in Computer Science. Those who count Computer Science 109 toward the
major must select an elective different from Computer Science 371 (Computer Graphics) for their project
course. Similarly, students who count Computer Science 108 as an elective cannot select Computer Sci-
ence 373 as their second elective, Computer Science 315 may not be used as a second elective in conjunc-
tion with Computer Science 106 and Computer Science 336T may not be used as a second elective in
conjunction with Computer Science 105. Computer Science 105, 106, 108, 109, and 134 are not open to
students who have taken a Computer Science course numbered 136 or higher.
To be eligible for admission to the major, a student must normally have completed Computer Science
136 as well as Discrete Mathematics by the end of the sophomore year. A second Mathematics course at
the 200-level or higher must be completed by the end of the junior year. Students are urged to have com-
pleted two of the four core courses (Computer Science 237, 256, 334, and 361) by the end of the sopho-
more year and must normally have completed at least three out of the four core courses by the end of the
junior year.
Satisfactory participation is required in the Computer Science Colloquium by all senior majors. With the
advance permission of the department, two appropriate mathematics courses numbered 240 or above may
be substituted for one Computer Science elective. Other variations in the required courses, adapting the
requirements to the special needs and interests of the individual student, may be arranged in consultation
with the department.
Potential majors are strongly encouraged to pick up the latest copy of the Informal Guide to Courses in
Computer Science, which can be obtained from the departmental office or on the World Wide Web at
http://www.cs.williams.edu. This document contains much more information on the major, including sug-
gested patterns of course selection and advice on courses relevant to different student goals.
LABORATORY FACILITIES
The Computer Science Department maintains two departmental computer laboratories for students tak-
ing Computer Science courses. The workstations in these laboratories also support student and faculty re-
search in computer science.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE
The degree with honors in Computer Science is awarded to a student who has demonstrated outstanding
intellectual achievement in a program of study which extends beyond the requirements of the regular ma-
jor. The principal considerations in recommending a student for the degree with honors will be: mastery of
core material, ability to pursue independent study of computer science, originality in methods of investiga-
tion, and creativity in research. Honors study is highly recommended for those students with strong aca-
demic records in computer science who wish to attend graduate school, pursue high-level industrial posi-
tions in computing, or who would simply like to experience research in computer science.
Prospective honors students are urged to consult with their departmental advisor at the time of registra-
tion in the spring of the sophomore or at the beginning of the junior year to arrange a program of study that
could lead to the degree with honors. Such a program normally consists of Computer Science 493 and 494
and a WSP of independent research under the guidance of a Computer Science faculty member, culminat-
ing in a thesis which is judged acceptable by the department. The program produces a significant piece of
written work. The written work often includes a major computer program, depending on the nature of the
honors work. All honors candidates are required to give an oral presentation of their work in the Computer
Science Colloquium in early spring semester.
Students considering honors work should obtain permission from the department before registering in
the fall of the senior year. Formal admission to candidacy occurs at the beginning of the spring semester of
the senior year and is based on promising performance in the fall semester and winter study units of honors
work. Recommendations for the degree with honors will be made for outstanding performance in the three
honors courses. Highest honors will be recommended for students who have displayed exceptional ability,
achievement, or originality.
INTRODUCTORY COURSES
The department offers a choice of five introductory courses--Computer Science 105: Understanding
the Web: Technologies and Techniques, Computer Science 106: Life as an Algorithm, Computer Science
108: Artificial Intelligence: Image and Reality, Computer Science 109: The Art and Science of Computer
Graphics, and Computer Science 134: Introduction to Computer Science.
Computer Science 134 provides an introduction to computer science with a focus on developing com-
puter programming skills. These skills are essential to most upper-level courses in the department. As a
result, Computer Science 134 together with Computer Science 136 are required as a prerequisite to most
advanced courses in the department. Those students intending to take several Computer Science courses
are urged to take Computer Science 134 early.
Those students interested in learning more about important new ideas and developments in Computer
Science, but not necessarily interested in developing extensive programming skills, should consider Com-
Computer Science
­ 124 ­
puter Science 105: Understanding the Web: Technologies and Techniques, Computer Science 106: Life as
an Algorithm, Computer Science 108: Artificial Intelligence: Image and Reality, or Computer Science 109:
The Art and Science of Computer Graphics. Computer Science 105 explores the computing technology
that underlies the internet. Computer Science 106 explores models and theories shared between computer
science and biology. Computer Science 108 discusses the techniques used to construct computer systems
that exhibit intelligent behavior from learning to planning and problem-solving. Computer Science 109
introduces students to the techniques of computer graphics used for the creation of artistic images. In addi-
tion, all four of these courses provide an introduction to the techniques of computer programming.
Although none of our introductory courses assume prior programming skills, some students planning to
take Computer Science 134 who have no prior programming experience may find it useful to gain some
programming experience together with a broader understanding of our field by taking one of the depart-
ment's other introductory courses before enrolling in Computer Science 134. On the other hand, students
with significant programming experience should consider electing Computer Science 136 (see "Advanced
Placement" below). Students in either of these categories are encouraged to contact a member of the de-
partment for guidance in selecting a first course.
ADVANCED PLACEMENT
Students with an extensive background in computer science are urged to take the Advanced Placement
Examination in Computer Science. A score of 4 or better on the exam is normally required for advanced
placement in Computer Science 136.
Students who wish to be placed in Computer Science 136 but who have not taken the Advanced Place-
ment Examination should consult with the department. Such students should have had a good course in
computer science using a structured language such as Java.
PLANS OF STUDY FOR NON-MAJORS
The faculty in Computer Science believes that students can substantially enrich their academic experi-
ence by completing a coherent plan of study in one or more disciplines outside of their majors. With this in
mind, we have attempted to provide students majoring in other departments with options in our depart-
ment's curriculum ranging fromtwo-coursesequences to collections of courses equivalent to what would
constitute a minor at institutions that recognize such a concentration. Students interested in designing such
a plan of study in any department should discuss their plans in detail with a member of the faculty. We
welcome such inquiries from students. To assist students making such plans, however, we include some
suggestions below.
Students seeking to develop an extensive knowledge of computer science without majoring in the de-
partment are encouraged to use the major requirements as a guide. In particular, the four core courses re-
quired of majors are intended to provide a broad knowledge of topics underlying all of computer science.
Students seeking a concentration in Computer Science are urged to complete at least two of these courses
followed by one of our upper-level electives. Such a program would typically require the completion of a
total of five computer science courses and one course in discrete mathematics.
There are several sequences of courses appropriate for those primarily interested in developing skills in
programming for use in other areas. For general programming, Computer Science 134 followed by Com-
puter Science 136 and 237 will provide students with a strong background in algorithm and data structure
design together with an understanding of issues of correctness and efficiency. Computer Science 223 pro-
vides valuable exposure to the techniques and tools needed for the development and maintenance of large
software systems. Students of the Bioinformatics program are encouraged to take Computer Science 106
and 134 at a minimum, and should consider Computer Science 136 and 256. The sequence of courses
Computer Science 109 and 134 would provide sufficient competence in computer graphics for many stu-
dents interested in applying such knowledge either in the arts or sciences. For students requiring more ex-
pertise in the techniques of computer graphics, Computer Science 136 and 371 could be added to form a
four-course sequence.

GENERAL REMARKS
Divisional Requirements
All Computer Science courses listed may be used to satisfy the Division III distribution requirement.
Alternate Year Courses
Computer Science 106, 108, 109, 315, 323, 336T, 337T, 338T, 371, 373, 374T, 432, and 434 are each
normally offered every other year. All other Computer Science courses are normally offered every year.
Course Numbering
The increase from 100, through 200 and 300, to 400 indicates in most instances an increasing level of
maturity in the subject that is expected of students. Within a series, numeric order does not indicate the
relative level of difficulty of courses. Rather, the middle digit of the course number (particularly in upper-
level courses) generally indicates the area of computer science covered by the course.

Course Descriptions
Brief descriptions of the courses in Computer Science can be found below. More detailed information
on the offerings in the department is available in the Informal Guide to Courses in Computer Science.
Courses Open on a Pass-Fail Basis
Students taking a computer science course on a pass-fail basis must meet all the requirements set for
students taking the course on a graded basis.
With the permission of the department, any course offered by the department may be taken on a pass-
fail basis. Courses graded with the pass-fail option may not be used to satisfy any of the major or honors
requirements. However, with the permission of the department, courses taken in the department beyond
those requirements may be taken on a pass-fail basis.
COURSES INTENDED PRIMARILY FOR NON-MAJORS
CSCI 105(F) Understanding the Web: Technologies and Techniques (Q)
This course will enable students to understand the technology that underlies the World Wide Web and pro-
vide them with the skills needed to effectively use this medium. The course introduces techniques for
creating hypermedia documents on the web. Students will learn the basics of HTML, the formatting lan-
guage used to author World Wide Web documents, and a subset of Java, a language that can be used to add
interactive elements to web pages. The technology that makes the Web possible is developing as rapidly as
its use is growing. New facilities are introduced frequently. Web "standards" are evolving in several direc-
tions simultaneously as vendors introduce competing proposals. Accordingly, rather than simply learning
how to use the Web as it is today, we will also examine the fundamental technologies that make the Web
possible. These include digital encoding techniques, computer network organization, communication pro-
tocols and encryption systems. This material will leave students prepared to understand future possibilities
for, and obstacles to, the development of the Internet.
Format: lecture/laboratory. Evaluation will be based on homework, laboratory work and examinations.
55% of a student's final grade will be determined by performance on examinations.
Prerequisites: Mathematics 100/101/102 (or demonstrating proficiency in the Quantitative Studies diag-
nostic test--see catalog under Mathematics). This course is not open to students who have successfully
completed a Computer Science course numbered 136 or above. Enrollment limit: 60 (expected: 40).

COURSES INTENDED FOR BOTH NON-MAJORS AND MAJORS
CSCI 134(F,S) Digital Computation and Communication (Q)
The personal computer, the Internet, DVDs, and HDTV are just a few examples of advances in digital
computing and communication technology that have transformed the mechanism we use to process and
communicate information. This course explores the principles that underlie digital computation and com-
munication. All digital information processing systems are driven by precise rules or algorithms expressed
in computer programming languages. Students will develop an appreciation for the nature and limitations
of such algorithms by exploring abstract algorithms for complex processes and by learning the basics of
computer programming in Java. Programming topics covered will include objects, classes, methods, con-
ditional and iterative control structures, and simple data structures using arrays or lists. The representation
of information in discrete, symbolic form is ultimately what makes a system digital. We will examine digi-
tal techniques for representing information from the encoding of 0's and 1's on an optical fiber to the com-
pression techniques that made digital video possible, always examining the tradeoffs involved in the design
of such representation schemes.
Format: lecture/laboratory. Evaluation will be based on weekly programming assignments, one test pro-
gram, and midterm and final examinations.
Prerequisites: Mathematics 100/101/102 (or demonstrating proficiency in the Quantitative Studies diag-
nostic test--see catalog under Mathematics). Previous programming experience is not required. Students
with prior experience with object-oriented programming should discuss appropriate course placement with
members of the department. No enrollment limit (expected: 18 per section).

CSCI 136(F,S) Data Structures and Advanced Programming (Q)
This course builds on the programming skills acquired in Computer Science 134. Special emphasis is
placed on analysis, modularization, and data abstraction. Students are introduced to some of the most im-
portant and frequently used data structures: lists, stacks, queues, trees, hash tables, graphs, and files. Other
topics covered include analysis of algorithm complexity and program verification.

CSCI 223(F) Software Development (Q)
Building large software systems introduces new challenges to software development. Large software is
built in teams over a period of several years. Typically, no individual on the team understands the entire
system. In this setting, how can we build software that we are certain will work? How can we build soft-
ware that is easy to understand and modify so that we can produce new versions of software with confi-
dence that we will not break it? In this course, students will learn techniques and tools to help them address
these problems and develop larger software projects, improving their skills in designing, writing, debug-
ging and testing software. Topics include design patterns, UML, designing for maintainability, software
architecture, rigorous testing, version control, project management and advanced coding techniques, in-
cluding concurrency and fault tolerance.
Evaluation will be based primarily on lab assignments, examinations, and a software project developed by
a small team.
Prerequisite: Computer Science 136. Includes a 1 1/2 hour weekly lab. Enrollment limit: 30 (expected: 15).

CSCI 237(F) Computer Organization (Q)
This course studies the basic instruction set architecture and organization of a modern computer. Over the
semester the student learns the fundamentals of translating of higher level languages into assembly lan-
guage, and the interpretation of machine languages by hardware. At the same time, a model of computer
hardware organization is developed from the gate level upward. Final projects focus on the design of a
complex control system in hardware or firmware.
Evaluation will be based primarily on weekly labs, final design project, two exams.
Prerequisites: Computer Science 134, or both experience in programming and permission of instructor.

CSCI 256(S) Algorithm Design and Analysis (Q)
This course is concerned with investigating methods of designing efficient and reliable algorithms. By
carefully analyzing the underlying structure of the problem to be solved it is often possible to dramatically
decrease the computational resources needed to find a solution. Through such analysis one can also verify
that an algorithm will perform correctly, as well as accurately estimate its running time and space require-
ments. We will present several algorithm design strategies that build on data structures and programming
techniques introduced in Computer Science 136, including induction, divide-and-conquer, dynamic pro-
gramming, and greedy algorithms. Particular topics to be considered will include algorithms in graph
theory, computational geometry, string processing, and advanced data structures. In addition, an introduc-
tion to complexity theory and the complexity classes P and NP will be provided.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based on problem sets and programming assignments, and midterm
and final examinations.

CSCI 338T(S) Parallel Processing (Q)
As processor speeds approach physical limits, we will no longer be able to count on faster and faster proc-
essors being released on a regular basis. Performance increases will need to come from larger, parallel
computer systems. Parallelism complicates everything from computer hardware design to operating sys-
tems and compilers to application programming, yet it will become pervasive in the not-too-distant future.
This course examines methods, techniques, and languages for parallel programming, libraries and exten-
sions to sequential languages to support parallel programming, parallel computing environments, perfor-
mance analysis, efficiency and complexity of parallel algorithms, and applications of parallel computation.
Readings will be taken from recent technical literature and a textbook. This course is taught in the tutorial
format. Students meet weekly with the instructor in pairs to discuss the week's readings and to present
solutions to problem sets. Students complete several programming projects, using parallel computers both
in the department and at national supercomputing centers. There is a midterm and a final exam.
Format: tutorial. Evaluation will be based on the weekly assignments that will include both programming
and written components (40%), exams (25%), and tutorial participation (10%). The final project (25%)
will include a research paper and a minisymposium where each group will present their project to the class.

CSCI 374T(F) Machine Learning (Q)
This tutorial examines the design, implementation, and analysis of machine learning algorithms. Machine
Learning is a branch of Artificial Intelligence that has as its aim the development of algorithms that will
improve a system's performance. Improvement might involve acquiring new factual knowledge from
data, learning to perform a new task, or learning to perform an old task more efficiently or effectively. This
tutorial will cover instances of three general categories of algorithms: supervised learning algorithms (in-
cluding decision tree learning, support vector machines, and neural networks), unsupervised learning algo-
rithms (including k-means and expectation maximization), and reinforcement learning algorithms (such as
Q learning and temporal difference learning). It will also introduce methods for the evaluation of learning
algorithms, as well as topics in computational learning theory.
Format: tutorial. Evaluation will be based on presentations, problem sets, short programming exercises,
empirical analyses of algorithms, and two exams.

CONTRACT MAJOR
Contract Major Advisor: PETER D. GRUDIN
Students with the talent and energy for working independently and with the strong support of two facul-
ty advisors may undertake a Contract Major: a coherent study of an interdisciplinary subject not covered
by a regularly offered major. Such a major must be in an area suitable to the talents of the faculty in resi-
dence and cannot consist of minor modifications to an existing major. A Contract Major also must conform
to the structure and have the coherence of a departmental or program major--i.e., it must embody a disci-
plined cumulative study that moves from an elementary to an advanced level and culminates in a synthesis
similar to a senior major course. Hence a Contract Major usually consists of a program of existing courses,
sometimes supplemented by courses of independent study and the senior course.
The process of constructing a proposal for a Contract Major is both interesting and demanding. As part
of that process, students should consider carefully the advantage of working within existing majors or pro-
grams, taking note of the considerable intellectual pleasures involved in sharing similar educational experi-
ences with other students working within the same field. Students might also consider whether their inter-
ests could be met by completing a regular major and coordinate program, or a double major, or simply by
working outside a major field in courses of special interest. Because the Contract Major represents an ex-
ceptional opportunity provided for students whose interests cannot be met through existing departmental
and interdepartmental majors and programs, it cannot be pursued in conjunction with another major.
Students who wish to explore or propose a Contract Major should consult with the Contract Major advi-
sor and with potential faculty sponsors as early as possible in the fall semester of the sophomore year, and
then--during the sophomore year--follow these procedures:
1) The student must initiate discussion with at least two members of the faculty from differing depart-
ments who expect to be in residence during the student's senior year and who are willing to endorse the
Contract Major and undertake a central role in supervising its implementation, criticism, evaluation, and
ultimate validation. Since in essence faculty sponsors substitute for the student's major department, they
are expected to play an important role in the Contract Major.
The student must develop, in conjunction with the faculty sponsors, a written proposal (forms and
guidelines are available in the Dean's Office) which should contain:
a) a description of the proposed major area of study and an explanation of the reasons for proposing
the Contract Major. A sound and persuasive rationale for the major is crucial for obtaining ap-
proval from the Committee on Educational Policy (C.E.P.).
b) a list of all courses in the proposed major and an explanation for each course choice. A minimum
of nine semester courses, one of which must be designated the senior major course (and taken
during the senior year), must be completed for a Contract Major. Normal rules governing course
grades and grade point average apply for entry into and continuation in a Contract Major.
c) a list of other courses taken or anticipated to meet College distribution requirements, including
grades received in courses already completed.
Contract Major, Critical Languages
­ 129 ­
2) By mid-January, the student must meet with the Contract Major Advisor to discuss and further devel-
op the proposal.
3) By the first day of spring semester classes, the student must submit a complete draft of the proposal to
the Contract Major Advisor for feedback.
4) By the end of the fourth week of the spring semester, the student must submit the final proposal to the
Contract Major Advisor. By this date also, the faculty sponsors must submit their endorsement forms to the
Contract Major Advisor. If the student is essentially proposing to transform an existing coordinate program
(e.g., African-American Studies, area studies programs, Environmental Studies, Women's and Gender
Studies, etc.), into a Contract Major, the chair of that program should also submit to the Contract Major
Advisor a statement attesting to the validity of the proposal by the end of the fourth week of the spring
semester.
5) The Contract Major Advisor then conveys the proposal, a copy of the student's most recent academic
progress report, the faculty sponsors' endorsement forms, and recommendations regarding the feasibility
and substance of the proposal, for approval by the Committee on Educational Policy. The C.E.P., after
consultation with departments and programs substantially affected by a proposal, will vote on each propos-
al individually and will report the decision to the Contract Major Advisor, who will notify students and
sponsors before the spring registration deadline. If the time needed for C.E.P. review demands it, the Con-
tract Major Advisor may postpone notification to students and permit them to register late without penalty.
In making its decisions, the C.E.P. considers the student's academic record, the coherence and feasibility of
the plan of study, and the degree of support expressed by the faculty sponsors and, if appropriate, program
chairs.
Subsequent changes in a Contract Major must be requested in writing by the student and approved by
the faculty sponsors as well as by the Contract Major Advisor. Where there has been substantial alteration
of the original program, the Contract Major Advisor will forward the student's written request to the C.E.P.
for reconsideration.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN THE CONTRACT MAJOR
The route to the degree with honors in the Contract Major will normally be a senior thesis requiring two
semesters and a winter study of work. In special circumstances a student may propose to substitute a one-
semester course or a winter study course for one of his or her thesis courses and write a mini-thesis. The
Contract Major with honors shall comprise a minimum of eleven semester courses or ten semester courses
plus one winter study. One semester of independent study undertaken for the thesis may be allowed to
fulfill the requirement for a senior major course.
The faculty sponsors shall determine by the end of winter study whether the student is to be admitted to
honors candidacy. If not admitted to honors candidacy, the student may elect not to continue further inde-
pendent study. If admitted to honors candidacy, the student shall submit a written thesis or minithesis to
three faculty readers, at least one of whom shall be a faculty sponsor and at least one of whom shall not be a
faculty sponsor. The outside reader or readers shall be selected by the Contract Major Advisor in consulta-
tion with the faculty sponsors. There will be a one-hour oral exam by the readers, and they shall make a
final decision regarding honors.

CRITICAL LANGUAGES (Div. I)
Coordinator, JANE CANOVA
The Critical Languages Program enables students to study important foreign languages not taught in
regular courses at Williams. The languages offered are Arabic, Hebrew, Hindi, Korean, and Swahili. Each
may be studied for one year at the elementary level.
All courses adhere to the guidelines of the National Association of Self-Instructional Language Pro-
grams (NASILP). Students work independently with standard language textbooks and individual cassette
tapes for roughly ten hours per week and attend two one-hour group review sessions per week with native-
speaking tutors. Language faculty from other institutions conduct the midterm and final exams and deter-
mine the final grades.
To be eligible for a Critical Languages course, the student must:
z demonstrate proven capability for independent work and previous success in foreign language study;
z explain how study of the language will integrate with his or her major or other academic interests;
z present a letter of recommendation from a Williams faculty member;
z in some cases take a pretest for placement;
z have attained sophomore standing or higher;
z have at least a 3.00 Grade Point Average.
Interested students should obtain an application form for the desired course in early April. Forms are
available at the Center for Foreign Languages, Literatures, and Cultures in Weston Hall. Students must
Critical Languages, Economics
­ 130 ­
meet with the program coordinator and hand in the completed application forms no later than one week
before preregistration. The application must be approved before registering for the course.
Students should note that Critical Languages courses are hyphenated, meaning no credit is given for the
first semester until the second semester is successfully completed. Students must normally begin a course
in the fall semester. It cannot be taken Pass/Fail.
A Critical Languages course will be scheduled only if and when at least two students are accepted into
the course. Students planning to register for the course must attend an organizational meeting the first week
of each semester.

MAJOR
Students who are beginning their sequence with Economics 110 or Economics 120 should follow the
following sequence:
Economics 110 Principles of Microeconomics
Economics 120 Principles of Macroeconomics
(Economics 110 and 120 may be taken separately and in any order)
Economics 251 Price and Allocation Theory
or Economics 251M Price and Allocation Theory (This section of the Price and Allocation
Theory course will employ a somewhat more mathematical exposition of microtheory.)
Economics 252 Macroeconomics
One statistical methods course, Economics 253 or 255, or Statistics 201 and 346. (The statistical meth-
ods course should be taken before 401.)
Three Economics electives, of which at least two must be selected from advanced electives numbered
350 to 394
Economics 401 Senior Seminar
To complete the major, economics students must receive a passing grade on the oral examination given
in the course of Economics 401. A student who fails the oral examination must re-take the exam and re-
ceive a passing grade.
The primary objectives of the major are to develop an understanding of economic aspects of contempo-
rary life and to equip the student to analyze economic issues of social policy. The introductory courses
stress use of the basic elements of economic analysis for understanding and resolving such issues. The two
required intermediate theory courses then provide a more thorough grounding in economics as a discipline
by examining the strengths and weaknesses of the price system in allocating economics resources and by
examining the aggregate processes which determine employment, inflation, and growth. A course in statis-
tical methods (253 or 255, or alternatively, Statistics 201 plus Statistics 346) equips the major to understand
and apply the basic tools of quantitative empirical analysis. Majors must take three electives, in at least two
of which they apply parts of the theory learned in the required intermediate theory courses. In the senior
seminar, the student studies a series of current theoretical or policy problems, applying analysis and re-
search methods.
Note that students cannot take Economics 110 or 120 without having passed the quantitative studies exam
or the equivalent.)
The normal requirement that nine economics courses be taken at Williams will usually be waived only
on the basis of transferred credit deemed acceptable by the department. Credit is granted based on grades
consistent with college policy on various examinations:
Economics
­ 131 ­
z Students who receive a 5 on the Microeconomics AP or Macroeconomics AP exam, or a 5 on each,
may place out of Economics 110 or 120, or both, respectively, but major credit will be given for only
one course.
z The Department will grant major credit for both Economics 110 and 120 to a student who receives a
6 or 7 on the higher-level Economics IB examination, and that student can place into any 200-level
course or intermediate-level micro or macro course.
z For A levels credit, the Department will grant major credit for both Economics 110 and 120 to a
student who receives a grade of A or B.
Prospective majors please note that instructors in all sections of Economics 251, 252, 253, and 255 feel
free to use elementary calculus in assigned readings, lectures, problem sets, and examinations; therefore,
Economics 110 and 120 and Mathematics 103 or its equivalent are required as prerequisites for these
courses except for 251 which only requires Economics 110 and Mathematics 103 as a prerequisite. By
elementary calculus is meant differentiation of single variable polynomial functions and conditions for a
maximum or minimum; it does not include integration or multivariable calculus. Instructors in advanced
electives (courses numbered 350-394) may also use elementary calculus in assigned readings, lectures,
problem sets, and examinations. Students interested in graduate study in economics will need to study
more advanced mathematics; see your advisor for specific suggestions. Students are also reminded that
some courses now have specific mathematics requirements; see course descriptions.
Graduate training in economics requires more mathematical sophistication than does undergraduate
economics. We encourage students who are considering pursuing a Ph.D. in Economics to take Economics
251M, Economics 255, Mathematics 105 (or 106), Mathematics 209, Mathematics 211 and Mathematics
301. As graduate schools also look for evidence of research experience and promise, we strongly encour-
age interested students to write a senior honors thesis in Economics.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN ECONOMICS
We encourage all majors who have at least a 3.5 GPA in economics courses to consider honors. To be
admitted to candidacy for honors in economics a student must complete a substantial piece of independent
research. Two routes to honors are open: the Specialization Route and the Thesis Route.
1) Specialization Route, consisting of these three units:
a. Development of a thesis proposal in the second module of Economics 401;
b. An honors winter study project (W30) in January of the senior year;
c. Economics 404 Honors Seminar.
Students who have notified the department of their interest in writing an honors thesis will use the sec-
ond module of Economics 401 to develop a thesis proposal. Such proposals frequently build on research
papers completed for advanced electives, but this is not a requirement. If the proposal is accepted, the stu-
dent will be admitted to W30. The department provides a memorandum to majors with more details every
spring and fall.
2) Thesis Route (Economics 493-W31-494):
A few students each year will be accepted for year-long thesis research on a subject closely related to the
scholarly interests of a faculty member. A student who hopes to do such independent and advanced re-
search in close association with a faculty member should begin to work out a mutually satisfactory topic
early in the second semester of his or her junior year. Application to the department must be made before
the end of the junior year by submitting a detailed proposal for work under the supervision of the faculty
member. The WSP of the senior year is also spent on the thesis.
The College Bulletin states that students who wish to receive honors must take at least one course in
addition to the minimum number required for the major. Students who pursue a year-long thesis and there-
fore take both Economics 493 and 494 may substitute Economics 493 for an upper-level elective if they
wishto.StudentswhopursuetheSpecializationRouteto Honors may not substitute Economics 404 for an
upper- (or lower-) level elective requirement.
AFRICAN-AMERICAN STUDIES AND AREA STUDIES
A major in economics who concentrates in African-American or Area Studies may substitute the non-
economics courses in the concentration for one lower-level elective in the Economics major, but not for an
advanced elective (350-394).
Note on Course Numbers: Courses between 201 and 240 are lower-level electives and are open to first-
year students who have taken 110 or 120 (or 101). Courses between 260 and 349 are intermediate electives
which do not build on specific prior experience, but do require some maturity, so they have any two eco-
nomics courses or permission of instructor as prerequisites. Courses 350 and above are advanced electives
primarily designed for Economics and Political Economy majors and have intermediate theory prerequi-
sites.
ECON 110(F,S) Principles of Microeconomics (Q)
This course is an introduction to the study of the forces of supply and demand that determine prices and the
allocation of resources in markets for goods and services, markets for labor, and markets for natural re-
sources. The focus is on how and why markets work, why they may fail to work, and the policy implica-
Economics
­ 132 ­
tions of both their successes and failures. The course focuses on developing the basic tools of microeco-
nomic analysis and then applying those tools to topics of popular or policy interest such as minimum wage
legislation, pollution control, competition policy, international trade policy, discrimination, tax policy, and
the role of government in a market economy. This course is required of Economics majors and highly
recommended for those non-majors interested in Environmental Studies, Women's and Gender Studies
and Political Economy. The department recommends that students follow this course with Principles of
Macroeconomics or with a lower-level elective that has Economics 110 as its prerequisite. Students may
alternatively proceed directly to Intermediate Microeconomics after taking this introductory course.

An introduction to the study of the aggregate national economy. Develops the basic theories of macroeco-
nomics and applies them to topics of current interest. Explores issues such as: the causes of inflation, un-
employment, recessions, and depressions; the role of government fiscal and monetary policy in stabilizing
the economy; the determinants of long-run economic growth; the long- and short-run effects of taxes, bud-
get deficits, and other government policies on the national economy; and the workings of exchange rates
and international trade. Economics 110 and 120 may be taken in either order.

ECON 203(F) Gender and Economics (Same as Women's and Gender Studies 203)
This course uses economic analysis to explore how gender differences can lead to differences in economic
outcomes, in both households and the labor market. Questions to be covered include: How does the family
function as an economic unit? How do individuals allocate time between the labor market and the house-
hold? How have changes in family structure affected women's employment, and vice-versa? What are
possible explanations for gender differences in labor force participation, occupational choice, and earn-
ings? What is the role of government in addressing gender issues in the home and the workplace? How
successful are government policies that primarily affect women (e.g., comparable worth policies, AFDC/
TANF, subsidization of child care)? The course will focus on the current experience of women in the
United States, but will place these gender differences in a historical and cross-cultural context.

ECON 204(S) Economic Development in Poor Countries (Same as Environmental Studies
234)*
This is an introduction to the economies and development problems of the poorer countries in Africa, Asia,
and Latin America. We shall discover both the roots and the extent of these problems, and explore possible
solutions. The course begins by investigating how different socio-historical environments have shaped
various third world economies. Then, keeping this in context, it attempts to get an idea of the best feasible
policies to tackle a whole range of critical development issues. These issues include poverty and its
alleviation, the population explosion, employment and migration patterns, raising education and health
standards, and making agriculture and industry more efficient. Finally, we will consider some broader
international issues--like patterns of trade, foreign aid, and the international debt crisis.
Each student will be expected to study these issues for an individual country or region, attempting to get an
idea of the socio-economic context from reading examples of relevant third world literature.

Over the past twenty years, China has undergone an unprecedented economic turnaround. Since opening
the economy, average incomes in China have quadrupled and over 250 million people have been lifted out
of poverty. In this course, we will study the transformation of China's economy from several perspectives.
First, we will study the wildly successful transition of China from a commune-based economy to ``market
socialism.'' Within this study, we will discuss the ways that institutions and organizational structures in
China have led to and have been changed by the economy in transition. We will then discuss the effects of
trade on China's economy, and conclude by exploring the effect of China's rapid economic expansion on
the environment. Throughout the course, we will consider ways China's economy will continue to change

understanding of theoretical concepts as they apply to real-world environmental problems. Particular atten-
tion is given to situations where the free market fails to provide optimal outcomes. The theory includes
externalities, public goods, common property resources, taxes, standards, tradable pollution permits, and
inter-temporal discounting. Topics include benefit-cost analysis, non-market valuation, choice of different
policy instruments (i.e., command-and-control versus market-based), renewable and non-renewable re-
source management, economic growth and the environment, and international environmental treaties.

problems of health and health care markets. The course focuses on three broad issues: the inputs to health
and the demand for health care, the structure and consequences of public and private health insurance, and
the supply of health care. Special attention will be devoted to topics of current public concern, including the
problems of rising costs and cost containment, health insurance reform, the changing nature of health care
provision, changing public policies in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, hospital competition, and the

ECON 351(F) Tax Policy (Q) (W)
The tax system is a major element of public policy. In addition to raising revenue for government
expenditure programs, policymakers use the tax system to redistribute resources and to promote a variety
of economic policies. For example, the United States tax system has specific rules to encourage savings,
education, and investment. Inherently, many tax policy choices involve trade-offs between equity and
efficiency. The purpose of this course is to clarify the goals and possibilities of tax policy, mainly through
an examination of U.S. federal tax policy (though the search for possible reforms may lead us to examine
policies from other countries). The course will examine the choice of the tax base (income or
consumption), notations of fairness in taxation (e.g., the rate structure), the choice to tax corporate income
separately from personal income, and a variety of specific tax policy issues (e.g., retirement saving, child
care, the "marriage" tax, capital gains taxation, and the taxation of housing).

ECON 353(F) Decision Theory (Q)
Studies of decision-making suggest that most people substantially violate even undemanding models of
rationality. Are people truly irrational, and, if so, can anything be done about it? This course focuses on
normative decision-making (how we should make decisions under general conditions), descriptive deci-
sion-making (how we do make decisions under actual conditions), and the contrast between the two. We
proceed to a view of prescriptive decision-making, or how we might combine normative and descriptive
insights to improve decision-making and judgment. Topics include decision-analytic methods for improv-
ing decision-making rigor (e.g., decision trees); microeconomic concepts and tools for optimization prob-
lems; game theory as appropriate; insights from cognitive psychology on heuristics (short cuts) that some-
times help, but often distort, decision-making; integrated models of judgment that call for both analysis and
intuition; insights from the newly-emerging studies of judgment and wisdom. Until a few years ago, this
topic was given normative treatment in departments of engineering, statistics and economics, and was sep-
arately taught as a descriptive science in departments of psychology. The apparent value of combining the
two into a single, prescriptive analysis of decision-making and judgment has led to a recent wave of inter-
disciplinary approaches such as the one adopted in this course.
Requirements: multiple problems and case analyses, one project, final exam.

empirical techniques, known generally as macroeconometrics, which are designed to meet the practical
challenges that the data and the empirical questions pose in these fields. The course will introduce the
theory and application of these techniques, and students will learn how to implement these techniques
using real world data to address practical questions drawn from the fields of macro, international finance
and development. Topics to which these techniques will be applied include business cycle analysis and
forecasting, sources of exchange rate volatility and determinants of long run economic growth. Computer
work and programming will be an integral part of the course, but no previous training is expected.
Format: seminar. Requirements: short empirical projects, midterm, term paper.
Prerequisites: Economics 255 or equivalent and Economics 252. Enrollment limit: 20 (expected: 20).

ECON 374T(S) Poverty and Public Policy (W)
Since 1965, the annual poverty rate in the United States has hovered between 10 and 15 percent, though far
more than 15 percent of Americans experience poverty at some point in their lives. In this course, we will
study public policies that, explicitly or implicitly, have as a goal improving the well-being of the poor in
this country. These policies include safety net programs (Aid to Families with Dependent Children/Tempo-
rary Assistance to Needy Families, Food Stamps, Medicaid, and housing assistance), education programs
(Head Start and public primary and secondary education), and parts of the tax code (the Earned Income
Tax Credit). We will explore the design and functioning of these programs, focusing on questions econo-
mists typically ask when evaluating public policy: Does the policy achieve its goals? Does the design of the
policy lead to unintended effects (either good or bad)? Could it be redesigned to achieve its goals in a more
cost-effective manner? Through in-depth study of these programs, students will learn how economists
bring theoretical models and empirical evidence to bear on important questions of public policy.
Format: tutorial. Evaluation will be based on six 5- to 7-page papers and on the quality of the student's oral
presentations and commentary on the work of his/her colleagues.
Prerequisites: Economics 253 or 255 or Statistics 201 or permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 10

ECON 382(S) Industrial Organization
This course examines the interaction of firms and consumers in monopoly and imperfectly competitive
markets. We begin with an investigation of how firms acquire market power. Using game theoretic models,
we then analyze the strategic interaction between firms to study their ability to protect and exploit market
power. Aspects of strategic decision-making that we shall study include: price discrimination, product
selection, firm reputation, bundling and collusion. We conclude with a discussion of the role of anti-trust
policy. Theoretical models will be supplemented with case studies and empirical papers.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: There will be several problem sets as well as a midterm and
final examination. A group paper and presentation will also be required.

ECON 383(S) Cities, Regions and the Economy
Cities and urbanization can have significant impacts on the economy. In many developed economies, a
process of regional decline is associated with older, industrial cities. In developing countries, the process of
Economics
­ 137 ­
economic growth is generally associated with increasing urbanization. Urbanization, with its increasing
concentration of population and production, puts particular pressure on markets to allocate resources for
provision of land, housing, transportation, labor and public goods. Urbanization can alter the productivity
of land, labor, and capital in ways that can improve the welfare of residents and the performance of the
broader economy. In this course we will examine these conflicting economic forces and examine some
recent research that contributes to our understanding of the difference between regional growth and
decline, and the role that the urban structure plays in these processes. We will examine the function of land,
housing, transportation, and labor markets in the urban context, and the scope for public policies to
improve the performance of the regional economy.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: two midterms and a research paper.

ECON 384(F) Corporate Finance (Q)
This course is similar to Economics 317, but it is at a more advanced level and is especially designed for
economics and political economy majors. While 317 focuses on financial markets, 384 is a managerial
perspective of how managers operate in these markets. This course analyzes the major financial decisions
facing firms. Topics include capital budgeting, links between real and financial investments, capital struc-
ture choice, dividend policy, and firm valuation. Additional topics may include issues in corporate gover-
nance, managerial incentives and compensation, and corporate restructuring, such as mergers and acquisi-
tions. A student may not receive credit for both 317 and 384.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: problem sets, short projects such as case write ups, midterm,
and a final exam.
Prerequisites: Economics 251, 252, and some familiarity with statistics (e.g., Economics 253 or 255). En-
rollment limit: 20 (expected: 20). Preference given to senior Economics majors.

This course considers environmental protection and natural resource management as an element of devel-
opment policy and planning. Economic concepts are applied to environmental and natural resource prob-
lems as they relate to developing countries. Questions to be covered include the following: How do institu-
tions affect patterns of resource use? What is the relationship between economic growth and demand for
environmental quality? How does trade affect environmental quality and resource exploitation? What are
the tradeoffs between efficiency and equity when it comes to environmental protection and natural re-
source management? What are strategies for measuring and implementing sustainable development?
Course subject matter consists of a combination of analytical models and country-specific studies.

ECON 503(F) Public Finance
Public finance is the branch of economics concerned with government expenditure and taxation, focusing
primarily on microeconomic aspects of these activities. It provides tools for understanding the effects of
government policies, as well as a useful conceptual framework for analyzing normative questions such as
"what is a good policy?" This seminar will present the basic principles for public finance, and apply them
to topics of particular importance in developing countries. The course will begin by considering the effi-
ciency of market economics, and rationales for government intervention in the market, such as public
goods, externalities, information-based market failures, and equity. Applications include environmental
policy, education, health care, aid to the poor, and social security. We then move on to the economics of
taxation, considering what kinds of taxes are used in developing countries, the economic and distributional
effects of taxation, questions of administration and evasion, and options for reform such as the value added
tax. Time permitting, we may also address topics such as pubic enterprises, political economy, and decen-

ECON 505(S) Finance and Development
This course focuses on the financial system and its role in economic development. The first part explores
the functions of finance, how it contributes to growth, and reviews different models of financial sector
development and their influence on how governments viewed the sector. It will examine experiences with
financial sector repression and subsequent liberalization, and investigate the causes and impact of financial
crises. Then it will study how to make finance effective and how to prevent or minimize crises, analyzing
government's role as regulator, supervisor, standard setter, contract enforcer, and owner. In this final part,
attention will be devoted to the role of institutions (laws, norms, culture) and incentives in financial sector
development.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: two short papers, midterm, and a final exam.
Prerequisites: Economics 251, 252 and 509. Enrollment limit: 30 (expected: 25-30). Undergraduate en-
rollment limited and only accepted with instructor's permission.

ECON 509(F) Developing Country Macroeconomics
This course focuses on the relationship between macroeconomic policies and economic growth in devel-
oping countries. After examining the links between macroeconomic stability and long-run growth, the rest
of the course is divided into three parts. The first part is devoted to the construction of an analytical model
that is suitable for analyzing a wide variety of macroeconomic issues in developing countries. This model
provides the general framework for a more specific analysis of fiscal and monetary policies in the two
remaining parts. In analyzing fiscal policy, the course will consider in particular the requirements of fiscal
solvency and the contribution that fiscal policy can make to macroeconomic stability. It will also examine
alternative methods for achieving fiscal credibility, including the design of fiscal institutions. The final part
of the course will turn to an analysis of central banking, focusing on central bank independence, time con-
sistency of monetary policy, and the design of monetary policy rules in small open economies.

Readings will include topics that are frequently part of the dialogue between a nation's institutions and
international ones such as growth and stability, structural reform, financial sector stability, poverty, techni-
cal assistance, and governance. Tutorial participants will meet once a week in pairs with the faculty mem-
ber. Each week, one student will prepare a policy paper and submit the paper to the professor and to the
other student in advance of the meeting. During the meeting, the student who has written the paper will
present an argument, evidence, and conclusions. The other student will provide a detailed critique of the
paper based on concepts and evidence from the readings. The professor will join the discussion after each
participant has presented and ask questions that highlight or illustrate critical points. During a semester,
each participant will write and present 5 or 6 policy papers and a like number of critiques.
Enrollment will be limited to 10 students who will meet weekly in five groups of 2.

COURSES AND COURSE-NUMBERING
The course offerings in English enable students, whether majors or non-majors, to explore literature in a
variety of ways, and to satisfy their interests in particular authors, literary periods, and genres. They empha-
size interpretive skills, systematic and critical thinking, and careful attention to the generic, cultural, and
historical contexts of literature written in English.
100-LEVEL COURSES
At the introductory level, the department offers a range of writing-intensive 100-level courses which
focus on interpretive skills--techniques of reading--as well as skills in writing and argumentation. The
department also offers English 150, Expository Writing, a course focusing on rudimentary writing skills.
All 100-level courses are designed primarily for first-year students, although they are open to interested
sophomores, juniors, and seniors. A 100-level course other than 150 is required for admission to most up-
per-level English courses, except in the case of students who have placed out of the introductory courses by
receiving a score of 5 on the Advanced Placement examination in English Literature or of 6 or 7 on the
International Baccalaureate.
200-LEVEL COURSES
Most 200-level courses are designed primarily for qualified first-year students, sophomores, and junior
and senior non-majors, but they are open to junior and senior majors and count as major courses. Several
200-level courses have no prerequisites; see individual descriptions for details. 200-level Gateway courses
are designed for first- and second-year students who are considering becoming English Majors, or who are
interested in pursuing upper-level course work in the department. All Gateway courses are writing-inten-
sive. Completion of a Gateway course is a requirement for the major.
300-LEVEL COURSES
The majority of English Department courses are at the 300 level. 300-level courses are open to sopho-
mores, juniors, and seniors. They are normally not open to first-year students, although in exceptional cases
first-year students may enroll in a 300-level course with consent of the instructor.
400-LEVEL COURSES
400-level courses are intensive, discussion-oriented classes that place a premium on independent, stu-
dent-initiated work. Such classes can be structured in a variety of ways. A course might alternate tutorial
sessions with seminar meetings, or it might take the form of a colloquium, with discussions organized
around individual or group presentations on different aspects of a topic. Or a class might be oriented around
a long final paper on a topic of the student's devising and involve conferences focused on the progress of
that project. Limited to 15 students, 400-level courses are open to students who have completed at least one
300-level English course; they should be attractive to any student interested in a course that emphasizes
intensive discussion and independent work.
ADVISING
All junior and senior English majors are assigned a departmental faculty member as an advisor. Stu-
dents' preferences for advisors are solicited during the preregistration period in April, and assignments are
announced at the start of the school year.
Non-majors who wish to discuss English Department offerings are invited to see any faculty member or
the department chair.
MAJOR
Majors are urged to select a balance of intermediate and advanced courses, and to choose classes from
both the American and British traditions. Each student can fashion his or her own sequence of study within
a basic pattern that insures coherence and variety. This pattern comprises at least nine courses.
They are also urged to elect collateral courses in subjects such as art, music, history, comparative litera-
ture, philosophy, religion, theatre, and foreign languages with a view to supporting and broadening their
studies in literature. In particular, the study of classical and modern languages, as well as of foreign litera-
tures, is strongly recommended.
Requirements
The nine courses required for the major must include the following:
1) Any 100-level English class except English 150. Students exempted by the department from 100-lev-
el courses will substitute an elective course.
English
­ 142 ­
2) At least two courses dealing primarily with literature written before 1700 (identified in parentheses at
the end of the course description).
3) At least two courses dealing primarily with literature written between 1700 and 1900 (identified in
parentheses at the end of the course description).
4) At least one course dealing primarily with literature written after 1900 (identified in parentheses at the
end of the course description).
5) At least one "criticism" course (identified in parentheses at the end of course description). A course
fulfilling the criticism requirement entails a sustained and explicit reflection on problems of critical meth-
od, whether by engaging a range of critical approaches and their implications or by exploring a particular
method, theorist, or critic in depth. Please note that when a criticism course also deals with literature satis-
fying a historical distribution requirement (pre-1700, 1700-1900, etc.), the course may be used to satisfy
either the criticism or the chronological requirement, but not both.
6) At least one 200-level Gateway course (listed at the end of the 200-level course descriptions). Gate-
way courses are designed for first- and second-year students contemplating the major or intending to pur-
sue more advanced work in the department; these courses focus on analytical writing skills while introduc-
ing students to critical methods and historical approaches that will prove fruitful as they pursue the major.
(Note: a Gateway course can fulfill a Period or Criticism requirement as well as a Gateway requirement.)
The department will now give one elective course credit toward the major for a course taken in
literature of a foreign language, whether the course is taught in the original language or in transla-
tion. Such a course may not be used to satisfy the department's historical distribution, criticism, or
gateway requirements.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN ENGLISH
The English Department offers three different routes toward honors: a creative writing thesis, a critical
thesis, and a critical specialization. The requirements of each are described below. Candidates for the pro-
gram should normally have at least a 3.5 average in courses taken in English, but admission will not de-
pend solely on course grades. Formal application to pursue honors must be made to the director of honors
by April of the junior year. For the Class of 2006, the Director of Honors is Professor John Kleiner.
All routes require honors students to take a minimum of TEN regular-semester courses (rather than the
nine otherwise required for the major), and to devote their senior year winter study course to their honors
projects. More specifically:
Students doing a creative writing thesis must, by graduation, take at least nine regular-semester courses,
and, in addition, take English 497 (Honors Independent Study, fall) and English 031 (Honors Thesis, win-
ter study) during senior year.
Students writing a critical thesis must, by graduation, take at least eight regular-semester courses, and, in
addition, take English 497 and English 498 (Honors Independent Study, fall and spring) and English 031
(Senior Thesis, winter study) during senior year.
Students pursuing a critical specialization must, by graduation, take at least eight regular-semester
courses, and in addition, take English 497 and English 498 (Honors Independent Study, fall and spring)
and English 030 (Honors Colloquium: Specialization Route, winter study) during senior year.
A student who is highly-qualified to pursue honors, but who, for compelling reasons, is unable to pursue
a year-long project, may petition the department for permission to pursue a critical thesis or critical special-
ization over one semester and the winter study term. Since the norm for these projects is a full year, such
permission will be granted only in exceptional circumstances. If granted, the standards for admission and
for evaluating the final project would be identical to those that apply to year-long honors projects.
All students who wish to apply to the honors program are required to consult with a prospective faculty
advisor, as well as with the director of honors, before April of the junior year. In April, candidates submit a
1-page preliminary proposal that provides as specific a description as possible of the proposed project. The
director of honors reviews proposals with the faculty advisor, and then makes a recommendation to the
whole department. Students whose proposals are accepted receive provisional admission to the program at
this time. Students not admitted to the honors program are advised, when appropriate, about other possible
ways of pursuing their interests (e.g., independent studies, regular departmental courses).
Admitted students must consult with their advisors before the end of the spring semester of junior year
to discuss reading or work pertinent to writing the formal honors prospectus. This prospectus is a decisive
factor in final admission to the program. The prospectus must be submitted to the Director of Honors and
the advisor (two copies) by July 30 before the fall of senior year. After reviewing the prospectuses and
consulting with advisors, the department's honors committee determines final admission to the program.
Applicants are notified during the first week of the fall term.
While grades for the fall and winter study terms are deferred until both the honors project and review
process are completed, students must do the equivalent of at least B+ work to continue in the program.
Should the student's work in the fall semester not meet this minimal standard, the course will convert to a
standard independent study (English 397), and the student will register for a regular winter study project. A
student engaged in a year-long project must likewise perform satisfactorily in winter study (English 030 or
031) to enroll in English 498 in the spring semester. When such is not the case, the winter study course will
be converted to an independent study "99."

Students are required to submit to their advisor, on the due dates specified below, three final copies of
their written work. While letter grades for honors courses are assigned by the faculty advisor, the recom-
mendation about honors is made by two other faculty members, who serve as readers of the student's
work. These readers, after consulting with the faculty advisor, report their recommendation to the whole
department, which awards either Highest Honors, Honors, or no honors. Honors of any kind are contin-
gent upon satisfactory completion of courses in the major during the spring semester of the senior year.
Highest honors are normally awarded only to students whose performance in both the honors program and
regular courses in the major has been exceptional. All students who are awarded honors participate in a
series of informal presentations at the end of the spring term in senior year.
Creative Writing Thesis
The creative writing thesis involves the completion of a significant body of fiction or poetry during the
fall semester and winter study of the senior year. (With permission of the honors committee, the thesis may
be undertaken during the winter study period and the spring semester of the senior year.) Since a student
will most likely include in the thesis writing done in earlier semesters, a creative writing thesis usually
involves only the fall semester and the winter study period, rather than the full year allotted to complete the
critical essay.
Requirements for admission include outstanding work in an introductory and an advanced workshop, a
recommendation from one of the creative writing teachers (who will then act as thesis advisor), a brief
preliminary proposal, and the approval of the departmental honors committee. No formal prospectus is
necessary. A creative writing thesis begun in the fall is due on the last day of winter study. The methods of
evaluation are identical to those for critical projects (but their page limits do not apply).
Critical Thesis
The critical thesis involves writing a substantial scholarly and/or critical essay during both semesters as
well as the winter study period of the senior year. The formal prospectus, a 2- to 3-page description of the
thesis project, should present a coherent proposal indicating the range of the thesis, the questions to be
investigated, the methods to be used, and the arguments likely to be considered, along with a brief bibliog-
raphy.
Significant progress on the thesis, including a substantial amount of writing (to be determined by student
and advisor), is required by the end of the fall semester. A first draft of the thesis must be completed by the
end of the winter study period. The spring semester is to be devoted to revising and refining the work and to
shaping its several chapters into a unified argument. Ideally, the length of the honors essay will be about
15,000 words (roughly 45 pages). In no case should the thesis be longer than 25,000 words, including
notes. The finished thesis is due on the second Friday following spring break.
Critical Specialization
The critical specialization route is intended to provide students with an opportunity for making a series
of forays into an area of interest that is both broad in scope and related to work undertaken in at least two
courses. At least one of these courses must be in the English Department, and both need to have been taken
by the end of fall term in senior year. The critical specialization must be united by a common area of inter-
est, such as a given literary form or historical period, a topic that cuts across several periods, an issue in
literary theory, a topic that connects literary and cultural issues, a comparative literature or interdisciplinary
topic. Students are encouraged to propose specialization topics of their own devising. The following exam-
ples are meant only to suggest the kinds of topics appropriate to a critical specialization: lyric traditions,
postmodern narrative, magic realism, Dante and modern literature, Freud and literature, the poet as citizen,
new historicist approaches to literature, feminist film criticism.
In addition to reading primary works, the student is expected to read secondary sources, which describe
or define issues critical to the area of specialization. The formal prospectus, a 2- to 3-page description of the
project, should specify the area and range of the study, the issues likely to be explored, and the methods to
be used for their investigation. This prospectus should also describe the relation between previous course
work and the proposed specialization, and include a brief bibliography of secondary works. The pursuit of
the specialization route requires the following: (1) writing a set of three essays, each about 10 pages long (a
page being approximately 250 words), which together advance a flexibly-related set of arguments. The
first two essays are due by the end of the fall semester, and the third by the end of winter study; (2) develop-
ing an extended annotated bibliography (about 4-5 pages long) of selected secondary sources, explaining
their importance to the area of specialization (due mid-February); (3) meeting with the three faculty evalu-
ators (one of whom is the advisor) during the last two weeks in February to discuss the trio of essays and
the annotated bibliography; (4) writing a fourth essay of 10-12 pages, the purpose of which is to consider
matters that arose during the faculty-student discussion and to reflect on the evolution and outcome of the
intellectual journey undertaken by the student. This final essay is due on the second Friday after spring
break.
The same three faculty members are involved throughout the assessment process, and the standards and
methods of evaluation are the same as for other kinds of honors projects, with the following exception: For
the specialization route, the evaluation will also include the student's performance in the discussion with
the three faculty readers, and that discussion will include not only the student's writing but also secondary
sources.

COURSES
100-LEVEL COURSES (except English 150)
Through small class discussions (limited in size to 19 students per section) and frequent writing
assignments, 100-level English courses ask students to develop their skills as readers and as analyti-
cal writers. Each course assigns 20 pages of writing in various forms. These courses are prerequi-
sites for taking most other English courses. Students who receive a 5 on the AP English Literature
exam may take upper-level courses without first taking a 100-level. All 100-level English courses
are writing intensive.
ENGL 105(S) Poetry and Magic (W)
Ancient Celtic texts--Irish and Welsh--associate the poet (meaning any creator of fiction) with powerful
magic--with shape-shifting, access to the other-world, and visions of transcendent authority and truth. Pla-
to, in his famous condemnation of poetry in The Republic, also associates poetry with magic, but with
magic as a con game or sleight-of-hand trick. This course will use Plato and Celtic texts to establish a
theoretical framework for reading and interpreting the representation of poetry and magic in a variety of
literary works and films from the Middle Ages to the twentieth century. The goal of the course, in addition
to its particular subject matter, is to develop effective reading and writing strategies for works of different
genres and time periods. Reading will include Chaucer's Friar's Tale (where the poet-figure is an evil ma-
gician); David Mamet's film House of Games (where the master of illusion is a con artist); Marlowe's
Doctor Faustus (where the poet-figure sells his soul to the devil for magical power); Shakespeare's A Mid-
summer Night's Dream and The Tempest (where fairies and magic represent the positive powers of imagi-
nation); the "magical" transformations of gender and identity in As You Like It and the documentary film
Paris Is Burning (about the world of gay male balls in Harlem); and short poems by Coleridge, Keats,
Tennyson, and Yeats.
The class will be run as a discussion. Requirements: weekly writing assignments, both formal and infor-
mal, including use of a class listserver and required electronic journal postings. Students will do about 20
pages of writing and will be evaluated on writing and class participation.
No prerequisite. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference to first-year students.

ENGL 112(F) Introduction to Literary Analysis (W)
This course is designed to encourage students to become more responsive readers of literature through the
close study of a small number of works, with frequent written exercises. The emphasis is on learning how
to read different types of imaginative literature, especially poetry, Shakespearean drama, and fiction.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference to first year students.

ENGL 115(F) Narrative and Narrative Experience (W)
Forming and sharing and thinking about stories is our primary way of organizing experience: through them
we make life and the world understandable and open to mastery. In this course we will read narratives
across time, from antiquity to the present day, and across their wide diversity of forms, from poetry to
novels to comic books, from plays to film and television. We will investigate the ways in which narrative
has been put to use as an organizer of experience, and the ways in which it has been put to use in specific
historical and political situations. Possible authors and works include Homer, Sir Gawain and the Green
Knight, Conan Doyle, Joyce, Nabokov, and Shakespeare, among others.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: 20 pages of writing in the form of short papers. No prerequi-
sites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected:19). Preference given to first-year students.
Hour: 1:10-2:25 MR MURPHY
ENGL 117(F) Introduction to Cultural Theory (Same as Comparative Literature 117) (W)
This course has a clear purpose. If you had signed up for a course in biology, you would know that you
were about to embark on the systematic study of living organisms. If you were registered for a course on
the American Civil War, you would know that there had been an armed conflict between the northern and
southern states in the 1860s. But if you decide you want to study "culture," what exactly is it that you are
studying? The aim of this course is not to come up with handy and reassuring definitions for this word, but
to show you why it is so hard to come up with such definitions. People fight about what the word "culture"
means, and our main business will be to get an overview of that conceptual brawl. We will pay special
attention to the conflict between those thinkers who see culture as a realm of freedom or equality or inde-
pendence or critical thought and those thinkers who see culture as a special form of bondage, a prison
without walls. The course will be organized around short theoretical readings by authors ranging from
Matthew Arnold to Constance Penley, but we will also, in order to put our new ideas to the test, watch
several films (Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Silence of the Lambs, The Lord of the Rings) and listen to a lot of
rock & roll. Why do you think culture matters? Once you stop to pose that question, there's no turning
back.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: five short papers totaling about 20 pages, class attendance and
participation.

(See under Linguistics for full description.)
ENGL 123(F,S) Borrowing and Stealing: Originality in Literature and Culture (W)
Someone once said that bad poets borrow and good poets steal, thus suggesting that acts of theft, as well as
their subsequent cover-ups, may lie behind some of the best and seemingly most original works of art in
history. And it's not just the poets. More recently, an exhibition of artworks that employ copyrighted mate-
rial, called "Illegal Art," has directly challenged current U.S. copyright law. Given the ubiquity of visual,
electronic, and audio sampling in contemporary art, one might wonder if anyone even bothers to create
alibis for today's artistic thefts. This course will investigate ideas about artistic and intellectual influence,
inspiration, borrowing, revision, appropriation, and outright stealing. We'll ask a series of questions as we
look at a variety of material, mostly literary, but also visual and musical, that troubles ideas about novel and
derivative art. What's so original about original art? Where does influence stop and plagiarism begin?
What must be forgotten, or remembered, about earlier works of art for a new one to appear to be just
that--new? What becomes of our image of the artist as a lone figure of genius in works that make ample
use of others' material? The course will consider these questions in part by reading various theories of
originality and imitation, as well as recent re-workings of older literary texts, such as a contemporary re-
writing of Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray by novelist Will Self (in a book sub-titled "An Imita-
tion"). We'll listen to music that relies heavily on the sampling of other works, as well as look at collage art
in various forms. In addition we will read new considerations of copyright law by legal scholars to gain
some sense of originality's shifting legal status. Throughout, we'll refine our sense of the relations among
fiction, art, originality, and imitation by studying some of the best acts of artistic and intellectual theft of the
recent past. Possible authors and works to be studied include Wordsworth and Coleridge, Oscar Wilde,
Sigmund Freud, Vladimir Nabokov, Andy Warhol, Will Self, and essays on copyright law.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: 20 pages. of writing in the form of frequent short papers, active

ENGL 125(F) After The Tempest (W)
In the past few decades it has become common to see The Tempest as a play about appropriation and con-
trol. Ironically, however, the play itself has been the victim of numerous appropriations over the past four
centuries by surprisingly different kinds of writers. The play has served as a starting point for all kinds of
literary and cinematic works-romantic, feminist, post-colonial and post-modern, even science fiction. In
fact The Tempest has had a long and varied afterlife; we can hear the imaginative echo of its themes and
images throughout western and non-western literature. Why has the play proven so fascinating and so con-
tinually relevant? How do different interpretations and adaptations interact with Shakespeare's play? What
happens when a writer transforms the play by adapting it to a new genre or a new medium? We will begin
the course with a close reading of the play, an examination of its sources and critical history, and then set off
on an exploration of its literary legacy. Among other works we will probably look at Browning's Caliban
upon Setebos, Ernst Renan's Caliban, Auden's The Sea and the Mirror, George Lamming's The Pleasures
of Exile, Aime Cesaire's Une Tempete. We will also look at a few films, including the 1956 science fiction
classic, The Forbidden Planet, and recent adaptations like Peter Greenaway's Prospero's Books.
Requirements: three short papers (5-7 pages) and several shorter writing assignments, as well as active
participation in class.

ENGL 126(F,S) Stupidity and Intelligence (W)
Stupidity fascinates authors, and they do not merely despise it--they feel it and make us feel it. Why?
Around the same time that psychologists began measuring and ranking intelligence--and stupidity, under
various names, of course occupied the space below (average) intelligence--literary authors were finding
types of stupidity within intelligence. What is stupidity? Why can't it stay sequestered from intelligence? Is
there such a thing as literary stupidity? (Can one be specifically a bad reader not only of books but of life?)
What are the problems of intelligence? We shall be reading stories, novellas, novels, and plays by Melville,
Poe, Henry James, Kafka, Borges, Stoppard, Faulkner, Flaubert, and others.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: active class participation, and five papers totaling 20 pages.

ENGL 128(F) Documentary Film (W)
A course exploring the development of documentary and nonfiction film from 1900 to the present, in
which we will consider both the formal interest and narrative power of particular films, and the way they
shape wider cultural assumptions about technology, identity, and representation.
Films studied will range from the early actualites of the Lumiere Brothers, through masterpieces including
Nanook of the North, Man With a Movie Camera, and The Plow That Broke the Plains, to such recent
works as Fahrenheit 9/11, Grizzly Man, and Taxicab Confessions.
Course requirements include attendance at screenings, active class participation, a series of short responses
and three five-page papers. No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference given to first-

Hour: 8:30-9:45 MW ROSENHEIM
ENGL 129(F) Twentieth-Century Black Poets (W)*
From Langston Hughes to contemporary poets such as Amiri Baraka and Angela Jackson, African Ameri-
can poets have been preoccupied with the relations of poetry to other traditions. Vernacular speech, English
poetry, jazz and other musical forms, folk humor and African mythology have all been seen as essential
sources for black poetry. This course will survey major poets such as Hughes, James Weldon Johnson,
Countee Cullen, Robert Hayden, Gwendolyn Brooks, Baraka, Jackson, and Yusef Komunyakaa, reading
their poems and their essays and interviews about poetic craft. We will ask how black poetry has been
defined and whether there is a single black poetic tradition or several.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: twenty pages of writing in the form of a journal on the readings
and several short papers.

ENGL 130(F,S) J.M. Coetzee (W)
The contemporary South African writer J.M. Coetzee is a master of the art of fiction. In novels of excep-
tional intelligence and unflinching honesty, Coetzee relentlessly explores the human mind and its relation-
ship to the sometimes inhumane world it must inhabit. Although his imaginative findings are often neither
flattering nor reassuring, Coetzee's books are consistently brilliant and thought-provoking, and therefore
deeply satisfying to read. They contain subtle and penetrating reflections upon such wide-ranging topics as
the politics of apartheid, the philosophy of mind, the conventions of storytelling, the logic of torture, the
psychology of sexual desire, and animal consciousness and animal rights. In this course, we will hone our
analytic skills by closely studying a number of Coetzee's novels, including (among others) Waiting for the
Barbarians, Foe, and Elizabeth Costello. In addition, we will read a selection of works by writers who
have had a shaping influence upon Coetzee's imagination, such as Daniel Defoe, Franz Kafka, Fyodor
Dostoyevsky, and Samuel Beckett.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: active class participation and five papers totaling 20 pages.

ENGL 131(F,S) Provincialism (W)
This course is centered on writing about outlying regions, those places that, as the wags tell us, it's great to
be from. The escape from the provinces --literature and historiography are replete with examples --is
made the precondition of an awakening into cultural knowledge; the simple life comes at the price of nar-
rowness. Our task in this course will be to consider how the provinces have been represented in literature
and history and the work that these representations perform. Because the province could not exist without
the urban center, we'll be especially interested in works that describe encounters between the provincial
and the sophisticate: works we take up may include Rousseau's Confessions, Austen's Pride and Preju-
dice, Stendhal's The Red and the Black, Dickens' Great Expectations and biographical materials related to
real-life provincial strivers, from Napoleon to Bill Clinton. We will also discuss and write about the role of
provincialism in national self-definition and the connection of the pastoral and the provincial. Additional
reading will likely include selections from Raymond Williams and Lionel Trilling, as well as a few recent
essays. Format: seminar. Requirements: a number of short papers totaling 15-20 pages.

ENGL 137(S) Shakespeare's Warriors and Politicians (W)
From history, legend, and his own imaginative powers, Shakespeare has fashioned superlative warriors:
Hotspur, Othello, Macbeth, Antony, and Coriolanus are larger-than-life soldiers on the battlefield. They
are, however, frequently undone by love and politics. Hotspur is no match for the shrewd political maneu-
vering of Prince Hal; Othello's love for Desdemona turns to hate through the machinations of the Machia-
vellian Iago; Macbeth is pushed to regicide by his wife; and Antony is twice undone--made "a strumpet's
fool" by Cleopatra and defeated by a mere "boy" in the supreme politician Octavius Caesar. This course
will examine seven plays by Shakespeare, where the virtues and weaknesses of the warrior and the politi-
cian are seen to be in tension: Richard III, Henry IV, Part I, Henry V, Othello, Macbeth, Antony and Cleo-
patra, and Coriolanus. In the last play, Shakespeare portrays the convergence of sex, war, and politics with

ENGL 145(F,S) Reading and Writing Science Fiction (W)
This course will explore some of the themes and techniques of modern science fiction by examining a
range of published stories, while at the same time making some new stories of our own. Writers of fiction
and non-fiction often watch each other with suspicion, as if from opposing sides of an obvious frontier.
Though the goals of both forms of writing--the disciplined articulation of brainy thoughts and mighty
feelings--are similar, there is a tendency in both camps to think their methods different and exclusive. The
conceit of this class is to imagine that constructing a plot and constructing an argument, say, are comple-
mentary skills, and that the tricks and techniques of one type of writing can profitably be applied to the
other. With this in mind, the class is made of two strands twisted together--a creative writing workshop
and a course in critical analysis. There will be short weekly assignments in both types of writing, as well as
two larger projects: an original science fiction short story and a critical essay. Assigned readings will in-
clude stories and essays by Terry Bisson, Octavia Butler, Rachel Pollack, Samuel R. Delaney, Karen Joy
Fowler, Carol Emshwiller, and John Crowley.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: active participation in class and a minimum of 20 pages of
writing, both critical and creative.

well-argued, intelligible and interesting analytical paper. Readings will be taken from a writing handbook
and a collection of essays.
Format: discussion/workshop. Requirements: a substantial amount of writing will be assigned in the form
of short essays. As part of the Critical Reasoning and Analytical Skills initiative, this course will also ask
students to actively engage in a variety of techniques to improve their reasoning and analytical skills.

aspects of film history, including the role of genre and the contrasting narrative and visual conventions
prevailing in Hollywood and in strikingly different national traditions, such as the silent cinema of the So-
viet montage and the French New Wave cinema of the 1960s. Critical readings will be assigned, and we
will examine films by such directors as Eisenstein, Keaton, Murnau, Renoir, Hawks, Welles, Kurosowa,
Hitchcock, Almodovar and Jonze.

ENGL 209(F) American Literature: Origins to 1865 (Same as American Studies 209)
What is American literature? This course will examine the variety of answers that have been made to this
question, and the way that those answers differently articulate both what counts as "America" and what
counts as literature. One tradition will be at the center of the story: from Puritans (such as the poets Edward
Taylor and Anne Bradstreet, and the theologian Jonathan Edwards) through the major writers of the Amer-
ican Renaissance (Emerson, Hawthorne,Thoreau). Along the way, we will consider other American tradi-
tions as well: Native American trickster stories, conquistador literature. In the eighteenth century, we will
take up such Enlightenment writers as Jefferson and Franklin; in the nineteenth, such abolitionist writers as
Douglass and Jacobs. Working through the differences among different figures, eras, and genres we will be
asking what makes a literary tradition: temporal progression, thematic consistency, national identity, etc.?
And consider, too, what the way we construct American literature means for our understanding of the na-
tion today.

ENGL 210(S) American Literature: 1865-Present (Same as American Studies 210)
This course is designed to provide an introduction to American literature from the post-Civil War period to
the present. Beginning with Walt Whitman and Emily Dickinson, we will read a series of influential Amer-
ican texts--both fiction and poetry. We will situate these works not only within the literary movements of
the time (e.g., realism, modernism, and postmodernism), but also within other important historical and cul-
tural occurrences (e.g., immigration and migration, civil rights, commodity culture). Throughout, the em-
phasis will be on the diverse, sometimes conflicting traditions that make up the American literary canon.
Readings may include works by such authors as Twain, Chopin, Chesnutt, Hemingway, Hughes, Hurston,

ENGL 241(F) The African Novel (Same as Comparative Literature 241) (W)*
This class is a chance to read some great novels that you might not otherwise hear about, and to discover a
counter-canon that attempts to combat ideas about Africa produced by the West. We will also, however, be
questioning the idea that there is such a thing as "the African novel." The sheer variety of these books, from
lyrical visions of the pre-colonial past, to bitter allegories of corrupt post-colonial regimes and fantastical
visions of the contemporary city, defies easy categorization.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: the class will involve a lot of discussion, as well as writing.
There will be regular short response papers and email assignments, leading up to two longer papers.

ENGL 242(F) Reading and Writing Biography (W)
Participants in this course will not only examine biography as a literary form but also learn how to research
and write a short book-length biography. We will begin by reading excerpts from biographies, plays, and
other sources that invite critical thinking about such issues as the authority and status of different kinds of
evidence, the demands of "telling a story" about a life, and the kinds of choices a biographer might con-
front in order to shape that story. These issues will continue to come into focus during the practical part of
the course, as students work to impose order on biographical materials uncovered through research. During
the course of the term, students will work independently on a biographical subject of their choice, meeting
regularly with the instructor to discuss problems and progress. About halfway through the semester, the
class will convene for several sessions as a workshop, where each student will present his or her work-in-
progress for the group to critique. By the end of the semester, each student will have completed a set of
materials similar to a proposal for submission to a publisher: a sample chapter, an outline for the whole
book with a brief synopsis of each chapter, and a selection of illustrations with captions.
Students are encouraged to select their biographical subject before the first class meeting, and to be imagi-
native in choosing a subject: for example, it could be a well-known political, literary, or scientific figure,
including one relevant to another course, or it could be a family member about whom they would wish to
know more.
Format: discussion/workshop. Prerequisites: a 100-level English course, except 150, or permission of the

ENGL 244T(S) Kids (W)
A tutorial designed to explore the interpretive difficulties and possibilities posed by child narrators in con-
temporary American fiction. Tobias Wolff has said that, "Except for very small children, everyone is re-
sponsible in some way for the situation in which he finds himself." If we let children off the hook in terms
of individual responsibility, what becomes of the notion of agency in a narrative with a child at the helm?
What are the particular problems involved in constructing and negotiating a child narrator's voice? What
are the implications of presenting the complexities of an emotional life through a limited vocabulary? Chil-
dren, according to Americans, inhabit the land of innocence and possibility. But childhood is, by definition,
also a place of mystery, a place potentially without lucid or ordered notions of possibility. How do contem-
porary American authors represent that mystery, and its attendant anxieties, in clarifying ways? Course
readings may include Edwin Mullhouse: The Life and Death of an American Writer 1943-1954 by Jeffrey
Cartwright by Steven Millhauser, Ellen Foster by Kaye Gibbons, The House on Mango Street by Sandra
Cisneros, Housekeeping by Marilynne Robinson, The Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold, Jim the Boy by Tony
Earley, and short fiction by Junot Diaz, Sherman Alexie, Mary Robison, A.M. Homes, Gish Jen, among
others.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: students will meet in pairs with the instructor once a week; one student will
present a short analytical paper on the texts covered that week, and the other will write a response paper
and join the instructor in a discussion of both papers. Evaluation will be based on the quality of written
work, discussions and oral presentations.

ENGL 247(F) Colonial Subjects (W)
Whatever else it did, British colonial expansion generated a lot of fascinating, disturbing cultural materi-
al--travel narratives by British government and company officials, by common sailors and soldiers, and
by colonized subjects; natural histories by amateur and professional biologists and anthropologists; slave
narratives; novels, plays, and poetry that dramatized slave uprisings and shipwreck; and polemical debates
about slavery and empire. This course will examine a rich array of texts and images that suggest the disrup-
tive and transformative effects colonial enterprises had on ways of seeing and knowing. Readings may
include: Aphra Behn's Oroonoko; travel narratives by William Smith, Mungo Park, and Dean Mahomet;
memoirs by Olaudah Equiano and Ignatius Sancho; John Gabriel Stedman's Life in an Eighteenth-Century
Slave Society; poetry by William Blake and Phyllis Wheatley; and political tracts by Thomas Clarkson and
Ottobah Cuguano. We will also look at visual materials from botanical prints to orientalist paintings. Dur-
ing the course of the term, the class will actively participate in defining the "subjects" we decide to explore:
on the third class of each week, students will meet in smaller groups to discuss short papers members of the
group distribute in advance.
Format: seminar. Requirements: attendance, active participation, a short essay due every other week, and
two longer (4-6 pp.) essays.
Prerequisite: 100-level English course or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 18 (expected: 18).

ENGL 284(S) Adaptation: Words into Images
Economy of words, resonance and the play between traditional and untraditional structure are shared val-
ues which make short stories and feature films related forms. And yet the successful adaptation of a great
short story into a great movie is rare. The primary point of this class is to write a full-length screenplay
which is an adaptation of an existing short story. Students will also read a selection of stories by such au-
thors as J.D. Salinger, Alice Munro, James Salter and Richard Ford and watch a selection of movies by
screenwriters including Robert Towne, Mike Leigh, Woody Allen, and Alexander Payne & Jim Taylor. In
two short papers, students will consider the results of selected adaptations and analyze the transitions from
story to movie; they will also be expected to try their own hand at an adaptation.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: a full-length screenplay and two short analytical papers. Pre-
requisite: a 100-level English course, except 150. Enrollment limit: 20 (expected: 20).

GATEWAY COURSES
200-level "Gateway" courses are designed for first- and second-year students contemplating the
major or intending to pursue more advanced work in the department; these courses focus on analyti-
cal writing skills while introducing students to critical and historical approaches that will prove
fruitful in later courses. (Note: a Gateway course can fulfill a Period or Criticism requirement as
English

well as a Gateway requirement. Students contemplating the English major are strongly urged to
take a Gateway course by the end of Sophomore year.)
ENGL 222(S) Studies in the Lyric (Gateway) (W)
This discussion course is designed to introduce students considering the major to the study of lyric poetry
by raising three fundamental questions: How does one read a lyric? How does one talk about a lyric? How
does one write about a lyric? In the first half of the course we will read groups of poems from a range of
historical periods in order to examine the various elements that make up a poem (line breaks, tone, image,
versification, form, lyric audience). In the second half of the course we will focus on two writers, John
Donne and Robert Frost, to see how an individual poet uses and adapts lyric conventions to develop a
distinctive style and vision.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: active class participation and frequent short writing assign-
ments.
Prerequisites: a 100-level English course, except 150. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference giv-

ENGL 225(S) Romanticism and Modernism (Gateway) (W)
The literature of Europe in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries was dominated by two aesthetic move-
ments, Romanticism and Modernism, respectively. While Modernism is often thought to mark a decisive
break with Romanticism--in part because both movements presented themselves as "new," a radical de-
parture from what had gone before--there are important continuities and affinities as well as breaches be-
tween the two movements. This course will investigate the nature of Romanticism and Modernism, and
the relation between them. We will study major works from each period, including polemics, poetry, nov-
els, and short stories by Wordsworth, Coleridge, Percy and Mary Shelley, Yeats, Eliot, the French Symbol-
ist poets, Wilde, and modern novelists such as Joyce and Woolf. We will explore each movement's en-
gagement with a range of topics and issues: for example, the subjective experience of time and memory;
the nature of symbolization, and the role of "feeling" in art; the relation of the individual mind to social life;
the conflicted appeal for the artist of "common" language and experience, on the one hand, and avant-
garde forms of expression, on the other. Our broader aim will be to invite potential English majors to think
critically about the principles that underlie the ordering of literary history into aesthetic movements and
"periods."
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: four or five short essays, including at least one revision.

ENGL 235(S) Comedy/Tragedy (Gateway) (W)
"Tragedy is when I cut my finger. Comedy is when you fall down an open manhole cover and die." Critics
have long sought to define comedy and tragedy against each other, yet, as Mel Brooks' joke suggests, the
relationship between the two is complicated, even disturbing. In this course we will read tragedies by So-
phocles, Marlowe and Racine, comedies by Aristophanes, Shakespeare and Moliere, and works that do not
easily fit either classification by Chekhov, Beckett and Stoppard. We will consider how in different periods
the distinction between the two forms has been understood and their antithetical effects accounted for. We
will discuss the essential if also problematic link between suffering and pleasure, and ask why it is that
comedy persists while tragedy, at least in its classical expression, no longer seems possible. Critical read-
ings will include Aristotle's Poetics, Nietzsche's The Birth of Tragedy, and Bergson's Laughter.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: four or five short essays, including at least one revision. There
will also be periodic film screenings. Prerequisites: a 100-level English course, except 150. Enrollment

ENGL 236(F) Witnessing: Slavery and Its Aftermath (Gateway) (W)*
The dual acts of remembering and forgetting slavery have become central to the constitution of American
history. This course examines the relationship between memory, history, and national identity that has been
produced through the visual and literary material on the subject of slavery. Our readings will move from
nineteenth- and eighteenth-century accounts of slavery, poems by Phillis Wheatley, fiction and non-fiction
by Frederick Douglass and Martin Delany to twentieth century re-writings and remembrances of slavery.
Here we will be examining both visual and literary texts that include works by William Faulkner, Octavia
Butler, Sherley Anne Williams, Toni Morrison and visual productions by Kara Walker and Bill T. Jones.
Finally, we will consider how television melodramas--Roots, North and South, Sally Hemmings: An
American Scandal--have shaped the function of slavery in contemporary popular culture.

ENGL 237(F) Gender and Desire 1200-1600 (Same as Comparative Literature 237 and
Women's and Gender Studies 237) (Gateway) (W)
The Middle Ages invented--and the Renaissance refined--the notion of "courtly love"--the humble
devotion of an adoring knight to a beautiful but distant lady. In both its medieval and early modern ver-
sions, courtly love institutionalized the notion of the desiring male subject and the desired female object
that continues to reverberate in contemporary culture. But medieval and Renaissance works do not always,
or even usually, endorse these positions uncritically, and even works that elevate heterosexual love open up
surprisingly large spaces for other kinds of desire. What does it mean, for example, that the fountain of
Narcissus occupies the center of the garden of courtly love in the Romance of the Rose? That despite the
Lover's proclaimed desire to "possess" the Rose, it is the male God of Love he kisses on the mouth?
Shakespeare's comedies end famously with triple and quadruple marriages, but how should we read the
cross-dressing and gender confusion that occupy so much of the plots beforehand? As we explore these
and other issues, we will supplement our literary readings with theoretical texts drawn from medieval and
Renaissance treatises as well as contemporary feminist, psychoanalytic, and queer theory. The goal of the
course is to sharpen critical reading and writing skills across a broad range of literary forms and historical,
cultural and aesthetic values.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: class participation, four or five papers of varying lengths in-
cluding one revision, and occasional oral reports.
Prerequisite: a 100-level course, except 150. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference given to first-

potboilers to Othello. What can these works tell us about interpretive method? (In literature, as in life, we're
all detectives, of course.) And what can these works tell us about the precise grounds of readerly pleasure?

ENGL 246(S) The Novel and Globalization (Gateway) (W)
Here's an interesting question: Is it possible to tell meaningful stories about the whole world--and not just
about this or that place? If you're tempted to say yes, then try to make a list of such stories. It's harder than it
sounds. You might call to mind the geographical horizon of classic European novels, which almost all
unfold within the confines of either the city or the nation. Our question, then, will be: Can there be properly
global stories, beyond city limits and the nation's borders? But then why, you might ask, does this matter?
It is often remarked that one of the curious features of a global economy is its diffusion of power, which is
less than ever concentrated in any one place. Can there be stories, then, that are similarly diffuse, stories that
do not in the conventional sense have "settings," stable locations in which their plots take root? We will
read a series of novels, from four different centuries, that give it their best shot. These will include Daniel
Defoe's Robinson Crusoe, Joseph Conrad's Lord Jim, China Mieville's Perdido Street Station, and Robert
Newman's Fountain at the Center of the World.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: weekly writing assignments, two long essays, class participa-

300-LEVEL COURSES
ENGL 302(S) Philosophy and Poetry: Ancient Quarrels and Modern Questions
In Plato's Republic, Socrates refers to an "ancient quarrel between philosophy and poetry" and notoriously
exiles poetry from the ideal state. Though he admits to feeling the charms of the "honeyed muse," Plato's
English
­ 153 ­
Socrates sees the inspired wisdom of the poets as fundamentally incompatible with the rational truths of
philosophers, and he therefore regards poetry as an unacceptable danger to social order and well-being.
From its beginnings, therefore, western philosophy defined itself in opposition to poetry and the kind of
wisdom or knowledge it was understood to express. In this course, we will consider the modern legacy of
this ancient quarrel, reading philosophers reading poets and poets reading philosophers, as well as poets
writing philosophically (not to mention philosophers, like Heidegger, writing poetically). Few thinkers
since Plato's day (not even his own student Aristotle) fully accepted the uncompromising argument about
poetry in The Republic, yet we will see that as with so many other matters, Plato's ideas have nonetheless
cast a long shadow over even the most conciliatory of later writings about the relationship of poetry to
philosophical thought. What is the difference between philosophical and poetic knowledge (if poetry can
even be said to provide a kind of knowledge)? In what ways are poems vehicles of thought? How do they
express the mind at work? Do poems provide access to cognitive experiences inaccessible by other means?
Is poetry, as Plato argued, at war with rationality? How does philosophy alter (and must it?) when it at-
tempts to bring the poets back in from the conceptual cold? Philosophers we will read include: Plato,
Nietzsche, Heidegger, Benjamin, Adorno, Derrida, Kristeva, Koethe and Nussbaum. And poets: Homer,
Coleridge, Hölderlin, Baudelaire, Stevens, Celan, Grossman, Bernstein, and Stewart.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: active participation in class discussions, one 5- to 8-page paper

ENGL 303(S) Visible Culture: Documentary and Nonfiction (Same as Anthropology 225)*
This course examines the potential of moving images to reveal aspects of culture normally obscured by the
written word. We will consider both the theory and practice of documentary film from its inception around
1900 to the present, paying particular attention to the way documentary filmmakers have approached the
representation of social reality in Western and non-Western cultural settings. Questions that we will consid-
er include: What is the relationship between written text and image, or between image and story? What is
the role of film in anthropology? What counts as a document?
Team-taught, through a mixture of lectures and discussions. Course requirement: Regular attendance at
film screenings and active class participation. Students will write a 5-page paper on an assigned topic and a
12- to 15-page final paper. There will be a self-scheduled take-home final.

ENGL 308(S) Jewish and Other Others*
Jewish difference, French theorist Alain Finkeilkraut insists, is a different sort of difference from those with
which we are more familiar. But what are the distinct qualities that have composed Jewish difference? And
how have these qualities intersected with those associated with other, allegedly more familiar, forms of
difference--ethno-racial, gendered, sexual? We'll be looking at the various ramifications of these ques-
tions in the context of American Jewish writing and experience since roughly the turn of the century to the
present day. Along the way, we'll think about the ways in which Jewish-Americans sought to define them-
selves within and against the American national project, at least as they understood it; and about the rela-
tion of that project of self-definition to categories of gender, of sexual normativity, of "whiteness" and "off-
whiteness." We'll also look at how these projects intersect with those of other racial and ethnic agendas--
e.g. those of African-American and Asian-American culture makers. And we'll conclude by looking at the
efforts of contemporary culture-making, both Jewish and gentile, to move beyond the impasses to which
many of these interactions tend. The course will be focused on literary expression, but will be broadly
interdisciplinary in its ambitions: we will look at history, film and music as well as novels and stories.
Works to be studied include: Cahan, The Rise of David Levinsky; Johnson, Autobiography of an Ex-Col-
ored Man; Malamud, The Tenants, Hasia Diner, Lower East Side Memories; D.W. Griffith, The Muske-

ENGL 310(S) Fictions of Finance
Literary realism and naturalism arise at the same moment, and in the same culture, that saw the rise of
finance capital as a dominant mode of economic life in Europe, England and America. In this course, we'll
try to correlate these two by looking at fictions that take the new, globalizing ambitions of finance capital-
ism seriously and, in so doing, attend to the emotional and imaginative consequences of such a massive
new economic force and its ancillary institutions (the stock market, the corporation). Readings will include
some poems and plays (e.g. Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice and Christina Rossetti's Goblin Market)
and a bit of history, economics, and criticism (e.g. Marx, Schumpeter; Marc Shell, Walter Michaels, Rege-
nia Gagnier) but will mainly focus on novels of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries: Trollope's
The Prime Minister, James's The Golden Bowl, Wharton's The House of Mirth, Dreiser's The Financier,
Norris's The Pit; Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby, Pyncheon's The Crying of Lot 49. If time permits, we'll
spend some time on contemporary fictions of the financial imaginary--Oliver Stone's Wall Street, for ex-
ample.

ENGL 312T(S) Early Modern Women Writers and the Art of Renaissance Self-Fashioning
(Same as Women's and Gender Studies 312) (W)
Since early modern women were at once inside and outside English literary tradition, their writings raise
fascinating questions about self-fashioning, generic and social expectations, literary innovation, political
subversion, and social revolution. Students in this tutorial will explore questions such as the following:
What self-conceptions or forms of self-representation shape these writings? How are these texts shaped by
generic and formal expectations of sonnet, romance, drama, or religious autobiography, and how do they
re-envision or break free from poetic, narrative, and social conventions? How does the expectation of pri-
vate manuscript circulation or public printed book affect choices of voice, style, and form? What assump-
tions or preconceptions do modern readers bring to these texts, and how do these texts shape their readers'
expectations and reactions? Readings include: poems and speeches by Elizabeth I; lyrics, psalms, and nar-
rative poems by Isabella Whitney, Mary Sidney, Martha Moulsworth, and Mary Wroth; dramas by Mary
Sidney and Elizabeth Cary; diaries, letters and memoirs by Lucy Hutchinson and Anne Halkett; autobio-
graphical/fictional fantasy prose by Margaret Cavendish. Format: tutorial with occasional group meetings.
Requirements: Students will meet with the instructor in pairs for an hour each week; they will write a 5- to
7-page paper every other week (five in all), and comment on their partners' papers in alternate weeks.
Emphasis will be placed on developing skills not only in reading and interpretation, but also in constructing
critical arguments and responding to them in written and oral critiques.

ENGL 315(S) Milton
If you know anything about John Milton, you probably think of him as some blind guy who wrote a really
long poem about the Bible. It's hard to shake the feeling that Milton is the fustiest of English poets--dull,
pious, brilliant and all, but nobody you would read if you didn't have to. But then what are we to make of
the following? The first piece that Milton wrote that was read widely throughout Europe was a boisterous
defense of the English Revolution. Milton was most famous in his lifetime as the poet who went to bat for
the Puritan rebels, who came right out and said that the king looked better without his head. Of all the major
English poets, Milton is the revolutionary.
So a course on Milton is by necessity a course on literature and revolution. We will read most of Milton's
major works, poetry and prose, and we will look, too, at the writings of Milton's allies and his opponents:
poets, pamphleteers, and news-writers. And we will ask some big questions as we go: How did the mid-
seventeenth century, probably the most tumultuous decades in the history of modern Britain, transform the
culture of the English-speaking world? What is the relationship between literature and the state or between
literature and radical politics? Is there a poetics of revolution? How can a poet who seems to be writing for
Sunday school-about God and Adam and Eve and the serpent--really have been writing about rebellion
all along?
Format: discussion. Requirements: class discussion, two long essays.

ENGL 316(F) The Art of Courtship (Same as Women's and Gender Studies 316)
During Elizabeth I's reign, love poetry and dramatic comedy acquired a remarkable popularity and
brilliance, unparalleled in English literary history. What is the "art"--the language, form, and rhetoric--of
Elizabethan courtship? What kind of society generated this literary obsession, and conversely, what kind of
culture and sexual relationships did the literature of courtship and seduction produce? This course explores
the links between literary conventions and social conventions, sexual politics and court politics. It studies
gems of English Renaissance literature (Shakespeare's Twelfth Night and Much Ado About Nothing, love
poetry by Shakespeare, Spenser, Sidney, and Donne, Castiglione's The Courtier) along with court rhetoric,
political negotiations, the first poem written and published by an Englishwoman, the first autobiography
written by an Englishman, social debates over poetry, the theater, sexuality, clandestine marriage, women's
lawful liberty. There will be short lectures and lots of discussion.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: weekly short essays or two 5-page papers, and a final research
paper of 10-12 pages.

ENGL 318(F) Literature and Revolution
Since at least the time of Thucydides, historians have noted the transformative effect of political upheavals
on language. In this course, we will explore the connection between revolution and writing, thinking about
the ways that political changes shape literary, historical, and philosophical expression. The course will fo-
cus on British responses to the French Revolution (though this will require some attention to the American
revolution and the revolutionary moments of 1830 and 1848 as well), the idea of "radicalism" in politics
and literature, the role of trauma, and the difficulties involved in narrating contested history, both within the
nations suffering these displacements and abroad. Readings will include central revolutionary documents,
as well as writing across genres that grapples with the issues most important to revolutionary projects. Au-
thors to be discussed may include Rousseau, Burke, Paine, Blake, Williams, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Car-
lyle, and Dickens. We will also spend some time considering various theoretical responses to revolution,
including those of Hegel, Marx, and Arendt.

ENGL 320T(F) Marlowe and Shakespeare (W)
In 1586, at the age of twenty-three, Christopher Marlowe wrote Tamburlaine the Great. Over the next six
years--probably while moonlighting as a government spy--he went on to produce some of the strangest
and also most influential works of English drama. Then in 1593, Marlowe was murdered, stabbed through
the eye in a tavern brawl. It is often said that Marlowe's early death, no less than his early success, made the
work of Shakespeare possible. In this tutorial we will read Marlowe's Edward II, the first popular history
play in English, and Shakespeare's Richard II; The Jew of Malta and The Merchant of Venice; Doctor
Faustus and Macbeth. We will look at ways in which Marlovian preoccupations--with lurid violence,
with debasement, with self-invention--resurface in Shakespeare, in new forms. In the process we will also
take up more general questions of literary influence: What do writers borrow from each other? And how
does the knowledge of indebtedness--shared to varying degrees with an audience--affect the meaning
and impact of their work? Critical readings will include essays by Harry Levin, Harold Bloom and Stephen
Greenblatt.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: Students will meet with the instructor in pairs for an hour each week; they
will write a 5- to 7-page paper every other week (five in all), and comment on their partners' papers in
alternate weeks. Emphasis will be placed on developing skills not only in reading and interpretation, but
also in constructing critical arguments and responding to them.

ENGL 332(F) Law and Society in 18th-19th Century British Fiction (Same as Legal
Studies 332)
With industrialization, urbanization, and the expansion of colonial powers, 18th- and 19th-centuries Britain
increasingly saw relations between individuals mediated by large, impersonal structures and institutions,
rather than by local customs and traditional social relations. Chief among these was the law. National legal
codes, police forces, lawyers, courts, prisons, and indeed the gallows replaced traditional ways of settling
disputes and adjudicating crimes. We will examine fiction from this period that addresses fundamental
questions about living in a culture bound in new ways by the law and its enforcement. Can the law tran-
scend class interests, or will it inevitably reinforce the power structures of the society that produces it? How
can the law mediate between cultures with radically different conceptions of right and wrong? What is the
meaning of the "ideal of justice" when legal institutions, like courts and lawyers' guilds, become power
bases in themselves? How can the quest for truth in the courtroom contend with the slipperiness of lan-
guage, and the seemingly limitless human capacity for conscious and unconscious deceit, from both prose-
cutors and defendants? Finally, how do popular novels, as part of mass culture, shape various publics' per-
ceptions of and reactions to legal institutions?
Some likely texts include Fielding's Jonathan Wild, Godwin's Caleb Williams, Scott's Heart of Midlo-
thian, Dickens's Bleak House, Taylor's Confessions of a Thug, and selections from Browning's The Ring
and the Book .
Format: discussion. Requirements: regular participation, two 5- to 7-page papers, and a 10- to 15-page final

ENGL 335(S) Victorian Strangers: Anonymity and Solitude in the Nineteenth Century
What is the Victorian novel if not over-crowded? Its pages teem with people, characters both major and
minor, as well as those who seem to be simply extras, jamming the streets and making their usual uproar
just outside the center of action. And all of them are crammed into some space we understand as the world
of the novel. This heavily populated literary form has a geographic analogue in London, Europe's first city
of one million people. For many in Victorian Britain the world seemed increasingly crowded, populated
with people unknown. This course is about strangers and crowded worlds, as well as the varied literary and
cultural responses to a society characterized by frequent encounters with anonymous others. We'll discov-
er the pleasures and perils posed by the Victorian city, alive with unknown people and exhilarating crowds,
and think about questions raised by life among the strangers who constitute any community, from towns to
nations. How does it feel to live in a peopled world, for example, one in which the presence of others might
be felt as much as a problem as a pleasure? What strategies--psychological, social, aesthetic, even roman-
tic--evolve to cope with such a world? We'll spend some time thinking through newly central categories
of experience, such as anonymity and solitude, as they're registered in a variety of texts. We'll ask whether
anonymity is a relegated subjectivity or a privileged model of identity. What does it mean that Victorian
prostitutes were called Anonyma? Does anonymity have a gender? A class? We'll consider how texts con-
tend with strangers and anonymity at the formal level, asking if the Victorian novel's weirdly disembodied
but ubiquitous omniscient narrator, for example, routinizes anonymity. We'll also examine strategies of
solitude in a crowded world, moments in which some, unable to take on the mantle of anonymity, attempt
other types of escape from society through self-absenting acts like reading in public or daydreaming. Read-
ings likely to include: Thackeray, Vanity Fair; Dickens, Bleak House; Eliot, Daniel Deronda; Oscar Wilde;
Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories; Stevenson, Jekyll and Hyde; Conrad, The Secret Agent; various
social theorists.

ENGL 336(F) Victorian Literature and Culture
The Victorian era might seem shrouded in the fog of history, an only dimly seen world of repressed sexual-
ity and stiff manners. Much of that fog, however, turns out to be pollution produced by the factories that
sprang up seemingly everywhere during Britain's industrialization in the nineteenth century. In other
words, the Victorians, with their noisy, crowded cities and burgeoning mass entertainment industry in the
form of the novel, Great Exhibitions, and moving panoramic pictures, are much closer to our own foggy
world than we might think. This course will introduce students to some of the major works and concerns of
that huge portion of the nineteenth century over which Queen Victoria reigned, concerns that continue to
occupy us long after her death: like sex, money, celebrity, work and death. Although the (very) long novel
is the signal literary achievement of the era, we'll also read poetry and other types of prose to gain a sense
of the century's enormous variety of literary production. Among our concerns will be the rise of commodi-
ty culture (shopping as we know it was invented by the Victorians); the efforts, and dramatic failures, of
literary forms to secure the distinction between the private realm of the home and the public world of work;
the novel's part in the formation of Britain's vast empire; and the response of literary works to life in cities
such as London. We'll pay attention to how these works transform stories of getting and spending (i.e. the
pursuit of economic interests) into dramas of romantic desire (and vice versa), and how they work both to
uphold and overturn the social arrangements of gender, class, sexuality and race in nineteenth-century En-
gland. Because so many of the stories told by these works are as familiar to us as everyday life--in fact, are
crucial to the construction of what we now know as everyday life--we'll also work hard to maintain
what's strange and specific to the nineteenth century about these works even as we glimpse our own
world's fun-house mirror reflection in them. Likely authors to be studied include Austen, Bronte, Dickens,
Arnold, Swinburne, Eliot, Wilde, and Hardy.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: two essays, one shorter and one longer, totaling 15-20 pages,
short weekly writing assignments, regular attendance, and active participation in class discussions.

ENGL 338(F) Literature of the American Renaissance (Same as American Studies 338)
In this course we will study the distinctive writing produced in the last two decades before the Civil War, a
concentrated moment of expression that has often been taken as the "birth" of an American literature. But
while some of the authors we will be reading have been valued by critics since the mid-nineteenth century
(Emerson, Poe, Hawthorne, Whitman), some were only rediscovered in the early twentieth century
(Melville, Dickinson), and some only entered the classroom in the last twenty-five years (Stowe,
Douglass). We will attend closely to the period's pervasive self-consciousness about language; the
contested influence of transcendentalism on literature; debates over citizenship and American identity; and
the challenge of slavery to American values.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: class participation, email responses to readings, two short

ENGL 341(F) American Genders, American Sexualities (Same as Women's and Gender

This course investigates how sexual identities, desires, and acts are represented and reproduced in
American literary and popular culture. Focusing on two culturally rich periods--roughly 1880-1940
(when the terms "homosexual" and "heterosexual" came to connote discrete sexual identities), and on the
last twenty years--we will explore what it means to read and theorize "queerly." Among the questions we
will ask: What counts as "sex" or "sexual identity" in a text? Are there definably lesbian, gay, bisexual,
transgender or queer writing styles or cultural practices? What does sexuality have to do with gender? How
are sexual subjectivities intertwined with race, ethnicity, class, and other identities and identifications? And
why has "queerness" proven to be such a powerful and sometimes powerfully contested concept? We will
also explore what impact particular historical events, such as the rise of sexology, the Harlem Renaissance,
and the emergence of a transgender movement have had on queer cultural production. Readings may
include works by the following theorists--Almaguer, Butler, Sedgwick, Foucault, Freud, Hammond--as

ENGL 343T(F) Whitman and Dickinson in Context (W)
In this tutorial, we will read closely the works of two of the most influential and fascinating poets in the
U.S., Walt Whitman and Emily Dickinson. In addition to studying in depth their poems and other writ-
ings--in Whitman's case, his essays; in Dickinson's, her letters-we will delve into some of the major criti-
cal debates surrounding their work, both individually and when compared to one another. For example,
Whitman is often viewed as perhaps the most public nineteenth-century American poet, whereas Dickin-
son is regarded as perhaps the most "private." We will interrogate this assumption, exploring how each
poet represents publicity and privacy in his/her work, as well as their efforts to "perform" and/or reform the
American self. We will also examine how each poet engages questions of gender and sexuality, as well as
contemporary debates surrounding such issues as abolition/slavery, women's suffrage, temperance, and
territorial expansion. Finally, we will explore Whitman and Dickinson's relation to significant literary and
philosophical movements of the period, including transcendentalism and the culture of sentiment.
Throughout the course, emphasis will be on analyzing and generating interpretations of Whitman and
Dickinson's works, constructing critical arguments, formulating cogent written critiques, and carrying on
an oral debate about a variety of interpretations. Students will meet with the instructor in pairs for an hour
each week. They will alternate between writing 5- to 7-page papers and commentaries on their partner's
papers.
Format: tutorial. Students will be evaluated on their written work, their oral presentations of that work, their
analyses of their colleague's work, and on a final, comprehensive essay that will address the themes en-

Why study James Baldwin? This course will examine his major fiction in relationship to works by other
African American writers, male and female, and will highlight his contribution to current debates about
race, gender, sexualities, and the politics of location. To what extent is Baldwin in conversation with such
writers as Richard Wright, Ann Petry, Toni Morrison, Randall Kenan, and Melvin Dixon? How does Bald-
win's fiction treat identity as a complex, often unstable social formation? We will read Go Tell It on the
Mountain, Giovanni's Room, Going to Meet the Man, Another Country, If Beale Street Could Talk, and
Just Above My Head as answers to these questions.

In this class we will explore some of the ways that gender and sexuality are understood, performed, and
transformed in Africa. We will begin by thinking about predominant ways of looking at the continent
which we must work through: the legacy of colonial conceptions of Africa, the debates over the validity of
feminism in Africa, and contemporary Western journalism's "afro-pessimism"--imagining Africa as the
site of inevitable horror and disaster, usually figured through the image of the young black man with a gun.
English

How can Africans negotiate these frameworks while also writing honestly about the urgent problems fac-
ing contemporary society? We cannot attempt to cover everything going on across this vast continent, but
we will analyze some African texts from different locations--novels, short stories, films, photographs,
journalism, and music--that offer their own perspectives on women and men, marriage, tradition, and mo-
dernity, war, Aids and the city, as well as the emergent structures of feeling produced by new sexual identi-
ties, musical forms, and the popular institution of the beauty pageant.

ENGL 360(F) Joyce's Ulysses
This course will explore in depth the demanding and exhilarating work widely regarded as the most impor-
tant novel of the twentieth century, James Joyce's Ulysses, which both dismantled the traditional novel and
revitalized the genre by opening up new possibilities for fiction. We will discuss the ways in which com-
pelling issues of character and theme (e.g., questions of heroism and betrayal, oedipal dynamics, sexuality
and the politics of gender, civic engagement and artistic isolation, British imperialism and Irish national-
ism), are placed in counterpoint with patterns drawn from myth, theology, philosophy, and other literature,
and will consider the convergence of such themes in an unorthodox form of comedy. In assessing Ulysses
as the outstanding paradigm of modernist fiction, we will be equally attentive to its radical and often funny
innovations of structure, style, and narrative perspective. (Students unfamiliar with Joyce's short novel A
Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, which introduces characters later followed in Ulysses, are urged to
read it in advance of the course.)

ENGL 368T(S) Approaches to W. B. Yeats (W)
In this course we will read the poetry and selected prose and plays of the Irish writer William Butler Yeats,
widely regarded as the single most influential poet of the twentieth century. We will read these texts in
conjunction with writing about Yeats which represent a range of critical and theoretical approaches to his
work--including post-colonial theory, social text theory, post-structuralism, gender studies, and textual
scholarship. We will consider, for instance, how his writings were shaped by and responded to the cultural,
political and material contexts of his time; how he conceived of authorial selfhood, its construction in lan-
guage, and the functions of literature; and what draft materials, and published revisions can tell us about the
"finished" text of a poem. The aim of the course is to give students both a richer understanding of Yeats's
oeuvre, and experience in engaging with a range of critical and theoretical approaches to reading literary
works.
Format: tutorial. Students will meet with the instructor in pairs for an hour each week, and will alternate
between writing 5-7 page papers and commenting on their partner's papers. Substantial revision of one
paper will also be required as a final project. Students will be evaluated on their written work, their oral
presentation of that work, and on their analyses of their partner's essays.

don Johnson, Alain Locke, W.E.B. Du Bois, Zora Neale Hurston, Richard Wright, Ralph Ellison, Toni
Morrison and Patricia Williams. In doing so, we will be asking a set of practical questions: What is the
relationship between sociopolitical criticism and literary history? Should Afrocentric ideology govern the
theoretical and critical examination of African American literature? What role does literature play in shap-
ing contemporary debates about the social construction or political realities of race and gender? What is the

ENGL 392(F) Wonder
We tend to imagine "wonder" as a naive, wide-eyed response, something quite distinct from the cold and
sophisticated act of critical analysis. In this discussion class, we will consider wonder as an analyzable
concept, but one that raises provocative questions about the nature and limits of our own, distinctly modern
forms of critical engagement. The course examines three historical incarnations of "wonder," each involv-
ing complex relations among the aesthetic, philosophical, and social domains: the Renaissance tradition on
wonder and the marvelous; the eighteenth-century analysis of the sublime; and twentieth-century accounts
of the culture of spectacle. We will consider writers such as Shakespeare, Sir Thomas Browne, Word-
sworth, Borges, and W.G. Sebald (all wonderful); painters such as Leonardo and Vermeer, the photography
of Andreas Gursky and Thomas Struth; films including Lang's Metropolis and Scott's Blade Runner; and

ENGL 395(F) Time-Consciousness in Modern Literature and Philosophy
In the eleventh book of his Confessions, Augustine gives voice to the perplexity that motivates this course:
"what in speaking do we refer to more familiarly and knowingly than time? And certainly we understand
also when we hear it spoken of by another. What, then, is time? If no one ask of me, I know; if I wish to
explain to him who asks, I know not." In this course, we will consider the many difficulties that arise when
one attempts to answer Augustine's deceptively simple question, giving special attention to the probing
reflections about the experience of time that played such an important role in the development of twentieth-
century literature and philosophy. Is time essentially a series of punctual and homogeneous "nows," best
measured by clock and calendar? Or does this objective picture of time (which imagines it as analogous to
space) exclude some essential aspects of our first-person consciousness of time? To take a basic example,
when we listen to a musical melody, is it but a sequence of individual tones that we hear? Or is there a
temporal duration or continuity to the series perceived as a whole that exceeds the sum of its parts? If so,
how (if at all) do the subjective and objective aspects of musical time fit together? And are there other types
of time-consciousness that cannot easily fit into an objective picture of time but which nonetheless play an
essential role in our lives? These are the kinds of questions we will ask, both of ourselves and of the many
literary and philosophical works written in the last century that found time-consciousness a rich and ab-
sorbing subject. Time-related topics we will investigate include stream of consciousness, memory, haunt-
ing, the everyday, finitude and death. Literary works we will read include Virginia Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway
and William Faulkner's The Sound and the Fury. We will also read philosophical treatments of time by St.
Augustine, Immanuel Kant, William James, Henri Bergson, John McTaggart, Edmund Husserl, Martin
Heidegger, Mikhail Bakhtin, and Paul Ricoeur.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: active participation in class discussions, one 5- to 8-page paper
and one 8- to 10-page paper.
Prerequisites: a 100-level English course, except 150. Enrollment limit: 25 (expected: 20). Preference to

On the aims of these courses, please see description at beginning of the English Department section of
the catalog.
ENGL 411(S) Psychoanalysis, Gender, and Sexuality (Same as Comparative Literature
342 and Women's and Gender Studies 411)
Psychoanalytic thought offers one of the most subtle and startling accounts we have of the nature of gender
and sexuality, one that suggests how inextricably sexuality is bound to language, to the limits of culture,
and to the problem of identity as such. We'll be interested in these issues in their own right; we'll be equally
interested in the surprising ways psychoanalytic thought opens up literary and cinematic works--psycho-
analysis is, in the end, a form of reading. The course will weave together theoretical texts and fictions from
As You Like It to Some Like it Hot. We'll explore Antigone, "chick flicks" and "buddy" films, courtly love
lyrics and novels (Woolf, Duras) in the light of thinkers such as Freud, Jacques Lacan, Jacqueline Rose,
Leo Bersani and Lee Edelman.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: lively participation, one short (6 page) and one long
(12 page) paper.
Prerequisites: a 300-level English course or permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 15 (ex-
pected: 15). Preference given to English and Women's and Gender Studies majors.

ENGL 450(S) Herman Melville and Mark Twain
Despite their profound differences in literary style and personal temperament, Heman Melville and Mark
Twain had much in common. Both gained national popularity through their travel writings, both were
acute and critical observers of American Political life, and both were adventurous innovators in the craft of
prose fiction. Melville, however, spurned his own success and alienated his readers with a series of com-
plex, difficult, and unsettling novels. Mark Twain, on the other hand, expanded his popularity with aston-
ishing effectiveness. This course will examine and compare the works and careers of these writers. A com-
parative approach to works such as Benito Cereno and Puddn'head Wilson, satirical works addressing
slavery and racial attitudes, should be illuminating. On the other hand, we will also attend to the traits that
English
­ 162 ­
make these writers such singular literary artists.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: one short paper of 5 to 7 pages and a final paper of about fif-
teen pages.

ENGL 385(F) Advanced Fiction Workshop: Form and Technique
A course for students with experience writing fiction and an understanding of the basics of plot, chararact-
er, setting, and scene. By examining stories in both traditional and unusual forms, we'll study how a story's
significant elements are chosen, ordered, and arranged; how the story is shaped; how, by whom, and to
what purpose it's told. Students will generate new stories for workshop, employing the forms and tech-
niques studied.

CONCENTRATION IN ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
The Environmental Studies Program, within the liberal arts mission of Williams College, provides stu-
dents with an opportunity to explore how humans interact with the environment, including physical, bio-
logical, philosophical, and social elements. The program is designed so that students will understand the
complexity of issues and perspectives and to appreciate that most environmental issues lack distinct disci-
plinary boundaries. Our goal is to aid students in becoming well-informed, environmentally-literate citi-
zens of the planet who have the capacity to become active participants in the local and global community.
To this end, the program is designed to develop abilities to think in interdisciplinary ways and to use syn-
thetic approaches in solving problems while incorporating the knowledge and experiences gained from
majoring in other departments at the College.
The concentration in Environmental Studies allows students to pursue an interdisciplinary study of the
environment by taking elective courses in the natural sciences, the social sciences, and the humanities and
the arts. The purpose of the program is to provide the tools and ideas needed to engage constructively with
the environmental and social issues brought about by changes in population, economic activity, and values.
Environmental controversies typically call upon citizens and organizations to grasp complex, uncertain
science, contending human values, and ethical choices--in short, to grapple with matters for which the
liberal arts are a necessary but not sufficient preparation. Environmental Studies accordingly includes
courses in natural sciences, social sciences, humanities, and the arts, in order to equip students with the
broad educational background needed to analyze complex environmental matters and to fashion pragmat-
ic, feasible solutions.
The program is administered by the Center for Environmental Studies (CES), located in Kellogg House.
Founded in 1967, CES was one of the first environmental studies programs at a liberal arts college. In
addition to the academic program, CES is the focus of a varied set of activities in which students lead and
participate, often with other members of the Williams community. The Matt Cole Memorial Library at
Kellogg House holds a substantial collection of books, periodicals, unpublished documents, maps, and
electronic media. Kellogg House also houses a Geographic Information Systems laboratory as well as
study and meeting facilities available to students and student groups. The Center administers the Hopkins
Memorial Forest, a 2500-acre natural area northwest of campus, where field-study sites, a laboratory, and
passive-recreation opportunities may be found in all seasons. CES also operates an environmental analysis
laboratory at the Science Center.
Environmental Studies

The Environmental Studies Program has three overlapping components:
 The concentration in Environmental Studies, which consists of a set of seven courses.
 The Four Places goal. (See below.)
 Honors in Environmental Studies; a senior thesis is encouraged but not required.
Concentration Requirements
Seven courses are required: four are core courses to be taken by all students earning the concentration;
three are distribution courses to be selected from the lists below.
Core courses
101 Humans in the Landscape
203 Ecology
302 Environmental Planning and Design Workshop
402 Senior Seminar
The core courses are intended to be taken in sequence, although there is some flexibility allowed. Envi-
ronmental Studies (ENVI) 101 is a broad introduction to the field, emphasizing the humanities and social
sciences. ENVI 203 is a course in ecology (offered in Biology) that provides a unified conceptual approach
to the behavior of living things in the natural world. ENVI 302 puts teams of students to work on planning
projects of immediate importance in the Berkshires. ENVI 402, the senior seminar, is an opportunity for
concentrators majoring in a wide variety of disciplines to draw together their educational experiences and
provide a personal accounting of how they understand the interdisciplinary character of environmental
studies and its connections to their future lives and careers. The core course structure affords students free-
dom to explore and to specialize in diverse fields of study, while sustaining a focus on environmental ques-
tions throughout their time at Williams.
An interdisciplinary course emphasizing field science, ENVI 102 (Introduction to Environmental Sci-
ence), is strongly recommended for all students interested in the concentration.
Distribution Courses
In order to earn the concentration a student must take one course from each of the following three
groups. Courses may be counted both toward the concentration in Environmental Studies and toward a
disciplinary major.

Variations from the requirements of the concentration must be approved in writing by the director of the
program. Students are urged to consult with program faculty and the director as soon as they develop an
interest in the concentration or if they intend to participate in study away opportunities.
In addition to courses fulfilling the concentration requirements, the following electives and related elec-
tives are offered:
Environmental Studies 397, 398 Independent Study of Environmental Problems
Environmental Studies 493-W31-494 Senior Research and Thesis
Winter study courses play an important role in the program, offering opportunities to experiment in
fields unfamiliar to the student, and for interdisciplinary topics to be developed by faculty working alone
and in teams. Students are urged to review each year's winter study offerings bearing in mind their interests
in the environment.
Rationale for Course Numbering
The numbering sequence of the four required courses reflects the order in which they should be taken,
although Environmental Studies 302 may be taken in the senior or sophomore year if a student is away
junior year. Cross-listed courses are assigned the same number as the departmental number whenever pos-
sible.
Four Places--A Goal
The human place in natural landscapes is intrinsically geographic, and learning about humans in partic-
ular places is an essential part of environmental studies. By the time each student in Environmental Studies
graduates, she or he should have developed intellectual insight into and personal experience of four places:
"Home"; "Here"--the Berkshires; "There"--an alien place; and "The World"--a global perspective. For
practical purposes, "There" is a place where the geography is unusual in the student's experience (e.g.,
developing country, inner city, arctic), so are the socioeconomic circumstances (for example, per capita
income might be a small fraction of a year's tuition at Williams), and the working language is not standard
English. Although this goal is not a requirement for the concentration, it is a significant aspect of the pro-
gram, and CES resources are aimed in part at enabling all students to meet this goal. For example, students
are encouraged to pursue summer internships in their "Home" communities, or to do semester or winter
study courses at locations outside the temperate zones ("There"); field courses in natural science or history
courses emphasizing New England can deepen familiarity with "Here." Students concentrating in Envi-
ronmental Studies should plan winter study courses and summer work or study experiences with the Four
Places goal in mind, particularly the experiences "There" and at "Home." Courses not in the list of elec-
tives for the concentration may be considered as substitutes, on a case-by-case basis, if they also meet the
Four Places goal in a way not otherwise available in the program. Students should see the program director
for further information.
Honors in Environmental Studies
A student earns honors in Environmental Studies by successfully completing a rigorous, original inde-
pendent research project under the supervision of two or more members of the faculty, including at least
one member of the CES faculty. The research project should be reported and defended both in a thesis and
orally. A student may undertake an honors thesis and submit it to both his or her major department and
Environmental Studies; petitions for a joint honors project should be approved by the department chair and
the director of the program no later than the beginning of the student's senior year. Students who pursue
honors in Environmental Studies alone should enroll in Environmental Studies 493-W31-494, Senior Re-
search and Thesis, in addition to completing the requirements for the concentration.
Because most research requires sustained field, laboratory, or library work that is difficult to combine
with conventional coursework, students are strongly encouraged to spend the summer before senior year
doing honors research. Funds to support student research are available from restricted endowments of the
Center, and an open competition is held each spring, to allocate the limited resources. Some departments
Environmental Studies
­ 166 ­
also provide limited support for summer thesis research. Students and their faculty sponsors should plan
the thesis with the possibility of summer research in mind.
Honors in Environmental Studies will be awarded on the basis of the academic rigor, interdisciplinary
synthesis, independence, and originality demonstrated by the student and in the completed thesis.
ENVI 101(F) Humans in the Landscape: An Introduction to Environmental Studies
This course introduces environmental studies in the context of the liberal arts--natural and social science
and the arts and humanities. By the end of the semester, a student should be able to recognize and to inves-
tigate the natural, economic, and industrial bases of daily life, and to analyze the social challenges of alter-
ing humans' imprint on nature. These skills are necessary but not sufficient for developing a stance toward
environmental quality as an element of civilized life.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on two quizzes (testing detailed recall), written exer-
cises (testing ability to grasp and make use of ideas important to the course), and a final exam; attentive
participation in class and conference discussions also counts.
No enrollment limit (expected: 30-40). Required course for students wishing to complete the Environmen-
tal Studies concentration.
Satisfies one semester of the Division II requirement.
Hour: 10:00-10:50 MWF Conference: TBA K. LEE
ENVI 102(S) Introduction to Environmental Science
Introduction to Environmental Science introduces students to current scientific methods used to assess en-
vironmental quality, rectify impaired systems, and limit future detriment. Through hands-on study of sev-
eral local sites, we probe five global themes: alteration of the greenhouse effect and carbon cycle; acid
deposition; toxic metals in the environment; water quality; and prospects in waste treatment and remedi-
ation.
Discussions of case studies from other parts of the world illustrate the global analogues of these local stud-
ies. Following these group projects, students design and complete independent projects in subjects of par-
ticular interest to them.
Format: two, 75-minute workshop/discussion sessions, and one, 4-hour field/laboratory session each
week. Evaluation will be based on reports of field and laboratory projects, participation in discussion, and
an independent research project.
Enrollment limit: 36 (expected: 25). Preference given to first-year students. This course is designed for
students who have a strong interest in Environmental Science.

Natural resources--forests, pastures, and waterways--are a foundation of rural livelihoods and local gov-
ernance in much of the developing world. Natural resource management is therefore an important vehicle
not only for reducing environmental degradation, but also for promoting rural economic development and
good governance. This course examines the nexus of natural resources management, rural livelihoods, and
governance systems as it relates to sustainable development and biodiversity conservation efforts. It builds
Environmental Studies
­ 168 ­
a grassroots perspective by situating community-based systems of natural resource management in pro-
gressively broader contexts --regional, national, and international. Students explore a variety of conceptu-
al and practical tools for understanding the nature, wealth and power nexus and for balancing the needs and
aspirations of local populations with the objectives of conservation and development programs.
Format: seminar. Requirements: Each student completes, in stages, a long research paper integrating envi-
ronmental, economic and institutional analysis around a case study of sustainable development and/or en-
vironmental conservation. Students design their paper around their specific environmental and geographic
interests.

ENVI 270T(F) (formerly 308T) Environmental Policy (Same as Political Science 270T) (W)
Over the past generation, the environment has emerged as a significant policy arena. This course discusses
environmental policy and politics from the perspective of the constellation of professionals, managers, and
activists involved in the implementation and formulation of policies. The technical and social challenges of
environmental policy strain long-accepted notions of democratic representation and rationality. We
examine institutional forms, and survey the conflicts that shape the governance of natural resources,
property, and ecosystem services. This course emphasizes domestic environmental policy but also draws
examples from international contexts.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: each student completes, in stages, a research project on an environmental
policy or controversy. A 12-page background paper at mid-semester describes the issues and actors. The
subsequent research paper incorporates the background paper, with revisions, into a 20-page analysis of
the case and its governmental dynamics, including policy recommendations. There is also a 90-minute
exam on the course readings.
Prerequisites: Environmental Studies 101; Political Science 201 are recommended. Enrollment limit: 12

Berkshire region. The first part of the course introduces the students to planning literature through analysis
and discussion of case studies. In the second section of the course students apply their skills to the study of
an actual planning problem. Small teams of students, working in conjunction with a client in the communi-
ty, research and propose solutions to a local environmental planning problem. The project work draws on
students' academic training, extracurricular activities, and applies interdisciplinary knowledge and meth-
odologies. The course culminates in public presentations of each team's planning study. This course also
includes field trips and computer labs.
Format: discussion/project lab. Requirements: midterm exam, short written exercises, class presentations,
public presentations, final group report.
Prerequisites: Environmental Studies 101 and Biology/Environmental Studies 203, or permission of

ENVI 307(S) Environmental Law (Same as Political Science 317)
In recent decades, a complex web of environmental laws has altered our approach to land use and resource
management, raised public health standards, and forced business and government to reinvent their relation-
ships with one another and with local communities. This course examines how environmental laws devel-
op, from the discovery of a problem, through the passage and implementation of legislation, to changes in
the behavior of regulated industries, and, finally, to site restoration and the prevention of new harms. Stu-
dents will examine the roles played by four main groups: citizens--organizations, elected officials, the
business sector, and the bureaucracy. We will use case law and source materials like agency permits and
consent agreements to show how these four groups often establish a "checks and balances" relationship
with one another, helping to assure that the laws we enact provide real environmental relief without unduly

This course examines the possibility of sustainable development, an economy in which material prosperity
pursued together with preservation of the life-support systems of the human and natural world. Over the
past 200 years the human presence on the planet has changed dramatically, as seen in long-term trends of
environmental modification, population growth, and economic change, including patterns of consumption.
These and other data are reviewed, in an effort to illuminate the idea of a gradual transition toward
sustainability. Sustainability is examined as an emergent phenomenon--not a simple idea imposed from
above, but the product of decentralized learning, market innovations, and social changes at many scales.
Simulation exercises providing metaphors of emergent phenomena are used to stimulate imagination and
thinking.

FIRST-YEAR RESIDENTIAL SEMINAR
The First-Year Residential Seminar is part of a program designed to help students explore new ways of
integrating their social and intellectual lives. Students who elect this seminar live together in the same resi-
dential unit, and take the seminar together during the fall semester. Enrollment in the seminar is restricted to
students in the program. The seminar explores topics and issues that can be expected to promote lively
discussions both in and out of class. It may be team-taught and may contain interdisciplinary subject mat-
ter.
All entering first-year students have the opportunity to express interest in participating in this program; if
more students are interested than there are spaces available (two sections, maximum 19 students in each),
selection is done randomly. Participants must commit themselves to taking FRS 101.
FRS 101(F) Interpreting Human Experience (W)
How we make sense of the world, and of our lives, depends to a considerable degree on the intellectual
methodologies we apply to the task of interpretation. Freud, for instance, saw selfhood and perception as
fundamentally determined by the structures of the psyche itself; Marx, by contrast, argued that our sense of
reality is conditioned primarily by our material and social circumstances; more recently, historian of sci-
ence Thomas Kuhn has emphasized that the underlying assumptions which shape the very questions we
pose as thinkers significantly influence and limit what data, and thus what reality, we are most likely to
observe. This course aims to provide a foundational experience for the liberal arts education, by engaging
with key religious, political, literary, anthropological, philosophical and psychoanalytic texts with a view to
complicating our sense of the purposes and possibilities of intellectual life and confronting the challenges
of epistemology. Readings will include works by Plato, John Stuart Mill, Marx, E.M. Forster, Freud, Na-
guib Mahfouz, Brecht, Dangarembga, and extracts from the Bible and the Qu'ran. In keeping with the
aims of the FRS program, the course is intended to foster productive connections between what we discuss
and debate in class and your broader experiences as students. The course will invite and promote interdisci-
plinary connections between core ways of seeing and interpreting the world, with a strong emphasis on
improving your critical skills.
Format: seminar. Requirements: regular short writing assignments designed to hone your reading skills;
four papers ranging from 3-5 pages; participation in one or two tutorial sessions; and active contribution to
discussion.
Enrollment limited to FRS students. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19).

MAJOR
The Geosciences major is designed (1) to provide an understanding of the physical and biological
evolution of our planet and its interacting global systems, (2) to help us learn to live in harmony with our
environment, and (3) to appreciate our place within the vastness of Earth history. Forces within the Earth
are responsible for the development of mountain ranges and ocean basins. Waves, running water, and gla-
ciers have shaped the surface of the Earth, providing the landscapes we see today. Fossils encased in sedi-
mentary rocks supply evidence for the evolution of life and help to record the history of the Earth.
Students who graduate with a major in Geosciences from Williams can enter several different fields of
geoscience or can use their background in other careers. Students who have continued in the geosciences
are involved today, especially after graduate training, in environmental fields ranging from hydrology to
earthquake prediction, in the petroleum and mining industries, federal and state geological surveys, geo-
logical consulting firms, and teaching and research in universities, colleges, and secondary schools. Gradu-
ates who have entered business or law have also found many applications for their geoscience background.
Other graduates now in fields as diverse as art and medicine pursue their interest in the out-of-doors with a
deeper appreciation for the natural world around them.
The Geosciences major sequence includes, after any 100-level course, six designated advanced courses,
and two elective courses.
Sequence Courses (required of majors)
201 Geomorphology
202 Mineralogy and Geochemistry
215 Climate Changes
301 Structural Geology
302 Sedimentation
401 Stratigraphy
Elective courses may be clustered to provide concentrations in selected fields. Suggested groupings are
listed below as guidelines for course selections, but other groups are possible according to the interests of
the students. Departmental advisors are given for the different fields of Geosciences.
I Environmental Geoscience. For students interested in surface processes and the application of geolo-
gy to environmental problems such as land use planning, resource planning, environmental impact analy-
sis, and environmental law. Such students should also consider enrollingin thecoordinate program of the
Center for Environmental Studies.
103 Environmental Geology and the Earth's Surface
104 Oceanography
206 Geological Sources of Energy or
208 Water and the Environment
214 Remote Sensing and Geographic Information Systems
215 Climate Changes
(Students interested in Environmental Geosciences should consult with Professors Dethier or Stoll.)
II Oceanography, Stratigraphy and Sedimentation. For students interested in the study of modern and
ancient sedimentary environments and the marine organisms that inhabited them.
101 Biodiversity in Geologic Time
104 Oceanography
206 Geological Sources of Energy
212 Invertebrate Paleobiology
(Students interested in Oceanography, Stratigraphy, and Sedimentation should consult with Professors
M. Johnson or Cox.)
III The Solid Earth. For students interested in plate tectonics, the processes active within the Earth, the
origin and deformation of rocks and minerals, and mineral exploration.
102 An Unfinished Planet
105 Geology Outdoors
303 Igneous and Metamorphic Petrology
(Students interested in The Solid Earth should consult with Professors Wobus or Karabinos.)
With the consent of the department, certain courses at the 200 level or higher in Biology, Chemistry,
Mathematics and Statistics, or Physics may be substituted for elective courses in the major. Credit may be
granted in the Geosciences major for American Maritime Studies 211/Geosciences 210 (Oceanographic
Processes) or American Maritime Studies 311/Biology 231 (Marine Ecology) taken at Mystic Seaport.
Students considering graduate work in geosciences should also take courses in the allied sciences and
mathematics in addition to the requirements of the Geosciences major. The selection of outside courses
Geosciences
­ 172 ­
will depend on the field in which a student intends to specialize. Most geoscience graduate schools require
a year of Chemistry and Mathematics through 105. For those going into Environmental Geoscience,
courses in computer science or statistics are recommended. For those considering Oceanography, Stratig-
raphy, and Sedimentation, Biology 102 and Biology 203 are suggested. For students entering Solid-Earth
fields, Physics 131 and 132 are recommended.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN GEOSCIENCES
In order to be recommended for the degree with honors, a student is expected to have completed at least
two semesters and a winter study project (031) of independent research culminating in a thesis which dem-
onstrates outstanding achievement of an original and innovative nature. The principal considerations in
admitting a student to a program of independent research are mastery of fundamental material and skills,
ability to pursue independent study successfully, and demonstrated student interest and motivation.
Further advice on the major can be obtained from the department chair.
GEOS 101(F) Biodiversity in Geologic Time (Same as Environmental Studies 105)
Is planet Earth now undergoing the most severe mass extinction of species ever to have occurred during its
4.5-billion-year history? By some calculations, the expanding population of a single species is responsible
for the demise of 74 species per day. This provocative question is addressed by way of the rock and fossil
record as it relates to changes in biodiversity through deep geologic time before the appearance of Homo
sapiens only 250,000 years ago. Long before human interaction, nature conducted its own experiments on
the complex relationship between evolving life and changes in the physical world. This course examines
ways in which wandering continents, shifting ocean basins, the rise and fall of mountains, the wax and
wane of ice sheets, fluctuating sea level, and even crashing asteroids all shaped major changes in global
biodiversity. Particular attention is drawn to the half dozen most extensive mass extinctions and what fac-
tors may have triggered them. Equal consideration is given to how the development of new ecosystems
forever altered the physical world. How and when did the earliest microbes oxygenate the atmosphere? Do
the earliest multicellular animals from the late Precambrian portray an architectural experiment doomed to
failure? What factors contributed to the explosive rise in biodiversity at the start of the Cambrian Period?
What explanation is there for the sudden appearance of vertebrates? How and when did plants colonize the
land? What caused the demise of the dinosaurs? Is the present dominance of mammals an accident of na-
ture? The answers to these and other questions are elusive, but our wise stewardship of the planet and its
present biodiversity may depend on our understanding of the past. Concepts of plate tectonics and island
biogeography are applied to many aspects of the puzzle.
Format: lecture; one laboratory per week (some involving field work); plus one all-day field trip to the
Helderberg Plateau and Catskill Mountains of New York, and a half-day trip to the Geology Museum at
Amherst College. Evaluation will be based on weekly quizzes and lab work, a midterm exam, and a final
exam.
Enrollment limit: 35 (expected:20).

GEOS 102(S) An Unfinished Planet
The Earth is a work-in-progress, an evolving planet whose vital signs--as expressed by earthquakes, vol-
canic eruptions, and shifting plates--are still strong. In a geological time frame, nothing on Earth is perma-
nent: ocean basins open and close, mountains rise and fall, continental masses accrete and separate. There
is a message here for all who live, for an infinitesimally brief time, on the moving surface of the globe. This
course uses the plate tectonics model--one of the fundamental scientific accomplishments of this centu-
ry--to interpret the processes and products of a changing Earth. The emphasis will be on mountain sys-
tems (on land and beneath the oceans) as expressions of plate interactions. Specific topics include the rocks
and structures of modern and ancient mountain belts, the patterns of global seismicity and volcanism, the
nature of the Earth's interior, the changing configurations of continents and ocean basins through time, and,
in some detail, the formation of the Appalachian Mountain system and the geological assembly of New
England. Readings will be from a physical geology textbook and primary source supplement, selected
writings of John McPhee, and references about the geology of the Northeast.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; lab (several involving field work), two hours per week; one required
all-day field trip during the last week of the semester to the Connecticut Valley and the highlands of west-
ern Massachusetts. Evaluation will be based on two hour-tests, weekly lab work, and a scheduled final
exam.

GEOS 103(F) Environmental Geology and the Earth's Surface (Same as Environmental
Studies 103)
Limitations imposed by the physical environment have become increasingly important as population ex-
pands. Geologic materials such as soil, sediment, and bedrock, and geologic processes involving earth-
quakes, volcanic activity, and running water often pose constraints on land use. This course examines the
nature of geologic materials, the physical processes that continuously change the surface of the Earth, and
how these processes affect human activity. Topics include volcanic and earthquake hazards, surface-water
Geosciences

erosion and flooding, landslides, groundwater, solid waste disposal, resource issues, global climate change,
and the importance of geologic information to land-use planning. Laboratories emphasize field and class-

GEOS 105(F) Geology Outdoors (W)
An introduction to geology through student field projects. The mountains, lakes, rivers, and valleys of the
Williamstown area provide unusual opportunities for learning geology in the field. Student projects will
include the study of streams as active agents of erosion and deposition, the effects of glaciation on the New
England landscape, and the history of mountain building in the Appalachians. Following several group
projects introducing the techniques of field geology, students will pursue independent projects on subjects
of particular interest to them. This course departs from the standard science course format with three lec-
tures and a required lab each week. Instead, emphasis is placed on learning through active participation in
field projects and presentation of results through high quality writing. The class will meet two afternoons
each week from 1:00 to 3:45 p.m. There will be two all day field trips. This course is designed for students
who have a serious interest in geology or other natural and environmental sciences, the outdoors, and writ-
ing.
Format: discussion/field laboratory, six hours per week. Evaluation will be based on participation in field
work and discussions, five 8-page papers based on field projects, and an oral presentation of independent
projects. Students will use detailed comments on their papers to improve their writing style in successive
assignments.
No prerequisites; no previous knowledge of geology required. Open only to first-year students. Enrollment
limit: 12 (expected:12).

GEOS 201(F) Geomorphology (Same as Environmental Studies 205)
This course is designed for geosciences majors and for environmental studies students interested in surfi-
cial geologic processes and their importance in shaping the physical environment. The course emphasizes
the nature and rates of constructional, weathering, and erosional processes and the influence of climatic,
tectonic, and volcanic forces on landform evolution. Labs focus on field measurements of hydrologic and
geomorphic processes in the Williamstown area as well as on the analysis of topographic maps and stereo
air photos.

GEOS 214(S) Remote Sensing and Geographic Information Systems (Same as Environmental
Studies 214)
Remote sensing involves the collection and processing of data from satellite and airborne sensors to yield
environmental information about the Earth's surface and lower atmosphere. Remote sensing enhances re-
gional mapping of rock types and faults and analysis of vegetation cover and land-use changes over time.
A Geographic Information System (GIS) links satellite-based environmental measurements with spatial
data such as topography, transportation networks, and political boundaries, allowing display and quantita-
tive analysis at the same scale using the same geographic reference. This course covers the principles and
practice of remote-data capture and geographic rectification using a Global Positioning System (GPS), as
well as the concepts of Remote Sensing, including linear and non-linear image enhancements, convolution
filtering, principle components analysis, and classification. Principles of GIS include display and classifi-
cation, spatial buffers, and logical overlays. Weekly labs focus on practical applications of these techniques
to data from Hopkins Memorial Forest, the Berkshire region, and other areas of North America.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, weekly.

GEOS 217T(F) Planetary Geology (Same as Astronomy 217T) (W)
Planetary geology is hot! In the last few years space probes and the Hubble Telescope have given us
stunning new perspectives on our planetary neighbors, and the recent thrilling discoveries of the bizarre
"hot Jupiters" orbiting other stars have forced us to reexamine ideas about the evolution of our own solar
system. We can't hike around on Mars or Europa, so we have to infer composition, form, texture and
process from photographs and sparse chemical data. By reading recent research papers we will examine a
number of topics, which may include planetary formation and differentiation, the failed-planet hypothesis,
surficial features of planets and their interpretation, tectonics in the solar system, liquid water in the outer
solar system, water on Mars, and giant-planet migration.
Evaluation will be based on five 2500-word (about five pages) papers, discussion, and critical analysis.
There will be a strong focus on polished writing and argument, and papers will be thoroughly edited by the
professor for style, grammar and syntax. Students will improve their writing by integrating into successive
papers the editorial comments they receive, and also by editing the writing of their tutorial partners.

Global warming is a hot button topic that crosses disciplinary boundaries. Earth systems often work at time
scales longer than the human life span, forcing us to look into the Earth's climatic past to put modern cli-
mate change in perspective. What does a dragonfly with a 2-foot wingspan reveal about the climate of the
Earth millions of years ago? How do plate tectonics and mountain building affect climate? Is global tecton-
ic activity a more important climatic control than the release of CO2 to the atmosphere by human activity?
In this tutorial, we examine the processes that control Earth's current climate, but will focus on how Earth's
climatic past informs our understanding of modern climate change. Readings shall include the more recent
scientific literature and classic papers. After an initial meeting with all participants, students will meet in
pairs with the instructor for one hour each week to discuss the readings. During each session, one student
will orally present a written paper for criticism by their partner. The critique provides a jumping off point
for the ensuing discussion.
Format: tutorial. Evaluation is based on five written papers and the student's effectiveness as a critic and
discussion partner.
Prerequisites: any 100-level Geosciences course and/or consent of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 12 (ex-
pected: 10), with preference for sophomores.
Tutorial meetings to be arranged. BACKUS
GEOS 301(F) Structural Geology (Q)
The structure of the Earth's crust is constantly changing and the rocks making up the crust must deform to
accommodate these changes. Rock deformation occurs over many scales ranging from individual mineral
grains to mountain belts. This course deals with the geometric description of structures, stress and strain
analysis, deformation mechanisms in rocks, and the large scale forces responsible for crustal deformation.
The laboratories cover geologic maps and cross sections, folds and faults, stereonet analysis, field tech-
niques, strain, and stress.
Format: lecture/discussion, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours per week. Evaluation will be
based on weekly laboratory exercises, problem sets, a midterm exam, and a final exam. Many of the labo-
ratories and problem sets use geometry, algebra, and several projection techniques to solve common prob-
lems in structural geology.
Prerequisites: Geosciences 101, 102, 103, or 105 or permission of instructor. No enrollment limit (ex-
pected: 12).
Hour: 11:00-12:15 MW Lab: 1-4 M KARABINOS
GEOS 302(S) Sedimentation (W)
The composition and architecture of sediments and sedimentary rocks preserve information about the
rocks that were eroded to form them, the fluids and forces that transported them, the mechanisms by which
they were deposited, and the processes by which they were lithified. This course will provide an introduc-
tion to the principles of sedimentology, including sedimentary petrology, fluid mechanics, bedform analy-
sis, and facies architecture.
Format: lecture/discussion, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours per week; one half-day and one
all-day field trip. Evaluation will be based on laboratory work, writing assignments, an hour exam, and a
final exam. Ten written critiques (each 1000 words) of specific assigned papers from the sedimentological
literature are designed to teach clear written expression and careful analytical reading. Papers will be thor-
oughly edited for style, grammar and syntax. Students will improve their writing by integrating editorial
comments into successive papers. Each student will compile his/her papers as a growing body of work,
and each new paper will be read and edited in the context of the previous submissions. Prerequisites: Geo-
sciences 202 (may be taken concurrently). Enrollment limit: 16 (expected:12).
Hour: 11:20-12:35 TR Lab: 1-4 R COX
GEOS 303(F) Igneous and Metamorphic Petrology
The origin of metamorphic, plutonic, and volcanic rocks are examined in the light of field evidence and
experimental work. Rock texture and composition are used to interpret the environment of formation of
individual rock types, and important assemblages are related, where possible, to theories of global
tectonics.
Laboratory work emphasizes the study of individual rock units and rock suites in hand specimens and by
petrographic and x-ray techniques.
Format: lecture/discussion, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours per week; several field trips
including one all-day trip to central New Hampshire. Evaluation will be based on lab work, one hour test,
and a final exam.
Prerequisites: Geosciences 202. No enrollment limit (expected: 12).

GEOS 304T(S) Paleoecology (W)
Ecology embraces the study of living plant and animal associations and their response to highly varied
physical conditions found in a wide variety of ecosystems. The goal of paleoecology is to trace the evolu-
tionary history of ancient ecosystems through geologic time. Each discipline offers a fascinating perspec-
tive on the other. Topics of discussion include: the role of biological and physical controls in the structure of
communities; interpretation of fossil assemblages; meaning of biodiversity through a range of local to
Geosciences
­ 176 ­
global scales; ecological succession in recent and ancient communities; role of mass extinctions in long-
term community evolution. Ecosystems considered include marine-shelf benthos, reefs, rocky shores, rain
forests, grasslands, and deep-sea hydrothermal vents. Readings are selected from current and recent jour-
nal literature in biology and geology.
Format: tutorial. Following an initial group meeting, students will meet in pairs for tutorials. Two lab ses-
sions and a final group meeting are required. Evaluation will be based on five orally presented, written
essays, as well as weekly participation in discussions.
Prerequisite: any 100-level Geosciences course. Enrollment limit: 12 (expected: 10). Preference given to
sophomores and juniors who have taken Geosciences 101.
Tutorial meetings to be arranged. M. JOHNSON
GEOS 350T(S) Tectonics, Erosion, and Climate (W)
Traditional models of landscape development postulate rapid pulses of tectonic uplift followed by long
periods of gradual erosion. In sharp contrast, recent studies suggest that landscape is the product of
complex interactions between tectonics, erosion, and climate. It is clear that tectonic uplift directly affects
erosion rates and may induce orographic climate changes, but can climatically enhanced erosion rates
drive tectonic processes? Can very rapid uplift and erosion in one region, such as the Himalayas, affect
global climate by sequestering greenhouse gases during the weathering of sediments? Some researchers
believe so. This course will explore the feedback mechanisms that have been proposed to explain how
tectonics, erosion, and climate
affect one another and produce the landscapes we observe today. Topics will include plate tectonics and
crustal thickening, erosion and exhumation processes, climate and erosion rates, isostasy, equilibrium
landscapes, formation of orogenic plateaus, and formation of the Himalayas and development of the Asian
monsoon.
Format: tutorial. After an initial group meeting, students will meet in pairs for one hour each week with the
instructor. Each student will orally present a written paper every other week for criticism during the tutorial
session.
Evaluation will be based on five 5-page papers and each student's effectiveness as a critic.
Prerequisites: at least one of the following courses: Geosciences 201, 202, 301, 302, 303, or 401 or with
permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected:10). Preference given to Geosciences majors.
Tutorial meetings to be arranged. KARABINOS
GEOS 401(F) Stratigraphy
Study of the composition, sequence, and correlation of layered sedimentary rocks is traditionally applied to
geologic mapping and the reconstruction of ancient environments. Through the use of various time scales,
stratigraphy is the unifier of historical geology while also at the heart of conceptual debates over the uni-
formism or episodicity of geological processes. During the first half of the course, emphasis will be placed
on the various methods of correlation based on physical means and the use of fossils. The second half of
the course will focus on plate migrations and the relationships between climate and depositional environ-
ments as a model for the broad scale interpretation of sedimentary sequences. This part of the course will
be conducted as a seminar, with students responsible for topics on the paleogeographic linkage of climate-
sensitive facies and natural resources. As a final project, students working individually or in pairs will pres-
ent a detailed analysis of North-American stratigraphic relationships during a specific interval of Cambrian
to Cretaceous time. In sequence, these class reports will provide highlights of the geologic history of the
North-American continent through Paleozoic and Mesozoic time.
Format: lecture, three hours a week; one three-hour lab per week during the first half of the course (includ-
ing field problems); independent projects during the second half of the course; one major field trip. Evalua-
tion will be based on weekly lab assignments during the first half of the semester, seminar participation,
and the completion of a final project during the second half of the semester, as well as a midterm and a final
exam.
Prerequisites: Geosciences 302 or permission of instructor. No enrollment limit (expected: 12).

ates: DELACROIX, GRUBER,
LANGUAGE STUDY
The department provides language instruction to enable the student to acquire all four linguistic skills:
understanding, speaking, reading, and writing. German 101-W-102 stresses communicative competence
and covers German grammar in full. German 103 combines a review of grammar with extensive practice
in reading and conversation. German 104 aims to develop facility in speaking, writing, and reading. Ger-
man 111-112 offers an alternative introduction to German with a focus on reading competence. German
201 emphasizes accuracy and idiomatic expression in speaking and writing. German 202 combines ad-
vanced language study with the examination of topics in German-speaking cultures. Students who have
studied German in secondary school should take the placement test given during First Days in September
to determine which course to take.
STUDY ABROAD
The department strongly encourages students who wish to attain fluency in German to spend a semester
or year studying in Germany or Austria, either independently or in one of several approved foreign study
programs. German 104 or the equivalent is the minimum requirement for junior-year abroad programs
sponsored by American institutions. Students who wish to enroll directly in a German-speaking university
should complete at least 201 or the equivalent. In any case, all students considering study-abroad should
discuss their language preparation with a member of the department.
LITERATURE IN TRANSLATION
The department regularly offers courses on German literature in translation for students who have little
or no knowledge of German, but who wish to become acquainted with the major achievements in German
literary and intellectual history.
ADVANCED STUDIES
The department offers a variety of advanced courses for students who wish to investigate German litera-
ture, thought, and culture in the original. German 202 is given each year and is recommended as prepara-
tion for upper-level courses.
THE CERTIFICATE IN GERMAN
To enhance a student's educational and professional profiles, the department offers the Certificate in
German. It requires seven courses--three fewer than the major--and is especially appropriate for students
who begin study of the language at Williams.
Students who enter Williams with previous training in German may substitute more advanced courses
for the 100-level courses; they can also be exempted from up to two of the required courses.
Students must receive a minimum grade of B in each course taken in the sequence. In addition, they
must score of at least 650 (out of a possible 800) on the ETS (Educational Testing Service) Proficiency
Test.
Appropriate elective courses can usually be found among the offerings of German, Art History, History,
Music, Philosophy, Political Science, and Theatre.

THE MAJOR
The German major offers students an interdisciplinary approach to German intellectual and cultural his-
tory by combining courses in German language and literature with courses in History, Philosophy, Music,
and other appropriate fields.
For students who start German at Williams, the major requires a minimum of ten courses: German
101-102, 103, 104, 201 and 202; two 300-level German courses; and two electives from either German
courses numbered above 202 or appropriate offerings in other departments.
For students who have acquired intermediate or greater proficiency in the language before coming to
Williams, the minimum requirement is nine courses: German 202; two 300-level German courses; and six
other courses selected from German courses numbered above 102 and appropriate offerings in other de-
partments.
Examples of appropriate courses in other departments are:

Austria in the junior year.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN GERMAN
Students earn honors by completing a senior thesis (German 493-W31-494) of honors quality.
Students interested in honors should consult with the department chair no later than April 15 of their
junior year. The usual qualifications for pursuing honors are: (1) an overall GPA of 3.33 or better, (2) a
departmental GPA of 3.67 or better, (3) a strong interest in a specific topic for which an appropriate faculty
advisor will be available in the senior year.
GERM 101(F)-W88-102(S) Elementary German
German 101-102 is for students with no previous study of German whose ultimate aim is to gain compre-
hensive fluency in the language. The course employs a communicative approach involving all four lan-
guage skills: listening comprehension, speaking, reading, and writing. We focus initially on practice in un-
derstanding the spoken language and then move rapidly to basic forms of dialogue and self-expression. In
the second semester, reading and especially writing come increasingly into play. The course meets five
days a week. Credit granted only on successful completion of 102. Students are required to attend and pass
the sustaining program in Winter Study Period.
Format: lecture and discussion. Principal requirements: active class participation, written homework, short
compositions, oral exercises and tests.

GERM 103(F) Intermediate German I
Intensive grammar review. Practice in writing and speaking, vocabulary building. Students will learn scan-
ning and predicting skills on a variety of texts and become proficient at decoding unfamiliar material. For
three weeks of the course, we will interact with students in the intermediate German course at Vassar Col-
lege, through a Web-based German-language MOO (a discussion and design medium), on projects con-
cerning private and public selves.
Prerequisites: German 101-102 or equivalent preparation.

GERM 111(F)-112(S) Reading German for Beginners
German 111-112 is for students whose principal reason for acquiring German is to work with written mate-
rials. It is particularly appropriate for students majoring in fields in which the ability to read primary and
secondary texts in German can be crucial, such as Art History, Classics, Comparative Literature, History,
Music, Philosophy, Political Science, and Theatre. In the first semester students learn the elements of gram-
mar and acquire a core vocabulary. In the second semester, while covering advanced grammatical topics,
they practice reading in a variety of textual genres in the humanities and social sciences. They also learn
how to work with dictionaries, encyclopedias, and other reference works, in both printed and online forms.
By the end of the course they will have a solid foundation for building proficiency in German, whether
through self-study or further course work. Credit granted only on successful completion of 112.
Format: lecture and discussion. Principle requirements: written homework, quizzes, tests, active class par-
ticipation.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20 (expected: 15). Preference given to art-history graduate students,
seniors and juniors.

GERM 202(S) Vienna
Once the center of a vast empire, Austria has tended to be overlooked since the demise of that empire. In
fact, though, its trajectory can usefully serve as a guide to the complex developments in Europe before,
during, and after the Second World War. Contemporary Austria is indeed a laboratory of post-Cold War
Europe: Its population is remarkably multicultural, in spite of resistances; its language is rich and dynamic,
yet increasingly dominated by its more powerful neighbor to the north; its political attitudes encompass
extreme nationalism, pan-Europeanism, and much in between. Austria's capital, Vienna, will form the lens
through which we examine the origins and quirks of this fascinating, sometimes paradoxical, culture. The
course will employ a variety of written, video, audio and cyber-materials to explore some of the issues
facing contemporary Austria, and to continue the development of advanced reading, writing, and speaking
skills begun in German 107. Conducted in German. Requirements: active class participation, several 1-2
page writing assignments, final project. Prerequisite: German 107 or the equivalent. Expected enrollment:

GERM 305(S) From the "Wende" 'til Today in Literature, Films, and Politics
This course will investigate recent trends and developments in Germany since the fall of the Berlin Wall.
Even though they are now one political entity, East and West are divided by economy, lived experience and
mentality. We will focus on recent memoirs and films that look back at growing up in the different cultures,
or, in the works of Turkish-Germans, living with the contradictions of East and West. Women's issues,
immigrant concerns and social reforms will be foregrounded.
Films will include among others: Head-on, Im Juli, Good-bye, Lenin, Herr Lehmann, Das Leben ist eine
Baustelle, Schultze gets the Blues. Conducted in German.
Authors will include: Julia Schoch, Jana Simon, André Kubiczek, Claudia Rusch, Daniel Wiechmann,
Jana Hensel, Barbara Honigmann, Julia Franck, Yadé Kara, Sven Regener, Wladimir Kaminer and Jakob

GERM 311(F) Freud and Kafka (Same as Comparative Literature 311)
The life and work of Sigmund Freud and Franz Kafka enact some of the tensions that drove the twentieth
century: empire vs. national identity, cultural cosmopolitanism vs. ethnic specificity, tradition vs. moderni-
ty, social/communal vs. psychological/individual reality. In some ways these two Jewish men, living in two
imperial cities on the brink of collapse, both writing in German, are remarkably similar. Both struggle with
fathers and father figures, both experience deep ambivalence about the dominant discourse of their
spheres, both ultimately create a radically new intellectual vocabulary that becomes embedded in the twen-
tieth-century mind. But while Freud strove constantly for public success within established medical and
scientific circles, Kafka wrote under cover of night and circulated his work only among a few close friends.
Freud's German language is linked to a long tradition of assimilation to the dominant culture; Kafka's, on
the other hand, bespeaks a linguistic marginality matching his ethnic status. This course will examine
prominent and less prominent texts of both figures with an eye toward gaining a better understanding of
German, History

their sociohistorical, cultural, psychological, and intellectual-historical significance. We will also explore
Freud's and Kafka's influence on the intellectual and popular culture of subsequent generations. Readings

GENERAL STATEMENT OF GOALS
The core objectives of the History department are the cultivation of a critical understanding and aware-
ness of the past and the development of our students' intellectual, analytical, and rhetorical abilities. In
pursuit of the first objective, through its curricular offerings the department seeks both to expose students to
the richness, diversity, and complexities of human history over long periods of time and in different geo-
graphic regions and to provide students with the opportunity to explore aspects of the past in depth. At the
same time, the department endeavors to develop students' ability to think historically and to foster in them
an appreciation of the contested nature and the value of historical knowledge by confronting them with the
variety of ways in which historians have approached and interpreted the past, engaging them in issues that
provoke historical debate, and familiarizing them with the nature and uses of historical evidence. By en-
gaging students in the critical study of the past, finally, the department seeks to develop their ability to
formulate historically informed opinions and their analytical and rhetorical skills generally. While mem-
bers of the department attempt to accomplish these multiple objectives individually through their particular
courses and their other contacts with students, the department seeks to do so collectively through the struc-
ture of the History curriculum and the requirements of the History major.
COURSE NUMBERS
The course numbering system used by the History Department reflects the different types and objectives
of courses offered at each level. The different course levels are distinguished less by degree of difficulty
than by the purposes that the courses at each level are intended to serve and the background knowledge
they presume.
First-Year Seminars and Tutorials (102-199): These writing intensive courses introduce students to the
richness of historical approaches to the past and to the contested subjects on which historians focus. They
History
­ 181 ­
emphasize the acquisition of skills needed in the advanced study of history and are ideal for students con-
templating a major in History. Each seminar is limited to nineteen students, and each tutorial, to ten stu-
dents. In the case of seminars, preference is given to first-year students and then to sophomores. First-year
students and sophomores will be given equal preference in the case of tutorials, to which the writing of five
or six essays and the oral presentation of five or six critiques of another student's essays are central. In any
case, first-year students will not normally be permitted to enroll in a tutorial during their first semester.
Because first-year seminars and tutorials serve as an introduction to the study of history, only one course of
each type may count toward the History major; these courses can also be used to meet the department's
group and concentration requirements.
Introductory Survey Courses (202-299): These courses are open to all students and are intended to provide
a basic understanding of the history of peoples, countries, and geographic regions over relatively long
time-spans. Most of all, they will provide students with the background necessary for more advanced study
in history at the 300 and 400 level. They are offered in either small or large formats, depending on the
individual course.
Junior Seminars (301): Junior seminars explore the nature and practice of history, are required for the de-
gree in History, and are normally restricted to junior History majors. Although these seminars vary in topic
and approach, each focuses on the discipline of history itself--on the debates over how to approach the
past, on questions of the status of different kinds of evidence and how to use it, on the purpose of the study
of history. Focusing on questions of methodology, epistemology, and historiography, these courses ask:
What kind of knowledge do historians claim to produce? What does it mean to study the past? How do
historians approach the project of studying the past? Each year several junior seminars will be offered;
prospective majors must select two junior seminars at the end of their sophomore year and will then be
assigned to one of their two choices. If students are studying away from Williams during their junior year,
they must enroll in a junior seminar during their senior year.
Advanced Electives (302-399): These advanced, topical courses are more specialized in focus than are the
introductory survey courses (202-299) and are intended to follow such courses. Enrollment is often limit-
ed. Because these courses may presume some background knowledge, the instructor may recommend that
students enroll in an appropriate introductory course before registering for an advanced elective.
Advanced Seminars (402-479): These are advanced courses normally limited in enrollment to fifteen stu-
dents. Each seminar will investigate a topic in depth and will require students to engage in research that
leads to a substantial piece of historical writing. All History majors are required to complete either an ad-
vanced seminar (402-479) or a tutorial (480-492). Instructors may recommend prior coursework in the
area of the seminar. Preference is given to senior History majors, followed by junior History majors.
Advanced Tutorials (480-492): These are advanced reading and writing courses that offer an in-depth anal-
ysis of a topic in tutorial format. Tutorials are limited in enrollment to ten students and preference is given
to senior History majors. All History majors are required to complete either an advanced seminar
(402-479) or a tutorial (480-492). Instructors may recommend prior coursework in the area of the tutorial.
The writing of five or six essays and the oral presentation of five or six critiques of another student's essays
are central to tutorials.
Within each of these levels, courses are further divided by geographical area:
Africa and the Middle East 102-111 202-211 302-311 402-411
Asia 112-121 212-221 312-321 412-421

Transnational/Comparative 192-199 292-299 392-396 472-479
ADVISING
Both majors and non-majors are encouraged to talk at any time with the department chair, the depart-
ment administrative assistant, or any other member of the department about the History major.
All majors will be able to choose a faculty advisor. All majors must meet with their advisor, or the de-
partment chair, during the first week of classes during the fall semester and at the time of the spring semes-
ter registration period in order to have their courses and plans for the History major approved. Students
who are interested in the senior honors program or graduate school should contact Professor Kittleson.
Prospective study abroad students should contact Mrs. Swift.
ADVANCED PLACEMENT
Students receiving a score of 5 on any AP history examination will be guaranteed a place in the 100-lev-
el History seminar of their choice.
THE MAJOR
The major consists of at least nine semester courses as follows:
Required Courses in the Major
One Junior Seminar (History 301)
History
­ 182 ­
At least one Advanced Seminar (History 402-479) or Tutorial (History 480-492)
Elective Courses
Seven (or more) additional semester courses in History, at least one of these to be chosen from each of
the following three groups:
Group A: History of the United States
Group B: European History (including Russian History)
Group C: History of Asia, Africa and the Middle East, and/or Latin-American and the Caribbean
In addition, students must take at least one course dealing with the premodern period (designated Group
D in the catalog); this may be one of the courses used to fulfill the group requirement (Groups A-C).
A single course can meet the requirement for no more than one of Groups A through C. Only one First-
year seminar and one First-year tutorial (102-199) may be used to meet the group requirements.
Concentration in the Major
All students are required to adopt a concentration within the History major. The concentration should be
selected in consultation with a faculty advisor at spring registration during the sophomore year. A list of
concentrations is appended below and a list of the courses that fall within each concentration is available
from the History Department office and can also be found on the department's website. Students must
choose to concentrate in one of these eighteen broad areas unless they petition the department's Curricu-
lum Committee to substitute a concentration of their own design. A concentration will consist of at least
three courses linked by common themes, geography, or time period; only one of those courses can be a
100-level seminar while at least one must be a 300- or 400-level course. Courses in the concentration may
be used to fulfill the group requirements. In selecting courses to meet their concentration requirement, stu-
dents should be aware that not every course is offered every year. Courses taken abroad may be included in
the concentration with the approval of the chair.
Concentrations:
1. Africa and the African Diaspora
2. Asia and the Asian Diaspora
3. The Middle East
4. Comparative Slavery
5. Ancient, Medieval, and Renaissance Europe
6. Early Modern Europe
7. Modern Europe
8. Gender and Sexuality
9. History of Ideas
10. Imperialism, Nationalism, and European Expansion
11. Latin America and the Caribbean
12. Latin America and the Latina/o Diaspora
13. Religion
14. The Twentieth-Century World
15. Colonial North America and the United States to 1865
16. The United States Since 1865
17. Race and Ethnicity in North America
18. Urban and Environmental History
19. War and Revolution
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN HISTORY
The History Department offers a thesis route to the degree with honors in History. This involves a ten-
course major as well as an independent WSP. Students wishing to undertake independent research or con-
sidering graduate study are encouraged to participate in the thesis program and honors seminar.
Application to enter the honors program should be made by spring registration in the junior year and
should be based on a solid record of work of honors caliber, normally defined as maintaining at least a B+
average in courses taken for the major. Students who intend to write an honors thesis must submit a pro-
posal to the History Department at this time. Students who will be away during the spring semester of their
junior year should make arrangements to apply before leaving. Normally, it is the responsibility of the indi-
vidual student to procure the agreement of a member of the department to act as his or her thesis advisor,
and the student must therefore consult with a member of the department about a thesis topic and a possible
thesis advisor prior to submitting a proposal to the department. A student who is uncertain of which mem-
ber of the department might be an appropriate advisor, or who otherwise is unable to find an advisor,
should contact the chair of the honors committee. An honors thesis proposal must be signed by a member
of the History Department. Normally, the thesis topic should be related to course work which the student
has previously done. Students should be aware, however, that while the department will try to accommo-
date all students who qualify to pursue honors, particular topics may be deemed unfeasible and students
may have to revise their topics accordingly. Final admission to the honors program will depend on the
department's assessment of the qualifications of the student and the feasibility of the project.
History
­ 183 ­
Once the student has been notified of admission to the honors program, he or she should register for
History 493, Senior Honors Thesis Research Seminar, in the fall semester, for History 031 during winter
study, and for History 494, Senior Honors Thesis Writing Seminar, in the spring. In addition to doing the
research for and writing a thesis of approximately 75-100 pages, students will attend special presentations
under the History Department's Class of 1960 Scholars Program.
During the fall, students should work regularly on their research and consult frequently with their advi-
sors. Throughout the semester, honors candidates will also present written progress reports for group dis-
cussion to the seminar (History 493). Performance in the seminar will be evaluated on the basis of class
participation and completed written work and will determine if a student will continue in the thesis pro-
gram. For students proceeding to History 031 and History 494, performance in the fall semester will figure
into the thesis grade calculated at the end of the year.
Students who are deemed to be making satisfactory progress on their research and writing at this point
will be allowed to continue with the thesis. They will devote the entire winter study period to thesis work.
They should conclude their research during winter study and complete at least one chapter of their thesis
for submission to their advisor before the end of winter study. At the end of winter study, the honors com-
mittee will formally consult with advisors and make recommendations to the department concerning
which students should be allowed to proceed with the thesis. During the early weeks of the second semes-
ter, students will present a draft chapter of their thesis to the honors seminar.
Completed theses will be due in mid-April, after which each student will prepare and make a short oral
presentation of his or her thesis for delivery at the departmental Honors Colloquium. Another student who
has read the thesis will then offer a critique of it, after which the two faculty readers of the thesis will offer
their own comments and questions. Finally, there will be a general discussion of the thesis by students and
other members of the department.
LANGUAGE
Study of a foreign language is basic to the understanding of other cultures. Particularly those students
who might wish to do graduate work in History are encouraged to enroll in language courses at Williams.
COURSES
FIRST-YEAR SEMINARS AND TUTORIALS (102-199)
These writing intensive courses introduce students to the richness of historical approaches to the past
and to the contested subjects on which historians focus. They emphasize the acquisition of skills needed in
the advanced study of history and are ideal for students contemplating a major in History. Each seminar is
limited to nineteen students, and each tutorial, to ten students. In the case of seminars, preference is given to
first-year students and then to sophomores. First-year students and sophomores will be given equal prefer-
ence in the case of tutorials, to which the writing of five or six essays and the oral presentation of five or six
critiques of another student's essays are central. In any case, first-year students will not normally be per-
mitted to enroll in a tutorial during their first semester. Because first-year seminars and tutorials serve as an
introduction to the study of history, only one course of each type may count toward the History major;
these courses can also be used to meet the department's group and concentration requirements.
FIRST-YEAR SEMINARS AND TUTORIALS: Africa and the Middle East (111-121)
HIST 111(S) Movers and Shakers in the Middle East (Same as Leadership Studies 150)
(W)*
This course examines the careers, ideas, and impact of leading politicians, religious leaders, intellectuals,
and artists in the Middle East in the twentieth century. Utilizing biographical studies and the general litera-
ture on the political and cultural history of the period, this course will analyze how these individuals
achieved prominence in Middle Eastern society and how they addressed the pertinent problems of their
day, such as war and peace, relations with Western powers, the role of religion in society, and the status of
women. A range of significant individuals will be studied, including Gamal Abd al-Nasser, Mustafa Ke-
mal Ataturk, Ayatollah Khomeini, Muhammad Mussadiq, Umm Khulthum, Sayyid Qutb, Anwar Sadat,
Naghuib Mahfouz, and Huda Shaarawi.

HIST 118(S) "Ten Years of Madness": The Chinese Cultural Revolution (W)*
In 1966 Mao Zedong launched the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in an attempt to restore revolu-
tionary purity to the Chinese Communist Party and society. The Cultural Revolution decade (1966-1976)
is remembered most often as a period of political violence and intense struggle, over which Mao reigned as
supreme leader. In this course, we will complicate this standard interpretation by examining the Cultural
Revolution in a variety of ways: as an elite political struggle, an attempt to proletarianize culture and the
arts, a social movement, and a youth movement. The course will address themes of participation and com-
plicity, new gender roles, impact on different social groups, and differences between rural and urban exper-
ience. In addition to relevant historiographical works, the course will use memoirs, fiction, films, and eth-
nographies.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class participation, several short papers, and a final research

FIRST-YEAR SEMINARS AND TUTORIALS: EUROPE AND RUSSIA (122-141)
HIST 124(S) The Vikings (W)
Viking raiders in longships burst through the defenses of ninth-century Europe, striking terror in the hearts
of peasants, monks, and kings for the next three centuries. Yet the impact of these sea-born Scandinavians
on European civilization was more complex and constructive than portrayed by medieval chroniclers.
Vikings acted as merchants, craftsmen, farmers, settlers, and mercenaries, and they colonized regions
beyond the edges of the known world like Russia, Iceland, and North America. This course explores the
complicated relationship of the Vikings with the medieval world and examines important developments
within Scandinavian society such as kingship, trade, and Christianization. At the same time, we will
consider the methodological difficulties presented by the diverse and often contradictory historical sources
for the Vikings such as monastic chronicles, archaeology, inscriptions, and Scandinavian sagas.
Format: seminar/lecture. Evaluation will be based on class participation and several papers and assign-
ments.

HIST 127(F) (formerly 105) The Expansion of Europe (W)
This course investigates the expansion of European power and influence over much of the rest of the world
from the late Middle Ages to the mid-nineteenth century--the early period of European Imperialism.
Specific topics will vary, but include the development and initial expansion of medieval and Renaissance
Europe, the discovery and conquest of the New World, the struggle with Islam for command of the seas,
the establishment of European influence in the East and Far East, the slave trade, the invasion of North
America, and the initial steps toward hegemony in the Middle East and Africa. Students will investigate the
ways in which individual personality, religiosity, greed, critical first contacts, and cultural
misunderstandings and prejudices combined with important aspects of the Military, Scientific, and early
Industrial Revolutions to establish European hegemony on a world-wide scale during this early period of
European Imperialism.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on five short written exercises and one research paper.

HIST 135T(F) The Great War, 1914-1918 (Same as Leadership Studies 135T) (W)
During the nineteenth and early twentieth century Europeans and their immediate offspring created the
modern world. European industry, science, trade, weapons, and culture dominated the globe. After a centu-
ry of general peace the continual "progress" of Western Civilization seemed assured. Then, in August,
1914, the major European powers went to war with one another. After four years of unprecedented car-
nage, violence, and destruction, Europe was left exhausted and bitter, its previous optimism replaced by
pessimism, its world position undermined, and its future clouded by a deeply flawed peace settlement.
What were the fundamental causes of the Great War? How and why did it break out when it did and who
was responsible? Why was it so long, ferocious, wasteful, and, until the very end, indecisive? Why did the
Allies, rather than the Central Powers, emerge victorious? What did the peace settlement settle? How was
Europe changed? What is the historical significance of the conflict?

HIST 136(F) Before the Deluge: Paris and Berlin in the Interwar Years (W)
Paris and Berlin were the two poles of Europe in the 1920s, rival capital cities of two historically hostile
nations that had only just put an end to the carnage of World War I. Paris was the grande dame; Berlin the
upstart. In the 1920s, these two pulsating metropolises became the sites of political and cultural movements
that would leave a lasting imprint on European society until the present day. This course focuses on the
politics, society, and culture of these two cities in their heyday in the 1920s. We will also consider their fate
in the 1930s, first as depression set in, and then as the Nazis came to power. Devoting half the semester to
Paris and the other half to Berlin, we will examine a range of parallel topics in both contexts, including the
impact of World War I, the growing popularity of right-wing political movements and the increase in politi-

HIST 140T(S) Fin-de Siecle Russia: Cultural Splendor, Imperial Decay (W)
Imperial Russia on the eve of the First World War presents a complex picture of political conflict, social
and economic change, and cultural ferment and innovation. Newly emergent political parties sought to
enlist mass support to transform or overthrow the tsarist regime, which in turn endeavored to preserve itself
through reform, repression, and the refashioning of its image. Rapid urbanization and industrialization, and
the spread of education and literacy, gave rise to social conflict and dislocation, demands for social reform,
and the redefinition of individual identities and beliefs. These political, social, cultural, and economic
developments provided a fertile context for the burst of literary creativity and the emergence of modernist
literary and artistic movements that occurred in fin-de-siecle Russia. Intended for first- and second-year
students, this tutorial seeks to familiarize students with the ways historians study and attempt to understand
the past through an exploration of the interrelationships between political conflict, social and economic
change, and literary and artistic creativity in imperial Russia between the 1880s and the October
Revolution of 1917.
Format: tutorial. Evaluation will be based on tutorial participation, and responses to tutorial partner's es-
says.

HIST 148(F) (formerly 102) The Mexican Revolution: 1910 to NAFTA (W)*
The first great revolution in the twentieth century, the Mexican Revolution was as dramatic and compelling
as later episodes in Russia, China and Cuba. Using a wide variety of sources--from films, murals, and
comic books to classic works of political and social history--this seminar will examine the forces that
exploded in over a decade of violence and produced the peculiar "institutional revolutionary" government
that ruled Mexico from the 1920s to the crises of the late 1990s. Was the Revolution a true social revolution
or just a "palace coup"? Did workers, women, peasants, or indigenous peoples make real gains in social or
political power during the after the Revolution? How democratic or authoritarian is the Mexico that
emerged from the brutal decade of the 1910s? Finally, in light of globalization, the political scandals of the
1990s, and ongoing peasant rebellion in Chiapas, is the Revolution dead or is its promise only now to be
fulfilled?

HIST 164(S) Slavery in the American South (W)*
No area of American social history has been more active and exciting in recent years than the study of
slavery. This seminar will introduce students to the most important aspects of the South's slave system. We
will begin by reading a number of key books in the field, and then we will turn to the College library's
extensive holdings of microfilm records dealing with both agricultural and industrial slavery. In
consultation with the instructor, each student will select the records of a slave-manned plantation or
industrial site for careful and detailed study. The most important piece of work in the seminar will be a
research paper that each student will prepare using the manuscript source materials.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class attendance and participation, several short preliminary
essays, and a final research paper.

to the quest for racial justice in twentieth-century America, Dr. King's leadership should be understood
within the context of ongoing national and grassroots political activism before, during, and after the 1963
March on Washington. This introductory course focuses on the social, political, and public policy
perspectives that informed twentieth-century struggles for black civil rights. Using a variety of sources
(memoirs, photography, film, and music), we will consider historical debates as well as the period's impact
on our understanding of African American and American history.

HIST 203(F) Sub-Saharan Africa Since 1800*
This survey of sub-Saharan African history takes up the continuing saga of African political, social and
economic developments from the aftermath of the trans-Atlantic slave trade to the present. It is divided into
three sections. The first section of the course focuses on the consequences of the slave trade on African
societies and on the Africans' interaction with European merchants, explorers, and missionaries in the
decades preceding colonial conquest. The human consequences of the trade lingered long after the
abolition of the slave trade across the Atlantic ocean. Many African societies were strengthened, often at
the expense of their neighbors; other societies were weakened, thus setting the stage for colonial conquest.
During the second half of the nineteenth century, however, competition among Europeans for control of
raw materials for their nascent industries led to colonization, and in some cases, to white settlement in
Africa.
The second section of the course investigates the process of colonial conquest and the dynamics of colonial
rule in Africa. It looks especially at the ways in which colonialism affected various groups of Africans, and
at the ways, both subtle and overt, in which Africans resisted or collaborated with colonial rule in order to
achieve their goals. The colonial period, brief in time, yet profoundly significant in its impact, was ushered
out partly by the rising tide of African nationalism.
The last section of the course, then, examines the rise of new nation-states, their colonial legacies,
post-colonial economies, and systems of justice, education, and governance.

Middle East. Topics to be covered include the relations with Great Powers, the impact of imperialism, the
challenge of modernity, the creation of nation states and nationalist ideologies, the discovery of oil, radical
religious groups, and war and peace. Throughout the course these significant changes will be evaluated in
light of their impact on the lives of individuals in the region and especially how they grapple with increas-
ing Western political and economic domination.

HIST 212(F) Transforming the "Middle Kingdom": China, 2000 BCE-1600*
China expanded from scattered Neolithic settlements to become one of the world's most complex and so-
phisticated civilizations. During this process, it experienced dramatic transformation as well as remarkable
institutional and cultural continuities. This course will examine Chinese history from prehistoric times to
the "early modern" seventeenth century. It will address topics such as the creation and transformation of
dynastic authority, the reinterpretation of Confucian thought, the transmission of Buddhism, the conquest
of China proper by "barbarian" peoples, the composition of elites, and change in daily life, popular culture
and China's place in the East Asian and world systems.

Observers may be struck by the apparent contradictions of contemporary China: market reforms undertak-
en by a nominally Communist government, extremes of urban wealth and rural poverty, increasing partici-
pation in the international community and intensifying nationalist rhetoric. This course will examine Chi-
na's historical engagement with the modern world in order to gain perspective on our current views. It will
cover the Qing (1644-1911) dynastic order, encounters with Western and Japanese imperialism, the rise of
Chinese nationalism, Republican and Communist revolutions, the "other Chinas" of Taiwan and Hong
Kong, economic liberalization, and globalization.

A modernizing revolution, the construction and collapse of an empire, devastating defeat in a World War,
occupation by a foreign power, and high-speed economic growth have marked Japan's modern experi-
ence. This course will examine the main themes of modern Japanese history with a focus on how various
"ordinary people" have lived through the extraordinary changes of the past century and a half. Through the
perspectives of ordinary people, from a young girl working in a cotton textile factory in the 1920s to a
salaryman in the post-World War II period, issues of class and status, gender, family, education, and work
will be addressed. Reading materials will include autobiographies, oral histories, and anthropological stud-
ies.

HIST 223(F) (formerly 218) Roman History (Same as Classics 223)
The study of Roman history involves questions central to the development of Western institutions, religion,
and modes of thought. Scholars have looked to Rome both for actual antecedents of European cultural
development and for paradigmatic scenes illustrating what they felt were cultural universals. Yet Roman
history also encompasses the most far-reaching experience of diverse cultures, beliefs, and practices
known in the Western tradition until perhaps contemporary times. A close analysis of Roman history on its
own terms shows the complex and fascinating results of an ambitious, self-confident nation's encounter
both with unexpected events and crises at home, and with other peoples. As this course addresses the
history of Rome from its mythologized beginnings through the reign of the emperor Constantine, it will
place special emphasis on the impressive Roman ability to turn the unexpected into a rich source of cultural
development, as well as the complex tendency later to interpret such ad hoc responses as predestined and
inevitable. The Romans also provide a vivid portrait of the relationship between power and self-confidence
on the one hand, and violence and ultimate disregard for dissent and difference on the other. Readings for
this course will concentrate on a wide variety of original sources, and there will be a strong emphasis on the
problems of historical interpretation.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on weekly brief in-class response papers, one 8- to

HIST 225(F) The Middle Ages (Same as Religion 216)
This course explores the development of European and Mediterranean civilizations during the
thousand-year period known as the "Middle Ages." At the beginning of this period the Romans ruled a
massive empire that stretched from Britain to north Africa and from Spain to Iraq. A millennium later, this
classical and pagan world had broken apart into three successor civilizations: medieval Europe, the
Byzantine empire, and the Islamic world. This course investigates how this momentous transformation
occurred. We will examine such topics as relations between Romans and "barbarians," the spread of
Christianity and Islam, the development of kingdoms and empires, the Vikings and crusades, saints and
religious reformers, art and architecture, cities and trade, the persecution of Jews and heretics, as well as the
Black Death and Italian Renaissance.

HIST 228(S) Europe in the Twentieth Century
This survey course has two goals: to introduce students to the fundamental issues and experiences of the
last century of European history, from the eve of World War One to the present, and to teach students to be
historians. Toward that end, students will be required, in class and in written assignments, to use primary
sources in conjunction with secondary source readings to pose questions and suggest interpretations about
the past. Wars, depression, political changeovers, urbanization, technological advancements all have a pro-
found impact on the lives of ordinary people; so, too, ordinary people shape those historical developments.
We will focus on learning how to empathize with people from the past and to understand their experiences
on their terms. What was it like to return to civilian life after fighting in the First World War? What were the
experiences of Europeans between the wars? Why did so many Germans support Hitler and what was it
like for different segments of European society to live through World War II? In a divided postwar Europe,
what hopes and betrayals did Europeans on different sides of the Iron Curtain experience in the realms of
social, economic, and legal justice? How have Europeans since the fall of the Berlin Wall attempted to
confront their pasts? By the end of this course, students will be familiar with the central themes of the
history of twentieth-century Europe and understand how to analyze historical documents, which students
can replicate in their future research and writing.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, several quizzes, an exam, and
two papers.

HIST 230(F) Modern European Jewish History, 1789-1948
What does it mean to be a Jew? The vexed question of Jewish identity emerged at the end of the eighteenth
century in Europe and has dominated Jewish history throughout the modern period. Although Jewish
emancipation and citizenship followed different paths in France and the German states, in both cases Jews
were confronted by unprecedented opportunities for integration into non-Jewish society and
unprecedented challenges to Jewish communal life. This course will introduce students to the major social,
cultural, religious, and political transformations that shaped the lives of Europe's Jews from the outbreak of
the French Revolution to the aftermath of World War II. We will explore such topics as emancipation,
Jewish diversity, the rise of religious denominations within Judaism, competing political ideologies,
Jewish-gentile relations, the role of Jewish women, Jewish responses to Nazism, and the situation of Jews
in the immediate postwar period. In addition to broad historical treatments, course materials will include
memoirs and diaries.

HIST 243(S) Modern Latin America, 1822 to the Present*
This course will examine salient issues in the history of the independent nations of Latin America. The first
section of the course will focus on the turbulent formation of nation-states over the course of the nineteenth
century. In this regard the course will analyze the social and economic changes of the period up to World
War I and the possibilities they offered for both political order and disorder. Key topics addressed will
include caudillismo, the role of the Church in politics, economic dependency and development, and the
place of indigenous and African Latin-American peoples in new nations. The second section will move us
to questions in twentieth-century Latin-American history, including industrialization and urbanization; the
emergence of workers' and women's movements and the rise of mass politics; militarism, democracy, and
authoritarian governments; the influence of the U.S. in the region; and the construction of cultural
modernism in these "Third World" societies. Here and throughout the course we will strive for an
understanding of how social conflicts shaped and were shaped by economic and political forces.

This course provides an introduction to the history of the first two and a half centuries of the experience of
African Americans in colonial America and the United States. Economically, culturally, and politically,
African Americans had a profound effect on the historical landscape of this nation. The experience of slav-
ery necessarily dominates this history and it is the contours and nuances of slavery that give this course its
focus. We will explore the influence of African culture on early America, the role of gender in the Ameri-
can slave labor system, the development of racial classification in North America, and the cultural and
intellectual significance of the abolitionist movement. Our readings will include primary sources and sec-
ondary literature. Class meetings will combine lecture and discussion. Informed participation in class dis-

JUNIOR SEMINARS (301)
Junior seminars explore the nature and practice of history, are required for the degree in History, and are
normally restricted to junior History majors. Although these seminars vary in topic and approach, each
focuses on the discipline of history itself--on the debates over how to approach the past, on questions of
the status of different kinds of evidence and how to use it, on the purpose of the study of history. Focusing
on questions of methodology, epistemology, and historiography, these courses ask: What kind of knowl-
edge do historians claim to produce? What does it mean to study the past? How do historians approach the
project of studying the past? Each year several junior seminars will be offered; prospective majors must
select two junior seminars at the end of the sophomore year and will then be assigned to one of their two
choices. If students are studying away from Williams during their junior year, they must enroll in a junior
seminar during their senior year.

HIST 301A(F) Approaching the Past: History, Theory, Practice
This course will explore how the discipline of `History' has come to assume its present form and how a
number of historians since the 1820s have understood their craft. We will begin by discussing the work of
three great nineteenth-century historians (Macaulay, Marx, and Ranke) who believed that historical "truth"
existed and could, with skill, be deciphered. Next we will explore the philosophy and practice of the cultur-
al and social historians of the 1960s/1970s, comparing and contrasting it with that of their nineteenth-cen-
tury predecessors. We will then consider the work of those recent theorists who have tried to refute histo-
rians' claims to be able to capture the "truth" of the past, focusing on the state of the field in the wake of
challenges posed to its epistemological foundations by "post-modernism." We will conclude with an as-
sessment of the state of the discipline today. In general, we will be less concerned with "the past" than with
what historians do with "the past." Consequently, we will focus primarily on those abstract, philosophical
assumptions that have informed the practice of history.
Format: discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, a 250-word position statement ("What
is History?"), two 9- to 11-page interpretive essays, and a take-hone final exam.
Enrollment limit: 20 (expected: 15-20). Restricted to History majors.

HIST 301C(S) Approaching the Past: Practices of Modern History
What is history? What is it that historians do? In this course, students will explore questions of how and
why we historians practice our craft. The first section of the course will examine how historians come to
know, think about, and understand the past. Issues of objectivity and bias, types and uses of sources, and
the nature of historical "truth" will be discussed. Next, we will address the ways in which historians write
about the past, considering historical fiction and film, microhistory, and the influence of postmodernism on
historical narratives. Finally, we will examine the uses of history, including history education and the
construction of historical memory. The class will meet once a week, and each session will focus on some
theoretical material as well as readings that concretely illustrate the methodological issues at stake. These
readings will be drawn from topics in modern history, such as westward expansion in the United States, the
Pacific War, the Holocaust, and the age of terror.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class participation, response papers, short essays, and a re-
search project.

HIST 301F(S) Approaching the Past: Remembering American History
Much of what we know and understand about American history is rooted in the received narrative of our
national history, a history that is constructed of individual, collective, and a national memory of the past and
its meanings. This course will examine some forms through which American historical memory is present-
ed and (re)presented, such as monuments, museums, novels, film, photographs, and scholarly historical
writing, by considering a number of pivotal events, institutions, or eras in American history: slavery, race,
and the Civil War; the Great Depression; World War II; the Sixties and the war in Viet Nam; and the events
and aftermath of September 11, 2001.

HIST 311(S) The United States and the Middle East*
At the turn of the twentieth century, the United States was considered a benign superpower in the Middle
East. Americans were known as "innocents abroad" for their educational and philanthropic work. From a
distance, American society was admired for its affluence and freedom, and Middle Eastern politicians ea-
gerly sought American advice and assistance. Today, however, the situation could hardly be more different.
This course will examine the remarkable transformation of American involvement in the Middle East. Sig-
nificant cultural and political encounters of the latter half of the twentieth century will be assessed in order
to identify how the United States has approached the region and consider the multifaceted and sometimes
ambivalent reactions of people in the Middle East to increasing U.S. presence. It will also explore the diffi-
culty the United States has experienced in balancing diverse, and sometimes conflicting, foreign policy
interests, and will evaluate what may account for the increasing level of antagonism and mistrust on both
sides.

Although sometimes claimed as part of a set of immutable "Asian values", the Chinese family has not
remained fixed or stable over time. In this course, we will use the framework of "family" to gain insight
into gender, generational, and sexual roles in different historical periods. Beginning in the late imperial
period (16th-18th Centuries), we will examine the religious, marriage, sexual, and childrearing practices
associated with the "orthodox" Confucian family. We will then explore heterodox practices, debates over
and critiques of the family system, and the substantial history of family reform efforts in twentieth century
China.

An unabating tension between conflict and cooperation has been an undercurrent of U.S.-Japan relations in
the past one-hundred and fifty years, at times erupting into clashes reaching the scale of World War and at
times allowing for measured collaboration. This course will explore the complexities of U.S.-Japan
relations from the perspectives of both countries, with a focus on how culture, domestic concerns,
economic and political aims, international contexts, and race have helped shape the course and nature of
U.S.-Japan relations. Issues will extend beyond those of diplomatic history to examine how various types
of interactions have influenced the dynamics of power between the two countries and have shaped the
ways in which each country has understood and portrayed the other. Topics will include early U.S.-Japan
encounters, the road to World War, the politics and social history of the Occupation, trade relations, and the
U.S.-Japan security alliance. Contemporary topics will also be discussed and due attention will be given to

HIST 327(F) Knighthood and Chivalry
Today the terms "knighthood" and "chivalry" evoke romantic images of King Arthur and the Knights of
the Round Table. Throughout the Middle Ages, however, knighthood and chivalry described the warlike
and violent world of the European ruling class: the nobility. A knight was an armored warrior on
horseback, and chivalry described his bellicose aristocratic culture. This course seeks to understand the
origins, nature, and transformations of knighthood and chivalry during the Middle Ages. We will explore
such topics as the formation of the European nobility, the emergence of the ethos of knighthood, Christian
lay piety, family structure and inheritance patterns, the changing status of women, warfare and crusades,
life in castles, relations with peasants, jousting and tournaments, courtly love, chivalric literature, and the
emergence of "civilized" courtly manners.

HIST 328(S) Medieval Empires
Today the nation-state is the accepted form of political organization across the globe. But in Antiquity and

known world. This course explores the nature of empire and imperial rule in the late antique and medieval
world through several case studies: the late Roman empire of Constantine the Great, the Byzantine empire
of Justinian, the Frankish empire of Charlemagne, the Islamic caliphate of Harun al Rashid, and the Ger-
man Reich of Otto the Great. In examining these premodern world empires, we will investigate the nature
of imperial politics, government, ideology, warfare, cultural life, and economic organization, as well as the
causes for the rise and fall of empires.

HIST 335(S) (formerly 316) Britain 1945-1990: Gender, Race, Sexuality, and Social Change
A major theme in British historiography is the enormous social change that has taken place in Britain since
the end of World War II. In the 1950s, sociologists argued about the extent to which postwar affluence was
leading to the "embourgeoisement" of the working class; in the 1960s, the advent of the so-called
"Permissive Society" witnessed the flourishing of a culture of sex, drugs, and rock `n roll; in the 1970s, the
feminist movement challenged gender roles that earlier had seemed so secure; in the 1980s, Thatcherism
sought to halt the nation's apparent terminal deadline, finally, throughout this period successive ways of
immigration challenged the social and cultural homogeneity of white Britain. This course will explore
these themes, tracing the break-up of the so-called "postwar consensus" and the gradual emergence of a
new politics of class, gender, and sexuality in Britain. In attempting to make sense of these complex
transformations, we will consider primary and secondary material, including a dozen feature films, which
students will be expected to view outside of class.
Format: discussion. Evaluation will be based on participation in class discussion, two 8- to 10-page inter-

HIST 353(F) North American Indian History: Pre-Contact to the Present (Same as

In most renditions of North American history, Indian people only make cameo appearances as warriors or
victims bound to disappear in the face of relentless Euro-American imperialism. All too often, the
complexity and diversity of American Indian historical experiences and Indian people's role in shaping the
political, economic, and cultural history of the United States and Canada remain unexplored. In this course,
we will examine the historical significance of North American Indian actions and experiences from the
"pre-Columbian" era to the present. Our approach will be both chronological and thematic and will pay
close attention to the methods scholars have used to reconstruct American Indian perspectives. Our themes

HIST 357(F) Race, Region, and the Rise of the Right
It may be hard to imagine the American political landscape today without conservatism, and yet like its
counterpart--liberalism--conservatism is a creature with a complicated history. While drawing on Euro-
pean ideas that were emerging in reaction to fascism and communism, conservatism also had its American
origins in a backlash against the New Deal, particularly in the South and the West, and particularly to liber-
als' growing belief that the federal government should expand its powers to protect the rights of African

Americans and working-class Americans. While the Reagan presidency signified to many "the end of the
New Deal order," it remains unclear in the post-9/11 world what precise legacy of conservatism his admin-
istration established. This course will explore the issues that conservatives have embraced in different peri-
ods since the New Deal; what issues have created conflict among conservative ranks; and how conserva-
tives have mobilized political power at different historical junctures.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, one book review, a take-home

HIST 364(F) (formerly 311) History of the Old South*
During the course of the semester, we shall investigate two broad, interrelated topics: slavery in the ante-
bellum South, and the impact of slavery on Southern civilization. Our approach will be primarily topical. In
the first half of the course, we shall look at subjects like the foreign and domestic slave trade, patterns of
work and treatment, the nature of the master-slave relationship, resistance and rebellion, and slave cultural,
social, and family life. The second half of the course will concentrate on the influence of the institution of
slavery on the mind, social structure, and economy of the Old South, and slavery's impact on Southern
politics and the decision for secession in 1860-61.

HIST 374(S) American Medical History
This course will cover major themes in American medical history and historiography from the colonial
period through the twentieth century. Every aspect of American "medicine" underwent tremendous
transition during the period we will study. Medical education, the medical profession, and notions about
cures and care changed fundamentally, as did ideas about the nature of illness itself. Our course of study, in
addition to charting ways in which the practice of medicine in America has developed, will make an equal
effort to understand how medicine has changed and affected American society. Topics that we will
investigate include cholera, TB, and childbirth in American society, as well as other medical phenomena.

HIST 440(F) Reform, Revolution, Terror: Russia, 1900-1939 (W)
The Russian Revolution of 1917 and the establishment of the Soviet Union are among the most important
and influential events of the twentieth century. Not surprisingly, almost every aspect of the Revolution and
the emergence of the Soviet system has aroused intense controversy, from the origins of these events and
processes, to their character and the forces driving them, to the nature and meaning of their outcome. The
purpose of this seminar is to enable students to explore the sources and process of revolution in early
twentieth-century Russia and the controversies the Revolution continues to provoke through both common
readings and a substantial independent research project. Class meetings, therefore, will be devoted initially
to the discussion of common readings intended to familiarize students with the main aspects and
interpretations of the Revolution (defined broadly as the period from roughly 1900 to 1939), and then to
helping students with their research. Topics for general discussion will include the prospects for
non-revolutionary change prior to 1914; the substance and significance of Marxist-Leninist ideology and
Bolshevik political culture; the interplay of social, political, ideological, and cultural forces in shaping the
revolution and the new Soviet order; the process of cultural revolution; and the origins and nature of
Stalin's "revolution from above" and the "Great Terror" of 1937-1939. Research topics will be chosen by
each student in consultation with the instructor and can concern any aspect of Russian history during the
revolutionary era.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on several short preliminary writing assignments, a final
research paper, oral presentations in class, and class participation. Although the common readings in the
seminar will be in English, the research project will provide an opportunity for students with reading
knowledge of Russian to use their language skills if they wish to do so.

HIST 466(S) (formerly 364) Imagining Urban America, Three Case Studies: Boston, Chicago,
and L.A. (Same as American Studies 364)
This course will explore the social, economic, and cultural lives of three cities, each of which at its zenith
seemed to contemporaries to represent definitive aspects of "American" development. We will begin with
Boston--the country's first "big" city and the nominal capital of Puritan New England--in the colonial
and early national periods. From there we will move to Chicago, the transportation and commercial hub of
the emerging national economy in the nineteenth century. Finally we will turn to Los Angeles, "The City of
Dreams" and the center of the popular entertainment industry in the twentieth century. In each case, draw-
ing on a variety of sources, we will examine the city's origins, the factors that promoted its growth, and the
distinctive society it engendered. Then we will consider some of the city's cultural expressions--expres-
sions that seem to characterize not only changing the nature of urban life, but the particular meanings each
city gave to the nation's experience at the time. What made these cities seem simultaneously, as they did, so
alluring and so threatening to the fabric of national community and identity?

from the turn-of-the century to the present. As we discuss the period from the interpretive frameworks that
have guided scholarship in black urban studies, we will focus on selected themes such as migration, the
black family, political activism, and culture. We will explore the various dimensions of the black urban
experience by using primary resources, scholarly analyses, music, and film.

HIST 474(F) The History of Oil (Same as Environmental Studies 474)
Few discoveries have so fundamentally transformed the natural world and the organization of human life
as the discovery of oil. From our concern with global warning to the international conflicts regarding the
price and supply of petroleum, oil clearly occupies a central place in world politics and economics today,
not to mention in our daily lives. This course will investigate the history behind this pre-occupation with oil
production, focusing on several themes. First, we will explore how the exploration for oil, as well as the
technologies required for refining and transporting it, have altered the natural environment. Second, we
will examine the economic nature of oil exploration and in particular the boom-bust cycles that mark oil
production. With this latter theme, we will investigate both how domestic politics have revolved around oil
in the United States, as well as how international politics have been shaped by the problems of oil
production.
Evaluation will be based on class participation, weekly critical writing, and a major research paper (20-30
pages) based on primary documents.

HIST 481T(S) The American Revolution, 1763-1798: Meanings and Interpretations (W)*
During the second half of the eighteenth century, the political, social, and demographic landscape of east-
ern North America underwent dramatic transformations. If many of the characters and events marking the
transition of the region from a cluster of thirteen colonies to the first republic of the western hemisphere are
quite familiar to most Americans, the movement to independence and the creation of the United States
have been the subject of complex and sometimes contentious historical interpretations. This tutorial will
explore the ideological, economic, political, and cultural causes and consequences of the American Revo-
lution, from the emergence of increasing tensions between Great Britain and its North American colonies
to the attempts of the United States government to limit political expression and immigration in the new
nation. Through the close reading of some of the most significant scholarship of the period, we will seek to
understand how a multitude of historical actors of varied social, economic, religious, and ethnic back-
grounds made and shaped the famous political, military, and constitutional struggles of the Revolutionary
Era. By the end of this tutorial, students will have engaged and debated some of the most important histo-
riographical assessments of the Revolutionary Era. In their final assignment, students will be equipped to
provide an erudite and personal answer to the most important question of all: How revolutionary was the
Revolution?
Format: tutorial. Requirements: once a week for about an hour, student will meet with the instructor in
pairs. During our sessions, students will alternatively present orally or critique a written essay of seven
double-spaced pages on a topic assigned by the instructor. At the end of the semester, students will be
asked to write a final paper assessing the revolutionary nature of the American Revolution.

HIST 482T(S) Memory, History, and the Extermination of the Jews of Europe (W)
The atrocities committed by Nazi Germany during the Second World War continue to trouble historians in
their attempts to understand and represent them in all their magnitude and horror. Beyond historians, the
complicity of segments of European societies in perpetrating those atrocities continues to raise thorny
questions for postwar European nations about what their responsibilities are toward that past.
This tutorial will focus on a series of questions relating to the historicization and memorialization of the
extermination of European Jews. They include: Is the Holocaust unique? Is it a Jewish story or universal
story? Does the Holocaust raise different issues for the historian than other historical events? How should
the Holocaust be represented and what are the implications of different means of representing it? What
role, if any, did European Jews play in their own destruction? Has Germany faced up to its past? Were
Germans also victims of World War II? Who were the "bystanders" as compared to the "perpetrators"?
Were the postwar trials of perpetrators a travesty of justice? How appropriate are the different uses that
Israel and the United States have made of the Holocaust? By the end of the course, students will have
grappled with the ongoing controversies that have arisen among scholars, governments, and lay people
about the meaning (and meaninglessness) of the Holocaust for the postwar world. In a world in which
extraordinary acts of violence continue to be perpetrated and more and more nations' pasts are marked by
episodes of extreme criminality and/or trauma, exploring the manner by which one such episode has been
remembered, avenged, and adjudicated should prove relevant for future consideration of other societies'
efforts to confront their own traumatic pasts.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: weekly one-hour sessions with the instructor and a fellow student. Every
other week the student will write and present orally a 5- to 7-page paper on the assigned readings of that
week. On alternate weeks, the student will write a 2-page critique of the fellow student's paper. A final
written exercise, a thought piece on the issues raised in the tutorial, will cap off the semester's work.Enroll-

HIST 483T(F) African Political Thought (W)*
This course examines the ideas of major figures in the progressive tradition of African political thought.
This emancipatory tradition emerged in societies shaped by racial, cultural, and economic exploitation,
forcing both African men and women to address questions of identity and political action. Most members
of this tradition also considered the ways in which uneven power relations within African communities
shaped the personal and political landscapes. The Africans we will examine in this course drew on
History

resources as varied as Pan-Africanism, Nationalism, Classical Liberalism, Social Democracy, Marxism,
Black Consciousness, Negritude and Gender theory, yet each participated, at least implicitly, in a common

HIST 486T(F) Historical Memory of the Pacific War (Same as Japanese 486T) (W)*
Over half a century after Japan's surrender, the issue of how to remember the Pacific War continues to raise
controversy both within Japan and between Japan, Korea, and China. This tutorial will consider how indi-
viduals, groups of individuals, and nations construct and reconstruct historical memories by examining
how various Japanese have sought to remember the Pacific War. The course will begin with a discussion of
theoretical writings on the social and political construction of historical memory and the distinctions be-
tween official, collective, and historical memory. Then we will consider Japanese historical memory of the
Pacific War, focusing on how the Occupation and the Tokyo war crimes trial shaped how the war has been
remembered. We will also deal with how the war has been portrayed in literature, film and other media.
Finally, the course will explore how Japan's unique position as both wartime aggressor and victim has
influenced its relationships within East Asia. We will examine the mnemonic sites contested by Chinese,
Korean, and Japanese memories by discussing issues pertaining to military comfort women, the Nanking
massacre, Unit 731, history textbooks, and Yasukuni shrine. Themes will include how the construction of
memory is linked to the nation, how the passage of time influences the construction of historical memory,
and the dilemmas of coming to terms with pasts contested both within and between countries.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: students will meet with the instructor in pairs for an hour each week. Each
student will write and present orally a 5- to 7-page essay every other week on the readings assigned for that
week. In alternate weeks, students will be responsible for offering an oral critique of the work of their part-
ner. Students will be evaluated on their written work and their analyses of their partner's work. There will
be a final paper (15 pages) on the themes of the course.

HIST 492T(S) Revolutionary Thought in Latin America (W)*
Throughout Latin America revolution has been a focus of political and social thought--as well as political
organizing and armed initiatives--since the late eighteenth century and continues to be so, albeit in
changed form, today. This course will examine the trajectory of various types of revolutionary theory in
Latin America, from the anti-colonial and anti-white thought behind massive Andean uprisings in the
1780s to efforts to win national sovereignty and to construct socialist or other revolutionary states in mod-
ern Mexico, Guatemala, Cuba, and Nicaragua, and, more recently, to put more racially-, ethnically-, and
gender-oriented notions of social justice into place. We will work to measure the impact of revolutionary
thought as well as to tease out the internal tensions in the utopian ideals that revolutionaries have implicitly
or explicitly pursued. We will also weigh the impact of more strictly intellectual currents and of geopolitical
concerns on the evolution of Latin American ideas of revolution.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: students will meet with the instructor in pairs for an hour each week. Each

sional meetings in order to present and critique each other's proposals and drafts and to discuss common
problems in research and the design of a long analytical essay. Evaluation will be based on class participa-
tion and completed written work, and will determine if a student will continue in the thesis program. For
students proceeding to W31 and HIST 494, performance in the fall semester will figure into the thesis
grade calculated at the of the year. The quality of a student's performance in end the colloquium segment of
History 493, as well as his or her performance in all aspects of the May colloquium at which these are
presented and critiqued, will be figured into the overall grade the student is given for History 493-494 and

HISTORY OF SCIENCE
(Div. II & III, see course descriptions)
Chair, Professor DONALD deB. BEAVER
A major in the History of Science is not offered, but the occasional Contract Major in it or a related
interdisciplinary field is possible. Courses in the History of Science are designed primarily to complement
and strengthen work in other major fields. Although any of the courses may be taken separately, studying
related courses in other departments will enhance their value, because by nature, History of Science is in-
terdisciplinary.
The following will serve as examples: the 101 course is an introduction to science and technology stud-
ies, and concentrates on key aspects of contemporary science and technology relevant to many issues of
living in a technological society. Scientific Revolutions (HSCI 224) deals with the emergence of modern
science in the 1600s and 1700s, and with subsequent revolutions in scientific thought; as such it comple-
ments courses related to modern European history. History of Science 240 traces the influential role of
science and invention in the shaping of American culture, and complements offerings in American Studies
and American History. HSCI 320, an historical overview of the ideas, practice, and organization of medi-
cine, provides context for related coursework in History, Philosophy, and the Premed Program.
HSCI 101(F) Science, Technology, and Human Values (Same as Science and Technology
Studies 101)
A study of the natures and roles of science and technology in today's society, and of the problems which
technical advances pose for human values. An introduction to science-technology studies. Topics include:
scientific creativity, the Two Cultures, the norms and values of science, the Manhattan Project and Big
Science, the ethics and social responsibility of science, appropriate technology, technology assessment, and
various problems which spring from dependencies engendered by living in a technological society, e.g.,
computers and privacy, automation and dehumanization, biomedical engineering.
Format: seminar. Requirements: two or three short exercises, two papers (3-5 pages and 5-10 pages), and a
final exam.
Enrollment limit: 25.
Satisfies one semester of the Division II requirement.

HSCI 240(F) Technology and Science in American Culture (Same as History 295)
Although technologically dependent, the American colonies slowly built a network of native scientists and
inventors whose skills helped shape the United States' response to the Industrial Revolution. The
interaction of science, technology, and society in the nineteenth century did much to form American
identity: the machine in the garden, through the "American System of Manufactures" helped America rise
to technological prominence; the professionalization and specialization of science and engineering led to
their becoming vital national resources. Understanding these developments, as well as the heroic age of
American invention (1865-1914), forms the focus of this course: how science and technology have helped

HSCI 320(F) History of Medicine (Same as History 293)
A study of the growth and development of medical thought and practice, together with consideration of its
interaction with science and social forces and institutions. The course aims at an appreciation of the
socio-historical construction of Western medicine, from prehistory to the twentieth century. The course
begins with paleomedical reconstructions, and moves to Babylonian, Egyptian and Greek [not only
Hippocratic] medicine, Greek and Roman anatomy and physiology, Arabic medical thought, Renaissance
medicine, and the gradual professionalization and specialization of medicine from the sixteenth century.
Attention is paid to theories of health and disease, ideas about anatomy and physiology, in addition to
achievements such as anesthesia and internal surgery, and advances in instruments such as obstetrical
forceps and the stethoscope.
Format: seminar. Requirements: six short papers (3 pages), midterm and final.

Professor: CHAVOYA*.
This program is designed to facilitate and promote innovations in curricular offerings in relation both to
interdisciplinary conceptual focus and experimental pedagogical form. It provides support for faculty and
student efforts to develop a curriculum that creatively responds to intellectual needs and modes of teaching/
learning that currently fall outside the conventional pattern.

INTR 107(F) Interpreting Human Experience (W)
How we make sense of the world, and of our lives, depends to a considerable degree on the intellectual
methodologies we apply to the task of interpretation. Freud, for instance, saw selfhood and perception as
fundamentally determined by the structures of the psyche itself; Marx, by contrast, argued that our sense of
reality is conditioned primarily by our material and social circumstances; more recently, historian of sci-
ence Thomas Kuhn has emphasized that the underlying assumptions which shape the very questions we
pose as thinkers significantly influence and limit what data, and thus what reality, we are most likely to
Interdepartmental Program
­ 203 ­
observe. This course aims to provide a foundational experience for the liberal arts education, by engaging
with key religious, political, literary, anthropological, philosophical and psychoanalytic texts with a view to
complicating our sense of the purposes and possibilities of intellectual life and confronting the challenges
of epistemology. Readings will include works by Plato, Rousseau, John Stuart Mill, Marx, E.M.Forster,
Freud, Naguib Mahfouz, Brecht, Dangarembga, and extracts from the Bible and the Qu'ran. The course is
intended to foster productive connections between what we discuss and debate in class and your broader
experiences as students. The course will invite and promote interdisciplinary connections between core
ways of seeing and interpreting the world, with a strong emphasis on improving your critical skills.
Format: seminar. Requirements: regular short writing assignments designed to hone your reading skills;
four papers ranging from 3-5 pages; participation in one or two tutorial sessions; and active contribution to
discussion.

INTR 165(F) Words and Music in the 60s and 70s (Same as English 243 and Music 112)
What are the sources of meaning and emotional power in song? To what extent do musical settings of text
support meanings already inherent in the words? To what extent do the musical elements of song fix the
meaning of otherwise ambiguous lyrics? Finally, what is lost and what is gained when poetry is trans-
formed into song? In this course, we will investigate the intricate alliance between words and music in
American and British popular song of the 1960s and 70s. Our focus will be on the songs of Bob Dylan,
John Lennon/Paul McCartney, and Joni Mitchell. Albums receiving particular attention will include Dy-
lan's Highway 61 Revisited and Blood on the Tracks, the Beatles' Revolver and Sgt. Pepper, and Mitchell's
Hejira and Court and Spark. In addition to training our analytic and interpretive skills on these paramount
songwriters, we will also consider songs by those figures who influenced them and by those they, in turn,
influenced. Our primary focus will be on the songs themselves--on how they were put together and on
how we hear them--yet we will also consider the impact of social and artistic context on their creation. By
studying these particular songs, we will develop and refine our abilities to read and hear all forms of words
and music.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based on a midterm exam, occasional in-class quizzes, a 5- to 6-page

This field-lecture course examines the rich diversity of upland and wetland communities within a 20-mile
radius of the Williams College campus. Lectures focus on the biological, geological, climatological, and
historical underpinnings needed to observe, interpret, and analyze the biological communities in the re-
gion. The Field/lab sections will engage students in reading the landscape, field identification of indicator
species, natural history, and using historical documents and materials ranging from photographic images,
tax data, newspaper articles, and other resources. Students will undertake a series of field projects such as
using historical materials to interpret changes in the landscape and creating interpretive guides for specific
sites. Format: lecture/laboratory, six hours per week. Evaluation will be based on field quizzes, project re-
ports, hour exams, and a final exam.

INTR 259(F) Society, Culture and Disease
Disease is one of the basic forces behind the growth, shape and vitality of human societies. Recognizing
that understanding the effects of disease upon culture and society requires an approach that transcends
traditional academic disciplines, this course will examine the nature and importance of disease from sever-
al perspectives. Focusing on the intersection of biology, economics and cultural study, we will confront
Interdepartmental Program
­ 204 ­
some of the most difficult and important issues of our time. How do we decide which diseases deserve the
resources required for vaccine development? Who gets the vaccine? In other words, who lives, and who
dies? How do we decide the value of a human life? How do we understand and heal the wounds, individual
and cultural, deriving from our confrontation with disease--with the AIDS epidemic, for instance? In what
ways has disease, as an agent of change, been a beneficial force in our history? How do we define
"health"? What, exactly, is disease? In exploring these issues, we will use a number of different formats,
including lecture, discussion, tutorial sessions, and guest lecturers. Texts studied will range from the scien-
tific to the literary, and might include formal academic papers, poetry, plays, films, historical works and
cultural studies.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, several short papers, and a final
essay.

INTR 292(S) What is Life? (Same as Religion 292)
The 21st century will be the biological century. Developments in biology, biochemistry, and bioinformatics
will be as transformative as computers and information technologies were in the 20th century. These
changes will recast the question of life and will pose difficult social, political, and ethical challenges. For
centuries philosophers and scientists have attempted to define life. How does life begin and where does it
end? What is the difference between the living and the non-living? What makes human life distinctive?
Recent advances in science and technology have complicated these questions but at the same time have
opened new possibilities of communication between philosophy and science. In this course, we will draw
on a variety of disciplinary approaches to integrate scientific and philosophical approaches to the question
of life. Topics to be considered include: origin of life, evolution, co-evolution and symbiosis, cells and
organisms, organization and complex adaptive systems, replication and reproduction, disease and self-
preservation, information and bioinformatics, viruses and parasites, molecular, cellular and organism clon-
ing, stem cells, abortion, tissue engineering, gene therapy, artificial life, implants and prostheses. In addi-
tion to the philosophical and scientific aspects of these issues, we will examine their social, ethical and
political implications. Readings drawn from texts and articles written by scientists and philosophers.
Format: discussion/lecture. Evaluation will be based on midterm exam and final paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 25 (expected: 25). Open to all.

INTR 307(S) Art and Justice (Same as ArtS 311 and Political Science 337) (W)
Although Plato dismissed painters as unreliable imitators who invariably lead viewers "far from the truth,"
art has played an important role in the creation and transformation of political belief throughout history.
This class is an interdisciplinary examination of that role, focusing especially, though not exclusively, on
the problem of how the visual arts advance and hinder the pursuit of justice. Our visual materials span
diverse periods, areas, media, and cultural traditions, but the primary emphasis is on recent American art,
particularly public art and self-consciously political works that seek to contest prevailing institutions,
norms, and social structures. By examining key aspects of contemporary art practice, we will pursue fun-
damental questions about art, politics, and the relationship between them. For example: How does one
"read" an image and determine how it "works?" How does the specific kind of activity or creation called
"art" reflect and/or shape political life, especially in a time of increasingly digital mass-media? What do
images offer those seeking, exercising, or contesting political power? Are such uses inherently more ma-
nipulative than verbal arguments over policies and principles? Does art have important ways of showing us
things we might not otherwise see? Can it make our political imaginations more generous? Can it bring us
closer to justice? What would claiming this entail? Likely authors and artists include Arendt, Bal, Benja-
min, Danto, Gran Fury, the Guerrilla Girls, Hall, Kant, Kruger, Lacy, Plato, Rockwell, Salgado, Sontag,
Walker, Wodiczko, and others.
Format: seminar. Requirements: regular short written critical analyses, several hands-on visual projects,
and one major, final independent project. For students counting the course towards the Art Studio major,
the project must be a studio project; for those taking the course toward the Art History major, the final
project must be a research paper on a body of contemporary art.

Chair, Professor GEORGE T. CRANE
Advisory Committee: Professors: CRANE, KUBLER, K. LEE, MAHON, MONTIEL. Associate Pro-
fessors: CASSIDAY, M. LYNCH**, MUTONGI, A. V. SWAMY. Assistant Professor: PIEPR-
ZAK.
In this era of cultural, technological and economic globalization and also of pressing international crises
including environmental degradation, poverty and underdevelopment, terrorism and pandemics, knowl-
edge of the world beyond the United States is an essential part of the liberal education that is the goal of the
Williams experience. Both within and outside the classroom the College provides a rich array of opportu-
nities to pursue that goal. The International Studies Program is designed to increase awareness of those
opportunities and to provide a centralizing mechanism to encourage gaining such knowledge with per-
spectives that are cross disciplinary and comparative.
The program administers a number of tracks that provide students with the opportunity to pursue study
of one area of the world or theme as a way of complementing the work they have done in their majors.
Students will be expected to take courses in at least two departments to fulfill the requirements of a track. In
addition to completing International Studies 101, they will be expected to do five courses in a track includ-
ing an approved senior exercise. Students may not count a course toward more than one track in the pro-
gram. They may pursue two tracks but will need to meet the course requirements for each track with a full
complement of courses.
TRACKS
Tracks are of two kinds. The first type focuses either on a particular region of the world or a contact zone
where several cultural traditions encounter each other. The second type is organized thematically and will
explore a cultural, political, economic or technological issue globally. Each track will be administered by
faculty teaching in that track in consultation with the steering committee. Each track may set an additional
requirement of a level of language competency for its concentrators. Each track may also require one of the
elective courses to be comparative, i.e. course that might not cover material directly dealing with their area,
but would enrich the student's experience with tools for comparative inquiry. At present the program con-
sists of the following tracks:
International Studies
­ 206 ­
Area Tracks Thematic Tracks
African Studies Borders, Exile and Diaspora Studies
East Asian Studies Economic Development Studies
Latin American Studies
Middle Eastern Studies
Russian and Eurasian Studies
South and Southeast Asia Studies
To complete a track, students must take a section of International Studies 101, complete five additional
approved courses within the track, attend the weekly International Studies colloquium and complete a se-
nior exercise. Credit for work done on study abroad will likely provide one or more of the electives for
many concentrators.
International Studies 101
All students wishing to pursue the program should take a section of International Studies 101 early in
their careers. These courses will usually be team taught. The topics and regions covered will vary and be
selective, but all will be designed to place cultural, political, economic and technological issues in con-
versation with one another to illustrate the necessity of having a broad range of disciplinary tools available
to pursue an individual track.
Study Abroad and Internships
Study abroad and/or overseas internships are an essential component of International Studies. The pro-
gram in coordination with the Study Abroad Advisor and the Office of Career Counseling will advise stu-
dents on opportunities in these areas. One or more courses completed on an approved study abroad pro-
gram can be counted toward the five elective courses requirement.
Colloquium
Concentrators will be expected to attend fifteen sessions of the International Studies colloquia in their
senior year, and are urged to do so throughout their careers at Williams. We hope that it will become a
regular event for all concentrators. The colloquium meets weekly at the Center for Development Econom-
ics and is designed to feature faculty, students, CDE fellows and outside speakers addressing issues of wide
interest to those in International Studies.
Senior Exercise
All concentrators must also complete a senior exercise. This will be a substantial piece of writing (20-25
pages) that would allow a student to draw together both their disciplinary skills and expertise in a particular
area. It might be work done either in the context of a senior capstone course in a relevant department or in
the context of a shared seminar sponsored by the International Studies program. In both cases it would
culminate in a public presentation by each concentrator of his/her work in class or in the context of the
International Studies Colloquium.
Honors
A candidate for honors in International Studies must maintain at least a B+ average in the concentration
and be admitted to candidacy by the program faculty. An honors candidate must complete her/his project
in a semester (and Winter Study). An honors candidate will prepare a forty page thesis or its equivalent
while enrolled in the senior thesis course, 491 or 492 (and Winter Study). This course will be in addition to
the courses required to fulfill the concentration.
A student wishing to become a candidate for honors in International Studies should secure a faculty
sponsor and inform the program chair in writing before spring registration of her/his junior year.
INST 101(F) Asia and the World (Same as Asian Studies 201 and Political Science 100)*
Asia looms large in contemporary world politics: Japan is gradually assuming an expanded regional na-
tional security role; The People's Republic of China is emerging as a multifaceted Great Power; India is
challenged by rising ethno-nationalism. This course will explore both the historical background and cur-
rent dynamics of political and economic issues in these three countries, drawing on themes of imperialism,
nationalism, and globalization. It is an introductory class and, therefore, no prior coursework in political
science or Asian studies is necessary.

THE PROGRAM IN JEWISH STUDIES
Jewish Studies describes the academic field concerned with the experience and culture of the Jewish
people. Covering a wide temporal and geographical range, Jewish Studies embraces both the waters of
Babylon and the tenements of the Lower East Side. The subject cuts across numerous fields including
Ancient Near Eastern Studies, Religion, Classics, History, Anthropology, Sociology, Art History, English,
Middle Eastern Studies, Hebrew, Women's and Gender Studies, American Studies, Comparative Litera-
ture, Romance Languages and Literature, German and Russian Studies, and Political Science. Jewish
Studies as a subject and object of scholarly inquiry is more than 100 years old, emerging, as did the study of
religion in general, in the context of nineteenth century efforts to make religious texts open to scientific and
especially historical forms of investigation.
Williams offers a variety of courses specifically directed to students interested in Jewish Studies. In
addition, many other courses incorporate topics relevant to the study of Judaism. Students are encouraged
to integrate courses from diverse disciplines with a focus in Jewish history, religion, literature, language,
and thought. Thus, rather than emphasizing a particular method of inquiry, Jewish Studies courses bring
together students from different departments who share an interest in a common topic. As a result, Jewish
Jewish Studies
­ 210 ­
subjects are analyzed from a multitude of perspectives (religious, philosophical, political, historical, psy-
chological, literary, etc.). Williams offers two types of courses related to Jewish Studies: Courses directly
focusing on Jewish topics and courses partially devoted to some aspect of Judaism. Most courses in Jewish
Studies are open to all students without prerequisites. The specific catalogue entry for each course should
be checked for details. The concentration in Jewish Studies is recommended for students interested in a
sustained intellectual experience in the field.
CONCENTRATION IN JEWISH STUDIES
The concentration in Jewish Studies serves two primary functions. First, it provides a formal structure
enabling students to develop knowledge of the history, thought, texts, and practices of the Jewish people.
Second, students will learn to apply this competency to the analysis of issues related to Jewish Studies
emerging from disciplinary perspectives. Through the Jewish Studies concentration, students will be able
to examine topics according to the methods particular to majors as well as in comparison with other disci-
plinary approaches. Thus, Jewish Studies enhances one's specific knowledge of Judaica and the general
capacity to think interdisciplinarily.
Students wishing to concentrate in Jewish Studies must take 5 courses with at least 2 different prefixes: 1
core course, 2 required courses, 1 elective, and 1 capstone course.
Core Course
Jewish Studies 101/Religion 203 Introduction to Judaism (required of all concentrators)
Required Courses
Students must take two required courses, one from Group I and one from Group II. There will be offer-
ings from the visiting Croghan Professor and other visiting professors. These may fulfill the core require-
ments with approval from the Jewish Studies Advisory Committee. Only one Winter Study course may be
used to satisfy this requirement.
Group I
CRHE 201-202 Hebrew
Religion/Comparative Literature 201 Reading the Hebrew Bible
Jewish Studies 013 In the Beginning: Fundamentals of Hebrew
Group II
[ArtH 363 The Holocaust Visualized]
History 230 Modern European Jewish History, 1789-1948
[History 338 The History of the Holocaust]
Elective
Students may meet the elective requirement with one of the courses partially related to Jewish Studies or
another course from Group I or II. Since the elective requirement enables students to situate issues in Jew-
ish Studies within a broader disciplinary context, the elective must be taken after REL/CLAS 203 and si-
multaneously with or after at least one core course. In a course partially related to Jewish Studies, a student
will normally focus at least one of the major writing assignments on a topic relevant to Jewish Studies or
approximately one-third of the course will be devoted to Jewish subjects. The list of relevant electives
changes constantly so the course catalogue should be checked for details. Listed below are examples of
courses partially related to Jewish Studies. Students may meet the elective requirement with a course not
listed here, subject to the approval of the Chair of Jewish Studies.

Croghan Professorship
Each year, in addition to the regular course offerings listed above, Williams sponsors the Croghan Bi-
centennial Visiting Professor in Religion who offers one course in Judaism and/or Christianity. Past Crog-
han Professors have taught courses on the Mishnah (Shaye Cohen), the historical Jesus (John Dominic
Crossan), and Ancient Mediterranean Religions (Ross Kraemer).
Overseas Studies
Studying in Israel is highly recommended for students interested in Jewish Studies. Many students have
spent a semester or year at Hebrew University. With the approval of the Jewish Studies coordinator, stu-
dents may count a study-abroad program towards one core requirement.
Funding
The Bronfman Fund for Judaic Studies was established in 1980 by Edgar M. Bronfman `50, Samuel
Bronfman II `75, and Matthew Bronfman `80. The Bronfman Fund provides opportunities for the Wil-
liams community to learn about Jewish history and culture, both within the College's formal curriculum
and through the planning of major events on Jewish themes.
The Morris Wiener and Stephen R. Wiener `56 Fund for Jewish Studies was established in 1997
through the estate of Stephen R. Wiener `56. The Wiener gifts have provided an endowment to support a
faculty position in modern Jewish thought, and are used to underwrite an annual lecture, forum or event
relevant to contemporary Jewish life.

JWST 491(F) Jewish Studies Interdisciplinary Seminar
Open to students who have completed (or are completing) the four required courses for the Jewish Studies
concentration, this course enables students to integrate their background in Jewish Studies with the disci-
plinarity normally associated with a departmental major. Team-taught by members of the JWST advisory
committee, the course consists of three parts. 1) Introductory sessions on methodological issues in Jewish
Studies. 2) 4-6 week period of individual meeting with faculty member while working on a 15- to 20-page
research project. 3) Final month devoted to seminar style presentation and discussion of papers. Students
participating in the seminar must sign up for an approved independent study. A student writing a thesis
relevant to Jewish Studies for a departmental major may petition the chair of Jewish Studies to allow the
thesis to meet the capstone requirement in place of JWST 491.
Evaluation will be based on participation in discussions and final paper and presentation.
Prerequisites: fulfillment of requirements of Jewish Studies concentration. No enrollment limit, however,
chair of Jewish Studies must approve participation in the course (expected: 8).

Latina/o Studies is an interdisciplinary and comparative field of study that explores the histories and
experiences of Latinas and Latinos in the United States. Latinas and Latinos include peoples who come
from or whose ancestors come from Latin America and the Spanish-speaking Caribbean. The program
seeks to cover the widest range of experiences, encompassing Mexican-Americans, Puerto Ricans, Cu-
bans, and Dominicans, as well as more recent migrations from a wide variety of Central and South Ameri-
can countries. Courses, most of which use a comparative approach, seek to provide students with the tools
to continue their work in areas of their particular interest. Focusing on a diverse group with a long history in
the United States, which is also one of the fastest growing populations in the contemporary era, provides an
opportunity to explore complex dynamics globally and within the context of the United States. The pro-
gram examines topics such as the political and economic causes of migration, the impact of globalization,
economic incorporation, racialization, the formation and reformulations of identities and communities, the
uses of urban spaces, inter-ethnic relations, artistic expression, aesthetics, and visual and popular culture.
THE CONCENTRATION
The concentration in Latina/o Studies requires five courses. Students are required to take the introducto-
ry course (LATS 105), one 400-level Latina/o Studies seminar, and three electives. Two electives must be
Latina/o Studies

core electives, and one elective can be a related course in Comparative Ethnic Studies or in Countries of
Origin and Transnationalism. The three electives must include two different disciplines, and at least one
elective must be at the 300 or 400 level. Additional courses may be approved by the Chair. Students, espe-
cially those considering graduate work or professional careers in the field, are encouraged to enroll in
Spanish language courses at Williams.

LATS 105(F) Latina/o Identities: Constructions, Contestations, and Expressions (Same as
INTR 105)*
What, or who, is a Hispanic or Latina/o? This course examines this question by exploring the diversity of
the populations referred to by these terms, as well as the complex nature of "identity." Viewing identities as
historically and socially constructed, we begin with a brief assessment of how racial, ethnic, class, and
gendered identities take shape in the Hispanic Caribbean and Latin America. We then examine the impact
of migration and the rearticulation of identities in the United States. Identity is also a contested terrain. As
immigrants and migrants arrive, United States' policymakers, the media, and others seek to define the
"newcomers" along with long-term Latina/o citizens. At the same time, Latinas/os rearticulate, live, assert,
and express their own sense of identities. We conclude the course with an exploration of those many and
diverse expressions.
Format: discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, several short writing assignments (1-2
pages), and three short papers (5-7 pages).
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit : 25. Preference given to senior Latina/o Studies concentrators and then
first-year students and sophomores.

LATS 207(F) Spanish for Heritage Speakers: Introduction to the Cultural Production of
U.S. Latinas/os (Same as Spanish 107)*
The emphasis in this course is on learning critical communication and analytical skills in Spanish for use
both in and outside of the United States. We address all four of the primary language skills (listening, read-
ing, writing, and speaking), with particular attention to the unique needs of students who have received a
majority of their exposure to the Spanish language in informal/domestic environments. Through the use of
meaningful materials and vocabulary taken from a variety of Spanish-language contexts--but with prima-
ry emphasis on the numerous U.S. Latino communities--this course aims to sharpen Heritage Speakers'
sociolinguistic competency and ability to interpret Spanish-language musical, cinematic, and literary texts
in the target language. Ultimately, students will be prepared for a variety of "real-world," cross-cultural
contexts and more knowledgeable regarding the cultural production of U.S. Latinas/os.
Format: discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, several short writing assignments (1-3
pages each), two oral exams, oral presentation.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 10). Open to all heritage speakers of Spanish.
Hour: 2:35-3:50 MR CEPEDA
LATS 220(S) Introduction to Urban Studies: Shaping and Living the City (Same as
American Studies 221)
This course is an introduction to central topics in the interdisciplinary field of Urban Studies. Specifically,
we will discuss concepts and theories used to examine the peoples and structures that make up cities: In
what ways do socio-cultural, economic, and political factors affect urban life and development? How are
cities planned and used by various stakeholders (politicians, developers, businesses, and residents)? How
do people make meaning of the places they inhabit? We will pay particular attention to the roles of race,
ethnicity, class, and gender in understanding urban communities. Texts include works by anthropologists,
historians, sociologists, cultural critics, cultural geographers, and literary writers.
Format: discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, several short writing assignments (1-2
pages), and three short papers (5 pages).
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20 (expected: 20). Preference given to American Studies majors and
Latina/o Studies concentrators.

LATS 240(S) The Politics of Language in the Literature and Culture of U.S. Latinas/os
(Same as Comparative Literature 210)*
In this course we will focus on issues of language and identity in the contemporary literary production and
lived experience of various U.S. Latina/o communities. As such, how are cultural values and material con-
ditions expressed through Latina/o language and literature? How does Latina/o identity challenge tradi-
tional notions of the relationship between language, culture, and nation? In what ways might Latina/o liter-
ary and linguistic practices serve as tools for social change? Departing from a socio- and anthropological
linguistic overview of common practices such as code-switching (popularly known as "Spanglish"), we
will examine bilingual education, recent linguistic legislation, and the English Only movement. Through-
out the course we will survey texts culled from a variety of literary and performance genres, ranging from
the poetry of the Chicano and Puerto Rican Movements of the 1960s and 70s to more recent theatrical
pieces, novels, poetry, and short stories by writers such as Dolores Prida, Martín Espada, Junot Díaz, San-
dra Cisneros, H.G. Carrillo, and Achy Obejas, among others. Both directly and/or indirectly, these texts
address U.S. Latina/o language politics, as well as the broader themes of identity, power, community, race/
ethnicity, gender, class, hybridity, and cultural citizenship.
Format: discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, several short writing assignments (1-5
pages each), an oral presentation, and a final exam.
No prerequisites, though LATS 105 and/or intermediate-level reading competency in Spanish helpful. En-
rollment limit: 20 (expected: 15). Preference given to Latina/o Studies concentrators.

LATS 332(F) Latinos and Education: The Politics of Schooling, Language, and Latino
Studies (Same as American Studies 332) (W)*
Schools have often become the focal point for debates over the relationship between cultural identity, intel-
lectual abilities, and the production of knowledge. What should be taught, who should be taught, and how
they should be taught frame the politics of schooling. Language has often taken center stage in these de-
bates. This course examines the effects of educational policies and practices on the development of Latina/
o students and communities. We will also consider how these students and communities have resourceful-
ly carved out spaces and made demands to meet their educational needs. Topics include school desegrega-
tion, bilingual education, student walk-outs and sit-ins, as well as the origins and advancement of Chicano
Studies, Puerto Rican Studies, and more recently Latino Studies programs on college campuses. Through a
series of three essays, students will critically engage the major themes of the course as they also engage
each other in the form of peer-reviews and other in-class writing workshops.
Format: discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, class presentations, and three essays
(8-10 pages each).

LATS 338(S) Theorizing Popular Culture: U.S. Latinas/os and the Dynamics of the
Everyday (Same as Comparative Literature 338)*
Via critical analysis of select musical, cinematic, literary, and popular media texts, we will investigate the
primary approaches to the study of popular expression and identity, with particular emphasis on U.S. Lati-
na/o popular cultural production. This course will focus on the following questions: How is Latina/o identi-
ty expressed through the "popular" or the everyday? In which ways does the study of Latina/o popular
culture illuminate our understanding of the Latina/o community's history and culture? What methodolo-
gies or theoretical approaches are best suited to the analysis of the "here and now"? Employing a broad
range of current Cultural Studies theories, students will conduct a semester-long research project and com-
plete various ethnographic exercises in this analysis of the historical, socio-political, and artistic uses of
popular culture among U.S. Latinas/os.
Format: discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, several short writing assignments (1-3
pages each), oral presentation, final paper (15-20 pages).

LATS 405(S) Home and Belonging: Comparative Explorations of Displacements, Relocations,
and Place-making (Same as American Studies 405) (W)*
The metaphor of "home" and idea of "belonging" bring insight to theories and investigations centered on
community building and identity formation within and across national borders. These constructions give
us an indication of what people value, what is worth fighting for, as well as what is considered expendable.
Our objective in this course is to interrogate constructions of home and belonging by studying how individ-
uals, communities, and nations are transformed by experiences of dislocation, migration, and renewed
place-making. What are the ways a sense of belonging shapes these identities and the investments made in
these formations? Working with ethnography, history, memoir, literature, critical essays, and documentary
film, we will consider the personal and political uses and meanings of memory, nostalgia, and imagination
in "rooting" migrating subjects in place and time. Among the many case studies we will examine are the
politics of homeland among Cuban-Americans, Native American and West Indian festive forms, and
place-claiming and performativity among African Americans.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class participation, class presentations, research proposal,
and a final research paper.
Prerequisites: Prior work in American Studies, Latino Studies, or permission of instructor. Enrollment lim-
it: 19 (expected: 19). Preference given to senior American Studies majors and to senior Latina/o Studies

Leadership Studies focuses on the universal phenomenon of leadership in human groups. Leadership
Studies asks what leadership means within a wide variety of social contexts-whether in a family, a team, a
theatre company, a philanthropy, a university, a multinational corporation, or a nation state waging war. It
seeks to understand the dynamics of the relationships between leaders and followers. It studies authority,
power, and influence. It seeks to grasp the bases of legitimacy that leaders claim, and followers grant, in all
of these relationships.
Through a wide range of courses in the social sciences and the humanities, a number of questions are
addressed through the curriculum. How have men and women defined leadership and what are the bases
of leaders' legitimacy in different historical contexts? How do leaders in different contexts emerge?
Through tradition, charisma, or legal sanction? How do different types of leaders exercise and maintain
their domination? What are the distinctive habits of mind of leaders in different historical contexts? What
are the moral dilemmas that leaders in different contexts face? What are the typical challenges to estab-
lished leadership in different historical contexts? How does one analyze the experiences of leaders in wide-
ly disparate contexts to generate systematic comparative understandings of why history judges some lead-
ers great and others failures. How and why do these evaluations about the efficacy of leaders shift over
time?
To meet the requirements of the concentration, students must complete the sequence outlined below (6
courses total). Students must take their two core courses from different departments. At least one of the
core courses must be at the 300 or 400 level.

LEAD 125(S) Power, Leadership and Legitimacy: An Introduction to Leadership Studies
(Same as Political Science 125)
Leadership has long been a central concept in the study of politics. Philosophers from Plato to Machiavelli
have struggled with the question of what qualities and methods are necessary for effective leadership. So-
Leadership Studies
­ 216 ­
cial scientists throughout the twentieth century have struggled to refine and advance hypotheses about
leadership in the areas of economics, psychology, and sociology. Nevertheless, despite all of this impres-
sive intellectual effort, the study of leadership remains a contested field of study precisely because univer-
sal answers to the major questions in leadership studies have proven to be elusive. This course is designed
to introduce students to many of the central issues and debates in the area of leadership studies.

LEAD 265(F) "Great" Leadership: Lincoln, Gandhi, King, Mandela
What is great leadership? To what extent is it mythical or illusory? How does it depend on great follower-
ship? What difference has it made in history? How can great leadership be exercised by flawed leaders?
This course will explore these issues in relation to the lives and leadership of Abraham Lincoln, Mahatma
Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr., and Nelson Mandela, using a comparative approach that will examine
each leader within the context of his place, time, and culture. Readings will include both primary and sec-
ondary sources.

The American Revolution produced a galaxy of brilliant politicians and statesmen of extraordinary
courage, intellect, creativity, and character. They succeeded in drafting an unparalleled Constitution and
establishing enduring democratic political institutions while nevertheless failing to grapple with the
wrenching issue of slavery and the rights of women. In this course, we will explore the lives, ideas, and
political leadership of these men, most of whom belonged to the social elite of their day:Washington,
Madison, Jefferson, Adams, Franklin, and Hamilton. We will study in depth their superb writings, such as
the
correspondence between Madison and Jefferson and between John Adams and his wife Abigail, and
Madison's and Hamilton's Federalist essays. We will also read recent interpretations of the founding
generation by Gordon Wood, Joseph Ellis, Edmund Morgan, Bernard Bailyn, and others.

LEAD 295(F) Leadership and Management
What are the differences between effective leaders and effective managers of complex organizations, or are
they one and the same? If different, what are the key elements making each successful, and are there any
Leadership Studies, Legal Studies
­ 217 ­
critical dynamics or interdependencies between these elements? Finally, are there important distinctions
between the factors required for success by leaders/managers in different domains, in different cultures, or
of different genders? In this course, we will wrestle with these questions by examining both successful and
unsuccessful leadership and management of complex organizations in a number of domains, potentially
including business, non-profit, higher education, government agencies, and others. Our primary means of
doing so will be through case studies, supplemented by reading Ronald Heifetz, Peter Drucker, Warren
Bennis, and several noted leadership and management thinkers.
Format: seminar. Course requirements will include active class participation, several brief (1 page or less)
response papers, a short mid-term paper, and a longer final paper, which develops and analyzes a case of
the student's choice. This latter paper can be done individually or in groups of two. No prerequisites . En-

LEGAL STUDIES (Div. II)
Chair, Professor LAWRENCE KAPLAN
Advisory Committee: Professors: JACKALL*, JUST, KAPLAN, KASSIN. Associate Professors:
NOLAN*, SHANKS. Assistant Professor: MARUKO. Visiting Assistant Professor: A.
HIRSCH§§§.
Legal Studies is an interdisciplinary program designed to give students a background and frameworks
for understanding the law as a means of regulating human behavior and resolving disputes among individ-
uals, groups, and governments. Emanating from a liberal arts tradition, and not specifically aimed at pre-
paring students for law school, this program provides the tools needed to think and argue critically about
how laws work, how they evolved in the course of history and in different parts of the world, how they are
enforced, and how they affect our everyday lives.
The courses in this program address a wide range of subjects, including the philosophical, moral, histor-
ical, social, and political underpinnings of law; the U.S. Constitution; law enforcement and other aspects of
criminal justice; methods of scientific proof; psychological influences on evidence, trials, and decision-
making; cultural perspectives and non-western legal traditions; and the use of law to regulate environmen-
tal policy. Courses are taught by faculty in the Sciences, Social Sciences, and Humanities, whose work
centers on legal processes, and by visiting professors from various law schools.
THE CONCENTRATION
The concentration in legal studies consists of six courses, including an interdisciplinary introductory
course, four electives taken from at least two departments, and a senior seminar on a contemporary topic in
the law. Electives may vary from year to year according to course offerings. In addition, the program offers
local, alumni, and professional contacts for summer and WSP internships in a wide range of government
and private law-related settings.
REQUIRED COURSES
LGST 101(S) Processes of Adjudication
How are disputes resolved within social systems? Focusing on this question, this team-taught interdisci-
plinary course presents different perspectives on trials and other methods of adjudicating crimes, settling
matters of public policy, and resolving civil disputes among individuals, groups, governments, and organi-
zations. Topics to be addressed include: the historical and Constitutional basis for the operation of the
American court system and for juries and jury trials; methods of gathering and evaluating evidence; the
role of forensic science and technology; alternative means of adjudication as seen in the function of admin-
istrative agencies; adjudication of disputes across international boundaries; adversarial, inquisitorial, and
consensus-building approaches to dispute resolution used in past and non-western cultures.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on two exams, a 10- to 15-page paper, and class par-
ticipation.
Enrollment limit: 50.
This is an interdisciplinary course to be team-taught by faculty, from a variety of departments.

LGST 401(S) Senior Seminar: The Legal Palette
The great jurist Oliver Wendell Holmes claimed that people trained in law rarely appreciate art: works of
genius would elude lawyers and judges, Holmes said, because "their very novelty would make them repul-
sive." As this implies, in crucial respects law and art are opposites. The legal system aims at stability and
reinforcement of social norms whereas some art seeks to destabilize and challenge prevailing norms. The
legal system aspires to objectivity, whereas art is largely value-laden. What happens when these worlds
collide? This course explores a wide range of American trials involving art, such as: the fraud trial of Wil-
liam Mumler, America eading "spirit photographer"; the trial of Stephen Radich for displaying sculp-
tures defacing the flag; the suit against collector Joseph Duveen for calling an alleged Da Vinci painting a
forgery; the case of a Constantin Brancusi sculpture refused duty-free entry into the U.S. on the ground that
it wasn't art; the trial of Jeff Koons for copyright infringement; the defamation suit by David Wojnarowicz
against a group that misrepresented his work; the litigation to appraise Andy Warhol's paintings; and the
obscenity trial of Robert Mapplethorpe for homoerotic photographs. These cases implicate the complex
relationship between aesthetics and epistemology and raise profound questions about both law and art. Are
judges and juries equipped to determine the purpose or value of art? Do artists need the protection of soci-
ety or does society need protection from artists? The most crucial question, from the standpoint of this
course, concerns the capacity of our legal system to strike an appropriate balance between preserving the
social fabric and accommodating change. Does the inherent conservatism of the law inevitably impede the
kind of free expression necessary for a thriving democracy?
Format: seminar. Requirements: active class participation, several short papers, and a substantially longer
final paper.
Prerequisite: Legal Studies 101 and at least two Legal Studies electives, or permission of the instructor.
Enrollment limit: 25 (expected: 20-25). Preference will be given, in order of seniority, to students for whom
this course completes the Legal Studies concentration.

LINGUISTICS (Div. I)
Coordinator, Assistant Professor: NATHAN SANDERS
Courses in linguistics enable students to explore language from a variety of perspectives: the internal
workings of language as a system of communication, the physical means by which speech is produced, the
role of language in society, the history of language groups and specific languages, and the applicability of
scientific knowledge about language to various human endeavors.
Linguistics offers neither a major nor a concentration, but its courses provide a solid grounding in formal
linguistics and complement study in several other disciplines: Anthropology, Philosophy, Computer Sci-
ence, Psychology, Cognitive Science, Sociology, English, Comparative Literature, and all the foreign lan-
guages. Anthropology majors can receive major credit for Linguistics 101. Majors in German Studies may
receive major credit for a linguistics course with the special permission of the department chair.
Knowledge of foreign languages is helpful but not required for introductory linguistics courses.
LING 101(F) Introduction to Linguistics (Same as Anthropology 107)
This course is a general introduction to the scientific study of language, particularly its theoretical debates,
methodology, and relationship to other disciplines. With this aim in mind, we will examine the analytic
Linguistics, Maritime Studies
­ 219 ­
methods and major findings of various subfields of linguistics, including phonetics, phonology, morpholo-
gy, syntax, semantics, and language change. Additional topics may include dialects, American Sign Lan-
guage, the acquisition of language, and the official English language movement. By the end of the course,
you should be acquainted with systematic methods of studying language, be aware of the fundamental
similarities and startling diversity of human languages, and have an informed perspective on how issues of
language have an impact on our society.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: participation in discussions, weekly homework, a midterm
exam, and a final exam.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 40 (expected: 40).
Hour: 1:10-2:25 MR SANDERS
LING 111(S) Articulatory and Acoustic Phonetics (Q)
Phonetics is the study of human speech sounds. This course emphasizes the International Phonetic Alpha-
bet, a standardized system of transcribing speech. Students learn to recognize, describe, transcribe, and
produce speech sounds from languages all over the world. This course also covers phonetic analysis of
speech, including patterns of sounds within and across languages, the acoustic properties of the speech
signal, and how and why the mouth moves the way it does when we speak.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: participation in discussions, weekly homework, occasional
quizzes, a midterm exam, and a final project.
No prerequisites. No enrollment limit (expected: 40).
Hour: 1:10-2:25 MR SANDERS
LING 121(S) The Syntactic Structure of English (Same as English 122) (W)
This course is an introduction to a rigorous, scientific approach to language study. No previous training in
linguistics is assumed, and no reading is required for the course. A better understanding of the underlying
structure of English and of language in general will proceed by way of class discussion and homework
problems. These discussions and problems will involve students in observation and analysis of linguistic
data through construction, testing, and revision of syntactic theories. The homework will require time and
careful attention and will usually be rather challenging.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: participation in discussions and 30-40 pages of writing in the
form of weekly homework, alternating between essays and short answer problem sets.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 15).
Hour: 1:10-2:25 TF SANDERS
LING 131(F) Introduction to Logic and Semantics (Same as Philosophy 131) (Q)
This course is an introduction to both formal logic and the study of linguistic meaning. Throughout the
course, a formal system of logic will be developed, and its adequacy for describing linguistic meaning will
be tested. Topics to be covered include the meaning of words and sentences, first-order predicate logic,
logical deduction, interpretation and understanding, and pragmatics.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: participation in discussion, weekly homework, a midterm
exam, and a final exam.
No prerequisites. No enrollment limit (expected: 30).

The oceans cover almost three-quarters of the globe, and understanding them is of increasing impor-
tance in this era of climate change, sea-level rise, fisheries crises, and the internationalization of the high
seas. We encourage students to investigate our WaterWorld from a variety of perspectives. Maritime Stud-
ies is an interdisciplinary, cross-divisional program that examines the literature, history, policy issues, and
science of the ocean. Candidates for the concentration in Maritime Studies must complete a minimum of
seven courses: the interdisciplinary introductory course (Geosciences 104 Oceanography), four intermedi-
ate core courses (at Williams-Mystic), an elective, and the senior seminar.
Students who have completed other study-away programs that emphasize marine studies should consult
with the program chair about the possibility of completing the Maritime Studies concentration.

Weekly participation as a senior in the Mathematics Colloquium, in which all senior majors present talks
on mathematical or statistical topics of their choice.
NOTES
In some cases, an appropriate course from another department may be substituted for one of the elec-
tives, with prior permission of the Mathematics and Statistics Department. In any case, at least eight
courses must be taken in mathematics and statistics at Williams. These can, with prior permission, include
courses taken away. Students with transfer credit should contact the department about special arrange-
ments.
APPLIED MATHEMATICS OR OTHER SCIENCES
Students interested in applied mathematics or other sciences should consider Mathematics 209, 210,
251, 305, 306, 315, 323, 342, 354, 361, 433, or Statistics 201, 231, 346, 442, and additional appropriate
courses from outside Mathematics and Statistics, including possibilities such as Chemistry 301, Computer
Science 256, Computer Science 361, Economics 255, Physics 201, Physics 202, Physics 210 or more ad-
vanced physics courses. Students interested in economics should consult the Economics Department.
BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Students interested in careers in business or finance should consider Mathematics 373, as well as
courses in statistics and related areas such as Statistics 101, 201, 231, 331, 344, 346, 442, 443. Since these
courses address different needs, students should consult with the instructors to determine which seem to be
most appropriate for individuals.
ENGINEERING
Students interested in engineering should consider the courses for applied mathematics immediately
above, with Mathematics 209 and 305 especially recommended. Williams has exchange and joint pro-
grams with good engineering schools. Interested students should consult the section on engineering near
the beginning of the Bulletin and the Williams pre-engineering advisor for further information.
GRADUATE SCHOOL IN MATHEMATICS
Students interested in continuing their study of mathematics in graduate school should take Mathemat-
ics 301 and 312. Mathematics 302 and 324 are strongly recommended. Many of the 400-level courses
would be useful, particularly ones that involve algebra and analysis. Honors theses are encouraged. Read-
ing knowledge of a foreign language (French, German, or Russian) is helpful.
STATISTICS AND ACTUARIAL SCIENCE
Students interested in statistics or actuarial science should consider Mathematics 341, Statistics 201,
231, 331, 346, 442 and Economics 255. Additionally, students should consider taking some number of the
actuarial exams given by the Society of Actuaries, which can constitute part of an honors program in actu-
arial studies (see section on honors below).
TEACHING
Students interested in teaching mathematics at the elementary or secondary school level should consider
Mathematics 285, 313, 325, 381, Statistics 201 and practice as a tutor or teaching assistant. Winter study
courses that provide a teaching practicum are also highly recommended.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN MATHEMATICS/STATISTICS
The degree with honors in Mathematics/Statistics is awarded to the student who has demonstrated out-
standing intellectual achievement in a program of study which extends beyond the requirements of the
major. The principal considerations for recommending a student for the degree with honors will be: Mas-
tery of core material and skills, breadth and, particularly, depth of knowledge beyond the core material,
ability to pursue independent study of mathematics or statistics, originalityinmethods of investigation,and,
where appropriate, creativity in research.
An honors program normally consists of two semesters and a WSP (031) of independent research, cul-
minating in a thesis and a presentation. Under certain circumstances, the honors work can consist of coor-
dinated study involving a regular course and one semester plus a WSP (030) of independent study, culmi-
nating in a "minithesis" and a presentation. At least one semester should be in addition to the major require-
ments.
An honors program in actuarial studies requires significant achievement on four appropriate examina-
tions of the Society of Actuaries and giving a second colloquium talk. Written work is a possible compo-
nent.
Highest honors will be reserved for the rare student who has displayed exceptional ability, achievement
or originality. Such a student usually will have written a thesis, or pursued actuarial honors and written a
minithesis. An outstanding student who writes a minithesis, or pursues actuarial honors and writes a paper,
might also be considered.
Mathematics and Statistics
­ 224 ­
Prospective honors students are urged to consult with their departmental advisor at the time of registra-
tion in the spring of the sophomore or at the beginning of the junior year to arrange a program of study that
could lead to the degree with honors. By the time of registration during spring of the junior year, the student
must have requested a faculty member to be honors advisor and must have obtained the department's ap-
proval of formal admission to the honors program. Such approval depends on both the record and the
promise of the applicant. It is conditional on continuing progress.
The recommendation for honors is usually announced at the end of the spring term. Participation in the
honors program does not guarantee a recommendation for honors. The decision is based not only on suc-
cessful completion of the honors program but also on the merit of the student's overall record in mathemat-
ics. If the student completes the program during the fall or winter study, the decision may be announced at
the beginning of the spring term, conditional on continuing merit.
ADVANCED PLACEMENT
The Mathematics and Statistics Department attempts to place each student who elects a mathematics
course in that course best suited to the student's preparation and goals. The suggested placement in an
appropriate calculus course is determined by the results of the Advanced Placement Examination (AB or
BC) if the student took one, and any additional available information. A student who receives a 3, 4, or 5 on
the BC examination is ordinarily placed in Mathematics 106. A student who receives a 4 or 5 on the AB
examination is ordinarily placed in Mathematics 105. A student who receives a 1 or 2 on the BC examina-
tion or a 2 or 3 on the AB examination is ordinarily placed in Mathematics 104. Students who have had
calculus in high school, whether or not they took the Advanced Placement Examination, are barred from
Mathematics 103 unless they obtain permission from the instructor. A student who receives a 4 or 5 on the
Statistics AP examination is ordinarily placed in Statistics 231. Students interested in statistics should con-
sult the department for placement. In any event, students registering for mathematics and statistics courses
are urged to consult with members of the department concerning appropriate courses and placement. In
general, students are encouraged to enroll in the most advanced course for which they are qualified: it is
much easier to drop back than to jump forward. The department reserves the right to refuse registration in
any course for which the student is determined to be over-prepared.
GENERAL REMARKS
Divisional Requirements
All courses may be used to satisfy this requirement.
Alternate Year Courses
Core courses Mathematics 301, 305, 312, and 315 are normally offered every year. Other 300-level
courses may be offered in alternate years. Senior seminars (400-level courses) are normally offered every
two to four years. Students should check with the department before planning far into the future.
Course Admission
Courses are normally open to all students meeting the prerequisites. Students with questions about the
level at which courses are conducted are invited to consult members of the department.
Course Descriptions
Descriptions of the courses in Statistics follow the descriptions of Mathematics courses. More detailed
information on all of the offerings in the department is available in the Informal Guide to Mathematics
Courses at Williams that can be obtained at the departmental office.
Courses Open on a Pass/Fail Basis
Students taking a mathematics or statistics course on a pass/fail basis must meet all therequirementsset
for students taking the course on a graded basis.
With the permission of the department, any course offered by the department may be taken on a pass/fail
basis. Permission will not be given to mathematics majors to meet any of the requirements of the major or
honors degree on this basis. However, with the permission of the department, courses taken in the depart-
ment beyond those requirements may be taken on a pass/fail basis.
Graduate School Requirements
An increasing number of graduate and professional schools require mathematics and statistics as a pre-
requisite to admission or to attaining their degree. Students interested in graduate or professional training in
business, medicine, economics, or psychology are advised to find out the requirements in those fields early
in their college careers.
MATHEMATICS COURSES
NOTE: STATISTICS COURSE LISTINGS FOLLOW THE MATHEMATICS COURSE LIST-
INGS.
MATH 101(F) Mathematical Analysis with Descriptive Statistics
This course is intended to develop quantitative skills for non-science majors. We will cover basic algebra
from an applied point of view, including working with formulas and solving for unknowns. We will inves-
tigate a variety of ways to model real-world problems. For example, how many handshakes away are you
from the president and how is that related to a transportation network? We will look at the mathematics of
Mathematics and Statistics
­ 225 ­
equity, including a look at voting theories. We will cover basic finance, including loans and annuities. Fi-
nally, we will also cover descriptive statistics, including data analysis, computing with mean/median/vari-
ance, data display and contingency tables.
Format: lecture and computer lab. Evaluation will be based primarily on homework, quizzes and/or exams,
and computer projects.
Prerequisites: placement by a Quantitative Studies Counselor. Enrollment limit: (expected: 15).
Hour: 9:00-9:50 MWF O. BEAVER
MATH 102(F) Precalculus
This course prepares students for Mathematics 103, first semester calculus. The course begins with a brief
review of algebra followed by a thorough treatment of algebraic, logarithmic, and trigonometric functions
from a graphical, analytical and applied point of view.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on homework, quizzes, and/or exams.
Prerequisites: placement by a Quantitative Studies Counselor or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit:
(expected: 15).
Hour: 9:00-9:50 MWF S. JOHNSON
MATH 103(F,S) Calculus I (Q)
Calculus permits the computation of velocities and other instantaneous rates of change by a limiting pro-
cess called differentiation. The same process also solves "max-min" problems: how to maximize profit or
minimize pollution. A second limiting process, called integration, permits the computation of areas and
accumulations of income or medicines. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus provides a useful and sur-
prising link between the two processes. Subtopics include trigonometry, exponential growth, and loga-
rithms. This is an introductory course for students who have not seen calculus before. Students who have
previously taken a calculus course may not enroll in Mathematics 103 without the permission of instructor.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on homework, quizzes, and/or exams.
Prerequisites: Mathematics 101 (or demonstrated proficiency on a diagnostic test; see Mathematics 101).
No enrollment limit (expected: 50-60).
Hour: 10:00-10:50 MWF, 12:00-12:50 MWF First Semester: STEVENSON
11:20-12:35 TR Second Semester: O. BEAVER
MATH 104(F,S) Calculus II (Q)
Mastery of calculus requires understanding how integration computes areas and business profit and acquir-
ing a stock of techniques. Further methods solve equations involving derivatives ("differential equations")
for population growth or pollution levels. Exponential and logarithmic functions and trigonometric and
inverse functions play an important role. This course is the right starting point for students who have seen
derivatives, but not necessarily integrals, before. Students who have received the equivalent of advanced
placement of AB 4 or BC 3 may not enroll in Mathematics 104 without the permission of instructor. Stu-
dents who have higher advanced placement must enroll in Mathematics 105 or above.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on homework, quizzes, and/or exams.
Prerequisites: Mathematics 103 or equivalent. No enrollment limit (expected: 50-70).

MATH 105(F,S) Multivariable Calculus (Q)
Applications of calculus in mathematics, science, economics, psychology, the social sciences, involve sev-
eral variables. This course extends calculus to several variables: vectors, partial derivatives, multiple inte-
grals. There is also a unit on infinite series, sometimes with applications to differential equations. This
course is the right starting point for students who have seen differentiation and integration before. Students
with the equivalent of advanced placement of AB 4, BC 3 or above should enroll in Mathematics 105.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on homework, quizzes, and/or exams.
Prerequisites: Mathematics 104 or equivalent, such as satisfactory performance on an Advanced Place-
ment Examination. No enrollment limit (expected: 45).
Hour: 9:00-9:50 MWF, 10:00-10:50 MWF, 11:00-11:50 MWF First Semester: ADAMS

MATH 106(F) Multivariable Calculus (Q)
Applications of calculus in mathematics, science, economics, psychology, the social sciences, involve sev-
eral variables. This course extends calculus to several variables: vectors, partial derivatives and multiple
integrals. The goal of the course is Stokes Theorem, a deep and profound generalization of the Fundamen-
tal Theorem of Calculus. The difference between this course and Mathematics 105 is that Mathematics 105
covers infinite series instead of Stokes Theorem. Students with the equivalent of BC 3 or higher should
enroll in Mathematics 106, as well as students who have taken the equivalent of an integral calculus and
who have already been exposed to infinite series. For further clarification as to whether or not Mathematics
105 or Mathematics 106 is appropriate, please consult a member of the math/stat department. Mathematics
106 satisfies any Mathematics 105 prerequisite. Credit will not be given for both Mathematics 105 and
Mathematics 106.

MATH 180(F) The Art of Mathematical Thinking: An Introduction to the Beauty and Power
of Mathematical Ideas (Q)
What is mathematics? How can it enrich and improve your life? What do mathematicians think about and
how do they go about tackling challenging questions? Most people envision mathematicians as people
who solve equations or perform arithmetic. In fact, mathematics is an artistic endeavor which requires both
imagination and creativity. In this course, we will experience what this is all about by discovering various
beautiful branches of mathematics while learning life lessons that will have a positive impact on our lives.
There are two meta-goals for this course: (1) a better perspective into mathematics, and (2) sharper analyti-
cal reasoning to solve problems (both mathematical and nonmathematical).
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based primarily on projects, homework assignments, and
exams.
Prerequisites: Mathematics 100/101/102 (or demonstrated proficiency on a diagnostic test--see Mathe-
matics 100) or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 50 (expected: 50). Not open to students who have
taken mathematics courses other than Mathematics 100, 101, 102, 103, 170, Statistics 101 without permis-
sion of the instructor.

MATH 209(S) Differential Equations and Vector Calculus (Q)
Historically, much beautiful mathematics has arisen from attempts to explain heat flow, chemical reactions,
biological processes, or magnetic fields. A few ingenious techniques solve a surprisingly large fraction of
the associated ordinary and partial differential equations. The mystical Pythagorean fascination with ratios
and harmonics is vindicated and applied in Fourier series and integrals. Integrating vectorfields over sur-
faces applies equally to blood flow, gravity, and differential geometry.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on problem sets, hour tests, and a final exam.
Prerequisites: Mathematics 105. No enrollment limit (expected: 31). Students may not normally get credit
for both Mathematics 209 and Mathematics/Physics 210.

MATH 211(F,S) Linear Algebra (Q)
Many social, political, economic, biological, and physical phenomena can be described, at least approxi-
mately, by linear relations. In the study of systems of linear equations one may ask: When does a solution
exist? When is it unique? How does one find it? How can one interpret it geometrically? This course devel-
ops the theoretical structure underlying answers to these and other questions and includes the study of ma-
trices, vector spaces, linear independence and bases, linear transformations, determinants and inner prod-
ucts. Course work is balanced between theoretical and computational, with attention to improving mathe-
matical style and sophistication.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on homework and exams.
Prerequisites: Mathematics 105 or 209 or 210 or 251, or Statistics 201. No enrollment limit (expected:

MATH 211T(F) Mathematical Reasoning and Linear Algebra (Q)
This tutorial aims to develop students' problem-solving and proof-writing techniques in mathematics
through the use of linear algebra. It is also an introduction to linear algebra, with an emphasis on its
conceptual development and the beauty of its mathematical structure. There will be weekly assignments
requiring clearly written proofs of theorems and facts in linear algebra, and expecting the level of
independent study of a tutorial. The topics to be covered are matrices, vector spaces, linear independence,
linear transformations, orthonormal bases, inner product spaces, and some applications such as fractals and
linear regression.
Note: This course fulfills the same requirements as Mathematics 211 but credit will not be given for both
Mathematics 211T and Mathematics 211.
Format: tutorial. Evaluation will be based on presentations, problem assignments and exams.
Prerequisites: Mathematics 105 or 251 or equivalent; permission of instructor is required for all students.

mathematical arguments through an exploration of topics from discrete mathematics. Students will learn
various mathematical proof techniques while discovering such areas as logic, number theory, infinity, ge-
ometry, graph theory, and probability. Our goal is not only to gain an understanding and appreciation of
interesting and important areas of mathematics but also to develop and critically analyze original mathe-
matical ideas and argumentation. Note: this course fulfills the same requirements as does Mathematics 251
but credit will not be given for both Mathematics 251T and Mathematics 251.
Format: tutorial. Evaluation will be based primarily on performance on written work, oral presentations,

MATH 285T(F) Teaching Mathematics (Q)
Under faculty supervision, student-teachers will prepare and conduct scheduled weekly extra sessions for
Mathematics 180, for smaller, assigned groups of students. For these sessions they will prepare
presentations, assign and grade homework, and answer questions on the course material and on the
homework. They will be available to their students outside of class, attend and assist at Mathematics 180
lectures (3 hours a week), and visit and evaluate each other's sessions. There is a weekly meeting, for an
hour or two, including organizational matters, deeper study of the mathematics discussed, and practical
teaching skills. There will be assigned readings, discussion, drills, and weekly homework or papers.

MATH 301(F) Real Analysis (Q)
Real analysis is the theory behind calculus. It is based on a precise understanding of the real numbers,
elementary topology, and limits. Topologically, nice sets are either closed (contain their limit points) or
open (complement closed). You also need limits to define continuity, derivatives, integrals, and to under-
stand sequences of functions.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on homework, classwork, and exams.

MATH 305(S) Applied Real Analysis (Q)
Real analysis or the theory of calculus-derivatives, integrals, continuity, convergence-starts with a deeper
understanding of real numbers and limits. Applications in the calculus of variations or "infinite-dimension-
al calculus" include geodesics, harmonic functions, minimal surfaces, Hamilton's action and Lagrange's
equations, optimal economic strategies, nonEuclidean geometry, and general relativity.

MATH 312(S) Abstract Algebra (Q)
Algebra gives us the tools to solve equations. Sets such as the integers or real numbers have special proper-
ties which make algebra work or not work according to the circumstances. In this course, we generalize
algebraic processes and the sets upon which they operate in order to better understand, theoretically, when
equations can and cannot be solved. We define and study the abstract algebraic structures called groups,
rings and fields, as well as the concepts of factor group, quotient ring, homomorphism, isomorphism, and
various types of field extensions.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on problem sets and exams.

MATH 313(F) Introduction to Number Theory (Q)
The study of numbers dates back thousands of years, and is fundamental in mathematics. In this course, we
will investigate both classical and modern questions about numbers. In particular, we will explore the inte-
gers, and examine issues involving primes., divisibility, and congruences. We will also look at the ideas of
number and prime in more general settings, and consider fascinating questions that are simple to under-
stand, but can be quite difficult to answer.
Evaluation will be based primarily on performance on homework, projects, and exams.
Prerequisites: Mathematics 211 or 251, or permission of instructor. Students cannot enroll in both Mathe-
matics 313 and 313T.

MATH 313T(S) Explorations in Number Theory and Geometry (Q)
The main goal of this tutorial is for students to discover some beautiful topics of number theory and their
connections with geometry. Here we will explore how the rational numbers sit within the real number line
and how geometric observations lead to number theoretic insights. We will also introduce elliptic curves
and consider the fundamental algebraic issues surrounding them. Our objective is not only to develop an
understanding and appreciation of interesting areas of number theory but also to create and critically ana-
lyze original mathematical ideas.
Format: Tutorial. Evaluation will be based primarily on performance on written work, oral presentations,

try of molecules. We will study the abstract properties of groups, rings and fields and then study several
applications of this theory. Possible topics include cryptography, puzzles, error correcting codes, computer
software applications, symmetry, tiling, networks, and grobner bases.

MATH 324T(F) Topology (Q)
Topology is the study of when one geometric object can be continuously deformed and twisted into anoth-
er object. Determining when two objects are topologically the same is incredibly difficult and is still the
subject of a tremendous amount of research, including current work on the Poincare Conjecture, one of the
million-dollar millennium-prize problems. The first part of the course on "Point-set Topology" establishes
a framework based on "open sets" for studying continuity and compactness in very general spaces. The
second part on "Homotopy Theory" develops refined methods for determining when objects are the same.
We will prove for example that you cannot twist a basketball into a doughnut.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on homework, classwork, and exams. Prerequisites:

This course will be an investigation into the mathematical theory of tiling. We will focus on tilings of the
plane, including topics such as the symmetry groups of tilings, the topology of tilings, the ergodic theory of
tilings, the classification of tilings and the aperiodic Penrose tilings. We will be able to see how algebra can
be utilized to solve a variety of tiling problems. We will also look at knotted tilings in higher dimensions. In
addition to several books on the subject, we will work from current research papers.

MATH 401(F) Functional Analysis with Applications to Mathematical Physics (Q)
Functional analysis can be viewed as linear algebra on infinite dimensional spaces. It is a beautiful and
classical area of mathematics and it also provides the rigorous mathematical background for some areas of
Mathematics and Statistics
­ 230 ­
theoretical physics (especially quantum mechanics). We will introduce infinite-dimensional spaces (Ba-
nach and Hilbert spaces) and study their properties. These spaces are often spaces of functions (for exam-
ple, the space of square integrable functions). We will consider linear operators on Hilbert spaces and we
will study their spectral properties. A special attention will be dedicated to various operators arising from
mathematical physics--especially the Schrödinger operator.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based on homeworks and exams.

Hour: 9:00-9:50 MWF STOICIU
MATH 402(S) Measure Theory and Probability (Q)
The study of measure theory arose from the study of stochastic (probabilistic) systems. Applications of
measure theory lie in biology, chemistry, physics as well as in economics. In this course, we develop the
abstract concepts of measure theory and ground them in probability spaces. Included will be Lebesgue and
Borel measures, measurable functions (random variables). Lebesgue integration, distributions,
independence, convergence and limit theorems. This material provides good preparation for graduate
studies in mathematics, statistics and economics.
Evaluation will be based primarily on performance on homework assignments and exams.

MATH 411(S) Commutative Algebra (Q)
Commutative algebra has applications ranging from algebraic geometry to coding theory. For example,
one can use commutative algebra to create error correcting codes. It is perhaps most often used, however,
to study curves and surfaces in different spaces. To understand these structures, one must study polynomial
rings over fields. This course will be an introduction to commutative algebra. Possible topics include poly-
nomial rings, localizations, primary decomposition, completions, and modules.

MATH 433(F) Mathematical Modeling and Control Theory (Q)
Mathematical modeling is concerned with translating a natural phenomenon into a mathematical form. In
this abstract form the underlying principles of the phenomenon can be carefully examined and real-world
behavior can be interpreted in terms of mathematical shapes. The models we investigate include feedback
phenomena, phase locked oscillators, multiple population dynamics, reaction-diffusion equations, shock
waves, morphogenesis, and the spread of pollution, forest fires, and diseases. Often the natural
phenomenon has some aspect we can control--such as how much pollution, electric charge, or
chemotherapeutic agent we put into a river, circuit, or cancer patient. We will investigate how to operate
such controls in order to achieve a specific goal or optimize some interpretation of performance. We will

STATISTICS COURSES
STAT 101(F,S) Elementary Statistics and Data Analysis (Q)
It is nearly impossible to live in the world today without being inundated with data. Even the most popular
newspapers feature statistics to catch the eye of the passerby, and sports broadcasters overwhelm the listen-
er with arcane statistics. How do we learn to recognize dishonest or even unintentionally distorted repre-
sentations of quantitative information? How are we to reconcile two medical studies with seemingly con-
tradictory conclusions? How many observations do we need in order to make a decision? It is the purpose
of this course to develop an appreciation for and an understanding of the interpretation of data. We will
become familiar with the standard tools of statistical inference including the t-test, the analysis of variance,
and regression, as well as exploratory data techniques. Applications will come from the real world that we
all live in.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on performances on quizzes and exams.
Prerequisites: Mathematics 100/101/102 (or demonstrated proficiency on a diagnostic test; see Mathemat-
ics 100). Students who have had calculus, and potential Mathematics majors should consider taking Statis-
tics 201 instead. Enrollment limit: 50 (expected: 40). Not open for major credit to junior or senior Mathe-
matics majors.

STAT 201(F,S) Statistics and Data Analysis (Q)
Statistics can be viewed as the art (science?) of turning data into information. Real world decision-making,
whether in business or science is often based on data and the perceived information it contains. Sherlock
Holmes, when prematurely asked the merits of a case by Dr. Watson, snapped back, "Data, data, data! I
can't make bricks without clay." In this course, we will study the basic methods by which statisticians at-
tempt to extract information from data. These will include many of the standard tools of statistical infer-
ence such as the t-test, analysis of variance and linear regression as well as exploratory and graphical data
analysis techniques.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on performance on quizzes and exams.
Prerequisites: Mathematics 105 or equivalent. Students without any calculus background should consider

Mathematics and Statistics, Music
­ 232 ­
Through no fault of its own, regression analysis has perhaps the most used of all data analysis methods. We
will study both the mathematics of regression analysis and its applications, including a discussion of the
limits to such analyses. The applications will range from predicting the quality of a vintage of Bordeaux
wine from the weather to forecasting stock prices, and will come from a broad range of disciplines.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on performance on the project, homework, and exams.

STAT 358T(F) Introduction to Biostatistics (Q)
This course discusses statistical methods and models useful in the biological sciences. It will briefly review
methods of inference for continuous data and then cover topics in discrete data analysis such as logistic
regression and exact inference for proportions. The second part of the course deals with the analysis of
time-to-event or survival data. Topics include discussion and modeling of the hazard and survivor function
through the Kaplan-Meier method and through the proportional hazard model. All methods will be imple-
mented using a statistical software package.
Format: tutorial. Evaluation will be based primarily on performance on written work, oral presentations,
and projects.

STAT 441(F) Bayesian Statistics (Q)
The probability of an event can be defined in two ways: (1) the long-run frequency of the event, or (2) the
belief that the event will occur. Classical statistical inference is built on the first definition given above,
while Bayesian statistical inference is built on the second. This course will introduce the student to methods
in Bayesian statistics. Topics covered include: prior distributions, posterior distributions, conjugacy, and
Bayesian inference in single-parameter, multi-parameter, and hierarchical models. The computational is-
sues associated with each of these topics will also be discussed.

Group A: any Music 106-Music 141 course, including direct supervision by instructor in supplementary
readings, assignments, papers, and other projects appropriate for the Music major.
Group B: Music 203T, 204T, 211, 212, 213, 245T, 301, 305, 306, 308, 325, 326, 407, 408, 427, 428.
Department strongly recommends that students elect at least one course from each group.
It is strongly recommended that prospective majors complete Music 103, 104, 201, 202, and 207 by the
end of the sophomore year.
Performance and Concert Requirements
Music majors are encouraged to participate in departmental ensembles throughout their careers at Wil-
liams; i.e., for eight semesters. Majors are required to participate in departmental ensembles for at least four
semesters. The student must petition to meet this requirement in an alternative way. Music majors are also
expected to attend departmentally-sponsored concerts.
Foreign Languages
Music majors are strongly urged to take courses in at least one foreign language while at Williams.
Musicianship Skills
Music majors are strongly urged to maintain, refine and improve their musicianship skills, such as sight-
singing, score reading, melodic and harmonic dictation, and keyboard proficiency, throughout their entire
Williams career.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN MUSIC
Three routes toward honors and highest honors are possible in the Music major:
a. Composition: A Composition thesis must include one major work completed during the senior year, a
portfolio of smaller works completed during the junior and senior years, and a 10- to 15-page discus-
sion of the student's work.
b. Performance: A Performance thesis must include an honors recital given during the spring of the
senior year and a 15- to 20-page discussion of a selection of the works performed. The student's
general performance career will also be considered in determining honors.
c. History, Theory and Analysis, or Ethnomusicology: A written Historical, Theoretical/Analytical, or
Ethnomusicological thesis between 65 and 80 pages in length and an oral presentation based on the
thesis is required. A written thesis should offer new insights based on original research.
To be admitted to the honors program, a student must have at least a 3.3 GPA in Music courses (this
GPA must be maintained in order to receive honors), and have demonstrated ability and experience
through coursework and performance in the proposed thesis area. A 1- to 2-page application to the honors
program, written in consultation with a faculty member, must be made to the chair of Music before or
during spring registration in the junior year.
Honors candidates must enroll in Music 493(F)-W31-494(S) during their senior year. A student who is
highly qualified for honors work, but who, for compelling reasons, is unable to pursue a year-long project,
may petition the department for permission to pursue a thesis over one semester and the winter study term.
If granted, the standards for evaluating the thesis in such exceptional cases would be identical to those that
apply to year-long honors projects. Final submission of the thesis must be made to the Music Department
by April 15 of the senior year. The department's decision to award honors will be based on the quality of
the thesis.
LESSONS
Courses involving individual vocal or instrumental instruction involve extra fees which are subsidized
by the department. (See Music 251-258 and Studies in the Musical Art 325, 326, 427, 428). For further

100-LEVEL COURSES
MUS 101(S) Listening to Music: An Introduction
Intended for non-major students with little or no formal training.
When you listen to music--on the radio, on a CD, at a concert--how much do you really hear? This
course has two goals: to refine listening skills, thus increasing the student's understanding and enjoyment
of music, while at the same time providing a survey of the major composers and musical styles of the
Western classical repertory to be encountered in concert halls today. Students will be introduced to music
from the Baroque, Classical, Romantic, and Modern periods, including works by composers such as Bach,
Mozart, Beethoven, Brahms, Mahler, and Stravinsky. Genres to be covered include the symphony, cham-
ber music, opera, song, and choral music. Attendance at selected concerts on campus required.
Evaluation will be based on two tests, two concert reports, and a final exam.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 40.
Hour: 10:00-10:50 MWF M. HIRSCH
MUS 102(F) Fundamentals of Music
A course in musical rudiments. Through a variety of exercises and projects, students will develop an un-
derstanding of pitch, scales, triads, rhythm, meter, and notation--materials that form the foundation of
Western art and popular musics. Students by the end of the course will have begun the study of basic four-
part harmony. The course has a musicianship component: students attend an aural skills and sight-singing
lab in addition to lectures.
Format: 2 weekly lectures and a weekly lab meeting. Evaluation will be based on quizzes and a final exam.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15 (expected: 15). Preference based on music reading proficiency.
Hour: 8:30-9:45 TR Lab: 8-8:50 W, 9-9:50 W BODNER
MUS 103(F) Music Theory and Musicianship I
Music 103 and 104 are designed for potential majors and for students with strong instrumental or vocal
backgrounds. Although there is no prerequisite for Music 103, students are expected to have some knowl-
edge of musical rudiments, reading proficiency in at least one clef, and ideally have some comfort reading
both bass and treble clefs. A short diagnostic exam will be administered at the first class meeting of Music
103 to assess students' skills and background, and determine if a student requires any additional remedial
work to complement and fortify course work during the early weeks of the semester. Students with a strong
background in music theory may take a placement exam during First Days to see whether they can pass
out of one or both semesters. Music 103 and 104 are required for the music major.
Music 103 presents the materials, structures and procedures of tonal music, with an emphasis on the har-
monic and contrapuntal practice of the baroque and classical periods (ca. 1650-1825).
Music 103 explores triadic harmony, voice leading, and counterpoint with an emphasis on the chorale style
of J.S. Bach and his predecessors. Keyboard harmony and figured bass exercises, sight singing, dictation,
analysis of repertoire, written exercises and emulation projects will develop both an intellectual and an
aural understanding of music of the period. Projects include the harmonization of chorale melodies, the
arrangement of classical period minuets and the composition of a dice game minuet.
Format: lecture two days a week; a conference meeting one day a week; keyboard/musicianship skills lab
meeting once a week. Evaluation will be based on weekly written work, written and keyboard quizzes, and
midyear and final projects.
Enrollment limit: 15 per section.

MUS 104(S) Music Theory and Musicianship I
Music 104 continues the practical musicianship work of Music 103, while expanding the scope of harmon-
ic topics to include seventh chords and chromatic harmony. Music 104 further explores the transformation
of chorale harmony in contrapuntal works of the eighteenth century. Projects include the composition and
performance of preludes, fugues and organ chorale preludes on baroque models.
Format: lecture two days a week; a conference meeting one day a week; ear training/keyboard skills lab
meeting twice a week. Evaluation will be based on weekly written work, written and keyboard quizzes,
and midyear and final projects.
Prerequisite: Music 103. Enrollment limit: 24.

MUS 106(S) Opera
An introduction to the history of opera, from the genre's birth c. 1600 to the present. At various points in its
400-year development, opera has been considered the highest synthesis of the arts, a vehicle for the social
elite, or a form of popular entertainment. Opera's position in European cultural history will be a primary
focus of our inquiry. We will also study the intriguing relationship between text and music, aspects of
performance and production, and the artistic and social conventions of the operatic world. The
multidimensional nature of opera invites a variety of analytical and critical perspectives, including those of
music analysis, literary studies, feminist interpretations, and political and sociological approaches. Works
to be considered include operas by Monteverdi, Lully, Charpentier, Handel, Gluck, Mozart, Rossini,
Donizetti, Verdi, Wagner, Bizet, Puccini, Strauss, Berg, Britten, and Glass. This course may involve a trip
to the Metropolitan Opera.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on a midterm, a brief paper, a 10-page paper, and a
final exam.

performed by the students. A critique of both the performance and notation of these transcription projects
will be offered by the partnered students for one another, as well as by the instructor, with revisions and
corrections incorporated into an edited performance the following week. In the other weekly meeting, all
of the tutorial pairs will meet jointly with the instructor in order to do group assignments involving sight-
singing (both rhythmic and melodic), and advanced harmonic and melodic dictation. During these sessions
the instructor will offer a critique of the past week's performances as well, based on the following criteria:
1.) notational technique, 2.) observations relating to performance practice, 3.) how such factors contrib-
uted to the evolution of the given soloists' style, and, 4.) historical significance of the given performance
and its relationship to the overall evolution of the given performer's personal voice.

Over the past 100 years, West African highlife, Congolese rumba, and South African jazz and other urban
musics have arisen all over the African continent. More recently, rap has taken root, changing the musical
landscape in Africa's cities. Although these urban musics are entertaining, they have a deeper significance.
They help Africans make sense of their changing world and they help us make sense of ours. We will
examine the multiplicity of meanings urban African music may carry and help students gain deeper in-
sights into the creative process that produces it by learning to perform this music, either as musicians or as
dancers, with Ghanaian master drummer Obo Addy and Kusika. Rehearsal times to be announced.
Format: seminar and rehearsal/performance. Requirements: four 5-page papers and related oral presenta-
tions, participation, the improvement of performance skills, and a take home final exam.
Enrollment: limit 10 (expected 10). Open to all students with an intermediate level of performance skill in
any kind of music or dance. If more apply, audition may be required.

MUS 245T(S) Music Analysis: Music with Text (W)
The course explores the ways in which musical structure interacts with, can comment upon, and can influ-
ence one's reading of a text set to music, and similarly, how texts set to music can exert influence upon and
guide one's understanding of the musical structure. Using scenes from Mozart operas and selected songs of
the 19th and 20th centuries (by Schubert, Schumann, Brahms and Schoenberg), the course will examine
the bearing specific aspects of a text (voice, person, time, alliteration, meter, and so forth) have upon the
musical domain, and conversely, how musical structures have the ability to project or allegorize actions in
the text. We will observe the often amazing ways composers of texted music use the tonal system to create
musical desires--desires that may be fulfilled, withheld, delayed, redirected, and so forth, in ways that
enhance, or enact the desires of characters in a drama or poem. In addition to the specific issues involving
texted and dramatic works, the course will introduce certain techniques and insights of linear analysis--
one of the most profound developments in tonal analysis during the last century. Analysis assignments,
based on the student's close study of texted musical works, will offer the opportunity to apply these techni-
ques. The course will also confront the difficult issue of writing about music and will help students define
and clearly express ideas about music.
Format: tutorial. Students will attend one weekly group lecture and one weekly tutorial meeting. Grades
will be based on five analysis essays/presentations and five critiques of another student's analyses.
Prerequisites: Music 104. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected 10). Preference will be based on advanced prog-
ress in the theory courses.

MUS 402(S) Senior Seminar in Music (W)
This seminar, the culminating course in the music major, examines how composers after Bach have under-
stood and responded to him. We will trace the course of the Classical and early Romantic period "Bach
Revival" through Mozart, Beethoven, and Mendelssohn, and explore how he was venerated in the later
Romantic era by Brahms and Busoni. Most of our focus, however, will be on how composers of the mod-
ern era have viewed his legacy and used his music. We will explore the pertinence of Harold Bloom's
theory of the "anxiety of influence" for understanding the ways in which contemporary classical compos-
ers ranging from Schoenberg and Webern through Peter Maxwell Davies and George Crumb engage
Bach's music, and consider both the musical techniques and meanings of reworkings and quotations of
Bach's music in jazz and popular styles.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on papers, presentations, and class participation.

NEUROSCIENCE (Div. III)
Chair, Professor STEVEN ZOTTOLI
Advisory Committee: Professors: P. SOLOMON, H. WILLIAMS, ZIMMERBERG, ZOTTOLI. As-
sistant Professors: HUTSON, N. SANDSTROM*.
Neuroscience is a rapidly growing interdisciplinary field concerned with understanding the relationship
between brain, mind, and behavior. The interdisciplinary nature of the field is apparent when surveying
those who call themselves neuroscientists. Among these are anatomists, physiologists, chemists, psycholo-
gists, philosophers, computer scientists, linguists, and ethologists. The areas that neuroscience addresses
are equally diverse and range from physiological and molecular studies of single neurons, to investigations
of how systems of neurons produce phenomena such as vision and movement, to the study of the neural
basis of complex cognitive phenomena such as memory, language, and consciousness. Applications of
neuroscience research are rapidly growing and include the development of drugs to treat neurodegenera-
tive disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, the development of noninvasive tech-
niques for imaging the human brain such as PET scans and MRI, and the development of methods for
Neuroscience
­ 242 ­
repair of the damaged human brain such as the use of brain explants. Combining this wide range of disci-
plines, areas of research, and application for the study of a single remarkably complex organ--the brain--
requires a unique interdisciplinary approach. The Neuroscience Program is designed to provide students
with the opportunity to explore this approach.
THE PROGRAM
The program in neuroscience consists of five courses including an introductory course, three electives,
and a senior course. In addition, students are required to take two courses, Biology 101 and Psychology
101, as part of the program.
Neuroscience (Neuroscience 201) is the basic course and provides the background for other neurosci-
ence courses. Ideally, this will be taken before the end of sophomore year. Either Biology 101 or Psycholo-
gy 101 serves as the prerequisite. Electives are designed to provide in-depth coverage including laboratory
experience in specific areas of neuroscience. At least one elective course is required in Biology (Group A)
and one in Psychology (Group B). The third elective course may also come from Group A or Group B, or
may be selected from other neuroscience related courses upon approval of the advisory committee. Topics
in Neuroscience (Neuroscience 401) is designed to provide an integrative culminating experience. Most
students will take this course in the senior year.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN NEUROSCIENCE
The degree with honors in Neuroscience provides students with the opportunity to undertake an original
research project under the supervision of one or more of the Neuroscience faculty. In addition to complet-
ing the requirements of the Neuroscience Program, candidates for an honors degree must enroll in Neuro-
science 493-W31-494 and write a thesis based on an original research project. Presentation of a thesis,
however, should not be interpreted as a guarantee of a degree with honors. Students interested in pursuing a
degree with honors should contact the Neuroscience Advisory Committee in the spring of their junior year.

NSCI 401(F) Topics in Neuroscience
Neuroscientists explore issues inherent in the study of brain and behavior. The overall objective of this
seminar is to create a culminating senior experience in which previous course work in specific areas in the
Neuroscience, Performance Studies
­ 243 ­
Neuroscience Program can be brought to bear in a synthetic, interdisciplinary approach to understanding
complex problems. The specific goals for students in this seminar are (1) to evaluate original research and
critically examine the experimental evidence for theoretical issues, and (2) to gain an understanding of this
discipline through group work, and oral presentations. Topics and instructional formats will vary some-
what from year to year, but in all cases the course will emphasize an integrative approach in which students
will be asked to consider topics from a range of perspectives including molecular, cellular, systems, behav-
ioral and clinical neuroscience. Previous topics have included memory, autism, depression, alcoholism,
language development, and stress.
Format: student-led discussions and presentations, three hours a week. Evaluation will be based on presen-
tations, participation in class discussion, and a term paper.
Prerequisites: open only to seniors in the Neuroscience program. Enrollment limit: 24 (expected: 22).
This course is required of all senior students in the Neuroscience program.

PERFORMANCE STUDIES
Advisory Faculty: Professors: BUCKY, DARROW*, D. EDWARDS, EPPEL, HOPPIN, OCKMAN.

The Performance Studies Program provides an opportunity to inhabit an intellectual place where the
making of artistic and cultural meaning intersects with critical reflection on those processes. The program
has as its primary goal the bringing together of those students and faculty engaged in the creative arts, i.e.,
studio art, creative writing, dance, film and video, music, and theater with those departments that reflect in
part on those activities, e.g., Anthropology and Sociology, Art History, Classics, Comparative Literature,
English, History, Music, Philosophy, Psychology, Religion and Theater. The central ideas which perfor-
mance studies confronts-action, body, frame, representation, race, ethnicity, gender, politics, history and
transcultural experience-circulate within and through the subjects and fields upon which the program
draws.
Performance Studies strongly suggests that interested students take the introductory course (Theatre
220) and one of two capstone courses (Political Science 301 or Theatre 338).
Currently, the Program's status is as a program without a concentration. However, students interested in
participating in the Performance Studies Program are encouraged to do five things: 1) take the introductory
course, which in 2005-2006 is Theatre 220, Approaching Performance Studies; 2) take a capstone course,
which in 2005-2006 is either INTR 307,Art and Justice, or, Theatre 338,Facing the Music ; 3) try different
artistic media, both in the curriculum and beyond; 4) move between the doing of art and performance and
thinking about that process; and 5) prepare a portfolio of their work in different media.
As a senior year project, the Performance Studies Program strongly recommends the assembling of a
senior portfolio. Preparation of the portfolio should normally begin in the second semester of the junior
year. It will be done under the supervision of a member of the advisory faculty and will be submitted in the
spring of the senior year. What we suggest is that portfolios should draw on at least four projects or produc-
tions. They should show critical self-reflection on the creative processes, a comparison of the artistic media
employed and also demonstrate performance criticism on the work of others.
THEA 220(F) Approaching Performance Studies (Same as Women's and Gender Studies
220) (W)
Theatre, film, video, music, dance, visual art, performance art, community activism, public gatherings--all
fall under the rubric of "performance." Performance studies takes on these types of performances in the
name of theorizing performance as a cultural act. This course will serve as an introduction to the field of
performance studies and its theoretical bases in anthropology, dramatic theory, poststructuralism, psycho-
analytic theory, folklore, religion, cultural studies, literary theory, religion, philosophy, feminist theory, and
queer theory. In addition to reading and discussing theory, local live and recorded performances will be
considered. The course will culminate in the showing of students' final projects. This course is the
introductory course for the Performance Studies Program.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class papers and final presentation. Students are also respon-
sible for participating in class.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). No first-years admitted. Preference to sophomores,
then juniors and seniors.

THEA 338(S) Facing the Music
Music has accompanied theatrical performance since the birth of drama. Over time music on stage has
served many dramatic functions: sometimes it merely serves to embellish the emotive temperature but,
more consequentially, music can also constitute the major source of dramatic articulation. In this course we
will study the specific dramatic function of music in such works as Mozart's Cosi Fan Tutte; Wagner's Die
Meistersinger; A Midsummer Night's Dream with incidental music by Mendelssohn; Cocteau's surrealist
work The Wedding On the Eiffel Tower; Brecht's Mahagonny and The Measures Taken; Sondheim's
Sweeney Todd; and Glass and Wilson's postmodern opera Einstein on the Beach. The course will also
study the variety of working relationships that musicians have enjoyed with their collaborators in theatrical
production.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: energetic and committed participation. Written exercises will
be a midterm report on the role of music in a live performance, and a final analytical paper on a work to be
chosen in consultation with the instructor.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20 (expected: 10). No preference.
Hour: 1:10-2:25 MR BUCKY
INTR 307(S) Art and Justice (Same as ArtS 311 and Political Science 337) (W)
Although Plato dismissed painters as unreliable imitators who invariably lead viewers "far from the truth,"
art has played an important role in the creation and transformation of political belief throughout history.
This class is an interdisciplinary examination of that role, focusing especially, though not exclusively, on
the problem of how the visual arts advance and hinder the pursuit of justice. Our visual materials span
diverse periods, areas, media, and cultural traditions, but the primary emphasis is on recent American art,
particularly public art and self-consciously political works that seek to contest prevailing institutions,
norms, and social structures. By examining key aspects of contemporary art practice, we will pursue fun-
damental questions about art, politics, and the relationship between them. For example: How does one
"read" an image and determine how it "works?" How does the specific kind of activity or creation called
"art" reflect and/or shape political life, especially in a time of increasingly digital mass-media? What do
images offer those seeking, exercising, or contesting political power? Are such uses inherently more ma-
nipulative than verbal arguments over policies and principles? Does art have important ways of showing us
things we might not otherwise see? Can it make our political imaginations more generous? Can it bring us
closer to justice? What would claiming this entail? Likely authors and artists include Arendt, Bal, Benja-
min, Danto, Gran Fury, the Guerrilla Girls, Hall, Kant, Kruger, Lacy, Plato, Rockwell, Salgado, Sontag,
Walker, Wodiczko, and others.
Format: seminar. Requirements: regular short written critical analyses, several hands-on visual projects,
and one major, final independent project. For students counting the course towards the Art Studio major,
the project must be a studio project; for those taking the course toward the Art History major, the final
project must be a research paper on a body of contemporary art.
Prerequisites: at least one course in Political Theory, Philosophy, Art History, Art Studio, American Stud-
ies, or permission of instructors. Enrollment limit: 18 (expected: 18). Preference given to juniors and se-
niors.

PHILOSOPHY (Div. II)
Chair, Professor JANA SAWICKI
Professors: GERRARD, SAWICKI***, WHITE**. Associate Professor: DUDLEY. Assistant Pro-
fessors: BARRY, CLARKE, CRUZ, MLADENOVIC, WILBERDING*. Visiting Assistant Pro-
fessor: J. PEDRONI. Visiting Lecturer: MUENCH.
To engage in philosophy is to ask a variety of questions about the world and our place in it. What can we
know? What should we do? What may we hope? What makes human beings human? These questions, in
various forms, and others like them are not inventions of philosophers; on the contrary, they occur to most
people simply as they live their lives. Many of us ask them as children, but later either ignore them, or
accept answers we can live with. Philosophers, however, seek to keep such questions open, and to address
them through reasoned discussion and argument, instead of accepting answers to them based on opinion or
prejudice.
The program in philosophy is designed to aid students in thinking about these issues, by acquainting
them with influential work in the field, past and present, and by training them to grapple with these issues
themselves. The program emphasizes training in clear, critical thinking and in effective writing. Philosophy
courses center around class discussions and the writing of interpretive and critical essays.
MAJOR
Philosophy is a discipline with a long and intricate history, a history that remains an integral part of the
discipline. In this way, it differs dramatically from the natural sciences: for example, although no contem-
porary physicists or biologists embrace Aristotle's physics or biology, among philosophers there continue
Philosophy
­ 245 ­
to be champions of Aristotle's metaphysics and of his ethics. Because of the richness and continuing im-
portance of the history of philosophy, the program is designed to give majors a historical background that
will acquaint them with a wide variety of approaches in philosophical issues, and will provide them with a
basis for evaluating and contributing to contemporary debates.
A total of nine courses is required for the major in Philosophy. Students should begin with Philosophy
101 and 102, in either order; both are required for the major. These courses provide introductions to histori-
cal figures and themes that continue to be influential in many contemporary discussions in the two major
areas of philosophical inquiry, i.e., practical inquiry into issues of ethics and politics, and theoretical inquiry
into issues of knowledge, belief, understanding, and reality. The final required course is the Senior Semi-
nar, Philosophy 401. Each student selects the six electives that complete the major. The exposure to figures
and topics in 101 and 102 provides students with some basis for choice, but optimal shaping of an individ-
ual curriculum requires in addition consultation with faculty members and other students.
Generally speaking, as students progress from 100- to 300-level courses, there will be decreasing
breadth and increasing depth. In addition, writing assignments become longer, and students assume in-
creasing responsibility for identifying and developing the topics of their essays. Finally, students in
300-level courses are often required to assume responsibility for making oral presentations or guiding sig-
nificant parts of class discussions.
Students considering graduate study in philosophy are strongly urged to develop reading competence in
German, French, or Greek before graduation.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN PHILOSOPHY
The degree with honors in Philosophy is awarded to the student who has demonstrated outstanding
achievement in a program of study that extends beyond the requirements of the major. The extension be-
yond major requirements may take the form either of independent work culminating in a senior essay or
thesis (the independent-study route) or of additional course work (the directed-study route). Candidates
must have GPAs of 3.6 or higher in their courses in philosophy at the end of the junior and senior years.
Juniors interested in pursuing honors should so inform the Department Chair no later than mid-April.
The independent-study route to honors requires the completion and defense of either a senior essay pro-
duced in the fall semester plus winter study period (maximum 40 pages) or a year-long senior thesis (maxi-
mum 75 pages). Plans for either essay or thesis (including a brief proposal and bibliography, worked out in
consultation with an advisor) must be submitted to the department in April of the junior year. A recommen-
dation for graduation with honors will be made on the basis of the thoroughness, independence, and origi-
nality of the student's work.
The directed-study route to honors required the completion of two courses in philosophy in addition to
the nine required for the major. Candidates taking this route must also submit to the department revised
copies of two term papers (10 pages or longer) written for philosophy courses they have taken; each stu-
dent will be assigned an adviser to help guide the process of revision. A recommendation for graduation
with honors will be made on the basis of the scope of the student's course work, the quality of the student's
participation in Philosophy 401, and the thoroughness, independence, and originality reflected in the sub-
mitted papers.
PHIL 101(F,S) Introduction to Moral and Political Philosophy (W)
Throughout the history of Western philosophy, there have been debates concerning how human beings
should live: What should we do both with our lives as wholes and in specific problematic situations? The
debates have addressed us both as individuals and as members of political communities. This course aims
to aid us in responding to these debates, and in living our lives, on the basis of reasoned conclusions rather
than from unrecognized presuppositions. The course concentrates on Plato's Republic, the most influential
ethical and political text within Western philosophy, but we assess the Republic in light of elaborations and
criticisms that have developed over the past 2500 years, in works by Aristotle, Kant, and Mill.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: class discussion, frequent short papers (totaling 20-30 pages).
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 per section (expected: 19 per section). Preference given to first-year
students and sophomores.

PHIL 102(F,S) Introduction to Metaphysics and Epistemology (W)
Metaphysics and epistemology are the two core pursuits of theoretical philosophy (as opposed to practical
philosophy, the focus of Philosophy 101). Metaphysics is concerned with the ultimate character of reality.
The metaphysician seeks to develop knowledge (as opposed to mere opinion or belief) of all things natural,
human, and divine. She asks, for example: Are we free, or are our acts determined? Is there a God? If so,
what must God be like? Epistemology is concerned with how we determine the difference between knowl-
edge and mere opinion. The epistemologist thus asks: What does it mean truly to know something? How
can we acquire such genuine knowledge? Answers to these epistemological questions are essential if we
are to have any confidence in the methods and results of our metaphysical investigations. This course will
emphasize the established historical classics that provide the basis for understanding contemporary work
on metaphysics and epistemological issues; we will consider, among others, the work of Descartes, Hume,
and Kant.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: class discussion, frequent short papers (totaling 20-30 pages).

PHIL 209(F) Philosophy of Science
It is a generally held belief, in our times and culture, that science is the best source of our knowledge of the
world, and of ourselves. The aim of this course is to examine the origins, grounds, and nature of this belief.
We will analyze and discuss various accounts of scientific method, structure and justification of scientific
theories, scientific choice, change, and the idea that scientific knowledge is progressive. The course will
begin with the "received view" of scientific theories, methods, and knowledge, advanced by logical posi-
tivists, which assumes the objectivity and the rationality of science. We will then discuss philosophies of
science that emerged out of various criticisms of this view-especially those of Popper, Lakatos, Kuhn and
Feyerabend-and the challenges to the assumptions of scientific objectivity and rationality their works pro-
voked. This discussion will naturally lead us to the relativist and social-constructivist views developed
within contemporary science studies. Finally, we will analyze the current debate about the cognitive cre-
dentials of science and the proper approach to the study of science, which came to be known as "the sci-
ence wars."

begin with questions about how to define death, as well as reflections on its meaning and function in hu-
man life. We will move on to examine ethical issues of truth-telling with terminally ill patients and their
families, decisions to withhold or withdraw life-sustaining treatments, the care of seriously ill newborns,
physician-assisted suicide, euthanasia, and research efforts to extend the human life-span. In addition to

key concepts of death, dying, and terminal illness, we will develop and refine notions of medical futility,
paternalism and autonomy, particularly within the context of advance directives and surrogate decision
making.

PHIL 240(F) German Idealism: Kant to Hegel (Same as German 240)
German Idealism (which began with Kant's Critique of Pure Reason in 1781 and ended with Hegel's death
in 1831) was the philosophical counterpart to the French Revolution: both sought to replace the pre-mod-
ern acceptance of unjustified authority with the modern insistence on rational justification and freedom.
The immediate stimulus for this development in philosophy was Hume's skeptical attack on the preten-
sions of reason and his claim that belief and action are ultimately determined by habit or custom. Hume's
skepticism famously shook Kant from his "dogmatic slumber," spurring him to undertake a "critique" of
reason and a defense of freedom and morality. The later German Idealists--Fichte, Schelling, and Hege-
l--attempted to carry out the Kantian project more rigorously than Kant himself, striving to develop a fully
self-critical and rational philosophy, in order thereby to determine the meaning and sustain the possibility
of a free and rational modern life. Their work has been extraordinarily influential not only in philosophy,
but also in political theory, religious studies, and aesthetics.
This course will pick up where Philosophy 101 and 102 leave off, introduce students to the main figures
and themes of German Idealism, and serve as preparation for work in 20th century European philosophy.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: four 5- to7-page papers, attendance and participation.
Prerequisites: Philosophy 101 or Philosophy 102 (or permission of the instructor). Students with German
ability are welcomed and will be encouraged to work with original texts. Enrollment limit: 30 (expected:

PHIL 272T(F) Free Will and Responsibility (W)
We hold people responsible for their actions, both morally and legally. This practice seems justified as long
as people are free to make the choices that they do. But which criteria must a decision meet in order to
qualify as free? Clearly, a free decision must not be the result of external coercion. But must the decision
also be free from any outside influence at all? If so then freedom may seem impossible, for we are all
deeply influenced by external factors ranging from the general laws of nature to specific features of our
genetic endowment and social environment (including religion, political ideology, and advertising). These
affect not only our particular choices but also, more fundamentally, who we are and what we value. Since it
is undeniable that we are pervasively influenced by such outside forces, the real question is whether, and
how, free choice is possible amidst all of these influences. In this course we will examine the best-known
recent philosophical attempts to make sense of the nature of free will and responsibility. Since these issues
Philosophy
­ 248 ­
have a direct bearing on which theory of legal punishment we should accept, we will also examine influen-

PHIL 273T(S) Hume's Treatise on Human Nature (W)
David Hume started work on his Treatise of Human Nature (1739/40) at the age of 15 and finished it in his
mid 20's. His ambition was no less than a complete science of human nature, including an account of
knowledge, the emotions, and morality. Some of Hume's conclusions are famously skeptical, while others
offer a rich positive source of philosophical and psychological insight. He considers personal identity, free
will, induction, causality, the limits of reason, sentiment as a foundation for morality, relativism, and objec-
tivity. The Treatise now exerts a towering influence over the Western tradition, and many contemporary
currents in moral philosophy, epistemology, philosophy of mind, cognitive science, and philosophy of sci-
ence are identifiably "Humean."
In this tutorial we will read the entire Treatise along with other works by Hume and influential secondary
literature. Throughout, we will have two goals, namely, understanding Hume's positions in their historical
context and making sense of the relevance of Hume's approach to current theorizing. At the end of the
semester we will turn to some recent inheritors of Hume's projects, with special attention to philosophical
naturalism.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: Participants will present a 5- to 7-page paper in the tutorial every other
week, and will be responsible for commenting on their tutorial partner's work on off weeks. Expect several
short lectures by the instructor over the course of the semester where the tutorial members convene as a
group.
Prerequisites: Philosophy 101 or 102. Preference will be given to majors or prospective majors in philoso-
phy. Several spaces in this tutorial will be reserved for sophomores, and every effort will be made to pair
students according to similar or complimentary background. This course is writing intensive. Enrollment
limit: 10.

PHIL 280(F) Analytic Philosophy: Frege, Russell, and the Early Wittgenstein
The last line of Ludwig Wittgenstein's Tractatus famously reads: "Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one
must be silent." Are there things that cannot be put into words? What are the limits of language? What is
the nature of language? How do logic and language relate? We will examine these (and other questions) in
the context of the great philosophical revolution at the beginning of the last century: the linguistic turn and
the birth of analytic philosophy. We will see how a focus on language affects our understanding of many
traditional philosophical questions, ranging from epistemology and metaphysics to aesthetics and ethics.
Our texts will include Gottlob Frege, The Foundations of Arithmetic, Bertrand Russell, Principles of Math-
ematics, and Ludwig Wittgenstein, Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus.
While you're debating whether to take this class, consider the following puzzle. There is a village where
the barber shaves (a) all those and (b) only those who do not shave themselves. Now, ask yourself: who
shaves the barber? You will see that if the barber does not shave himself, then by condition (a) he does
shave himself. And, if the barber does shave himself, then by condition (b) he does not shave himself.
Thus, the barber shaves himself if and only if he does not shave himself. See if you can figure out why this
is sometimes called a paradox, and then ask yourself what this has to do with our opening questions.
Format: seminar . Requirements: two short papers (5 pages) and one longer final paper (12-15 pages).
Prerequisite: Philosophy 102. Expected enrollment: 12-15. Preference give first to Philosophy majors, and
then to seniors and juniors of any major.
Hour: 1:10-2:25 TF GERRARD
PHIL 281(S) Philosophy of Religion (Same as Religion 281)
Our goal in this course will be to try to determine how far reason can justify belief in God. We will spend
roughly half of the semester examining well-known philosophical arguments for and against the existence
of God (including the ontological argument, the cosmological argument, the teleological argument, the
argument from religious experience, the argument from evil, and the argument from religious disagree-
ment). In each case, we will consider both historically important formulations and contemporary refor-
mulations in an effort to identify, and then assess, the strongest version of the argument.
After working through these arguments, we will reflect in a more general way on the proper roles of reason
and faith in religious belief, asking when it is appropriate to rely on faith and why. In the final section of the
course we'll examine the relationship between God, morality, and politics. Here we'll consider whether
God could be the foundation of morality and what role people's religious beliefs should play in political
decision making. Our tools in this course will be logic and reason, even when we are trying to determine
what the limits of reason might be. Authors will include Plato, Anselm, Aquinas, Pascal, Paley, Hume,

PHIL 301(S) Plato's Socrates and the Sophists (Same as Classics 301) (W)
What's the difference between philosophy and sophistry? Or better yet, is there a difference? Does every-
thing come down to how things appear to this or that person (a situation the advertising industry, e.g., might
be happy to exploit), or can the proper cultivation of reason arm us with a means of protecting ourselves
against the power of appearances by fostering the ability to detect how things really are? In this course we
will examine several works by Plato (notably the Gorgias and the Protagoras) in which he pits Socrates
(our philosophical hero) against the leading intellectual figures of the day, while also examining fundamen-
tal questions about what it is to be human and what it takes to lead a successful human life.

PHIL 305(F) Existentialism and Phenomenology (W)
According to Jean-Paul Sartre, the only philosopher to ever refer to himself as an "existentialist," existence
precedes essence. What is essential to human being is not any fixed set of characteristics, but rather what a
human being becomes and how it defines and creates itself under conditions it does not choose. In this
course we address key themes and figures from two of the most influential movements in twentieth centu-
ry European philosophy, namely, existentialism and phenomenology, a philosophical approach to which
existentialism is indebted. We will discuss major works (philosophical, literary, visual) by such figures as
Edmund Husserl, Martin Heidegger, Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, Albert Camus, Maurice Mer-
leau-Ponty, and Richard Wright, Ingmar Bergman and Jean-Luc Godard. We will raise questions concern-
ing the task of philosophy, the structure and meaning constituting function of consciousness, the relation-
ship between self and other, the mind-body relationship, freedom, authenticity, and absurdity.
Format: seminar. Requirements: short critical response papers, occasional short class presentations based
on outlines of the text, and three 5- to 6-page papers. Students will be required to re-write one of the three
papers in lieu of a final exam.

PHIL 308T(S) Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations (W)
Bertrand Russell claimed that Ludwig Wittgenstein was "perhaps the most perfect example I have ever
known of genius as traditionally conceived--passionate, profound, intense, and dominating." Wittgens-
tein's two masterpieces, the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus and the Philosophical Investigations, stand
like opposing poles around which schools of twentieth-century analytic philosophy revolve. The Wittgens-
tein of the Tractatus is known as the "earlier Wittgenstein," the Wittgenstein of the Investigations is known
as the "later Wittgenstein." This tutorial is an intensive, line-by-line study of the Investigations--one of the
greatest (and thus, one of the most controversial) books in the history of philosophy. Aside from its over-
whelming influence on late-twentieth-century philosophy and intellectual culture, any book which con-
tains the remark, "if a lion could talk, we could not understand him," deserves serious attention.
Format: weekly one-hour meetings of a tutorial pair with the instructor. Requirements: bi-weekly tutorial
papers (totaling 6 per student); bi-weekly oral responses to the paper of the tutorial partner.
Prerequisites: at least 3 courses in philosophy, of which Philosophy102 is required; Philosophy 103 and

PHIL 331(F) Contemporary Epistemology (W)
Epistemology is one of the core areas of philosophical reflection. In this course, we will study the literature
in contemporary philosophy on the nature of knowledge and rational belief. Epistemologists seek answers
to the following kinds of questions:
--When is it rational to have a particular belief?
--What is knowledge (as opposed to mere opinion)?
--In order to be justified in holding a belief, must someone know (or believe) that she is justified in holding
that belief?
--What, if anything, justifies our scientific knowledge?
These questions are typically asked within a framework where the overarching goal is attaining truth and
avoiding falsity. Beyond this common ground, however, epistemologists are much divided. Some maintain
that these issues are solely the provinces of philosophy, using traditional a priori methods. Others maintain
that these questions will only yield to methods that incorporate our broader insight into the nature of the
world including, perhaps, feminist thought or science. Both stances face severe difficulties. Further, even
where there is agreement as to the proper way of answering epistemological questions, there is a stunning
variety of possible answers to each question. The syllabus can be found at:

PHIL 339(S) Political Liberalism: Rawls and his Critics (Same as Political Science 339)
"Political Liberalism" is the idea that people who are profoundly divided about moral, religious and philo-
sophical questions can nevertheless live together on free and equal terms in a stable and just society. How is
this really possible? For one, won't such people disagree about justice itself? John Rawls' A Theory of
Justice (1971) sought to answer this question by establishing two simple principles of justice that would
appeal to any rational agent, whatever their particular "conception of the good," while safeguarding the
basic civil and political liberties of all. The result is one of the truly great works of moral and political
philosophy in the 20th century. We will study the main argument of A Theory of Justice in the first half of
the course. In the second half we will turn to powerful criticisms of it put forward by communitarian, femi-
nist and postmodernist thinkers, and Rawls' reformulation of his theory in the light of those criticisms. We
should end up with a much deeper appreciation for the problems, promise and prospects of liberalism in
the 21st century. Additional authors may include: Seyla Benhabib, Richard Rorty, Michael Sandel, Charles
Taylor, Michael Walzer and Iris Young,
Format: seminar. Requirements: attendance, participation, preparation; regular short writing assignments

PHIL 342T(F) Contemporary Virtue Ethics (W)
"The concepts of obligation, and duty-moral obligation and moral duty, that is to say-and of what is moral-
ly right and wrong ...ought to be jettisoned ...because they are survivals ... from an earlier conception of
ethics which no longer generally survives, and are only harmful without it...It is as if the notion `criminal'
were to remain when criminal law and criminal courts had been abolished...It would be a great improve-
ment if, instead of `morally wrong', one always named a genus such as `untruthful', `unchaste', `unjust'."
With these words, Elizabeth Anscombe (1958) launched her famous critique of the dominant traditions of
modern moral philosophy and suggested that they be replaced with a renewed investigation of human vir-
tue, one that built on the magnificent work of Plato and Aristotle while bringing it into the present. A rich
body of scholarship known as "virtue ethics" has developed in response to this call to arms. Rather than
Philosophy
­ 251 ­
conceiving goodness in terms of conformity to moral principles (such as the categorical imperative or the
principle of utility) virtue ethics seeks to understand it in terms of the characteristics (`virtues') which pro-
mote human flourishing. But how are we to define `flourishing' in a non question-begging way? Writers in
this tradition part ways on this crucial question. In this tutorial we will study the best and most influential
writings in virtue ethics in the last half century. The objective is not only to get to know this important body
of work, but to refine our own conceptions of human nature and moral philosophy in the process. Authors
will include Julia Annas, Elizabeth Anscombe, Philipa Foot, Rosalind Hursthouse, John McDowell, Alas-
dair MacIntyre, John McDowell, Iris Murdoch, Michael Slote and Michael Thompson.

Along with jazz, pragmatism stands as the greatest uniquely American contribution to world culture. As

John Dewey. We will continue with the contemporary inheritors of the tradition: Cornel West, Richard
Rorty, and Hilary Putnam. Although it has influenced both analytic and continental philosophy, pragma-
tism is a powerful third philosophical movement. Always asking what practical difference would it make,
our authors investigate the central questions and disputes of philosophy, from epistemology and metaphys-
ics to ethics and religion. Rather than seeing philosophy as an esoteric discipline, the pragmatic philoso-
phers (with the possible exception of Peirce) see philosophy as integral to our culture and see themselves as
public intellectuals.

PHIL 401(F) Senior Seminar: Emotions (W)
Philosophy is often described as "thinking about thinking;" variously conceived inquiries into the nature,
limits, and canons of human reasoning have always been at its heart. Without challenging the centrality of
such projects for philosophy, this course will focus on a less emphasized, but equally essential aspect of our
lives: emotions. What are emotions, and how should we think about them? What is the proper "geogra-
phy"--classification and analysis--of our emotions, and what is their relation to our beliefs, judgments,
and evaluations? Which methodological approach--if a single one can be thus privileged--should we
adopt for examining emotions? Finally, what is the scope and nature of an adequate theory of emotions,
what are the desiderata for such a theory, and what should count as evidence in its favor? We will examine

The instructional Physical Education Program at Williams is an integral part of the student's total educa-
tional experience. As a part of the liberal arts concept, the program develops the mind-body relationship,
which is dependent upon the proper integration of physical and intellectual capacities. The main objective
of the physical education program is to develop in each student an appreciation of physical fitness and
wellness, and to expose them to a variety of activities that are suitable for lifetime participation.
Four credits of physical education represent one of the requirements for the College degree. There are
five physical education units during the year. In the fall semester, there are two six-week physical education
quarters. Winter Study is another unit, and there are two physical education quarters in the spring semester.
Four sections meet two times per week in seventy-five minute periods and two sections meet three times
per week in fifty-minute periods.
The following courses are offered at various times during the year. A schedule listing all courses offered
is issued to every student before each quarter and Winter Study. Classes may vary according to availability
of instructors and interest of students.

Laboratory Supervisor: FORKEY.
What is light? How does a transistor work? What is a black hole? Why are metals shiny? What is wave/
particle duality? There are people for whom questions like these are of more than passing interest; some of
them become Physics or Astrophysics majors. A physics student experiments with the phenomena by
which the physical world is known and explores the mathematical techniques and theories that make sense
of it. A Physics or Astrophysics major serves as preparation for further work in physics, astrophysics, ap-
plied physics, other sciences, engineering, medical research, science teaching and writing, and other ca-
reers involving insight into the fundamental principles of nature.
ASTROPHYSICS MAJOR
The Physics Department, in cooperation with the Astronomy Department, offers a major in astrophysics
consisting of (at least): 6 or 7 courses in Physics, 3 or 4 in Astronomy, and 1 in Mathematics. The core
sequence of the Astrophysics major is the same as the Physics major described below (except that Physics
302, although strongly recommended, is not required). Students intending to pursue graduate study in as-
trophysics will need to take upper-level physics electives beyond the basic requirements for the major.
Honors work in Astrophysics may be in either physics or astronomy. Students majoring in Astrophysics
are expected to consult early and often with faculty from both departments in determining their course
selections. The detailed description of the Astrophysics major is given under "Astronomy," along with a
description of the Astronomy major also offered by that department (see page 86).
PHYSICS MAJOR
Introductory courses
Students considering a major in physics should take both physics and mathematics as first-year students.
A student normally begins with either Physics 131 or Physics 141:
1) Physics 131 Particles and Waves. This is designed as a first course in physics. It is suitable for stu-
dents who either have not had physics before or have had some physics but are not comfortable solving
"word problems" that require calculus.
2) Physics 141 Particles and Waves--Enriched. Students in this course should have solid backgrounds
in science and calculus, either from high school or college, including at least a year of high school physics.
The Department of Mathematics will place students in the appropriate introductory calculus course. The
physics major sequence courses all make use of calculus at increasingly sophisticated levels. Therefore,
students considering a Physics major should continue their mathematical preparation without interruption
through the introductory calculus sequence (Mathematics 103, 104, and 105 or 106). Students are encour-
aged to take Physics 210 as early as possible. Physics 210 is cross listed as Mathematics 210 for the benefit
of those students who wish to have the course listed with a MATH prefix.
Advanced Placement
Students with unusually strong backgrounds in calculus and physics may place out of Physics 141 and
either: 1) begin with the special seminar course Physics 151 in the fall (typically followed by Physics 210
in the spring), or 2) begin with Physics 142 in the spring (possibly along with Physics 210). Students may
take either 151 or 142 but not both. On rare occasions a student with an exceptional background will be
offered the option of enrolling in Physics 201.
Placement is based on AP scores, consultation with the department, and results of a placement exam
administered during First Days. The exam can also be taken later in the year by arrangement with the de-
partment chair. The exam covers classical mechanics, basic wave phenomena, and includes some use of
calculus techniques.
Requirements for the Major
A total of ten courses in physics and mathematics are required to complete the Physics major. Students
who place out of both Physics 141 and Physics 142 and begin their studies in Physics 201 are re-
quired to take a total of nine courses.
Required Physics Sequence Courses
Physics 141 Particles and Waves--Enriched
or Physics 131 Particles and Waves
Physics 142 Foundations of Modern Physics
or Physics 151 Seminar in Modern Physics
Physics 201 Electricity and Magnetism
Physics 202 Waves and Optics

­ 254 ­
Physics 210 Mathematical Methods for Scientists
Physics 301 Quantum Physics
Physics 302 Statistical Physics
Required Mathematics Course
Mathematics 105 Multivariable Calculus or Mathematics 106 Multivariable Calculus
Students entering with Advanced Placement in mathematics may obtain credit toward the major for the
equivalent Mathematics 105 or 106 taken elsewhere.
At least two more physics or other approved courses must be taken, bringing the total number of courses
for the major to ten.
Options
1) Mathematics 104 may be counted if taken at Williams
2) Mathematics 209 may substitute for Physics 210.
3) Astronomy 111 may count in place of Physics 141 if a student places out of 141 (see "advanced
placement" above).
4) An additional Astronomy or Astrophysics course above the introductory level that is acceptable for
the astrophysics major may be counted.
5) Two approved Division III courses above the introductory level may be substituted for one Physics
course. Approval is on an individual basis at the discretion of the department chair.
6) Honors work is in addition to completion of the basic major so Physics 493 and 494 do not count
towards the ten courses in the major.
Preparation for Advanced Study
Students who may wish to do graduate work in physics, astrophysics, or engineering should elect
courses in both physics and mathematics beyond the minimum major requirements. The first-year gradu-
ate school curriculum in physics usually includes courses in quantum mechanics, electromagnetic theory,
and classical mechanics that presuppose intermediate level study of these subjects as an undergraduate.
Therefore, students planning graduate work in physics should elect all of the following courses:
Physics 402T Applications of Quantum Mechanics
Physics 405T Electromagnetic Theory
Physics 411T Classical Mechanics
Advising
Both majors and non-majors are encouraged to consult with the department chair or course instructors
about course selections or other matters.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN PHYSICS
The degree with honors in Physics will be awarded on the basis of a senior thesis presenting the results
of a substantial experimental or theoretical investigation carried out under the direction of a faculty mem-
ber in the department. There is no rigid grade point average required for admission to the program or for the
awarding of the degree with honors, but it is normally expected that honors students will maintain at least a
B average in physics and mathematics. Students will normally apply for admission to the program early in
the spring of their junior year and during senior year these students will normally elect Physics 493, W31,
and 494 in addition to the usual requirements for the major. At the end of winter study, the department will
decide whether the student will be admitted to honors candidacy. Both a written thesis and a colloquium
presentation of the results are required. The degree with honors will be awarded to those who meet these
requirements with distinction. The degree with highest honors will be awarded to those who fulfill them
with unusually high distinction.
Honors candidates will also be required to participate in departmental colloquium talks.
OPTIONS FOR NON-MAJORS
Many students want to take a self-contained and rigorous full-year survey of physics. For such students,
the most appropriate sequence will be either Physics 131 or Physics 141 followed by Physics 132, depend-
ing on the student's background in science and mathematics (see Introductory Courses above). Either of
these sequences satisfies the physics requirement for medical school.
The department also offers one semester courses designed for non-majors. This year there are two such
offerings: Physics 100 and Physics 109.
PHYS 100(S) Physics of Everyday Life (Q)
How do things work? What makes a car go or a bird fly? Why do microwaves heat food? How does a CD
player work? Why are diamonds hard and metals shiny? How do we see?
Science is all around us. From common objects to high technology, science is part of our everyday lives.
Amazingly, with a few powerful principles we can understand the materials that make up our world and
the rules that govern their behavior--that's physics.
In this course we will explore the world we know and the microscopic components from which it is made,
and we will extract from this exploration the central concepts underpinning contemporary physics. The
mathematics used in the course will be basic algebra and trigonometry.
Format: lecture, three hours per week/home experiments. Evaluation will be based on weekly homework,

a midterm, a project, and a final exam, all with a significant quantitative component.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 120 (expected: 75).
Hour: 1:10-2:25 TF K. JONES
PHYS 109(F) Sound, Light, and Perception (Q)
Light and sound allow us to perceive the world around us, from appreciating music and art to learning the
details of atomic structure. Because of their importance in human experience, light and sound have long
been the subject of scientific inquiry. How are sound and light related? How do physiology and neural
processing allow us to hear and see the world around us? What are the origins of color and musical pitch?
This course introduces the science and technology of light and sound to students not majoring in physics.
We will start with the origins of sound and light as wave phenomena, and go on to topics including color,
the optics of vision, the meaning of musical pitch and tone, and the physical basis of hearing. We will also
discuss some recent technological applications of light, such as lasers and optical communications.
The class will meet for two 75-minute periods each week for a variable mixture of lecture, discussion, and
hands-on, interactive experiments.
Format: lecture/lab/discussion, three hours per week; occasional mini-tutorial-like meetings. Evaluation
will be based on class participation, problem sets, in-class exams, oral presentations, and a final exam, all
with a quantitative component.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20 (expected: 20).
Hour: 11:20-12:35 TR MAJUMDER
PHYS 131(F) Particles and Waves (Q)
We focus first on the Newtonian mechanics of point particles: the relationship between velocity, accelera-
tion, and position; the puzzle of circular motion; forces; Newton's laws; energy and momentum; and gravi-
tation. The historical context in which these ideas developed will be discussed. We then turn to the basic
properties of waves, such as interference and polarization, with emphasis on light waves. Finally, we bring
the two strands together with a brief discussion of the wave-particle duality of modern quantum mechan-
ics.
This course is intended for students who have not studied physics before or who have had some physics,
but are not comfortable solving "word problems" that require calculus. (Students with strong backgrounds
in the sciences are encouraged to consider taking Physics 141 instead.) Physics 131 can lead to either Phys-
ics 132 (for students wanting a one-year survey of physics) or Physics 142 (for students considering a
physics or astrophysics major).
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours every other week. Evaluation will be based
on weekly problem sets, hour tests, labs, and a final exam, all of which have a substantial quantitative com-
ponent.
Prerequisites: Mathematics 103. No enrollment limit (expected: 60).
Hour: 11:00-11:50 MWF Lab: 1-4 M,T,W STRAIT
PHYS 132(S) Electromagnetism and the Physics of Matter (Q)
This course is intended as the second half of a one-year survey of physics. In the first half of the semester
we will focus on electromagnetic phenomena. We will introduce the concept of electric and magnetic
fields, and study in detail the way in which electrical circuits and circuit elements work. The deep connec-
tion between electric and magnetic phenomena is highlighted in a discussion of Faraday's Law of Induc-
tion. In the second half of the semester, we introduce several of the most central topics in twentieth-century
physics. We will discuss Einstein's theory of special relativity as well as aspects of quantum theory. We will
end with a treatment of nuclear physics, radioactivity, and uses of radiation.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours every other week. Evaluation will be based
on weekly problem sets, labs, hour tests, and a final exam, all of which have a substantial quantitative com-
ponent.
Prerequisites: Physics 131 or 141 or permission of instructor, and Mathematics 103. No enrollment limit
(expected: 60).
Hour: 11:00-11:50 MWF Lab: 1-4 M,T,W S. BOLTON
PHYS 141(F) Particles and Waves--Enriched (Q)
This course covers the same topics as Physics 131, but with a higher level of mathematical sophistication
and more emphasis on waves. It is intended for students with solid backgrounds in the sciences, either from
high school or college, who feel comfortable solving "word problems" that require calculus. Physics 141
can lead to either Physics 132 (for students wanting a one-year survey of physics) or Physics 142 (for stu-
dents considering a physics or astrophysics major).
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours every other week/conference, one hour every
other week. Evaluation will be based on weekly problem sets, quizzes and hour tests, and labs, all of which
have a substantial quantitative component.
Prerequisites: high school physics and Mathematics 103 (or equivalent placement). No enrollment limit
(expected: 50).

PHYS 142(S) Foundations of Modern Physics (Q)
The twentieth century has been an extremely productive and exciting time for physics. Special relativity
has extended physics into the realm of high speeds and high energies. Quantum mechanics has successful-
ly described phenomena at small energies and small distance scales. Our understanding of atoms, mole-
cules, and solids has developed from a few revolutionary ideas into a sophisticated framework which today
supports technologies that were unimagined in 1900.
This course will introduce many important developments in physics, including special relativity, the Bohr
model of the atom, Schrodinger's wave mechanics in one dimension, the chemical bond, energy bands in
solids, and nuclear physics.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours every other week/conference, one hour every
other week. Evaluation will be based on weekly problem sets, labs, two hour tests, and a final exam, all of
which have a substantial quantitative component.
Prerequisites: Physics 141 and Mathematics 103, or equivalent; students may not take both Physics 142
and Physics 151. Physics 131 may substitute for Physics 141 with the permission of instructor. No enroll-
ment limit (expected:50).
Hour: 11:00-11:50 MWF Lab: 1-4 M,T,W WHITAKER
PHYS 151(F) Seminar in Modern Physics (Q)
Why does a hot coal glow red rather than blue or green or some other color? Remarkably, this simple
question could not be answered before the year 1900, because the answer depends on a radical assumption
introduced in that year by Max Planck. His work on thermal radiation marked the beginning of a revolu-
tionary era in the history of physics that culminated in a new framework for our understanding of the physi-
cal world. The two pillars of this framework, quantum mechanics and relativity, together with the ideas of
statistical physics that allow us to apply quantum mechanics to macroscopic objects (such as hot coals),
constitute the core of this course. As we study this material, we will also be exploring the process of re-
search in physics, partly by doing some experiments of our own. We will discuss the interaction between
experiment and theory, as well as the roles of simplicity, elegance and unity in the search for explanations.
This is a small seminar designed for first-year students who have placed out of Physics 141.
Format: lecture/discussion, three hours per week; laboratory, every other week. Evaluation will be based
on class participation, labs, weekly problem sets, an oral presentation, two hour-exams and a final exam, all
of which have a substantial quantitative component.
Prerequisites: placement by the department (see advanced placement above). Students may take either
Physics 142 or Physics 151 but not both. Enrollment limit: 20 (expected: 14).
This course is part of the Critical Reasoning and Analytical Skills initiative.
Hour: 11:00-11:50 MWF Lab: 1-4 M AALBERTS
PHYS 201(F) Electricity and Magnetism (Q)
In this course, we study electromagnetic phenomena and their mathematical description. Topics include
electromagnetic induction, alternating circuits, and the electromagnetic properties of matter. We also
introduce Maxwell's equations, which express in remarkably succinct form the essence of the theory.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on week-
ly problem sets, labs, two hour tests, and a final exam, all of which have a substantial quantitative compo-
nent.
Prerequisites: Physics 142, Mathematics 105 or 106. No enrollment limit (expected:25).
Hour: 10:00-10:50 MWF Lab: 1-4 M,T WHITAKER
PHYS 202(S) Waves and Optics (Q)
Waves and oscillations characterize many different physical systems, including vibrating strings, springs,
water waves, sound waves, electromagnetic waves, and gravitational waves. Quantum mechanics even
describes particles with wave functions. Despite these diverse settings waves exhibit several common
characteristics, so that the understanding of a few simple systems can provide insight into a wide array of
phenomena. In this course we begin with the study of oscillations of simple systems with only a few de-
grees of freedom. We then move on to study transverse and longitudinal waves in continuous media in
order to gain a general description of wave behavior. The rest of the course focuses on electromagnetic
waves and in particular on optical examples of wave phenomena. In addition to well known optical effects
such as interference and diffraction, we will study a number of modern applications of optics such as short
pulse lasers and optical communications. Throughout the course mathematical methods useful for higher-
level physics will be introduced.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on prob-
lem sets, labs, two one-hour tests, and a final exam, all of which have a substantial quantitative component.
Prerequisite: Physics 201. Co-requisite: Physics/Mathematics 210 or permission of instructor. No enroll-
ment limit (expected: 20).
Hour: 10:00-10:50 MWF Lab: 1-4 T,W STRAIT
PHYS 210(S) Mathematical Methods for Scientists (Same as Mathematics 210) (Q)
This course covers a variety of mathematical methods used in the sciences, focusing particularly on the
solution of ordinary and partial differential equations. In addition to calling attention to certain special
equations that arise frequently in the study of waves and diffusion, we develop general techniques such as
Physics
­ 257 ­
looking for series solutions and, in the case of nonlinear equations, using phase portraits and linearizing
around fixed points. We study some simple numerical techniques for solving differential equations. A se-
ries of optional sessions in TrueBasic will be offered for students who do not already have a background in
programming.
Format: lecture, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on weekly problem sets, a midterm exam
and a final exam, all of which have a substantial quantitative component.
Prerequisites: Mathematics 105 or 106 and familiarity with Newtonian mechanics at the level of Physics
131. No enrollment limit (expected: 20).
Hour: 9:55-11:10 TR TUCKER-SMITH
PHYS 301(F) Quantum Physics (Q)
This course serves as a one-semester introduction to the history, formalism, and phenomenology of quan-
tum mechanics. We begin with a discussion of the historical origins of the quantum theory, and the Schroe-
dinger wave equation. The concepts of matter waves and wave-packets are introduced. Solutions to one-
dimensional problems will be treated prior to introducing the system which serves as a hallmark of the
success of quantum theory, the three-dimensional hydrogen atom. In the second half of the course, we will
develop the important connection between the underlying mathematical formalism and the physical pre-
dictions of the quantum theory. We then go on to apply this knowledge to several important problems with-
in the realm of atomic and nuclear physics.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on week-
ly problem sets, labs, a midterm exam, and final exam, all of which have a substantial quantitative compo-
nent.
Prerequisites: Physics 202 and Physics 210. No enrollment limit (expected:15).
Hour: 9:00-9:50 MWF Lab: 1-4 T,W K. JONES
PHYS 302(S) Statistical Physics (Q)
The natural world is built with many small components interacting in a simple but coordinated way. With a
statistical view, we may make sense of the cooperative phenomena which emerge.
For example, we can associate macroscopic thermodynamic properties with ensembles of microscopic
states. With calculations and simple numerical exercises we shall probe a wide variety of physical phe-
nomena: magnetism, gasses, heat engines, thermal radiation, electrons in solids, polymers, random walks
in fluids or in the stock market, and genomic information.
Format: lecture, three hours per week/computer laboratory, 1 1/4 hours per week. Evaluation will be based
on weekly problem sets, quizzes, labs and a final exam, all of which have a substantial quantitative compo-
nent.

PHYS 405T(F) Electromagnetic Theory (Q)
We will review Maxwell's equations and use them to study a range of topics--electric fields and matter,
magnetic materials, light, radiation--exploring phenomena and seeking to gain an intuitive understanding.
We will also learn some useful approximation techniques and some beautiful mathematical tools.
The class will meet as a whole once per week for an hour lecture on new material and to discuss questions
on the readings. Each week a second tutorial meeting with the instructor will be scheduled; here, students
will take turns working problems on the chalkboard. Written solutions to problems will be due a few days
after the tutorial meeting.
Format: tutorial, 1&1/4 hours per week; lecture, one hour per week. Evaluation will be based on weekly
problem sets, tutorial participation, presentations, and a final exam or final project, all of which have a

PHYS 418(S) Gravity (Q)
This course is an introduction to the currently accepted theory of gravity, Einstein's general theory of
relativity. We begin with a review of special relativity in terms of spacetime vectors and tensors, and we
introduce the stress-energy tensor, which is the source of gravity. We study the mathematical description of
curved spacetime and develop an intuitive justification for Einstein's equation, relating the stress-energy
tensor (matter) to the curvature of spacetime (gravity). Finally we study in some detail two solutions of
Einstein's equation: the Schwarzschild solution, which applies to a spherically symmetric star, and the
Friedmann model of an expanding universe.
Format: lecture, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on weekly problem sets, a midterm
and a final exam, all of which have a substantial quantitative component.
Prerequisites: Physics 301 or Physics 405 or Physics 411 (students with strong math backgrounds are
invited to consult with the instructor about a possible waiving of the prerequisites). No enrollment limit

Hour: 10:00-10:50 MWF TUCKER-SMITH
Courses numbered 450 through 459 are independent reading courses in advanced topics. Students will
read a textbook or other material and work problems. Once a week the students and the instructor will
meet for discussion and student presentations. Due to the initiative and independence required, interested
students should consult with the instructor before registering for one of these courses. Enrollments will be
limited, usually to 4 or fewer.
PHYS 451(S) Solid State Physics (Q)
This course will explore the physics of metals, insulators, and semiconductors, with particular attention to
structure, energy bands, and electronic properties. After developing the appropriate background, we will
examine some simple semiconductor devices. Independent reading and discussion.

Advisory Committee: Professor: BRADBURD, C. JOHNSON, MAHON. Associate Professors: D.
GOLLIN***, SHANKS.
The Political Economy major is designed to give students a grasp of the ways in which political and
economic forces interact in the shaping of public policy. The major includes substantial study of the central
analytical approaches in both political science and economics and seeks to surmount the sometimes artifi-
cial barriers of specialization that may characterize either discipline taken by itself. In the junior and senior
years a conscious merging of the approaches in the two fields is undertaken in the three required Political
Economy courses. (These courses are designed by, and usually are taught jointly by, political scientists and
economists.) Political Economy 301 examines major writings in political economy and analyzes economic
liberalism and critiques of economic liberalism in the context of current policy issues. Political Economy
401 examines interactions of political and economic forces in contemporary international affairs. Political
Economy 402 examines such interactions in selected current public policy issues. Background for these
senior courses is acquired through courses in international economics, public finance, and domestic and
international/comparative politics and policy.
Students in Political Economy 402 visit Washington, D.C. Sunday night through Wednesday of the first
week of spring vacation to conduct interviews relating to their Political Economy 402 group projects. This
is a course requirement.

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN POLITICAL ECONOMY
Due to the special demands of this interdisciplinary major, the only route to honors in Political Economy
is the thesis. Seniors may pursue the honors thesis course (Political Economy 493-W31) during the fall
semester and winter study period. The third course contributing to such an honors program would normal-
ly be an elective in Political Science or Economics taken during the junior year. This course, which may be
one of the required electives, must be closely related, indeed must prepare the ground for the honors thesis.
Juniors in the Political Economy major with at least a 3.5 GPA in the program may apply for the honors
thesis program by means of a written proposal submitted to the chair before spring registration. Written
guidelines for such proposals are available in the chair's office or on the program website. The proposal
should have been discussed with at least two faculty members, and at least one faculty advisor from each
discipline should be solicited by the student prior to submission of the proposal.
Final decisions about admission to the honors program will be made in early summer, when spring
grades become available.
To achieve the degree with honors in Political Economy, the thesis must be completed by the end of
winter study period and be judged of honors quality by a committee consisting of the two advisors and a
third reader. A thesis judged to be of particular distinction will qualify its author for the degree with highest
honors.
COURSE NUMBERING SYSTEM
The numbering system for courses offered and required in Political Economy is identical to the system
outlined on page 45.
POEC 301(F) Economic Liberalism and Its Critics (Same as Economics 301 and Political
Science 333)
Economic liberalism holds that, if left alone by government, people will make mutually beneficial transac-
tions with one another, leaving society better off. Its critics point to what they believe this position ignores
or what it wrongly assumes, and hence, how it would make bad policy. This course explores the relation-
ship between politics and economics by surveying influential works of political economy. Its first part ex-
amines major thinkers in relation to the historical development of capitalism in Western Europe: the classi-
cal liberalism of Adam Smith, Karl Marx's revolutionary socialism, and the reformist ideas of John Stuart
Mill, R. H. Tawney, and John Maynard Keynes. The second part considers more recent writings that revise
and critique liberalism from a variety of perspectives. The historical focus of the course permits you to
appreciate the ongoing dialogue between classical and contemporary views of political economy, while
classroom discussion involves frequent reference to current public policy issues.
Format: discussion/lecture. Requirements: eight 2-page papers and a final exam.

POEC 402(S) Political Economy of Public Policy Issues
The core of this course consists of analyses by student study groups of current issues of public policy. The
student groups investigate the interacting political and economic aspects of an issue, do extensive reading,
conduct interviews in Washington (during spring recess) with public and private officials, write a major
report on their findings and recommendations, and defend it orally in a public session.
Students visit Washington, D.C. Sunday night through Wednesday of the first week of spring vacation to
conduct interviews relating to their group projects. This is a course requirement.

Politics is most fundamentally about forging and maintaining community, about how we manage to
craft a common destiny guided by shared values. Communities need a way to reconcile conflicts of interest
among their members and to determine their group interest; they need to allocate power and to determine
its just uses. Power may be used wisely or foolishly, rightly or cruelly, but it is always there; it cannot be
wished away. Political science attends to the ways that social power is grasped, maintained, challenged, or
justified. The contests over power and the values that it should be used to further give politics its drama and
pathos. The effort to understand politics aims not only to describe and explain, but also to improve political
life.
The Political Science major is structured to allow students either to participate in the established ways of
studying politics or to develop their own foci. To this end, the department offers two routes to completing
the major, each requiring nine courses. We invite students either to organize their major through the sub-
fields that structure the discipline of political science (American politics, international relations, political
theory, and comparative politics), or to develop individual concentrations reflecting their particular inter-
ests, regardless of subfields.
MAJOR
SUBFIELD CONCENTRATION ROUTE: Upon declaring a major, students choose one subfield:
American politics, international relations, political theory, or comparative politics. The subfield concentra-
tion draws at least four (4) of the nine courses from one subfield including the appropriate core course from
201-204, two electives of the student's choice at the 200 or 300 level and the senior seminar (or an individ-
ual project) in the student's subfield. (A degree with honors in Political Science requires enrollment in the
year-long senior thesis seminar, which does not count toward the nine (9) major requirements.) With per-
mission of the department chair, students may take a senior seminar in a different subfield, providing they
Political Science
­ 261 ­
take a third elective in the subfield of concentration. In addition, students must take courses in two subfields
outside the subfield of concentration to satisfy the breadth requirement (all courses at the 100 level and all
methods courses also count toward the breadth requirement). The faculty advisor and the department chair
must approve the student plan.
INDIVIDUAL CONCENTRATION ROUTE: Alternatively, students may devise a concentration of their
own. In this event, the student prepares a curricular plan in consultation with a faculty advisor, explaining
the nature of the concentration and the courses the student will take. The individual concentration also
requires nine (9) courses, with at least five (5) thematically linked courses constituting the concentration.
Of these five courses, four are electives at the 200 or 300 level, including one from 201-204, and one is a
senior seminar or individual project. In addition, students pursuing an individual concentration must take at
least two other courses that illustrate breadth in political science. To complete the requirement, the student
has his or her choice of any two other courses within the Political Science Department. The faculty advisor
and the department chair must approve the student plan.
ADVISEMENT
When a student chooses to major in Political Science (usually at the end of the sophomore year), he or
she may register with any Political Science faculty member at the designated time and places. The register-
ing faculty member will ask for preferences for a permanent faculty advisor and will assist undecided stu-
dents in finding an advisor. In all cases, students will be paired by the end of the sophomore year with an
advisor who will continue with them through graduation.
COURSE NUMBERING
The course numbering used by the Political Science Department reflects the format and specialization of
a course The 100-level courses are designed to address political topics from multiple subfield perspectives..
The 200-level courses are divided between our core courses and our electives. The core courses, numbered
from 201-204, serve as introductions both to the substance of the politics and the subfields organizing the
study of politics. The introductory subfield course must be completed before the senior year. The 200-level
elective courses delve into political processes, problems and philosophies. 100-level and 200-level courses
have no prerequisites. 300-level courses are more specialized and require prerequisites. 400-level courses
are senior seminars offered for students in the major; senior seminars also are open to juniors and to non-
majors if space permits.
WINTER STUDY PROJECT
The department welcomes relevant WSP 99 proposals that can make important contributions to the stu-
dent's understanding of public affairs and politics. Majors, seniors, and students without previous WSP 99
experience have preference.
THE JUNIOR YEAR ABROAD
A major in Political Science can be readily and usefully combined with study in a foreign country. No
more than one course taken per semester abroad in a program approved by the College may be counted
toward the requirements for a degree in Political Science.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE
The Political Science Department grants honors to candidates who, (1) complete the Senior Seminar, (2)
receive at least a grade of 3.50 on a Senior Thesis (493-W31-494), and (3) have a minimum GPA of 3.5 in
Political Science.
To become a candidate for honors the student must (1) apply in the second semester of the junior year,
(2) submit a research proposal acceptable to the department's honors committee and for which an ap-
propriate advisor is available, and (3) have a minimum GPA of 3.5 in Political Science for the first six
semesters. (Political Science 493-W31-494 DO NOT count toward the total of nine required of all majors.)
ADVANCED STUDY IN AMERICAN POLITICS
The Department of Political Science provides the opportunity for an unusually gifted student to engage
in an entire year's advanced research in American politics under singularly favorable conditions. Sup-
ported by income derived from an endowment fund, the student, designated the Sentinels of the Republic
Scholar (after the name of the fund), receives a substantial research stipend to cover costs associated with
the proposed project.
This unique research course (Political Science 481-W33-482) is designed to encourage the pursuit of
excellence among the most talented Williams students of Political Science. Admission to it is awarded to
the most distinguished candidate on the basis of demonstrated capacity for outstanding work and of the
project's promise for creative contributions to the understanding of American politics, political institutions
and thought.
PSCI 100(F) Asia and the World (Same as Asian Studies 201 and International Studies 101)*
Asia looms large in contemporary world politics: Japan is gradually assuming an expanded regional na-
tional security role; The People's Republic of China is emerging as a multifaceted Great Power; India is
challenged by rising ethno-nationalism. This course will explore both the historical background and cur-
rent dynamics of political and economic issues in these three countries, drawing on themes of imperialism,
nationalism, and globalization. It is an introductory class and, therefore, no prior coursework in political
science or Asian studies is necessary.

PSCI 101(S) Seminar: The Politics of Place in America
What does it mean when someone says they're a Midwesterner? A New Englander? A Texan? Is there
importance attached to being an urban resident versus a suburbanite? What about a rural resident? What's
the significance of living in a border town? This course explores the politics of place. The country's politics
have always been keyed, in important ways, to geography: representation in national government is de-
fined in terms of geographic areas; funds and resources from the national government are distributed un-
equally around the country; state and local governments, which have an influential role in our political
system, vary tremendously from one place to the next; and the country's history has been marked by the
violence of geographic conflicts as well as the acquisition of new territory. Much of its social and economic
life can also be understood in terms of geography. Patterns of settlement, immigration, slavery, agriculture,
education, religion, and cultural production have left and continue to leave different patterns of sediment
throughout the country; these patterns and their interactions form the bedrock of American politics. We
will spend the semester thinking about the significance of place in politics by exploring the ways that cul-
ture, economy, and political institutions vary throughout the country. Topics covered will include urbaniza-
tion and urban politics, the development of the suburbs, regional differences, and the effects of globaliza-
tion on local differences.

PSCI 120(F) America and the World After September 11
The terrorist attacks of September 11 and the war in Afghanistan raised fundamental questions about the
past and future course of American foreign policy. While virtually no one defended the terrorist attacks,
many academics argued that the root causes of September 11th were to be found in the flaws of the Ameri-
can approach to the world. In this view, America is an arrogant, unilateralist country that ignores the views
and perspectives of the rest of the world community, relies far too much on its overwhelming military pow-
er, and often acts against its ideals and values by supporting repressive and unpopular regimes. This course
has three primary objectives. First, we will assess important critiques of contemporary American foreign
policy from both the left and right of the political spectrum. Second, we will examine the historical and
intellectual background of both supporters and critics of American foreign policy in the post Vietnam War
era. Third, in the aftermath of September 11 we will attempt to answer the most important question of all
for any analysis of American foreign policy: What is to be done? While current issues of American foreign
policy will be addressed in this class, potential students should note that its primary focus is not on the
technical/military elements of combating terrorism.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: assignments will include weekly response papers, two 5- to
7-page papers, and a comprehensive in-class final exam. Students will also be required to obtain (free)

Begun as an experiment over 200 years ago, the United States has grown into a polity that is simultaneous-

course introduces students to the dynamics and tensions that have animated the American political order
and that have nurtured these conflicting assessments. Topics include the primary institutions of national
government (Congress, the Presidency, and the Supreme Court) and the politics of policy-making in the
United States. We study structures, processes, key events, and primary actors that have shaped American
political development. In investigating these topics, we explore questions such as these: How is power
allocated? What produces political change? Is there is a trade-off between democratic accountability and
effective governance? How are tensions between liberty and equality resolved? Do the institutions produce
good policies, and how do we define what is good? How are the politics of America different from the

PSCI 202(F,S) World Politics: An Introduction to International Relations
International politics differs from domestic politics in the absence of centralized, legitimate institutions.
Anarchy characterizes the world of sovereign states--there is no world government, nor agreement that
one is desirable or even possible. This lack of a common authority means that any dispute among countries
is up to the countries themselves to settle, by negotiating, appealing to shared norms, or using force. For
this reason, while international relations involves many of the same topics that consume domestic poli-
tics--ethnic antagonisms, spending on aid, war, national identity, inequality, weapons manufacture, fi-
nance, loans, pollution, migration--it shares few of the same processes for dealing with them. This course
covers problems central to international relations. It considers the importance that this radical decentraliza-
tion has for achieving values we hold, and examines processes that might undermine or support the anar-
chical system in which we live.
Format: lecture. Requirements: two papers, a final exam, reading response papers, and class participation.

PSCI 203(F,S) Introduction to Political Theory
What is justice? What does it entail for individuals and communities? How can it be secured, socially and
politically? Who decides? On what basis? These questions have been disputed since their earliest formula-
tions, and they remain controversial. This course introduces the study of political theory by exploring some
of its key controversies. Drawing on both contemporary and classic theories, and using practical examples
from today's world, we will examine justice in relation to such themes as authority, equality, democracy,
power, oppression, liberalism, capitalism, bureaucracy, community, cultural pluralism, and rights. Specific
theorists will vary from year to year, but include such thinkers as Plato, Aristotle, Hobbes, Machiavelli,
Locke, Rousseau, Marx, Mill, Nietzsche, Weber, Arendt, Rawls, and Foucault.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: two (5-page) papers and a final exam.

PSCI 204(F) Introduction to Comparative Politics
People around the world are all like Americans--or at least they all want to be like Americans, right? Fat
chance! People in different countries not only have different resources, but also different experiences, insti-
tutions, and values. The very foundations of political life--ideas about belonging, the fair division of social
roles, about family and religion, authority, law-- are deeply bound up with culture and history. Compara-
tive politics seeks to account for the fantastic variety of political life around the globe. Why were there so
many dictators in Latin America? Does oil or diamond wealth inexorably lead to corruption or dictator-
ship? Why is Canada so darned peaceful? How come some revolutionary governments end up stable and
powerful (the US, Cuba) whereas others go berzerk and fall apart (France, Cambodia)? This class grounds
students in the fundamental conceptual categories used in comparative political analysis, including nation-
alism, the state, political culture, institutionalism, religion and politics, constitutionalism, and political
economy.

PSCI 206(F) Memoirs of African American Social Movements (Same as Leadership Studies

This course explores African American political theory and practice through the lens of memoir. Begin-
ning with the slave narrative genre, autobiographies of African American activists have served as impor-
tant tools for organizing support for social movements, providing historical evidence of African American
experiences and challenging public policies that affect the African American community. In addition,
memoirs have provided an alternative space for African American voices to be heard when they have been
excluded or ignored by academic, media and political institutions. Throughout this course, we will ex-
Political Science
­ 264 ­
amine the history of African American social movements through the life stories of activists such as Har-
riet Tubman, Paul Robeson, Malcolm X, Assata Shakur and Audre Lorde. We will also observe how these
texts reveal concerns that are common to historically marginalized groups about the meaning of autonomy,
freedom, justice, authenticity and collective consciousness. In addition, we will consider how personal ex-
periences of race, class, gender, sexuality and citizenship influence various forms of political participation.
Last, we will interrogate the subjectivity and distortion of fact that are often found in even the most well-
intentioned memoirs.
Format: seminar. Requirements: consistent class participation, one fifteen-page research paper, one
twenty-page memoir and one take-home final exam.

PSCI 216(F) Constitutional Law I: Structures of Power
Constitutional Law I focuses on the legal and political regime established by the U.S. Constitution. We
concentrate on two themes at the core of American constitutionalism: (1) the respective powers of, and
interaction among, the federal government's three branches ("separation of powers"); and (2) the intersec-
tions and boundaries of federal and state authority ("federalism"). Specific topics include the Supreme
Court's power to overturn actions by political agents; Congress's authority to make laws governing matters
not mentioned in the Constitution; Congress's power to strip the courts of authority to decide certain issues;
states' power to resist the decrees of federal courts; the president's emergency powers; and war-making
authority of both the president and Congress. Most of the reading consists of Supreme Court opinions, but
some reading and much discussion will address historical context. Recurring issues include the extent to
which the Court does and should heed the framers' intent; the extent to which the Court does and should
take into account public opinion and other political considerations; and the significance of John Marshall's
famous but somewhat cryptic admonition: "we must never forget that it is a constitution we are expound-
ing."

PSCI 217(S) Constitutional Law II: Rights
Constitutional Law II explores constraints imposed on governmental power by a system of civil rights.
Areas examined include equal protection, due process, freedom of speech and religion. Within these and
other broad doctrines, countless specific controversies arise. Those we address include abortion, same-sex
marriage, affirmative action, flag-burning, and the death penalty. Much of the reading consists of Supreme
Court cases, but we will also pay close attention to the broader context surrounding these cases. A recurring
question is the relevance of the Court's undemocratic nature. Should the Court see itself as a tribune of the
powerless, which must restrain the political branches or, alternatively, should it generally defer to the
people's elected representatives? A closely related question involves the extent to which the Court should
confine the rights it protects to those specifically listed in the Constitution. Finally, to what extent do and
should judges consult their moral or even political views, as opposed to undertaking a more objective,
apolitical or distinctly "judicial" analysis, in reaching decisions?

colonies; imperialism and the so-called Spanish-American war of 1898; the Panama Canal; and the Good
Neighbor Policy. The middle part of the course will concentrate on the Cold War period, considering how
enduring economic interests and new strategic priorities shaped the U.S. response to leftist movements and
regimes in Guatemala, Cuba, Chile and Nicaragua, as well as the role of human-rights concerns in
policymaking. The final part of the course will discuss, in historical perspective, the main issues that have
arisen with the end of the Cold War: trade and investment, drugs, immigration, "post-modern" guerrilla
movements, and the embargo on Cuba.

PSCI 228(F) International Organization
Today global politics is frequently conducted in and around numerous international organizations (IOs).
Some claim that international organizations represent a new form of government, supplanting states and
civic communities, while others argue that they simply serve as fronts for the most powerful national gov-
ernments and private interests. In truth, some international governmental organizations (IGOs), like the
WTO and some UN agencies, do have the power to regulate and govern the behavior of states, while oth-
ers, like the UN's General Assembly, mainly cajole or shame. Some nongovernmental organizations
(NGOs), like the Red Cross or Amnesty International, play key roles in making international law and in
providing life-saving services to individuals; others, like the World Association of Esperantist Vegetarians,
have little influence. This course examines the historical background, theoretical perspectives and practical
issues relating to the role IOs play across a wide variety of issues, including peace and security, human
rights, and economic development, emphasizing the development of international norms and values and
how they are embedded in these institutions and bureaucracies.

PSCI 229(S) Global Political Economy
Thirty years ago the production, distribution, consumption and accumulation of goods, services and capital
were predominantly national, organized by nation-states and within national territories. Today they all are
increasingly global in scope, and nation-states find themselves more and more the subjects of mobile
transnational corporations, international trade tribunals, global currency markets and natural resources
cartels than their masters. All of these developments have direct and far-reaching effects on the power of
states, the wealth of societies, and the life chances of billions of people around the world. This course offers
a broad introduction to the politics of global economic relations, emphasizing the inherent and inseparable
intertwining of politics and economics, power and wealth, the state and the market. It begins with a short
overview of liberal, economic Nationalist, Marxist and green theoretical traditions (including Smith,
Keynes, List, Marx, Polanyi and others) and a study of the emergence of the contemporary global order.
We will examine both global trade and global finance, along the way focusing on important issues of
current interest including free trade and the WTO, the spread of transnational corporations, dollarization,
international labor standards, and uneven development.

PSCI 232(S) Modern Political Theory (Same as Philosophy 232)
The dominant moral, political and social theoretical framework associated with the Enlightenment gener-

specifically, is markedly different from that of the Ancients. It is arguably the framework within which
most debate in the West still occurs. Yet while (or perhaps because) it constitutes something of a shared
horizon, the framework itself is often simply taken for granted. The project of this course will be to make
the parameters of much contemporary thought explicit by tracing the development of the tradition to which
we are in large part heir. Class will involve careful reading and critical discussion of works by Hobbes, the
Levellers, Locke, Rousseau, Kant, Hegel and Mill.

PSCI 236T(S) Social Capital (W)
"Social capital" refers to the distinctively human resources and social relations that characterize a given
polity. Social and political theorists since Pierre Bourdieu and Alexis de Tocqueville have advanced argu-
ments about the source and value of social capital and how it is best sustained and developed. Contempo-
rary thinkers continue this discussion, arguing about whether and why civic engagement is important, how
civic spaces and civil society might be rejuvenated, and democracy "deepened." This course offers a criti-
cal exploration of the issues and questions that attend the idea of social capital. We begin by looking at the
origins of thinking about social capital, in the political theory of Bourdieu, de Tocqueville, and Antonio
Gramsci, and then turn to more recent debates about the value of social capital and a renewed civil society.
We will read works by such thinkers as Robert Putnam, Sidney Verba, Iris Young, and Cass Sunstein, as
well as writers associated with communitarianism and "third way" politics. Finally, we will critically inter-
rogate the social capital thesis from the standpoint of questions about gender and culture.

PSCI 247(S) Political Power in Contemporary China*
The People's Republic of China presents us with two grand political narratives: socialism and democracy.
In the Maoist era, a distinctive understanding of socialism, which claimed to be a more genuine
democracy, brought hope and, ultimately, tragedy to hundreds of millions of people. In the post-Mao era,
Chinese politics has been driven by the need to redefine socialism in the wake of the world-historic
calamities of the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution and, more recently, the end of the Cold
War. The state cannot simply give up the socialist myth because without it the rationale for Communist
Party hegemony evaporates. But China's rulers cannot avoid political reform, both ideological and
Political Science
­ 267 ­
institutional, because to do so heightens the legitimacy crisis born of Maoist failures. Within this context
has emerged the contemporary Chinese democracy movement which, in all of its complexity, looks to both
socialist discourse and Western practice to create a new politics that checks tyrannical abuses of state
power and engenders a civil society. What is Chinese democracy now? What are its prospects and what is
its relationship to the ideas of socialism?

PSCI 253(S) Japanese Politics*
Japan's politics are unique. Its culture and people are thoroughly Eastern, yet its institutions were designed
in the West; it comfortably shares the ranks of the greatest powers, yet its history is unlike theirs. This
course examines the politics and policies of contemporary Japan. We survey the core political institutions
of the postwar era, examine patterns of political interaction, and investigate current policy debates. The
1990s were marked by numerous political changes at various levels in Japan, including the introduction of
a new electoral system, a shift from one-party rule to coalition government rule, bureaucratic breakdown,
and extreme volatility in economic policy outcomes. This course investigates the significance of these
changes and identifies enduring patterns. The latter half of the course focuses primarily on the puzzle of
how Japan's political-economic structures and policies, which were successful for so long, have proven to
be so disastrous as of late. Throughout the course, students will be encouraged to think about Japanese
politics in a comparative context, and to consider the functioning of the Japanese political system within
the framework of more theoretical debates in political science. No prior knowledge of the broader theoreti-
cal literature is assumed or expected, however.

porary war on terrorism and neo-conservative revolution join a long line of events-wars, assassinations,
economic disasters, bombings-equally radical in their break from the past. But has policy really changed?
This course starts with competing theories and explanations that can inform us about ongoing and persis-
tent themes in American policy. Questions (and there are a lot of them) posed include: Is there a trade-off
between security and morality? Is America a truly exceptional nation? What does the U.S. mean when it
talks about enlarging democracies? What should the country's role in the world be? These questions pre-
ceded the Cold War and are still with us in the 21st century. Case studies will include the ideology of mani-
fest destiny, the Mexican-American War, and the Spanish-American War alongside specific incidents such
as Munich, Pearl Harbor, the Tonkin Gulf Resolution, and September 11th. Students will be challenged to
think where they stand on these issues and contemplate what future policy America should follow.

PSCI 266(F) Politics of Humanitarian Intervention
Humanitarian concerns have become increasingly bound up with our traditional understanding of security.
With the recent exceptions of Iraq and Afghanistan, the great powers have, since the Cold War's end, en-
gaged their combat missions directly and primarily to end humanitarian disaster and gross human rights
abuse. Yet failures both of intervention (in Somalia) and of nonintervention (in Rwanda) have made this
practice controversial for the military, foreign policy decision-makers, and the public. This course address-
es the when, where, why and how of humanitarian intervention by looking at competing theories, and in-
terlocking factors such as ethnic conflict, sovereignty, and state failure in the context of the expanding role
of international norms, laws and institutions, which have developed since World War II and the Holocaust.
The cases to be discussed include Bosnia, Kosovo, Somalia, Rwanda, Haiti, Democratic Republic of the
Congo, East Timor and Sierra Leone.

PSCI 268(F) U.S. and the Two Koreas*
As the staging-ground for the collision between the great powers, the Korean peninsula has been a pivotal
geopolitical area in modern history. Since the creation of a diplomatic relationship with the Korean king-
dom in 1882, the United States has been long and deeply involved in the historical changes that influenced
the fate of Korea as a country. With the end of the Cold War and the new threat of international terrorism,
the U.S. involvement in the foreign policy decisions of the Korean peninsula is far more critical today than
in the past. The main goal of this course is to introduce students to the complexities of U.S. relations with
both North and South Korea. This will involve surveying the historical background, and examining the key
issues and challenges the countries face today. Is the U.S. responsible for the division of Korea and the
delayed democratization in South Korea? Can the U.S.-South Korean military alliance survive another
fifty years? Despite military threats from the North, why have South Koreans become increasingly critical
of U.S. policy? Is "regime change" the best way for the U.S. to resolve the North Korean nuclear crisis and
make the country safer from terrorism? Will North Korea disappear in the near future? Using the perspec-
tives of the U.S. and the two Koreas, this course explores these topics to gauge the undercurrents that affect
US-Korean relations.

In social science research, clear rules govern how to choose cases, how to infer causation, and how to
recognize and assess disconfirming evidence. This course teaches those rules. Every week, students learn,
apply, and evaluate a research technique. We discuss how to state a researchable question and how to
determine what counts as an answer to that question. We consider what constitutes valid evidence, how to
identify and evaluate alternative explanations for the same event, and how to separate coincidence from
cause. Students do interviews, surveys, archival research, case studies and field studies. The course
assumes no statistics although students will have to (gasp) multiply; instead, our focus is on the issues
involved in conceiving and executing a research project in the social sciences.
Format: lab. Requirements: weekly papers applying a method or research problem to a topic chosen by the

This course explores the issues and problems of putting feminism into practice. What constraints and
opportunities confront feminists as they struggle for social change? What are the sources of and limits on
their power? How and when do they choose to compromise and negotiate, or object and fight? How are
these issues represented in the culture through the press, through other media, through art? We will
examine issues such as organizational dynamics, budgetary and administrative constraints, client-staff
interactions, power and dependency, and mother-child-family relationships. We will also look at artwork
about social issues; activist in nature, and critique imagery from ads to websites that portray women in a
range of manners. Students do fieldwork at community agencies involved in health care, social services,
and work. A variety of interactions with these organizations are encouraged, ranging from administrative
and service work to public art projects that might raise awareness of feminist issues in the community.
Format: discussion. Requirements: 1) Students intern at community agencies. These internships require a
minimum of 4 hours per week. The internships are to begin the first week of class--OR total at least 48
hours during the semester. 2) Weekly response papers of 1-2 pages are expected; these will relate the
worksite to the issues and readings of each week; the questions to be addressed will be posed week by

From the Founding to the present, the American political order has undergone incredible, cataclysmic and
thoroughgoing transformations, yet has also proven to be remarkably enduring. How can this be? Where
and how has the country's political history been stable? What accounts for the timing of upheavals? Who
or what causes them? What sorts of transformations have been possible? Finally, what are the costs of
change (and of continuity)-and who pays them? The goal of this tutorial is to gain an understanding of the
country's continuity, along with the impulses behind its transformative episodes, especially in the state's
relation to society and to the economy. When does the state protect property and liberty? When does it
prioritize equality? We look at what led to the civil rights movement, how women won the right to vote,
and why rights-denying and discriminatory legislation and practices persist. We also read about the social
and economic decisions of particular leaders, such as Franklin D. Roosevelt, who, some argue, succeeded
in building the modern welfare state at the cost of a vibrant democratic party politics. Last, we look at
arguments that America as a whole, and throughout its history, has been "exceptional" and unlike other
countries, as well as critiques of these arguments, to help us gain an understanding of future possibilities for
political change.

PSCI 315(S) Parties in American Politics
Political parties have played a central role in extending democracy and organizing power in the
United States, yet their worth is a continuing subject of debate. In one ideal formulation, parties not
only link citizens to their government, they also provide the coherency and unity needed to govern
in a political system in which power is widely dispersed. But there is also an American tradition of
antipathy toward parties. They have been criticized for inflaming divisions among the people and
for grid-locking the government. For others, political parties fail to offer citizens meaningful
choices; the Republican and Democratic parties are likened to a choice between "tweedledee and
tweedledum." This course will investigate this debate over parties by examining their nature and
role in American political life, both past and present. How have the parties changed over time?
Throughout the course, we will explore such questions as: What constitutes a party? For whom do
they function? Why a two-party system, and what role do third parties play? Is partisanship good or
bad for democracy? For governance? And, in the age of technology and mass communications, are
parties still relevant?

During the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln asked if constitutional government was forever destined to be
either too strong for the liberties of its people, or too weak to protect itself. Since the terrorist attacks on
September 11th, 2001, Americans are once again asking this question. Waged both at home and abroad,
the "war on terror" raises some of the oldest and most fundamental questions in American constitutional
interpretation; indeed, it raises issues that speak to the nature of constitutional government as such. Who
has the constitutional authority to declare and wage war? How does the Constitution apply in wartime?
Might war justify extraconstitutional action? What are the relationships among international law, the laws
of war, and the Constitution?

PSCI 327(S) The Global Politics of Development and Underdevelopment (Same as

Consider a photograph of the Earth at night taken from space. What will you see? Great agglomerations of
light in some parts of the world (North America, Western Europe, parts of East Asia) contrasted with vast
expanses of darkness in other parts (much of Central and South America, Southeast Asia and nearly all of
Africa). This pattern of light and darkness depicts a vastly unequal global distribution of technology, urban
infrastructure, capital accumulation--in short, the global patterns of development and underdevelopment.
These areas are connected through commodity chains, capital mobility, migration, political authority and
the natural environment. So why are some areas light and other dark?
This course focuses on the global factors influencing development and underdevelopment,
political-economic connections across national borders, and the intersections of power, production and
nature. We cover topics such as theories of development and industrialization, urban-rural relations, urban
bias in development policy, industrial agriculture, global agricultural trade, food security and hunger,
international development organizations (WTO, World Bank, UNCTAD, Food and Agriculture
Organization), peasant rebellions, `resource wars,' sustainable development and `eco-imperialism'.

"gendered" nature of political concepts and categories, and examine the place occupied by women within
mainstream political theory. Some questions we address include: Does inequality in the private and social
realms reflect public and political forms of inequality, and vice versa? How should we explain differences
and inequities between men and women: by invoking biological factors, or by pointing to social and
historical explanations? Is there a unified conception of "woman" which can ground these generalizations
and secure a common basis for political solidarity? And can we make general claims about women's and
men's lives and differences without negating important differences in terms of race, ethnicity, class, and
sexuality? In addition to surveying the development of different contemporary feminist
perspectives--such as liberal, socialist, radical, and postmodern feminist views--we will examine the
application of these arguments to particular issues in theory and practice: reproductive choice and new
reproductive technologies, pornography, body image, motherhood, and prostitution.

that underpin claims about globalization in East Asia, and empirically investigate the ways that states have
responded to globalization at the local, national, and regional levels in a number of issue areas (e.g., securi-
ty, economics, politics, culture, and the environment). We will also pay attention to the hurdles the region
faces in realizing its collective objective of meeting the challenges of globalization, comparing in particular
its historical legacy with that of Europe. What factors account for the similarities and differences in political
and economic development across East Asian countries? What roles do political culture, legacies of colo-
nialism, and authoritarianism play when examining regional cooperation and identity transformation in
East Asia? We will examine how crises have affected the balance between state and society while simulta-
neously deepening regional cooperation among actors in the region.

PSCI 347(S) Korea's Democratization*
Various theories purport to explain democratization and its effects. This course uses the politics of the Ko-
rean Peninsula as a testing-ground for these contending theories. Before the 1997 Asian financial crisis,
South Korea was widely regarded as among the leaders of the so-called "third wave of democracy. " It
attained a rare but exemplary success, as it achieved both spectacular economic growth and political lib-
eralization. Yet recently there have been an increasing number of intellectual and political debates both
inside and outside the country on whether the country can cope with the consequences of further political
and economic "maturation." Since South Korea has, in recent history, toppled authoritarian military re-
gimes and built one of the most affluent economies, this course will also examine the ways Koreans them-
selves think of what democracy means. As we tack back and forth between democratization theories and
the Korean experience, we will pursue the following topics: national identity, the unabated tension between
ethnic conceptualization and civic order, civil society before and after the anti-authoritarian movement, the
rise and fall of the minjung ideology, developmental state vs. crony capitalism, women and male-oriented
politics, nationalist, anti-American, and pro-North Korean youth in Korea, segewha movement in response
to globalization, and selective co-option of overseas Koreans.

Between Cuba and the U.S. there is a long and deeply felt history of dependence and conflict. After the
collapse of the USSR, Cuba entered a deep economic depression and in response, began a decade-long
"special period" that has combined new repression with an opening to religious practice, and strong official
protection of the social "conquests of the Revolution" with a vigorous popular pursuit of the Yankee dollar.
Where is Cuba headed? Can the U.S. do anything constructive at this juncture? This course examines
Cuba's relationship with its often troublesome and demanding neighbor to the north, from José Martí and
1898 to the present. Materials include journalism, official pronouncements of the Cuban revolutionary
regime, travel accounts, polemics by émigrés, policy statements of the U.S. government, and a wide range
of academic works. In the first week the entire class will meet once for lecture and discussion on Cuba's
colonial political economy. In the next ten weeks we will consider ten themes. In the final week we will
discuss the twelfth theme, the future of Cuba, in another meeting of the entire group.
Format: tutorial (The posted class hour will only be used for meetings in the first and last weeks of classes.).

PSCI 364(F) George Kennan and the Dilemmas of American Foreign Policy (W)
A grand strategist and historian, George Kennan has consistently criticized American foreign policy for its
inconsistencies and contradictions. Most historians, however, have generally viewed Kennan as an intel-
lectual whose own work is characterized by exactly those flaws. It is not hard to see why Kennan repre-
sents such a puzzle to historians. Kennan rose to prominence as a conservative and hostile critic of the
Soviet Union, but for most of the Cold War argued against confrontational policies toward the Soviet
Union. Kennan authored the doctrine of containment in the late 1940's, but spent most of the last fifty years
denouncing the very policies usually justified in the name of containment. Has Kennan been misunder-
stood by both policymakers and historians, or is it the case that Kennan's own philosophy of American
power is either incoherent or contradictory? This seminar examines Kennan's work as both a grand strate-

PSCI 410(F) Senior Seminar in American Politics: The American State
Is globalization eroding the American state? Is the threat of terrorism rebuilding it? Mainstream assess-
ments of the American state have long claimed that it is weak relative to states in Europe and elsewhere.
The class probes this premise and explores how recent trends in the global arena are affecting the American
state. We will assess traditional theories about the weak state in light of the military build-up of the post-
World War II era and the expansion of government services and programs during the New Deal era. Other
topics examined will include the extractive capacity of the state, the state's regulatory apparatus, the growth
of the bureaucratic state, the expansion of the penal system, and the use of the state to regulate home or
"private" life. The first half of the semester will be spent refining our definition of state strength and explor-
ing the normative implications. The second half of the semester will focus on students' individual research
projects. Students will explore an area of state growth and/or decline (e.g., the state as global police, the
state as nation-builder, the state as market-developer) that especially interests them.

This seminar examines whether the war on terrorism and the war in Iraq have fundamentally altered the
trends of globalization that unfolded over the previous few decades. We first read about globalization. We
will not read everything there is to read about globalization; nor will we attempt to survey all theoretical
perspectives on globalization. Rather, we engage several different perspectives to familiarize ourselves
with the major issues. Students write two five-page papers on two of the books we read together. The sec-
ond part of the course centers on individual student research projects. Each student chooses some facet of
the Iraq war or the war on terrorism and, throughout the semester, combs journalistic and academic sources
for information. Each student makes a presentation to the class on the topic of his or her research and,
finally, each writes a 20-page research paper engaging the question of how that particular aspect of the war
on terrorism or the war in Iraq has influenced larger processes of globalization.

PSCI 420(S) Senior Seminar in International Relations: American Hegemony and the Future

Since the time of Thucydides, world politics has often been a story of several great powers competing for
power, wealth, and security. The collapse and dissolution of the Soviet Union, however, left the United
States in a position of dominance that has no parallel in history. This course examines how international
relations theorists and American policymakers have grappled with the dilemmas and opportunities of
global hegemony since 1989, with a particular focus on the challenges that have emerged in the aftermath
of September 11. Will other powers, such as China or a united Europe, inevitably challenge American
dominance? Should America actively seek to promote its ideas and values throughout the world? Does a
hegemon have unique and special responsibilities for advancing international justice? What kind of grand
strategy should the United States pursue, both now and in the future? Why does so much of the world seem
to resent American hegemony?

able to U.S. foreign policy goals. But how could a country spread freedom? This course explores one of the
best-established answers to this question, tracing the various connections among the ways states obtain
revenue and the ways they act and evolve. It first considers the historical rise of parliamentary liberalism in
England, in contrast to the Continent, and the question whether some kinds of taxation facilitated despo-
tism and others, parliamentarism. It next turns to the current literature on the connection between oil wealth
and authoritarianism. It then considers the influence of creditors, in today's global bond markets, on politi-
cal outcomes, before looking at the question whether foreign aid ought to be conditioned on political re-
form. What is the relationship between markets and democracy?
Format: seminar. Requirements: one medium-length book summary paper, two short reaction papers, a
20-page research project, short oral presentations.
Prerequisites: at least two classes in international or comparative politics. Enrollment limit: 16 (expected:

PSCI 430(F) Senior Seminar in Political Theory: Contemporary Political Thought
This course will offer students the chance to engage with a number of complex, synthetic works of recent
political theory, each of which centers on the question "Where are we, and how did we get here?" All of the
books that we will read are efforts by their authors to assess critically the contours of contemporary thought
by constructing a certain kind of historical narrative regarding the intellectual lineages of the present.
Thinkers whom we may read include Charles Taylor (Sources of the Self), Alasdair MacIntyre (After Vir-
tue), Ellen Wood (Democracy Against Capitalism), Benjamin Barber (Strong Democracy), and Thomas
Spragens (The Irony of Liberal Reason). We may also consider Leo Strauss (Natural Right and History)
and/or Max Horkheimer (Eclipse of Reason).
Format: seminar. Requirements: regular seminar response papers, one midterm essay, and one final re-
search paper.

PSCI 481(F)-W33-482(S) Advanced Study in American Politics
A year of independent study under the direction of the Political Science faculty, to be awarded to the most
distinguished candidate based upon competitive admissions. The candidate, designated the Sentinels of the
Republic Scholar, receives a research stipend to cover costs associated with the proposed project. The Sen-
tinels Scholar may submit her/his essay for consideration for honors in Political Science.
Admission is awarded on the basis of demonstrated capacity for distinguished work and on the proposal's
promise for creative contributions to the understanding of topics on the federal system of government.
Anyone with a prospective proposal should contact the department chair for guidance.
PSCI 493(F)-W31-494(S) Senior Thesis
The senior major, having applied for and been accepted into the honors program during the second semes-
ter of the junior year, will devote the senior year to researching and writing a substantial and original work
of scholarship, under the supervision of a faculty mentor to be assigned by the department. The final work
will be submitted for evaluation by a committee made up of the faculty supervisor and two additional read-
ers to be chosen by the department, in consultation with the supervisor. Thesis writers will not only work
with their advisors but will participate in a weekly honors seminar supervised by a faculty member in polit-
ical science. The seminar (which is one component of the 493-W31-494 designation and not a separate
course) will provide a focused forum for the exchange of ideas among the honors students, who will regu-
larly circulate sections of their theses-in-progress for peer review and critique. The faculty seminar leader's
primary role is one of coordination and guidance.

MAJOR
For the degree in Psychology, students must complete a minimum of nine courses as outlined
below:
1) Psychology 101 Introductory Psychology
2) Psychology 201 Experimentation and Statistics
3) Three 200-level courses, with at least one from each of the following groups.
Group A Psychology 212 Neuroscience
Psychology 221 Cognitive Psychology*
Psychology 222 Cognitive Science*
Group B Psychology 232 Developmental Psychology
Psychology 242 Social Psychology
Psychology 252 Psychological Disorders
Psychology 272 Psychology of Education
*Either Psychology 221 or 222, but not both, can count towards the three required 200-level
courses.
4) Three 300-level courses from at least two of the areas listed below:
Area 1: Behavioral Neuroscience (courses with middle digit 1)
Area 2: Cognitive Psychology (courses with middle digit 2)
Area 3: Developmental Psychology (courses with middle digit 3)
Area 4: Social Psychology (courses with middle digit 4)
Area 5: Clinical Psychology (courses with middle digit 5)
Area 7: Educational Psychology (courses with middle digit 7)
At least one of these courses must be from among those carrying the format designation Empirical
Lab Course.
5) Psychology 401 Perspectives on Psychological Issues
Students who place out of Psychology 101 are still required to take nine courses to complete the major.
The department recommends that students take Psychology 201 in their sophomore year. The depart-
ment requires that 201 be completed by the end of the junior year.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN PSYCHOLOGY
Students who are candidates for honors need take only two 300-level courses from two different areas,
but they must enroll in Psychology 493-W31-494 and write a thesis based on original empirical work.
Presentation of a thesis, however, should not be interpreted as a guarantee of a degree with honors. Guide-
lines for pursuing the degree with honors are available from the department.

es? What is the best way to describe the psychology processes by which children gain information and
expertise? What accounts for individual differences in learning, and how do teachers (and schools) address
these individual needs? How do social and economic factors shape teaching practices and the educational
experiences of individual students? The course will draw from a wide range of literature (research, theory,
Psychology
­ 277 ­
and first hand accounts) to consider key questions in the psychology of education. Upon completion of the

PSYC 316(S) Clinical Neuroscience
Diagnosing and treating neurological diseases is the final frontier of medicine. Recent advances in neuro-
science have had a profound impact on the understanding of diseases that affect cognition, behavior, and
emotion. This course provides an in-depth analysis of the relationship between brain dysfunction and dis-
ease state. We will focus on neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's dis-
ease, and Huntington's disease. We will consider diagnosis of disease, treatment strategies, as well as social
and ethical issues. The course provides students with the opportunity to present material based upon: (1)
review of published literature, (2) analysis of case histories, and (3) observations of diagnosis and treatment
of patients both live and on videotape. All students will design and conduct an empirical research project.
Format: Empirical Lab Course. Evaluation will be based on position papers, class participation, and re-
search project report.

PSYC 317T(S) Nature via Nurture: Explorations in Developmental Psychobiology
Do your genes determine who you are? This course examines the relative contributions of nature (genetics)
and nurture (the environment) to the development of behaviors such as eating, stress response, learning,
play, aggression, parenting, alcoholism, drug addiction, schizophrenia and depression. Modern neurosci-
ence techniques, such as brain imaging, "knock-out" mice, and quantitative trait loci mapping, report ex-
traordinary new relationships between genes and behavior. In contrast to these findings are equally innova-
tive studies on the critical effects of the pre- and postnatal environment and the social milieu which support
environmental causation of behavior. This tutorial will evaluate theoretical and methodological issues in
the scientific literature to arrive at a synthetic understanding of the epigenetics of behavior. Each tutorial
pair will design and conduct an empirical project that will explore their own experimental question about
the interaction of genes and environment.
Format: tutorial and empirical lab. Requirements: Students will meet in pairs with the instructor for an hour
each week. Each week, students will either present an oral argument of a 5-page position paper or respond
to their partners' paper. Empirical projects will be presented in a poster session at the final meeting.
Prerequisites: Psychology 212 or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Preference
to neuroscience concentrators and psychology majors.
Satisfies one semester of the Division III requirement.

PSYC 325(S) Psychology of Language
Language plays a central role in our lives and is the primary manner in which we communicate our experi-
ences and views of the world with one another. In this course, we ask several fundamental questions about
the psychology of language: Are all languages essentially the same or different? What is the relationship
between language and thought? How are concepts represented by language? Why do children learn lan-
guages so effortlessly? To what extent is language a special cognitive system? What are the biological
foundations of language? We will address these questions by critically reviewing classic and contemporary
literature concerning language comprehension and production, with emphasis given to experimental tech-
niques researchers have used to study language. All students will design and conduct an empirical research
project.
Format: Empirical Lab Course. Requirements: a series of weekly1- to 2-page response papers, participa-
tion in class discussion, written and oral reports of empirical research.

PSYC 332(S) Cognitive Development
In this course we consider how mental abilities, such as language, memory, thinking and imagination de-
velop during the childhood years. We begin by asking how infants, who do not have language, make sense
of their world and how language, once acquired, changes the way children understand their world. We
study how children remember events, both every day and traumatic, and how memory relates to narratives
about the self. We examine the development of thinking, reasoning, and imagination (e.g. pretend play,
imaginary companions) and their intersection with related topics, such as children's ability to distinguish
between fantasy and reality. Throughout these discussions, we consider the impact of biology (e.g. changes
in the brain) and culture on cognition, as well as the similarities and differences in the cognitive abilities of
normally-developing children and children with developmental problems (e.g., autism). All students will
design and conduct an empirical research project.
Format: Empirical Lab Course. Requirements: two short (6-8 page) papers, and a written/oral report of
final research project.
Prerequisites: Psychology 232 or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 20 (expected: 14). Preference

How do we know what children know, what they feel, and what they do? This course provides students
with direct experience with children and the approaches used to investigate the world of childhood.
Through observation and interaction with children, we discover how they develop social skills, sex roles,
emotions and emotion control, and self-knowledge. All students will design and conduct an empirical re-
search project.

Why do we define adolescence as a distinct stage of development? What are its perils and
accomplishments? What internal and external forces make adolescence such a volatile and formative stage
of life? The course considers a range of empirical and theoretical material, as well as fiction and film, in
order to identify and understand the behavior and experience of adolescents. Topics include: identity,
sexuality, romantic love, intellectual growth, family relationships, psychological problems, education, and
variation between cultures.
Format: seminar. Requirements: two exams and a final paper. There are three 1-page response papers with
feedback, a 5- to 7-page midterm, and a final project that involves 20-25 pages of writing, with several sets
of feedback and revision.

PSYC 340(F) Cultural Psychology*
This course focuses on how the self and culture mutually constitute each other. Major theoretical and meth-
odological issues in cultural psychology, including distinguishing cultural psychology from cross-cultural
psychology and approaches to studying cultural differences, will be examined. We will review and discuss
research on conceptions of the self and cultural variations in psychological processes from a social psycho-
logical perspective. Material will be drawn from work that includes North American, East Asian (primarily
Chinese and Japanese), and Asian American cultural contexts. Specifically, we will also explore the im-
plications of a culturally grounded or informed psychology (e.g., consequences for psychological well-be-
ing). Students should be prepared to read, discuss, and critically analyze empirical research.

PSYC 346(F) The Psychology of Self-Esteem
In the first psychology textbook ever published, William James (1890) argued that a tendency to strive to
feel good about oneself is a fundamental aspect of human nature. Since then, the topic of self-esteem has
been the focus of a great deal of research, with some investigators arguing, like James, that humans are
"self-esteem machines," driven by an insatiable need for positive self-regard, and others challenging this
notion. The goal of this course is to explore current and classic research on the psychology of self-esteem,
including a consideration of the many ways in which individuals manage to think more highly of them-
selves than the objective evidence warrants, the consequences--both positive and negative--of such high
self-regard, and how cultural variables affect self-esteem.
Format: seminar. Requirements: daily thought papers, several short papers, and a final term paper.

PSYC 349(F) Automatic Thoughts, Feelings, and Behavior
Even as you read this course description, your thoughts and perceptions are guided by invisible forces. In
fact, many psychologists would argue that most of your life is governed by automatic processes that oper-
ate outside of conscious awareness. This course will focus on the nature and influence of these automatic
phenomena and the research methods used to assess them. As such, we will look at automatic attitudes in
domains ranging from prejudice to romantic relationships. We will examine how cues in the environment
can unwittingly lead us to pursue nonconscious goals. We will look at memories that idle just below the
surface of consciousness but which still exert an influence on behavior. Each topic is inextricably linked to
a provocative but well-substantiated view of human understanding: that we fail to understand the forces
guiding even our own beliefs and decisions. The course is designed to teach students the knowledge and
skills needed to conduct their own research in this field.

maintenance of peer difficulties, short- and long-term consequences, and intervention and prevention pro-
grams. A variety of research methodologies and assessment strategies will be considered. All students will
design and conduct an empirical research project based on the concepts discussed, to be critiqued through-
out the semester.

PSYC 355(S) Psychotherapy: Theory and Research (W)
Psychotherapy is a young, barely 100-year old psychological endeavor which attempts to promote change
and healing through social interaction. How can it be that talking with a psychotherapist can help people
change and how exactly does it help people achieve relief from psychological problems? We will study
various approaches to psychotherapy by examining the theories and scientific research that surround them.
This will be accomplished by a close reading and critical analysis of primary source theoretical papers, the
"raw data" (videotapes and transcripts) of therapy sessions, case studies, and contemporary empirical re-
search on the outcomes and change processes of psychotherapy. Students will learn how to evaluate the
efficacy claims of both standard and new therapies and claims about the mechanisms by which those thera-
pies work. Current controversies in psychotherapy and psychotherapy research will be will be addressed
and debated.
Format: seminar. Requirements: active class participation, four 5-page position papers and two oral class
presentations based on these, final term paper in the form of a grant proposal outlining an important ques-
tion for psychotherapy research, reviewing the extant literature, and proposing a study to address these
questions.

Over the lifespan there are stable differences between individuals in mood--such as differences in how
irritable, optimistic or anxious a person feels on average. We will investigate the origins, hypothesized
functions, and consequences of the major moods, consider how mood tendencies inform personality, and
explore what is known about both conscious and unconscious influences on mood. Readings will include
theoretical articles, empirical reports, and several detailed case studies. Both pathological and normal
mood will be considered. Attention will be given to contemporary evolutionary, biogenetic, cognitive, be-
havioral and psychodynamic theory and research, with particular emphasis on integrative models that in-
corporate all of those perspectives.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: class participation, brief weekly assignments including one or
more brief presentations, two exams, and an end-of-term research proposal. Prerequisites: Psychology 201.

PSYC 372(F) Advanced Seminar in Teaching and Learning
This advanced seminar will give students an opportunity to connect theory to practice. Each student will
have a teaching placement in a local school, and participate in both peer and individual supervision. In
addition, we will read a range of texts that examine different approaches to teaching, as well as theory and
research on the process of education. What is the best way to teach? How do various theories of children
and pedagogy translate into everyday practices with students? Students will be encouraged to reflect and
modify their own teaching practices as a result of what we read as well as their supervision. Questions we
will discuss include: What is the relationship between educational goals and curriculum development?
What is the relation between substance (knowledge, skills, content) and the interpersonal dynamic inherent
in a classroom setting? How do we assess teaching practices, and the students' learning? What does it take
to be an educated person?
Format: seminar. Requirements: This course involves a field placement, weekly readings, as well as semi-
nar discussion, supervision, 2 5-page papers and a 20-page final paper.
Prerequisites: Psychology 232 or Psychology 272 or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 19 (ex-
pected: 15). Preference given to Psychology majors and those who plan to become teachers.

MAJOR
The major in Religion is designed to perform two related functions: to expose the student to the methods
and issues involved in the study of religion as a universal phenomenon of psychological, sociological, and
cultural/historical dimensions; and to confront students with the beliefs, practices, and values of specific
religions through a study of particular religious traditions. It is a program that affords each student an op-
portunity to fashion his/her own sequence of study within a prescribed basic pattern constructed to ensure
both coherence and variety. It consists of at least nine semester courses as follows:
Required sequence courses
Religion 101 Introduction to Religion
Two seminars (courses numbered 200, 301-309)
Religion 402 Issues in the Study of Religion
Elective courses
Five additional courses in Religion are to be selected in such a way that at least one course is taken in
both the Western and non-Western traditions. Students will construct their sequence in consultation with
departmental advisors and subject to their approval. In order to achieve a deep coverage of a particular
religious tradition or set of related problems in the study of religion, students are urged to select three elec-
tives that together have some kind of coherence, be it cultural, historical, or topical. Related courses from
other departments or programs may be included among the three courses, and the point of coherence can
be the subject of research papers in the senior seminar.
Students are advised to elect additional courses in related fields (e.g., psychology, sociology, anthropolo-
gy, art, history, philosophy) in order to gain a clearer understanding of the social and cultural contexts in
which religions appear.
For those who wish to go beyond the formally-listed courses into a more intensive study of a particular
religious tradition, methodological trend, or religious phenomenon (e.g., ritual, symbol-formation, mysti-
cism, theology, etc.), there is the opportunity to undertake independent study or, with the approval of the
department, to pursue a thesis project.
The value of the major in Religion derives from its fostering of a critical appreciation of the complex
role religion plays in every society, even those that consider themselves non-religious. The major makes
one sensitive to the role religion plays in shaping the terms of cultural discourse, of social attitudes and
behavior, and of moral reflection. But it also discloses the ways in which religion and its social effects
represent the experience of individual persons and communities. In doing these things, the major further
provides one with interdisciplinary analytical tools and cross-cultural experience and opens up new ave-
nues for dealing with both the history of a society and culture and the relationships between different soci-
eties and cultures. What one learns as a Religion major is therefore remarkably applicable to a wide range
of other fields of study or professions.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN RELIGION
The degree with honors in Religion requires the above-mentioned nine courses and the preparation of a
thesis of 75+ pages with a grade of B+ or better. A thesis may combine revised work done in other courses
with new material prepared while enrolled either in Religion 493-W31 or Religion W31-494. Up to two-
thirds of the work in the thesis may be such revised work, but at least one-third must represent new work.
The thesis must constitute a coherent whole either by its organizing theme or by a focus on a particular
religious tradition. Candidates will also be expected to present the results of their thesis orally in a public
presentation. Students who wish to be candidates for honors in Religion will submit proposals and at least
Religion
­ 282 ­
one paper that may be included in the thesis to the department in the spring of their junior year. Students
must have at least a 3.3 GPA in Religion to be considered for the honors program.
The chair will serve as advisor to non-majors.
REL 101(F,S) Introduction to Religion
As an examination of the structure and dynamics of certain aspects of religious thought, action, and sensi-

REL 200(S) Religion and the Modern World
It is impossible to comprehend the modern world without understanding the contribution of religion in the
process of modernization, the cultural condition of modernity and the artistic tradition of modernism. This
course is divided into three parts. We begin by exploring the gradual reconciliation of religion and culture
in leading post-Enlightenment thinkers like Kant, Hegel, Schleiermacher and select Romantic poets. When
art displaces religion as the expression of spiritual aspiration, the traditional transcendent God gradually
becomes identified with immanent social, cultural and psychological processes. Religion comes to be un-
derstood as a human construction created to address specific needs and desires. In part two, we consider
pioneering theorists who establish the relation between religion and economics (Marx), biology (Darwin),
society (Durkheim) and psychology (Freud and Nietzsche). The work of these theorists frames the ques-
tions that the current study of religion is designed to answer. A study of the intricate relationship between
modernization and secularization draws together the first two parts of the course and prepares the way for a
consideration of the return of the religious in post-modern society and culture (Heidegger, Berger). While
originally defined as a movement in architecture and art, postmodernism emerged during the last half of
the twentieth century as a new social and cultural condition. Rapid technological changes and the econom-
ic and social transformations they brought created uncertainties and instabilities, which had unexpected
consequences. Far from inevitably leading to secularism, modernization created the conditions for the re-
turn of religion in a variety of guises. The course concludes with a consideration of alternative postmodern-
isms and their corresponding religious expressions in the work of Venturi, Lyotard, Baudrillard, LaHaye
and Derrida.
Requirements: midterm and final papers.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 30 (expected : 30). Preference given to first-years and sophomores.

THE JEWISH TRADITION
REL 201(F) The Hebrew Bible (Same as Classics 201, Comparative Literature 201 and
201)
The Hebrew Bible is perhaps the single most influential work in the history of Western philosophy, litera-
ture, and art. But the overwhelming presence of the text in nearly every aspect of modern culture often
obscures the sheer brilliance of its narrative technique as well as the complex interplay between law, histo-
ry, prophecy, and poetry. This course offers a comprehensive introduction to the literary, historical, and
theological aspects of the Hebrew Bible with an eye towards developing a sophisticated understanding of
the text in its ancient context. Through the close reading of substantial portions of the Hebrew Scripture in
translation and the application of various modern critical approaches to culture and literature, students will
explore fundamental questions about the social, ritual, and philosophical history of ancient Israel, as well as
the fundamental power of storytelling that has resonated across two millennia.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, short written assignments, and
two longer papers.
No prerequisites. No enrollment limit (expected: 25). Open to all.
Hour: 11:20-12:35 TR DEKEL
REL 203(S) Introduction to Judaism (Same as 101)
What is the relationship between modern notions of Jewish identity, thought and practice and the Hebrew
Bible? How does the modern Reform movement link itself to the laws of the rabbinic sages? Are there
consistent values and ideals that mark Jewish moral thought throughout its history? What elements of the
Jewish tradition have enabled its elasticity and historic persistence? By providing an introduction to the
traditions of Jewish thought and practice through the ages, this course will take up these questions. Though
the course's method of progression will be primarily chronological, commencing with myths of Israel's
beginnings and culminating with contemporary debates over Jewish identity, we will additionally empha-
size the strong ties between methods of Jewish thought and practices and the surrounding cultural environ-
ments in which they developed. We will approach the tradition not only with historical concerns, but with
literary and philosophical aims as well. We will analyze the interpretive strategies, theological presupposi-
tions, and political aims that accompany the tradition both in its continuities and its ruptures. Finally, we
Religion
­ 283 ­
will consider the extent to which we can speak of Judaism under the category of religion, considering as
well the other categories that have been proposed for Judaism, Jews and Jewishness, such as nation,
people, race and ethnicity, and the motivations behind such designations. Texts will include the Hebrew
Bible, Holz (ed), Back to the Sources; Halbertal, People of the Book; Mendelssohn, Jerusalem; Hertzberg
(ed), The Zionist Idea; Levi, Survival in Auschwitz as well as excerpts and articles available in a course
packet.
Format: lecture/discussion. Assignments will include participation in class discussion, periodic response

REL 206(S) The Book of Job and Joban Literature (Same as Classics 206, Comparative
Literature 206 and 206) (W)
The Book of Job has often been described as the most philosophical book of the Hebrew Bible. The story
of one man's struggle to understand the cause of his suffering and his relationship to God represents the
finest flowering of the Near Eastern wisdom literature tradition. Through its exploration of fundamental
issues concerning human suffering, fate and divinity, and the nature of philosophical self-examination, Job
has served as a touchstone for the entire history of existential literature. At the same time, the sheer poetic
force of the story has inspired some of the greatest artistic and literary meditations in the Western tradition.
This course will engage in a close reading of the Book of Job in its full cultural, religious, and historical
context with special attention to its literary, philosophical, and psychological dimensions. We will then pro-
ceed to investigate key modern works in several genres that involve Joban motifs, themes, and text both
explicitly and implicitly. These texts will include Franz Kafka's The Trial, Archibald MacLeish's J.B.,
Robert Frost's "Masque of Reason," Carl Jung's Answer to Job, and William Blake's Illustrations to the
Book of Job. All readings are in translation.

REL 209(S) Slavery and Women in Early Christianity and Ancient Judaism
Would you like to learn about the most marginal early Christians and ancient Jews? Many of these were
enslaved. Most of us think of slavery as one category and gender as another, separate category. But in the
highly stratified societies in which early Christians and both Greek-speaking and early rabbinic Jews lived
and taught, whether persons were enslaved or not usually shaped their life experiences more than their
gender. But beyond that, both enslaved and slave-holding women experienced both slavery and their
womanhood in unique ways. In this seminar, we will intersect gender analysis with status analysis (i.e., of
one's legal status as enslaved, freed, or free) of early Christian texts, such as the New Testament, the apoc-
rypha, canon law, sermons, and biblical interpretation and of such Jewish texts as Josephus, the Mishnah,
papyri, and inscriptions. You will learn to analyze religious teachings in the light of the complex identities
of the Christians and Jews hearing them.
Format: seminar. Requirements: active class participation, including posting once per week on the course's
Web site, one brief paper to be presented in class (5-6 pages), and one longer research paper (10-12 pages).
Students able to read the Greek or Hebrew texts may substitute work in a collateral reading group for the
short paper.

Christianity in the Western world has undergone numerous challenges since the early eighteenth century.
Many thinkers have turned inward, developing pietistic theologies compatible with the modern world,
while others have searched for an adequate expression of Christianity after the "Death of God." Another,
remarkably resilient strand has actively turned against the Enlightenment in ironic ways, appropriating
modern technologies, for example, while repudiating scientific discoveries that undermine their belief.
This course will examine these issues, along with a careful consideration of the way gender, identity, and
community have come to play a powerful role in contemporary expressions of Christian belief.

NORTH AMERICAN RELIGIONS
REL 225(F) Religions of North America
Scholars have written much about the history of religion in North America, but the effort has been fraught
with many oversights. Recent scholarship has begun to take account of the fact that most religions in North
America either did not emerge from European sources, or have existed long before the arrival of Euro-
peans. Indeed, many religions have grown out of the American soil during the past several centuries-what
some would call the product of religious "cross-fertilization," and what others would deem as religious and
cultural thievery, i.e. colonialism. This course follows a modified historical trajectory, one that strives to
allow the voices of forgotten "others" to speak, bringing questions of colonialism, identity, and the impor-
tance of religious community to the forefront.

THE SOUTH-ASIAN TRADITIONS
REL 240(F) Hindu Traditions*
Whether or not the implied unity of the term "Hinduism" reflected existing conditions on the South Asian
subcontinent when it was first coined in the nineteenth century, the idea of an all-embracing "Hinduism" or
"Hindu religion" has now long been in use in self-recognized Hindu communities around the world. This
course will introduce students to the historical emergence of two contemporary Hindu traditions. We shall
first consider the Hinduism of modern-day Bali, in which doctrine and practice have been articulated in
terms of Indonesian state-bureaucratic regulations regarding the nature of "legitimate" religion. We shall
then examine the emergence of "Hindu nationalism" in contemporary India and the rise of the Bharatiya
Janata Party. In each case, special attention will be paid to the representation of tradition and alterity, as well
as to the deployment of both scriptural and other modes of authority. The course will offer an overview of
broadly western scholarship on Hinduism, and the ways in which scholars have engaged with each of these
two Hindu traditions.

This introductory course examines Buddhism from a double perspective. On the one hand, it studies the
tradition descriptively, examining some of its religious, philosophical, historical and sociological aspects.
On the other hand, this course also seeks to bring out the personal relevance of Buddhist ideas, ensuring
that they are not just considered as objects but also as partners in an ongoing conversation. We start by
examining the Theravada tradition of South and South-East Asia through which we seek to understand
some of the basic Buddhist ideas such as no-self, suffering and its origin, and the possibilities for freedom.
We then move to the Indian and Tibetan Mahayana traditions, which are characterized by an increase in the
importance of compassion on the basis of the bodhisattva ideal. In dealing with Buddhism in Tibet, we
focus more particularly on the tantric aspects of its tradition. Throughout the course, we are careful to
consider Buddhism not just as a set of thought provoking ideas that can be studied in abstraction from their
implementation, but as being based on socially inscribed practices. We examine a broad range of practices,
ranging from so-called popular rituals to the practices of virtuosi. In particular, we examine meditation in
the Theravada and Tibetan Tantric traditions. In this way, we gain a realistic appreciation of the nature, role
and difficulties of such a practice, and dispel some of its misunderstandings.

discourses and practices which construct ideas about the body, purity and pollution, and the nature of male
and female. These discourses involve a disciplining of the body and sex through the use of moral codes,
ethics, social institutions, ritual practices, and popular culture. This course also addresses post-colonial and
post-structuralist debates about how class, caste, and race cut across the universality of gender as a
category.

REL 272(S) Mass Media and Religious Violence*
Both religion and violence are often attributed in scholarly and popular discourse to a given society's fail-

assumption that modernity equals secularity, and that religion is at best a private matter, or (more common-
ly)--like violence--a residual to be explained away in terms of socio-political or economic factors. Orga-
nized around a series of media sessions lectures and discussions, this course will examine specific conflicts
and outbreaks of violence as represented in mainstream Euro-American and Southeast Asian mass media,
with a special emphasis on their respective assumptions regarding the nature of religion and religious dif-
ference. Students will consider critically the extent to which modern mass media are crucial to--or even
constitutive of--public understandings of religion-related violence as well as the path to resolution.

debates? And what might be the implications of exporting Euro-American understandings of oppression
and progressive politics to Asian and African contexts? This course will challenge you to think critically
about the nature of power and the possibility of resistance and/or subversion. Although the course is ethno-
graphic in nature--focusing on examples from Egypt, India, Indonesia and the United States--our discus-
sion will be driven by a series of critical questions to which we shall return each week in addressing our

REL 287(S) The Dynamics of Globalization: Society, Religion and the Environment (Same as
Environmental Studies 287)
Recent events have demonstrated the importance of religion in the contemporary world. What is perhaps
less obvious is the reason for this role, which is often misconceived as a return of the past. This course
provides a different picture by examining the social, cultural and environmental dynamics of globalization
and their consequences for religion. We begin with a general investigation of globalization and raise
questions such as: What is the nature of globalization and its relation to (post)modernity? Is it a new
phenomenon? What are the cultural dynamics that globalization favors? What are its consequences for the
exercise of power? What are its environmental consequences? We then shift to religion, arguing that its
renewed relevance is a function of globalization and the transformations that the latter brings about. We

REL 302(S) Religion and Society: The Production of Conflict or Consensus?
This course offers a sustained inquiry into the nature and role of religion in society. We will consider a
fundamental question: how and why does religion produce conflict or consensus. Throughout, we will
examine how and why one major form of religious activity--ritual--can produce both social solidarity
and collective violence. We consider a variety of theoretical approaches that define and critique the nature
of ritual activity including Durkheim, Bourdieu, Geertz, Turner, Lincoln, and Tambiah. These analytical
frameworks will be applied to several ethnographic examples from the Himalayas and South Asia in
which ritual functions as social drama or political spectacles. Subsequently, we will pursue the recent inter-
section of religion and violence in South Asia and their colonial and historical antecedents. We will address
current events in India including several outbreaks of Hindu-Muslim riots and the controversial practice of
self-immolation to illustrate and analyze the ritualization of collective violence.

FRENCH
MAJOR--French Language and Literature
The French major seeks to provide training in literary and cultural analysis and linguistic expression
through the study of selected texts from the French-speaking world. Emphasis is placed on the changes in
form and subject matter from the early modern period to the contemporary era.
The major consists of nine courses above the 103-104 level with optimally one course each from the
following areas:
1) Poetry and Poetics
2) Prose Narrative and Fiction
3) Theatre and Dramatic Literature
4) Thematics, Special Topics, Survey Courses
Students must also take a 400-level capstone seminar which may count toward any of the four re-
quired areas.
Students entering the major program at the 109/110-level may, with the permission of the Department,
choose as part of their major program, one course in Art History, History, Philosophy, Comparative Litera-
ture or other subjects that relate to and broaden their study of French. Students
entering the major program at the 200-level may, in some cases and with the permission of the Department,
include two such courses in their major program.
Working with the major advisor, the student will formulate a curricular plan that will ensure balance and
coherence in courses taken. Such balance and coherence will be based on the above areas of literary and
cultural investigation. Prospective majors should discuss their program with the major advisor by the end
of their sophomore year. This is especially imperative for students who are planning to spend a part or all of
their junior year in France.
Romance Languages
­ 289 ­
Inasmuch as all courses in French assume the active participation of each student in discussions con-
ducted in the foreign language, regular attendance at class meetings is expected.
MAJOR--French Studies
The major in French Studies is an interdisciplinary program that provides students with the opportunity
to acquire skills and knowledge embracing the cultural, historical, social, and political heritage of France
and the Francophone world. The program allows for an individualized course of study involving work in
several departments and the opportunity to study abroad.
Students electing the French Studies major should register with the French Studies faculty advisor dur-
ing their sophomore year. At that time they should submit a feasibility plan that articulates their projected
program.
The French Studies major consists of ten courses satisfying the following requirements:
1) at least two courses in French language and/or literature above the French 103 level;
2) a senior seminar;
3) Electives: The remaining courses needed to complete the major must be drawn from at least three
different departments and relate primarily to an aspect of the culture, history, society, and politics of France
and the Francophone world. These courses will be selected in consultation with members of the Depart-
ment of Romance Languages. Appropriate electives might include:
History 331 The French and Haitian Revolutions
Religion 301 Psychology of Religion
All courses in French literature and language above the 103 level.
In addition, students should take at least two non-language courses that are taught in French.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN FRENCH
Two alternative routes are available to those who wish to apply for the degree with honors.
The first of these involves the writing of a senior thesis. Honors candidates are required to devote to their
theses two semesters of independent study (beyond the nine courses required for the major) and the winter
study period of their senior year (493-W31-494). The thesis will be written in French and will usually be in
the range of from forty to sixty pages. Candidates are expected to submit thesis proposals in May of their
junior year. By the end of the first semester of the senior year, students will normally have finished the
research for the thesis. By the end of the winter study period, candidates will submit to the department an
outline and rough draft of their work. At this time, the student will make a presentation of his project at a
departmental colloquium. The thesis will be discussed and evaluated to determine whether or not the stu-
dent should continue in the honors program. The second semester of independent thesis work will be spent
revising and rewriting the thesis. The completed dissertation in its final form will be due at the end of April.
The second route is a group of three clearly related courses (offered by the Department of Romance Lan-
guages or by other departments, such as History, Art, Philosophy, English, etc.), only one of which may be
counted in the nine courses comprising the major. One of the courses will be an Independent Study (plus
senior year WSP 030). At the end of the spring semester the student will write an essay that synthesizes the
content of the three related courses. Students may apply for this route by November 2 of the senior year.
In the case of both routes to the degree with honors, the department's recommendation for graduation
with honors will be based on the originality and thoroughness of the finished project.
THE CERTIFICATE IN FRENCH
The Certificate in French Language and Cultures consists of a sequence of seven courses for which the
student must earn a cumulative grade average of B or higher. In addition, the student must take a proficien-
cy test and achieve a score of "Advanced." The test will be administered by the department once a year
during the month of April to all students desirous of obtaining the Certificate. Those interested should ex-
press their intent to the chair of the department by March 1 or earlier.
For students with no prior French background, the course sequence will consist of French 101-102,
French 103 and 104, and three courses in French above the 104 level, with at least one of these courses
at the 200-level or higher taken at Williams. If the student starts out the sequence at French 103, in addition
to the three courses in French beyond the 104 level (including a 200-level course or higher), two electives
may be taken in other departments. One elective should be in French or Francophone cultural history (art,
literature, drama, music) and the other in French or Francophone intellectual, political or social history.
See French Studies Major description above for list of possible electives in other departments.
PLACEMENT
A placement test in French is administered at Williams at the opening of the fall semester. Incoming
first-year students who register for any French course above the 101-102 level must take this test, regard-
less of their previous preparation.
STUDY ABROAD
French majors are strongly advised to complete part of the requirements for the major by studying
abroad either during the academic year or the summer. Most American study-in-France programs require
applicants to have completed a fifth-semester, college-level French course (French 105, for example) be-
fore they go abroad. A special affiliation with the Hamilton Junior Year in France program enables Wil-
liams students (who have completed 105) to participate in a comprehensive academic and cultural experi-
ence in a French-speaking environment. Credit for up to four courses towards the major can be granted at
Romance Languages
­ 290 ­
the discretion of the Department: normally 2 major credit for one semester and up to 4 major credits for a
full year or two semesters. The final assignment of credit will be authorized in consultation with the stu-
dent's major advisor once the student has returned to Williams. Such credits can only be determined by
review of course format, course materials, and evidence of satisfactory academic performance. Students
interested in studying abroad need to consult with faculty members in French by the second semester of
their first year. Early planning is essential. Because the academic quality of certain programs of study in
France may well be beneath the pedagogical standards normally associated with a Williams education,
students will receive major credit for only those programs recommended by the Department. Please con-
sult a faculty member to find out which programs are acceptable. Normally, the Department does not ad-
minister proficiency exams (for study abroad) to any student who has not completed a French course at
Williams.

The goal of this course is to build on the writing, reading, and aural comprehension skills in French devel-
oped at the elementary and intermediate levels (specifically those of French 103). The course will consist
of a continued review of fundamental grammar structures, but will emphasize the application and assimila-
tion of those structures in activities of composition, oral presentation, and discussion. Textual resources will
be drawn from literary and cultural settings and will be used to develop basic analytical skills in French.
Conducted in French.

LITERATURE COURSES
RLFR 109(F) Introduction to French Literature: Laughter and Despair
Through an organized web of obsessions, this course will introduce students to some seminal moments of
French literature and culture. In the face of human misery and futility, the writers selected respond in a
multiplicity of ways, ranging from despair to laughter. The course will gravitate around dialectically op-
posed though not exclusive notions such as seriousness and frivolity (frivolous seriousness, serious frivol-
ity), depth and superficiality, being and appearance, the Court and the City. By establishing connections
between the various genres and periods, the course will show how the reading of one text infects and en-
hances our understanding of another. Readings will include: Villon, Du Bellay, Ronsard, Pascal, Molière,
Perrault, Constant, Flaubert, and Ionesco. Conducted in French.
Requirements: class participation, several short papers, an oral presentation, and an hour exam.
Prerequisites: French 104 or 105 or by placement test or by permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 20

Hour: 9:55-11:10 TR NORTON
RLFR 110(S) War and Resistance: Two Centuries of War Literature in France, 1804-2004
In 1883, Maupassant called on his fellow war veterans and writers to join him in speaking out against
warfare and violence, crying "Let us dishonor war!" From the Gallic Wars against Caesar (during the first
century BC) to France's controversial role in the current "War on Terror" (at the opening of the twenty-first
century), the French literary tradition is rich in texts that bear witness to war and speak out against its mon-
strous inhumanity. While war literature in France can be traced back to ancient and medieval texts on Ver-
cingétorix, Charlemagne, William the Conqueror, and Joan of Arc, this course will focus specifically on
literary representations of war during the nineteenth- and twentieth-centuries, from the Napoléonic Wars,
to the First and Second World Wars, to the Algerian and Cold Wars, and the current "War on Terror." Dis-
cussions will examine the impact of war on soldiers and civilians, patriotism and pacifism, history and
memory; the implications of war as invasion and conquest, occupation and resistance, victory and defeat;
the relationship of war to gender, sexuality, and ethnicity; and the role of war in colonialism and genocide.
Readings to include novels, short stories, and poems by Balzac, Stendhal, Hugo, Rimbaud, Daudet, Mau-
passant, Zola, Cocteau, Wiesel, Duras, Camus, and Fanon. Films to include works by Resnais, Renoir,
Malle, Angelo, Pontecorvo, and Duras. Conducted in French.
Format: seminar. Requirements: active class participation, two short papers, an oral presentation, and a

In this course, we will examine eighteenth-, nineteenth-, and twentieth-century texts in which woman's
destiny is defined in terms of spatial, social, and psychological confinement in mysticism or sexuality, ex-
cluding her from marriage and society. Convents and brothels, schools that teach ambiguous sexuality,
subversion, and revolt, may be more interchangeable than antithetical. Texts include Diderot's La
Religieuse, Prevost's Manon Lescaut, Laclos's Les Liaisons Dangereuses, Mme. de Lafayette's La Com-
tesse de Tende, Mme. de Duras's Ourika, Maupassant's La Maison Tellier, Zola's Nana, Colette's Gigi, and

RLFR 208(S) Fatal Passions and Happy Fools: French Theater in the Age of Louis XIV
(Same as Comparative Literature 208)
The plays of the three great French dramatists of the seventeenth century--Corneille, Molière, Racine--
are mirrors through which a rich tapestry of moral and intellectual issues, notions about art and aesthetics,
Romance Languages
­ 292 ­
social norms and aberrations, and meditations on the human condition are finely woven and exhaustively
reflected. In an age emblematized by the solar absolutism of the "Sun King", comedy and tragedy engage
critical minds in searching questions on what constitutes heroism, duty, fatality, hypocrisy, social conformi-
ty and marginality. No area of literature engages, perhaps, in more sustained interrogation, even subver-
sion, of the stifling authority of Versailles and the Court than do the genres of tragedy and comedy. They
are texts that interpret not only the tragic vision of the individual acting out his or her part in a universe
where the gods remain silent spectators, but also the comic vision of salons inhabited by a typology of
misfits, puffers and fops, the happy fools of gilt and glitter. This course will examine these issues through
some of the masterpieces of dramatic literature from this period, including Corneille's Le Cid and Horace,
Molière's Tartuffe, Le Misanthrope, and Les Précieuses ridicules, and Racine's Phèdre and Andromaque.
These plays will be studied and discussed in the context of French society, art, and the theological, intellec-
tual, and political thought of seventeenth-century France. The performance of certain plays will be ob-
served directly through cinematic productions. Conducted in French.
Format: seminar. Requirements: class participation, two shorter papers, one longer paper, and an oral pre-

Today the countries of North Africa are experiencing rapid social change. Rap music and Britney Spears

those selling their goods compete to be heard over the ringing of cell-phones. Old and new exist side by
side, albeit sometimes very uncomfortably. During the past decade, literature has emerged in both French
and Arabic examining the effects of globalization: unequal modernization, unemployment, cultural change
and cultural resistance. In this course, we will read short stories that address these issues alongside
Moroccan, Algerian and Tunisian newspapers on the web in order to explore contemporary
transformations of life in North Africa. Readings by Maissa Bey, Abdelfattah Kilito, Zeina Tabi, Mohamed
Zafzaf, Ahmed Bouzfour, Soumaya Zahy and Abdelhak Serhane among others. Conducted in French.

RLFR 408(S) Senior Seminar. Desperate Housewives and Extreme Makeovers: Novel
Approaches to the Nineteenth-Century Novel (Same as Comparative Literature 358)
In 1834, Balzac wrote that "Paris is a veritable ocean. Sound it: you will never know its depth." The same
can be said of the French nineteenth-century novel and its boundless ability to echo the historical past and
reverberate in the cultural present. Desperate housewives, sex in the city, queer eyes for straight guys, and
extreme makeovers fill the pages of the nineteenth-century novel. From the Romanticism of Stendhal and
Hugo, and the Realism of Balzac and Flaubert, to the Naturalism of Maupassant and Zola, the novel be-
came an extraordinary forum for examining illicit sexuality, institutional misogyny, social injustice, crimi-
nal passions, revolutionary struggles, and Parisian pleasures in nineteenth-century France. Characters such
as the imprisoned housewife Emma Bovary, the reluctant revolutionary Jean Valjean, the social-climbing
lover Julien Sorel, the ambitious undergraduate Rastignac, the domestically-abused Gervaise, and the
man-eating courtesan Nana became synonymous with France's turbulent social and political landscape
from the 1830s to the 1880s. And as recent film adaptations make clear, these characters continue to haunt
our twenty-first century present. Reinterpreted by such contemporary actors as Gérard Depardieu, Isabelle
Huppert, Uma Thurman, Claire Danes, and Jennifer Aniston, the nineteenth-century novel continues to
sound out the scandalous and sensational depths of our own century. Readings to include novels by Balzac,
Stendhal, Flaubert, Maupassant, and Zola. Films include adaptations by Renoir, Lelouch, Christian-Jaque,
Clément, Berri, August, and Chabrol. Conducted in French.

emphasis on comprehension of the spoken language. Students interact with taped materials and submit
written compositions on a regular basis.
The class, which meets five hours a week, is conducted entirely in Italian.
Evaluation will be based on chapter tests (50%), a final exam (20%), completion of workbook and lab
manual exercises (20%), and classroom attendance/participation (10%).
Students registered for 101-102 are required to attend and pass the sustaining program during the winter
study period. Credit granted only if both semesters are taken.
Enrollment limit: 22. The course is not open to those who have had one year or more of high school Italian.
Instructor will prioritize on the basis of study abroad plans and year at Williams.

RLIT 103(F) Intermediate Italian
This course reviews and builds on vocabulary and structures studied in first-year college-level Italian. As a
means to this end, students will engage in text-based grammar-review drills in meaningful context; and
will read short stories, excerpts of a contemporary novel, and non-literary texts dealing with current issues
in Italian society.
Evaluation will be based on classroom participation, completion of assigned exercises, and a combination
of chapter tests, and a final exam.
Prerequisites: Italian 102 or equivalent. Enrollment limit: 25 (expected: 15).

SPANISH
The Spanish major consists of nine courses above the 103-104 level. These nine courses include 301,
any 200 level or above (excluding RLSP 205 and RLSP 303), and 403. One 200-level course must be
completed at Williams. Other courses, taken at overseas programs, may be used to satisfy the requirements
of the major, with approval of the department. The Spanish faculty strongly suggests that students take 201
and 200 at some point in their studies, and especially recommends that they do so before rather than after
studying abroad.
The major seeks to provide training in literary analysis and linguistic expression, as well as an appreci-
ation of Hispanic civilization, through the study of the major writers of the Spanish-speaking world.
Students majoring in Spanish may replace one of their Spanish electives with a course in Comparative
Literature, with one course in Latin-American Studies that is 200-level or higher, or with a course in Lin-
guistics.
Romance Languages

Inasmuch as all courses in Spanish assume the active participation of each student in discussions con-
ducted in the foreign language, regular attendance at class meetings is expected.
Courses numbered in the 100s are language courses, with 105 and 106 combining grammar and litera-
ture. RLSP 200 and RLSP 201 focus on civilization and culture, while other 200-level classes serve as
gateway courses for literary study, in ascending order of difficulty; they are thus suitable for first-years and
sophomores. Courses in the 300s require both serious grounding in the study of literature and an advanced
command of the language. The 400-level course offered annually is the senior seminar, serving as "cap-
stone course" to the Spanish major.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN SPANISH
Candidates for a senior thesis must have maintained a 3.5 GPA in the major by the time of proposal
submission. Two alternative routes are available to those who wish to apply for the degree with honors.
The first of these involves the writing of a senior thesis. Honors candidates are required to devote to their
theses two semesters of Independent Study (beyond the nine courses required for the major--and the win-
ter study period of their senior year (493-W31-494). The thesis will be written in Spanish and will usually
be in the range of from forty to sixty pages. Candidates are encouraged to submit thesis proposals in May
of their junior year. By the end of the first semester of the senior year, students will normally have finished
the research for the thesis. By the end of the winter study period, candidates will submit to the department a
completed first draft of their work. At this time, the student will make a presentation of his project at a
departmental colloquium. The thesis will be discussed and evaluated to determine whether or not the stu-
dent should continue in the honors program. The second semester of independent thesis work will be spent
revising and rewriting the thesis. The completed dissertation in its final form will be due at the end of April.
The second route is a group of three clearly related courses (offered by the Department of Romance
Languages or by other departments, such as History, Art, Philosophy, English, etc.), only one of which
may be counted in the nine courses comprising the major. One of the courses will be an Independent Study
(plus senior year WSP 030) in the spring of the senior year, at the end of which the student will write an
essay that synthesizes the content of the three related courses. Students may apply for this route by Novem-
ber 2 of the senior year.
In the case of both routes to the degree with honors, the department's recommendation for graduation
with honors will be based on the originality and thoroughness of the finished project.
THE CERTIFICATE IN SPANISH
The Certificate in Spanish Language and Culture consists of a sequence of seven courses for which the
student must earn a cumulative grade average of B or higher. In addition, the student must take a proficien-
cy test and achieve a score of "Advanced." The test will be administered by the department once a year
during the month of April to all students desirous of obtaining the Certificate. Those so interested should
express their intent to the chair of the department by March 1 or earlier.
For students with no prior Spanish background, the course sequence will consist of Spanish 101-102,
Spanish 103 and 104, and three courses in Spanish above the 104 level, with at least one of these courses at
the 200-level or higher taken at Williams. If the student starts out the sequence at Spanish 103, in addition
to the three courses in Spanish beyond the 104 level (including a 200-level course or higher), two electives
may be taken in other departments. One elective should be in Spanish or Latin-American cultural history
(art, literature, drama, music) and the other in Spanish or Latin-American intellectual, political, or social
history. Spanish 200, 201, or 208 can be counted for the elective requirement.
List of possible electives in other departments:
Anthropology 215 The Secrets of Ancient Peru: Archaeology of South America
Anthropology 216 Native Peoples of Latin America
ArtH 200 Art of Mesoamerica
History 242 Latin-America from Conquest to Independence
History 243 Modern Latin America, 1822 to the Present
Political Science 349T Cuba and the United States
Other electives may likewise be considered as departments create new courses. However, students should
consult with the chair of Romance Languages before making any enrollment decisions.
PLACEMENT
A placement test in Spanish is administered at Williams at the opening of the fall semester. Incoming
first-year students who wish to register for any Spanish courses above the 101 level must take this test.
STUDY ABROAD
Spanish majors, as well as non-majors interested in further exposure to the language and the culture, are
strongly encouraged to include study in Spain or Latin America as part of their program at Williams.
Through its special ties with the Hamilton College Academic Year in Spain, the department offers a com-
prehensive linguistic and cultural experience in a Spanish-speaking environment, for periods either of a
semester or a year. Credit for up to four courses can be granted at the discretion of the Department for study

RLSP 201(F) (formerly 111) The Cultures of Spain
Linguistically, culturally, and historically, the Iberian peninsula bears the traces of the past civilizations that
once inhabited the land. Iberians, Celts, Phoenicians, Greeks, Carthaginians, Romans, Visigoths, Arabs,
and Jews have all been instrumental in shaping the modern nation and the contributions of these groups are
the starting point in any understanding of Spain's rich cultural heritage and traditions. Cultural diversity in
contemporary Spain reflects at once the distinct autonomous regions which constitute the socio-political
fabric of the country, such as Catalonia and the Basque Country, and also patterns of migration both within
and beyond the European Union. In this course we will examine and consider Spain past and present. We
will study periods of tolerance and cultural brilliance, such as the co-existence of Arabs and Jews in Medi-
eval Cordoba, as well as censorship and repression, brought about by the institution of the Inquisition, for
example, or during the Franco Regime. Materials will include representative works from literature, art,
architecture, music, and film. Secondary texts providing essential socio-political and historical context will
be supplied. Conducted in Spanish.
Requirements: active participation in class discussions, an oral presentation, several short writing assign-
ments, a midterm and a final. Prerequisites: Spanish 105, permission of instructor, or results of the Wil-

RLSP 208(S) The Spanish Civil War in Literature and Film
The Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) has generated a vast bibliography and filmography that to this day
reflect widely antagonistic interpretations of the conflict itself, its roots, and its impact. From the Spanish
perspective, the war is the most important single event in understanding modern Spain. The ideals,
passions, and consequences of the Spanish Civil War still divide Spaniards and have been recreated and
relived by writers, artists, and filmmakers, and debated by historians. The course will begin with a
historical introduction to the origins, development, and outcome of the war. Was the Spanish war a national
struggle or an international struggle played out on Spanish soil? Along with studying internal Spanish
political divisions, we will also consider the impact of the foreign policy positions of other
countries-including Germany, Italy, the United States, and Russia--vis-a-vis Spain, as well as the role of
the thousands of foreign volunteers who formed the International Brigades and came from all over the
world to fight against Franco. With this historical basis, we will see how the themes and issues of the war
are reflected in Spanish poetry, short fiction, novels, and films from the time of the war up through the
present day. Readings will include works by Ayala, Cernuda, Neruda, Goytisolo, Sender, Fernan-Gomez,
and Matute. Films will include documentaries as well as classic and contemporary features.Conducted in
Spanish.
Evaluations will be based on lively class participation, an oral report, short written assignments, and two

readings from prose and poetry) to provide us with a dynamic and critical understanding of the theme of
love as constructed by the greatest dramatists and authors of the period. Works by Lope de Vega, Tirso de
Molina, Calderón, Cervantes, San Juan de la Cruz, and others will show us how the theme was treated
from diverse perspectives, and how it related to key concepts such as honor, religion, and artistic creativity.

RLSP 306T(S) Latino Writing: Literature by U.S. Hispanics (Same as Comparative Literature
302T) (W)*
Writing by U.S. Hispanics constitutes a new voice in American letters. In this tutorial, we will read and
discuss work by U.S. Latinos and examine the social backgrounds to their texts. The experiences of im-
migration and assimilation, and the specific complexities of being both Hispanic and North American will
be addressed. Authors to be studied: Jose Antonio Villarreal, Tomas Rivera, Richard Rodriguez, Sandra
Cisneros, Rudolfo Anaya, Piri Thomas, Edward Rivera, Oscar Hijuelos, Cristina Garcia, and historical
texts by Carey McWilliams, and Rodolfo Acuna. Given the absence of a critical consensus around these
recent titles, our task is to gain some sense of their common traits as a tradition, and place them within the
larger body of literature of the Americas and the world. The tutorial will examine one work or set of au-
thors per week. A student will bring, written out in full, an oral presentation focusing on the artistic features
and sociocultural content of the assigned reading. Questioning of the presenter, on the part of the second
tutee and the tutor, will follow. The course is designed to accommodate both Spanish and English speaking
students. A student able to read and speak Spanish will be paired with another student of similar proficien-
cy. Students who neither read nor speak Spanish will be paired together. Requirements: five short oral pre-
sentations/papers (about 20-25 minutes) and a final longer one (about 40-45 minutes). Prerequisites: some
previous course work in any literature beyond the 100 level is helpful. Students selecting the Spanish op-
tion for credit toward the Spanish major must have taken at least one 200-level Spanish course or seek
permission of the tutor.
Tutorial meetings to be arranged. BELL-VILLADA
RLSP 403(F) Senior Seminar: Literature and the City in Latin America*
It is by now considered a mere commonplace to assert that literary production in Latin America depends
upon the city. In this course we will examine how the city as a real, lived space of power and the represen-
tation of the city as a fictional landscape intersect in many Latin American texts. We will pay close atten-
tion to how the city often serves to uphold dominant forms of power as well as appear as a space of com-
munity and resistance. We will also consider how the city is written in relation to nature and the country.
The focus will be broad, spanning from the colonial period (Balbuena, Carrió de la Vandera), through texts
of the early republican period (Sarmiento, Bello), the twentieth century (Güiraldes, Borges, Arguedas) and
the narratives of the last few decades (Eltit, Piglia,Bellatín, the film La ciudad). Conducted in Spanish.
Format: seminar. Requirements: Three papers (8 - 9 pages) and one oral report that explores a cultural
aspect of a particular Latin American city.
Prerequisite: any 300-level course or two 200-level courses or permission of the instructor. Enrollment lim-
it: 14 (expected: 8). Preference given to Spanish majors and students with a background in literature.

LANGUAGE STUDY
The department provides language instruction to enable the student to acquire all four linguistic skills:
understanding, speaking, reading, and writing. Russian 101-W88-102 covers the basics of Russian gram-
mar. Russian 103 and 104 offer additional instruction in grammar and provide extensive practice in reading
and conversation. Russian 201 and 202 aim to develop facility in speaking, writing, and reading.
STUDY ABROAD
The department strongly encourages students desiring to attain fluency in Russian to spend a semester
or year studying in Russia or one of the former Soviet republics. Students generally apply to one of several
approved foreign study programs. Russian 104 or the equivalent and junior standing are normally prereq-
uisite for study abroad.
LITERATURE AND CULTURE IN TRANSLATION
Russian
­ 298 ­
The department regularly offers courses on Russian literature and culture in English for those students
who have little or no knowledge of Russian, but who wish to become acquainted with the major achieve-
ments in Russian literary and cultural history.
THE CERTIFICATE IN RUSSIAN
To enhance a student's educational and professional profiles, the Certificate in Russian offers a useful
tool for using the language in a wide variety of disciplines. The sequence of language and culture courses is
designed to supplement a student's major at Williams by enabling the student to expand his or her knowl-
edge in a related field.
Students who enter Williams with previous training in Russian may substitute more advanced courses
for the 100- and 200-level courses; they can also be exempted from up to two of the required courses.
Thus, in order to earn a certificate a student must take no fewer than five courses (including three language
courses) after enrolling at Williams.
Students must receive a minimum grade of B in each course taken in the sequence. In addition, they
must receive a score of at least 85% on a standardized language proficiency test administered by the de-
partment.

THE MAJOR
The Russian major offers students an interdisciplinary approach to the intellectual and cultural history of
Russia and the former Soviet republics. Students complete the major by combining courses in Russian
language and literature with courses in history, political science, music, economics, and art.
For students who start Russian at Williams, the major requires a minimum of ten courses: Russian
101-102, 103, 104, 201, 202, and 402; one elective in Russian above 202; and two electives from either
Russian courses above 202 or appropriate offerings of other departments.
For students who have acquired intermediate or greater proficiency in the language before coming to
Williams, the minimum requirement is nine courses: Russian 402; one elective in Russian above 203; and
seven other courses selected from Russian courses above 102 and appropriate offerings in other depart-
ments.
Students selecting the major must normally complete Russian 202 or the equivalent by the end of the
junior year. Majors will normally be expected to take the 400-level seminar offered in their senior year,
even if they have previously taken another version.
Examples of appropriate courses in other departments are:
History 140 Fin-de Siecle Russia: Cultural Splendor, Imperial Decay
History 240 Muscovy and the Russian Empire
History 241 The Rise of the Soviet Union
History 440 Reform, Revolution, Terror: Russia, 1900-1939
Russian majors may receive major credit for as many as four courses taken during study abroad.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN RUSSIAN
At the beginning of the second semester of the senior year, students may nominate themselves to candi-
dacy for the degree with honors. By the end of the junior year at the latest, however, they will have estab-
lished in consultation with the department their qualifications for embarking on the project, the pattern of
study to be followed, and the standards of performance.
Students earn a degree with honors by submitting a senior thesis (493-W31-494) of honors quality.

RUSS 203(F) Nineteenth-Century Russian Literature in Translation (Same as Comparative
Literature 203)
Literature provided the primary medium for political, philosophical, and religious debate in nineteenth-
century Russia. It was also one of the major fora through which "Russia" could begin to define itself as a
nation, tied to, but distinct from, Western Europe. For a long time, Russian authors had relied quite heavily
on foreign literary models for inspiration and direction, and it was only in the early part of the nineteenth
century that a specifically "Russian" tradition could be seen to emerge. In addition to its task of introducing
major Russian authors and their creative ideas, this course will seek to examine the rise of Russian litera-
ture as such, its key movements and their proponents, and the recurring theme of "Russianness" and na-
tional identity. Readings by Karamzin, Chaadaev, Pushkin, Gogol, Goncharov, Turgenev, Dostoevsky,
Tolstoy, and Chekhov. All readings will be in English. As part of the Critical Reasoning and Analytical
Skills initiative, this course will focus on developing students' ability to analyze literature objectively and
to interpret literature in both written and oral arguments.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: active class participation, frequent short papers, one oral pre-
sentation, and a final research project.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference to majors in Russian and Comparative
Literature.

RUSS 206(S) Topics in Russian Culture: Feasting and Fasting in Russian History
This course will use the methodology of food history to explore the broader historical, economic, and
artistic conditions that gave rise to Russian culture. We will examine culinary practice as well as the social
context of cooking and eating in Russia. In order to elucidate the important interplay between culture and
cuisine, we will discuss such issues as the domestic roles of women and serfs, the etiquette of the table, the
role of drinking and temperance movements, and the importance of feasts and fasts in the Russian
Orthodox Church calendar. Short stories, memoirs, and cookery books will provide insight into class and
gender differences, cooking techniques, and the specific tastes that characterize Russian cuisine. This class

RUSS 402(S) Images of Childhood in Russian Literature (W)
The manner in which childhood is contemplated, experienced, and represented in Russian literature and
film tells us a lot about what it might be like to grow up Russian. In itself, the term "Russian" can shift in
meaning according to sex, religion, ethnicity, social class, and political affiliation; a consideration with
which children have often been confronted. This course will examine a variety of nineteenth and twentieth-
century works, from poetry to prose, fiction to autobiography, fairy-tales to didactic literature, in which the
experience of childhood is a central concern. We will read works by Pushkin, Tolstoy, Chekhov, Gorky,
Babel, Inber, Tsvetaeva, Pasternak, Schweitzer, and Vasilenko and watch such films as Eisenstein's "Bez-
hin Lea" and Karasik's "Scarecrow." All the primary texts will be read in the original, and class will be
conducted entirely in Russian.

MAN. Assistant Professor: MLADENOVIC.
Science and Technology Studies (SCST) is an interdisciplinary program concerned with science and
technology and their relationship to society. In addition to being concerned with the historical development
and a philosophical understanding of the ideas and institutions of science and technology; Science and
Technology Studies also examines their ethical, economic, social, and political implications.
The role that science and technology have played in shaping modern industrial societies is generally
acknowledged, but few members of those societies, including scientists and engineers, possess any under-
standing of how that process has occurred or much knowledge of the complex technical and social interac-
tions that direct change in either science or society. The Science and Technology Studies Program is in-
tended to help create a coherent course of study for students interested in these questions by providing a
broad range of perspectives. At present, courses are offered which examine the history or philosophy of
science and technology, the sociology and psychology of science, the economics of research and develop-

ment and technological change, science and public policy, technology assessment, technology and the en-
vironment, scientometrics, and ethical-value issues.
To complete the requirements of the program, students must complete six courses. The introductory
course and senior seminar are required and three elective courses are chosen from the list of designated
electives. Students may choose to concentrate their electives in a single area such as technology, American
studies, philosophy, history of science, economics, environment, current science, or current technology,but
are encouraged to take at least one elective in history, history of science, or philosophy. The sixth course
necessary to complete the program is one semester of laboratory or field science in additiontotheCollege's
three-course science requirement. Other science courses of particular interest include Chemistry 110 and
Biology 134.
The program is administered by a chair and an advisory committee of faculty who teach in the program.
Students who wish to enroll normally register with the chair by the fall of their junior year.

A research-oriented course designed to give students direct experience in evaluating and assessing scientif-
ic and technological issues. Students initially study particular techniques and methodologies by employing
a case study approach. They then apply these methods to a major research project. Students may choose
topics from fields such as biotechnology, computers, biomedical engineering, energy, and other resource
development. Students will apply their background of historical, philosophical, and technological perspec-
tives in carrying out their study.

WILLIAMS PROGRAM IN TEACHING
Director, SUSAN ENGEL
The program in teaching is designed to enable Williams Undergraduates to study the ideas, questions,
and practices involved in good teaching at all levels. The program seeks to promote and facilitate an ex-
change of ideas about teachers, learners and schools, within and beyond the Williams campus. The pro-
gram offers a range of opportunities including courses on education, intensive supervised student teaching,
workshops, advising, lecture series, and ongoing peer groups for those who teach. Students may participate
in a variety of ways, ranging from taking one course to a sustained in-depth study of teaching and learning
geared to those who want to become teachers, or educational psychologists. We seek to connect students
with one another, to bring in expert teachers to provide mentoring, and to create links across the curriculum
so that students can see the vital connections between what they study (French, Algebra or Biology for
instance) and the process of teaching those topics to elementary and high school students. The program is
Williams Program in Teaching, Theatre
­ 302 ­
open to any student interested in education and offers opportunities for all levels of interest, including those
who want to find out about certification and graduate study. Students seeking certification through an ar-
rangement with the Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts (MCLA) should consult with Susan Engel be-
fore the end of their sophomore year.
The following provides a sample outline of the sequence of courses and experiences that an interested
student might take
zPsychology 101 Intro to Psych (required for further psychology courses);
zPsychology 232 Developmental Psychology and/or
zPsychology 242 Social Psychology;
zPsychology 272 Psychology of Education;
zPsychology 336 Adolescence;
zPsychology 372 Advanced Seminar in Teaching and Learning
zAt least one Winter Study in an intensive teaching practicum. The major programs are in Berk-
shire County (under PSYC) or in New York City (under SPEC), although other opportunities
may be listed elsewhere in the Winter Study section of the course catalogue.
No specific major is required to participate in the program--although some lend themselves easily to
certification, such as Mathematics, English, Biology, American history, or French, almost all of our majors
can provide the basis of teacher certification. Alternately, students can major in Psychology, take a con-
centration of courses in a different field, and then pursue that content area more intensively in graduate
work.

THEATRE (Div. I)
Chair, Professor ROBERT BAKER-WHITE
Professors: BAKER-WHITE, EPPEL. Assistant Professors: BEAN, JOTTAR*, LIEBERMAN.
Lecturers: BROTHERS, CATALANO. Visiting Lecturers: O'CONNOR§, SEITEL§§. William
Dwight Whitney Professor of Arts and Theatre: BUCKY.
As a reflection of the theatre's historical relationship to literature and the arts, stage production is studied
in the context of the literary and artistic movements which have informed theatrical endeavor. The major in
Theatre emphasizes the collaborative nature of the discipline by drawing upon courses offered by faculty
of the Language, Literature, Music, and Art Departments. Although students will be equipped to proceed
to graduate and professional schools in theatre, the major is primarily directed toward those interested in
studying the theatre as an artistic phenomenon and as an interpretive tool. Because a deep understanding of
theatre requires training and experience with the synthesis on stage, the major includes curricular study of
production and performance, as well as continued participation in departmental stage production.
Williamstheatre, the production arm of the Department of Theatre, operates under the supervision of the
departmental faculty. Major departmental productions as well as laboratory and experimental productions
of all kinds are mounted on the new stages of the '62 Center for Theatre and Dance. Participation in acting
or technical work is open to all members of the Williams College community. Students majoring in
Theatre will be asked to consult regularly with departmental advisors in devising the sequence of courses
and production participation that will constitute their major.
MAJOR
The major in Theatre requires six specific courses, plus three electives as specified below. The specific
courses are:
Theatre 103 Acting I
Theatre 102 Theatre Technologies
Theatre 201 Theatrical Design: Process and Collaboration
One course focusing on Critical Studies/Dramatic Literature taught from within the department and to
be taken in first two years (prospective majors should consult with department chair for a list of ap-
propriate courses)
Prospective theatre majors should attempt to complete the above four courses, in no particular order, by the
end of sophomore year.
Theatre
­ 303 ­
The remaining two specific courses are:
Theatre 301 Junior Seminar
Theatre 401/402 Independent Senior Practicum
Students must also take three electives from the department's other offerings, and at least one of these elec-
tives must be drawn from each of the two categories "Theatre Scholarship" and "Theatre Practice."
Theatre Practice: courses where students learn the basic artistic skills of theatre practice through creative
endeavor. (Examples: Acting, Scenic Design, Lighting Design, Costume Design, Directing.)
Theatre Scholarship: courses where students employ critical skills through research and reflection focused
on the traditional canon or on selected more recently defined subject areas. (Examples: Approaching Per-
formance Studies, Contemporary Play and Performance Analysis, Theatre History, Classical Drama,
Modern Drama, Shakespeare, African American Drama, Performance and the Law).
Courses which mix modes of inquiry between the above categories may be counted in either; in any case,
majors should consult with the department chair to assure an adequate distribution of electives.
The department strongly recommends that students elect additional collateral courses in dramatic litera-
ture taught by the English, Classics, and modern language departments, and courses in opera taught by the
Music Department. Students with an interest in theatre design should particularly elect Art Studio courses
in drawing.
Production requirement for the major: All majors in Theatre are required to participate in a minimum of
eight department productions in addition to the laboratory requirement for Theatre 102. Participation in at
least three of the eight must be in technical production, and one must be in stage management. Assignment
to productions is normally made in consultation with the department chair.
Theatre majors are strongly urged to include dance and fencing in fulfilling their Physical Education
requirements.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN THEATRE
Candidates for Honors will apply for admission through the submission of a portfolio to the Department
Chair by February of their junior year, as well as a description of their proposed project. The portfolio will
be comprised of four parts:
1. The first part will include a list of the courses students have taken relevant to their work towards the
major. This list will include courses offered by the Theatre Department, but may also include classes
taken in other Departments. Students should also list and describe relevant independent studies and
production credits.
2. The second part of the portfolio will include a selection of materials developed for these courses and
productions listed in Part 1. The selection should include at least three papers or samples of other
written work, and might also include design projects, director's notebooks, studio art projects, actor's
journals or other forms of documentation of the candidate's work. For students who have taken a
semester away, it is particularly important that they provide the Department with a detailed picture of
their activities while studying off-campus. Course descriptions and syllabi should be submitted in
addition to a list of courses taken and activities performed.
3. The third part of the portfolio is an annotated bibliography of dramatic texts which the student has
read, drawn from a list supplied by the Department. Annotations should be based upon a particular
angle of engagement with the text, that reflects the area or areas that the student has chosen to empha-
size in their theatrical training. For instance, one might choose to write from the point of view of an
actor, a designer, a director, a playwright, or a dramaturg.
4. The portfolio should conclude with a retrospective essay that reflects on the materials that are being
submitted. Students should look for connections between the various aspects of their work, state any
theoretical positions that they have come to embrace, assess their strengths and weaknesses, and dis-
cuss their educational goals for their work with the Department during their Senior year.
The portfolio will be examined alongside the student's record and his or her project description; a deter-
mination will then be made as to admission into the Honors program. Students intending to apply for Hon-
ors should meet with the Department Chair by the end of the fall semester of their junior year. Once a
student is admitted to the Honors program, the department Chair will assign an Honors Project Advisor,
who will work with the student to specify a timeline and work program for the completion of the Honors
Project. At a minimum, this will entail enrollment in Theatre 493 or 494, plus W32, plus one other course
offered either within the department or elsewhere that the candidate and thesis advisor designate as contrib-
uting specifically to the overall goals of the honors work. This honors elective may not fulfill any other
portion of the Theatre Major, or any other major the student may be pursuing. All honors candidates will
present their completed projects to the Department Honors Committee for evaluation. Honors candidates
are exempt from the senior project in theatre (THEA 401/402).
THEA 102(S) Introduction to Theatre Technology
As an overview of performance spaces, play technologies, and production, the course will examine how
and where plays are performed, produced, and designed. Students will attend lectures, participate in labs in

combination of lecture, discussion, and individual/group projects. Text and music will be analyzed in ways
that help clarify how a designer develops a point of view while solving the practical needs of production.
All aspects of design-scenery, lighting, costume, and sound- will be explored with particular emphasis on
how these elements synthesize and contribute to the larger intellectual, emotional, and physical context of
the stage. Basic presentation skills and technique will be taught as crucial elements of design development.
Evaluation will be based upon committed class participation and thoughtful, timely completion of all as-
signments and projects.

Building on the foundation of Theatre 103, students will develop performance skills in the realist tradition,
primarily through intense scene work. Readings will include selections by Stanislavsky, Meisner, Adler, or
similar theorists. Improvisation may be used to explore simplicity, clarity of expression, listening, and
specificity in the actor's task. Focus on the imagination and creation of character will be emphasized
through the scene work. The dramatic literature employed will range from early realist/naturalist classics to
contemporary playwriting. Students will reflect critically on their progress through written and oral cri-
tiques. Scene work will require extensive preparation outside of class.

THEA 205(S) The Culture of Carnival*
Carnival is a regenerative festival as well as a transgressive one. It is a time for upheavals and recreating for
one day, a new world order. Men dress as women, women dress as men, the poor become kings; drink and
sex and outrageous behavior is sanctioned. We will look at festivals in such places as New Orleans, Venice,
and Rio. Central to this course are the cultural and religious lives of these societies, and how these festivals
exist politically in a modern world as theatre and adult play. A variety of sources will be used, such as
newspaper accounts, films, photography, personal memoirs and essays on the subject.
Students will be evaluated on regular active class participation, one oral presentation, one 5-page essay and
one 15-page research paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20. Preference will be given to sophomores and first year students.

nineteenth and twentieth centuries and trace chronologically recent theatre history where representations of
culture have occurred, whether celebratory, derogatory, or indifferent. We will consider work by both
American and international playwrights, directors, and choreographers.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on two papers, one at midterm and a final paper (10
pages); in-class and Blackboard discussions.

THEA 211(F) Topics in African-American Performance: Theatre and Film of the Harlem
Renaissance (Same as American Studies 211)*
From 1919 to 1935, Harlem in New York City was "in vogue." The rate of African-American cultural
production of theatre, film, music and dance was astounding during this period, known also as The Negro
Awakening and the Decade of the New Negro. At the onset of the decade, there were around twenty pub-
lished plays by African-Americans; by the end, the number increased to over eighty. W.E.B. Du Bois, in
his tireless promotion of African-American artists, put out the call for plays to "depict our life, experience
Theatre
­ 305 ­
and humor." The Broadway theatre pieces most often consisted of black musical revues--the precursors to
the American musical--and featured the best black performers of the day in year-long runs. Most revues,
such as Shuffle Along and Blackbirds, featured cakewalk and tap dancing and the music of the jazz age. In
addition, African-American film production companies, makers of "race" films, were flourishing, headed
by the visionary filmmaker Oscar Micheaux and numbering over one hundred by the end of the decade. In
this course, we will explore these cultural productions of the era of the Harlem Renaissance in relation to
their place in African-American performance history. We will consider the fluidity between the forms of
theatre, film, music and dance and also between performance and the thriving literary scene, with lumi-
naries such as Langston Hughes and Zora Neale Hurston, who both wrote plays as well as novels, poetry
and essays.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation: students will be evaluated on the basis of class participation, one
class presentation based on a semester-long research project, and a semester-long research project (15-20
pages).
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 15).

Theatre, film, video, music, dance, visual art, performance art, community activism, public gatherings--all
fall under the rubric of "performance." Performance studies takes on these types of performances in the
name of theorizing performance as a cultural act. This course will serve as an introduction to the field of
performance studies and its theoretical bases in anthropology, dramatic theory, poststructuralism, psycho-
analytic theory, folklore, religion, cultural studies, literary theory, religion, philosophy, feminist theory, and
queer theory. In addition to reading and discussing theory, local live and recorded performances will be
considered. The course will culminate in the showing of students' final projects. This course is the
introductory course for the Performance Studies Program.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class papers and final presentation. Students are also respon-
sible for participating in class.

A study of the art and techniques of stage lighting. This class will provide instruction in the basic physics of
light and color; the use of angle, intensity, color, texture and movement of light as compositional tools;
various kinds of stage lighting instruments and their uses; conceptual development of a lighting design;
translation of concept into light plot and channel hookup; focusing the plot in the theater; and writing cues.
Texts for the course will be the texts and scores of the plays, operas and other dramatic works that we will
examine from the lighting designer's perspective, supplemented with readings that address the technical
aspects of stage lighting. The class format will be a combination of lecture/discussion sessions and
practical labs.
Every effort will be made to provide students with lighting design opportunities on departmental
productions as a part of their coursework, in accordance with students' abilities and interests and in
consultation with directors and other faculty. Students are encouraged to seek out lighting design

more consequentially, music can also constitute the major source of dramatic articulation. In this course we
will study the specific dramatic function of music in such works as Mozart's Cosi Fan Tutte; Wagner's Die
Meistersinger; A Midsummer Night's Dream with incidental music by Mendelssohn; Cocteau's surrealist
work The Wedding On the Eiffel Tower, Brecht's Mahagonny and The Measures Taken; Sondheim's
Sweeney Todd; and Glass and Wilson's postmodern opera Einstein on the Beach. The course will also
study the variety of working relationships that musicians have enjoyed with their collaborators in theatrical

production.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: energetic and committed participation. Written exercises will
be a midterm report on the role of music in a live performance, and a final analytical paper on a work to be
chosen in consultation with the instructor.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20 (expected: 10). No preference.

THEA 397(F), 398(S) Independent Study
THEA 401(F), 402(S) Independent Senior Practicum
All majors in theatre must enroll in the Independent Senior Practicum (401 or 402) in order to complete a
Senior Project. Majors will work with the department chair and the theatre faculty during junior year to
determine the goals and scope of the project, and, when a project is approved, the chair will assign a Project
Advisor, who will then be instructor for the independent study course. Senior projects may be artistic or
scholarly in design and execution, and should grow from students' experience within the curricular and
extra-curricular work in the department. They may build on previous academic achievements, or venture
into new territory, but should be conceived as a capstone experience within the theatre major. Students may
propose collaborative senior projects in groups of two or more. If such projects are approved, students in
such a group will either be assigned one or multiple Project Advisors to oversee the work. In any case, each
senior will be responsible for fulfilling a unique and specific set of requirements for the course as set by the
advisor at the start of the semester. Students accepted into the Honors Program in Theatre are exempt from
the Senior Project requirement.

THE NATIONAL THEATRE INSTITUTE
The Department of Theatre is affiliated with the National Theatre Institute, which offers additional
theatre study through its resident semester program. The Institute is fully accredited by Connecticut Col-
lege and is a member of the Twelve-College Exchange. Limited numbers of Williams students can there-
fore be selected to take a full semester of intensive theatre study at the NTI, located at the Eugene O'Neill
Memorial Theatre Centre in Waterford, Connecticut. During the semester, students from participating col-
leges live and work as members of a theatre company gaining experience with professional theatre artists
in a workshop environment. Early application is essential.
WOMEN'S AND GENDER STUDIES (Div. II)
Chair, Associate Professor KATHRYN R. KENT*** (First Semester)

Women's and Gender Studies can be defined as the study of how gender is constructed, how it is in-
flected by differences of race, ethnicity, sexuality, class, and so on, how gender affects the experiences and
situations of men and women, and how assumptions about gender influence the construction of knowledge
and experience. Scholarship in Women's and Gender Studies has brought neglected material into estab-
lished fields and raised important methodological questions that cross disciplinary boundaries and chal-
lenge established intellectual frameworks. The program in Women's and Gender Studies thus includes
courses from a wide variety of disciplines that focus in a coherent way on gender issues, as well as core
courses that acquaint students with the interdisciplinarity of the field.
THE MAJOR
The Women's and Gender Studies major encourages exposure to the interdisciplinary character of femi-
nist scholarship. In addition, majors are required to gain some knowledge of methods within a field or
Women's and Gender Studies
­ 308 ­
discipline (3 courses in one of the categories listed below), to appreciate the importance of diversity (racial,
sexual, class, ethnic, national, etc.) in scholarship on gender, to gain exposure to feminist theory, and to
pursue work at an advanced level (3 courses at the 300-level).
In order to ensure that students reflect about the paths that they choose through the major, each major
will be assigned to an advisor in the spring of the sophomore year. With the advisor, the student will estab-
lish a revisable course of study for the following two years. Students interested in declaring a major should
contact the chair of the Program (Kent, x2549).
[ ] Courses not offered in 2005-2006 are listed in brackets.
Required Courses
The major consists of at least 9 courses. The following are required:
Women's and Gender Studies 101 Introduction to Women's and Gender Studies

nar explores topics in Women's and Gender Studies, and varies from year to year. Majors may take
more than one seminar, space permitting.)

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN WOMEN'S AND GENDER STUDIES
Honors in Women's and Gender Studies may be granted to majors after an approved candidate com-
pletes an honors project, delivers a public presentation of the work, and is awarded honors by the Women's
and Gender Studies Committee.
The honors project may be fall semester (plus winter study) or a year-long project. It may consist of a
conventional research thesis of 40-70 pages or of other modes of presentation (e.g., art, music, poetry, the-
Women's and Gender Studies
­ 309 ­
ater, fiction). Proposals for non-thesis projects should include evidence of experience and competence in
the chosen mode.
A student may become a candidate for honors in Women's and Gender Studies after the following crite-
ria are met:
1). in April of the junior year, submission and Women's and Gender Studies Committee approval of a 4-
to 6-page project proposal, in which the ideas, aim, general methodology, and preliminary bibliogra-
phy for the project are outlined and a faculty advisor is named;
2). at the end of the junior year, cumulative grade point average of 3.5 from courses taken in the major;
3). in the first week of classes of the senior year, submission and approval by the faculty advisor and
second reader of a 5- to 10-page "Plan of Action" (an overview of what has already been completed
and a schedule of what needs to be accomplished to finish the project). Where appropriate, students
pursuing honors will continue to consult with the second reader over the course of the semester(s).
All honors work, including the public presentation, will be evaluated by the Women's and Gender Stud-
ies Committee. It will decide on the awarding of honors; the advisor will award the grade(s)

CROSS-LISTED COURSES (INCLUDING SEQUENCE COURSES)
WGST 101(F) Introduction to Women's and Gender Studies (W)
This discussion course introduces a range of feminist issues, theories, and controversies. It has several
aims: to provide critical and analytical tools for thinking about gender as it is inflected by race, class, sexu-
ality, and culture; to explore key issues confronting women in American society, and to discuss strategies
for addressing them. The course will examine issues such as: body politics, sexuality, reproductive free-
dom, sexual violence, gender and work, motherhood and family.
Requirements: regular short essays, class presentations, and a longer paper, with revisions. Evaluation will
be based on these assignments and class participation.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 18 per section (expected: 15 per section).
Required course for the Women's and Gender Studies major and concentration.

(See under Art--ArtS for full description.)
WGST 212(S) Ethics and Reproductive Technologies (Same as Philosophy 212) (W)
In her groundbreaking book, The Tentative Pregnancy, Barbara Katz Rothman writes that "[t]he techno-
logical revolution in reproduction is forcing us to confront the very meaning of motherhood, to examine
the nature and origins of the mother-child bond, and to replace--or to let us think we can replace--chance
with choice." Taking this as our starting point, in this course we'll examine a number of conceptual and
ethical issues in the use and development of technologies related to human reproduction, drawing out their
implications for such core concepts as "motherhood" and "parenthood," family and genetic relatedness,
exploitation and commodification, and reproductive rights and society's interests in reproductive activities.
Topics will range from consideration of "mundane" technologies such as in vitro fertilization (IVF), prena-
tal genetic screening and testing, and surrogacy, to the more extraordinary, including pre-implantation
diagnosis (PID), post-menopausal reproduction, post-mortem gamete procurement, reproductive cloning
and embryo splitting, and in utero medical interventions. Background readings include sources rooted in
traditional modes of bioethical analysis as well as those incorporating feminist approaches.
Format: discussion. Requirements: active participation in class discussions, four to five short reflection pa-
pers, and two longer papers ( 5-10 pages).

WGST 402(S) Romantic Love (W)
This course is designed to enable advanced Women's and Gender Studies students to engage in vital re-
search on interdisciplinary topics. Both sexuality, in all its permutations, and "marriage" as a social and
economic institution have been the subject of widespread and intensive scholarship, analysis and theoriz-
ing within women's studies, gender studies, and queer studies. Less strenuously examined is the category
we often turn to to resolve and redeem our ambivalences about both: romantic love. This course will focus
on the concept of romantic love from a variety of disciplinary and interdisciplinary perspectives, including
history, literature, philosophy, anthropology, and psychology. We will look at the development of the con-
cept from its supposed "invention" in twelfth-century France, through its establishment as the only "prop-
er" foundation of marriage in nineteenth-century Britain and America, to the present-day emphasis on
same-sex romantic love as the most compelling reason homosexual couples both need and deserve the
right to marry. Key questions we will consider include: Is romantic love a fundamentally Western concept?
How have our ideas about it been shaped by gender ideology and gender roles? Should we view it as a
genuine ideal? a concept in need of "revisioning"? a dangerous mystification? Students will have wide
latitude in designing individual research projects.
Format: seminar. Requirements for the course include weekly 1- to 2-page critical response essays and one
substantial research paper (15-20) pages.

CRITICAL REASONING AND
ANALYTICAL SKILLS (CRAAS) COURSES
Coordinator, Lecturer KAREN L. SHEPARD
To one degree or another, every class at Williams goes beyond its subject--be it mathematics, Machia-
velli, or modernism--to teach intellectual skills that have wide application in other fields as well as outside
of the academy: scientific reckoning, expository writing, rhetorical analysis, oral presentation, and so on.
Courses offered under the CRAAS initiative foreground such analytical skills. While each CRAAS
class covers a different topic, all are aimed particularly at developing the processes necessary for excel-
lence in a range of fields: techniques for analyzing ideas, data, texts or artworks; approaches to interpreting,
synthesizing, and developing arguments; strategies for presenting ideas and results.
CRAAS classes typically emphasize the practices of meta-analysis--self-criticism, editing, and revi-
sion--with the goal of constant improvement. Many classes feature peer tutoring, small group work, and
intensive one-on-one engagement with the professor. Students should leave a CRAAS course with a sub-
stantially heightened ability to approach problems, analyze texts, and craft arguments in whatever disci-
pline they may go on to explore.
A few CRAAS courses are restricted to advanced students, but the majority are open to all, and some are
specifically targeted for first year students. Most have strictly limited enrollment. Because these classes
cultivate the general strategies of effective scholarship, students are encouraged to consider taking a
CRAAS course early in their academic careers.

PEOPLES AND CULTURES COURSES
The peoples and cultures requirement is intended to help students to begin to understand the cultural
diversity of American society and the world at large, so that, as citizens of an increasingly interconnected
world, they may become better able to respond sensitively and intelligently to peoples of varied social
backgrounds and cultural frameworks. Courses which fulfill this requirement are thus designed to familiar-
ize students with some dimension of American cultural diversity or that of the non-Western world. Each
student must complete one graded semester course primarily concerned with: (a) the peoples and cultures
of North America that trace their origins to Africa, Asia, Latin America, Oceania, or the Caribbean; Native-
American peoples and cultures; or (b) the peoples and cultures of Africa, Asia, Latin America, Oceania, or
the Caribbean. Although this course, which may be counted toward the divisional distribution requirement,
may be completed any semester before graduation, students are urged to complete the course by the end of
the sophomore year.

QUANTITATIVE/FORMAL REASONING COURSES
Williams students should be adept at reasoning mathematically and abstractly. The ability to apply a
formal method to reach conclusions, to use numbers comfortably, and to employ the research tools neces-
sary to analyze data lessen barriers to carrying out professional and economic roles. Prior to their senior
year, all students must satisfactorily complete a Quantitative/Formal Reasoning (QFR) course--those
marked with a "(Q)." Students requiring extra assistance (as assessed during First Days) are normally
placed into Mathematics 100/101/102, which is to be taken before fulfilling the QFR requirement.
The hallmarks of a QFR course are the representation of facts in a language of mathematical symbols
and the use of formal rules to obtain a determinate answer. Primary evaluation in these courses is based on
multistep mathematical, statistical, or logical inference (as opposed to descriptive answers).
Courses that may be used to meet the requirement in 2005-2006:

RELATED COURSE LISTINGS
There are a number of significant areas of studies in which Williams offers many relevant courses, yet
no formal program. To alert students to the opportunity for integrating courses from diverse disciplines into
a focus area and to encourage them to do so, the courses in this section are organized as lists of topic-related
courses. For their full descriptions, see the respective departmental sections.
Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual Studies
Gay, lesbian, and bisexual studies focuses on the social construction of sexuality, past and present. Al-
though, at present, Williams does not have a formal concentration in gay, lesbian, and bisexual studies, the
College offers a number of courses which examine how social, cultural, and political institutions shape
sexualities, as well as the responses and resistances thereto, through a variety of texts and contexts. The
following courses include significant components on gay, lesbian, and bisexual studies (at least two weeks
out of the semester).

WRITING-INTENSIVE COURSES
Courses designated as "writing intensive"--those marked with a "(W)"--stress the process of learning
to write effectively. Such courses include a substantial amount of writing (a minimum of 20 pages), usually
divided into several discrete assignments. Instructors pay close attention to matters of style and argumenta-
tion. Enrollments are limited to 19.
All Williams College students are required to take two writing-intensive courses: one by the end of the
sophomore year and one by the end of the junior year. Students will benefit most from writing-intensive
courses by taking them early in their college careers and are therefore strongly encouraged to complete the
requirement by the end of the sophomore year.

WILLIAMS OFF-CAMPUS PROGRAMS
WILLIAMS-EXETER PROGRAMME AT OXFORD UNIVERSITY
Director, Associate Professor JAMES L. NOLAN, Jr.
THE PROGRAMME
Williams College offers a year-long programme of studies at Oxford University in co-operation with
Exeter College (founded in 1314), one of the constituent colleges of the University. Williams students will
be enrolled as Visiting Students at Exeter and as such will be undergraduate members of the University,
eligible for access to virtually all of its facilities, libraries, and resources. As Visiting Students in Oxford,
students admitted to the Programme will be fully integrated into the intellectual and social life of one of the
world's great universities.
Although students in the Programme will be members of Exeter College, entitled to make full use of
Exeter facilities (including the College Library), dine regularly in Hall, and join all College clubs and orga-
nisations on the same terms as other undergraduates at Exeter, students will reside in Ephraim Williams
House, a compound of four buildings owned by Williams College, roughly 1.4 miles north of the city
centre. Three students from Exeter College will normally reside in Ephraim Williams House each year,
responsible for helping to integrate Williams students into the life of the College and the University. A
resident director (and member of the Williams Faculty) administers Ephraim Williams House, oversees the
academic programme, and serves as both the primary academic and personal advisor to Williams students
in Oxford.
Students enrolled in the Oxford Programme must enroll for the full academic year, which consists of
three academic terms, each of which includes eight full weeks of instruction: MICHAELMAS TERM
(early October to early December), HILARY TERM (mid-January to mid-March), and TRINITY TERM
(late April to late June). Students are expected to be in residence to write their first tutorial papers before the
eight weeks of instruction begins and to remain in residence during the week after the term ends in order to
sit their final examinations. Between the three terms there are two intervening four-five week vacations,
during which students may be expected to continue reading as preparation for their upcoming tutorials.
THE TUTORIAL SYSTEM
Undergraduate instruction at Oxford University is largely carried out through individual or small-group
tutorials, in which students meet weekly with their tutor to present and discuss an essay they have written,
based on an extensive amount of reading undertaken from an assigned reading list they will receive at the
beginning of each term. In addition to the weekly tutorial, students are from time to time encouraged to
attend a pertinent course of lectures offered by the University that corresponds to the material being ad-
dressed in their tutorials.
Each student will plan a course of study for the three terms of the academic year in consultation with the
director of the Programme. In his or her capacity as the Tutor for Visiting Students at Exeter College, the
director, working closely with Exeter's subject tutors, will arrange the teaching for the students, monitor
student progress, be in regular contact with the student's tutors, supervise the examinations that students
will sit at the end of each academic term, and report on each student's academic progress to the Senior
Tutor at Exeter College. There are no "add/drop" periods at Oxford; once a student has made a commit-
ment to a particular tutorial course, and the director has then secured a tutor to teach that course, students
cannot back out.
Over the course of the three terms, students are required to enroll in a minimum of FOUR full tutorial
courses (each consisting of eight individual tutorial meetings and requiring the preparation of eight essays)
and ONE half tutorial course (consisting of four individual tutorial meetings and the preparation of four
essays). Some students choose to substitute a fifth full tutorial course for the half tutorial course and a few
will decide to enroll in two full tutorial courses each term. The average course load undertaken by most
students in residence in Oxford during the past has been five full tutorial courses or their equivalent.
GRADES AND CREDIT
Grades for each tutorial course reflect the grade assigned to all eight (or four) tutorial sessions, including
their related essays, considered together, as well as the grade for the final examination on work accom-
plished in the individual tutorials and supplementary readings. Final examinations last three hours in the
case of full tutorial courses and two hours in the case of half tutorial courses and are always sat in the ninth
week of term, following the eight weeks of instruction each term. The final grade recorded on the Williams
transcript is calculated by counting the grade for the tutorial meetings and essays as two-thirds of the grade
and the final examination as one-third of the overall grade. For some tutorial courses (especially in writing
and the studio arts), tutors may offer the student the option of a final paper or project in lieu of an examina-
tion.
Upon satisfactory completion of the requirements for the Williams-Exeter Programme at Oxford Uni-
versity, students receive academic credit for a regular Williams academic year, the four tutorial courses
replacing the regular eight semester courses the student would normally take at Williams, the half tutorial
course replacing the Winter Study Course. Grades eventually become a part of their Williams transcript
and will be included in the computation of their Grade Point Average.
Williams-Exeter Programme at Oxford
­ 326 ­
Tutorial courses in Oxford may be used toward fulfilling the divisional distribution requirement; a stu-
dent may earn a year maximum of three distribution requirements, with no more than one from each divi-
sion, for the year. All tutorial courses at Oxford meet the Williams College "Writing Intensive" designa-
tion, except for those in the studio arts, mathematics, and the sciences.
Tutorial courses in Oxford may also be used to meet major requirements. Some departments at Williams
will grant a two-course credit towards the major for each full tutorial course taken at Oxford, and one
course towards the major for each half tutorial course taken at Oxford. Most departments, however, will
grant a one-course credit towards the major for each relevant tutorial course taken at Oxford (whether a full
or a half). Students are encouraged to check with their department chair(s) to confirm official department
policy.
THE COURSE OF STUDY
Students are encouraged to pursue a course of study during their three terms at Oxford that best reflects
the strength of the University's offerings. In addition to the opportunity to pursue British and Common-
wealth Studies, Williams students in Oxford will be able to pursue tutorials in fields in which Oxford is
particularly noted (English Literature, Modern History, Philosophy, Politics, Classics, Theology, etc.). Ex-
eter College also has a Fellow in English Language and Literature (with interests ranging from the Renais-
sance--including Shakespeare--to the early nineteenth century) committed to teaching Williams students,
and students are thus encouraged to consider undertaking at least one tutorial course in these fields as part
of their course of study.
What follows is a list of tutorial courses normally available to students studying with the Williams-Exet-
er Programme at Oxford. The tutorials listed below (WIOX 311-384) represent a selection of some of the
standard "papers" (courses) that comprise the Oxford degrees in various subjects and that are taught in
tutorial format. Normally, but not always, tutors can be secured who can teach these subjects to Williams
students, although demand, leave patterns, and other constraints, sometimes mean that not all of these sub-
jects can be staffed in all terms.
Some tutorial courses are accompanied by lectures. In such cases the term in which the lectures are
delivered is listed, as is the term in which students should take the tutorials (MT-Michaelmas Term; HT-
Hilary Term; TT-Trinity Term). Sometimes, where appropriate, prerequisites are also listed.
While many students enroll in the tutorial courses listed below (WIOX 311-384), it is also possible to
choose from other available Oxford courses under the heading of WIOX 390, a general rubric for more
specialized tutorial work. This is described in more detail below.

WIOX 390 Specially Arranged Subjects
Specially arranged tutorial courses in some subject areas other than those covered by the WIOX 311-384
courses might also be possible. A WIOX 390 is not simply what would be called an "independent study"
course at Williams. Rather, a WIOX 390 is normally a "paper" (course) that is regularly offered at Oxford
as either a required or optional part of the degree in various subjects. For a list of all the "papers" that make
up the degree requirements in various disciplines, students should consult the University of Oxford Ex-
amination Regulations, a recent copy of which can be found in the Dean's Office. Important guidelines for
how to make sense of this complex and weighty tome (the equivalent of the Williams College Bulletin) are
available from the Dean's Office and also from the director. It is easier to find tutors for a WIOX 390 in
some fields (Classics, English, History, Philosophy, Theology, etc.) than in others (Psychology, the natural
sciences, etc) and students should realize that it is not always possible for the Programme to accommodate
their requests.
A sample list of Specially Arranged Subjects (WIOX 390) staffed during the past three years is offered
below. This list is not comprehensive. Furthermore, students who wish to undertake a WIOX 390 course
are encouraged to consult the Examination Regulations rather than simply repeat what other students in the
past have done.

NON-CREDIT FOREIGN LANGUAGE STUDY
In addition to their regular tutorial courses, students may begin or continue the study of a wide range of
foreign languages on a non-credit basis through a variety of arrangements available through the University
as well as a number of other educational and cultural institutions in the city of Oxford. The Programme
normally subsidizes such study.
STUDENT LIFE
By virtue of the fact that, while in Oxford, they are officially Visiting Students at the University--and
full members of Exeter College--Williams students are offered every opportunity to become fully inte-
grated into student life in Oxford. Both Exeter College and Oxford University are home to an exceptional
variety of sports clubs, debating societies, interest groups, cultural organizations, and social activities, virtu-
ally all of which are available to Visiting Student members of the University. Students are encouraged to
participate fully in the social life of Exeter College--to dine in Hall as often as they wish, to frequent the
College bar, to use the College's athletic facilities, and to become members of the various College clubs
and organizations. Furthermore, Williams students also have access to the University's athletic events, con-
certs, theatrical productions, museums, and libraries. All Williams students in Oxford are provided with
membership in the Oxford Union, which, in addition to its debating activities and club rooms, possesses
dining facilities and the largest lending library in the University.
At the Ephraim Williams House, all Williams students are housed in capacious double rooms and enjoy
full access to the House's library, common rooms, laundry facilities, computer lab, and a large dining room,
in which a weekly catered meal is served during the eight weeks of term. There are also a number of small
kitchens in the House which students may use. All rooms are fully wired for high-speed internet access and
are fully equipped with furnishings, bed linens, and a telephone. The grounds include a courtyard where
basketball can be played, sheltered bike racks, barbecue facilities, and gardens. A number of student jobs
are available during the academic year for students who wish to earn a little spending money by helping to
maintain the facilities and organize Programme activities. Ephraim Williams House is a short bike or bus
ride (or a twenty-minute walk) from Exeter College and the center of town, and is within easy walking
distance of the University parks and the local shops, restaurants and banks of Summertown. The Pro-
gramme will partially subsidize student bus passes or bicycle purchase or rental to facilitate travel around
Oxford.
Before the academic year begins--at the end of September and in early October--ten days of orienta-
tion activities are scheduled. Students are expected to be in residence for all of these many activities, some
of which take place in Ephraim Williams House, others at Exeter College. At this time students will be-
come acquainted with the workings of the Programme, of Exeter College, and of the University, and will
be familiarized with the rules and regulations they are expected to abide by during their residence in Ox-
ford.
Throughout the academic year, provision will be made for trips to a number of sites of historical, cultur-
al, or political interest. In the past these have included the Cotswolds, Stratford, Stonehenge, Bath, Wells,
Warwick Castle, Blenheim Palace, and various sites of interest in London. Students will also be given the
opportunity to attend a number of theatrical productions and other cultural events. Oxford's proximity to
London gives students ready access to that city's multiple attractions and many resources. The Oxford-
London train service is frequent and the journey takes just over an hour. The buses to London run even
more regularly (and are cheaper), and the one-way journey takes about ninety minutes.
During the summer before students arrive in Oxford, they will receive a copy of the latest edition of
Ephs Among the Dreaming Spires, which will further explain the perks, policies, and procedures of the
Programme, the rules and regulations they are expected to follow, and tips for how best to enjoy a fulfilling
year in and around Oxford.

ILLNESS AND INSURANCE
Students must ensure they are covered either by the Williams College health insurance policy or by
some other comprehensive health insurance plan (generally a family health insurance policy). While in
Britain, students will be covered by the National Health Service (NHS) for routine visits at the Group Med-
ical Practice used by Exeter College and for emergency hospital treatment. Prescription drugs are available
through the NHS for a nominal fee. There are limited outpatient psychological counseling services avail-
able through the NHS and the Programme, although, as Visiting Students at the University, Williams stu-
dents are entitled to make use of the University Counseling Centre. Any extensive or long-term counseling,
however, would need to be covered by the student's personal health insurance policy. Finally, students are
not likely to be covered under the NHS for medical services received in foreign countries, especially those
countries that do not enjoy membership of the European Union.
FEES
The tuition and room fees paid by students on the Williams-Exeter Programme at Oxford are the same
as those for a year spent in residence at Williams. Students are responsible for some of their own meals and
for all of their personal expenses. They are also responsible for the cost of their air travel to and from Brit-
ain, although they may select to take the group flight to London arranged by the Programme at competitive
rates. They are provided with three meals a day for the first four or five days in Oxford and with a weekly
catered meal in Ephraim Williams House during the eight weeks of term. They may also eat breakfast,
lunch, and/or dinner on any day of the week at Exeter. Students will not be charged the full Williams board
fee during their year in Oxford, but they will pay a proportion of the board fee to help cover these costs. For
planning purposes, students and their parents should expect the cost of a year on the Programme to be
roughly the same as a year at Williams. Financial aid eligibility will be figured on the usual basis of tuition,
fees, room, board, and personal and book expenses, as if the student were at Williams for the year. Similar-
ly, the normal self-help contribution would be expected. Since the academic year ends later at Oxford than
at Williams, the summer earning expectations for students for the following year will be reduced by one
half and the difference will be made up by additional Williams aid.
APPLICATION
Admission to the Programme is on a competitive but flexible basis. Students must apply to the Dean's
Office by the prescribed deadline (normally early in February) and, prior to applying, should consult with
the chair of their major department. Any questions students might have about curricular offerings at Ox-
ford can also be raised with the director of the Programme in Oxford. In addition to completing the formal
application form, students can expect to be interviewed at Williams and will subsequently need to com-
plete an application for Visiting Student status at Oxford University. All admissions to the Programme are
subject to approval by Exeter College. Students can expect to be notified of acceptance before Spring
Break. It is normally expected that they will have completed the College's distribution requirement by the
end of their sophomore year. In making its decisions, the Admissions Committee of the Williams-Exeter
Programme at Oxford University takes student GPA into account, expects all applicants to have demon-
strated capacity for rigorous independent work and extensive essay writing, and looks favorably on those
students whose intellectual maturity, curiosity and enthusiasm would best prepare them for a demanding
course of study in Oxford. All applicants must identify two Williams faculty members who are willing to
provide references. Because of the emphasis at Oxford on weekly written work for each tutorial course, at
least one of those faculty members should be able to offer an assessment of the applicant's writing ability.
WILLIAMS-MYSTIC MARITIME STUDIES PROGRAM

Faculty: JAMES T. CARLTON (Williams College), LISA GILBERT (Mystic Seaport), GLENN S.
GORDINIER (University of Connecticut), CATHERINE ROBINSON HALL (Mystic Seaport),
DANIEL BRAYTON (Middlebury College).
The Williams College-Mystic Seaport Maritime Studies Program offers students a unique opportunity
to explore the ocean, to travel the Atlantic and Pacific Coasts, and to undertake original research of their
own design in the humanities and sciences. A term at Williams-Mystic satisfies both a semester's credit
and one winter study requirement, as well as intensive writing course credit. Four Williams courses are
offered as an integrated, multidisciplinary curriculum in the semester-long program at Mystic Seaport, in
Mystic, Connecticut: Maritime History, Literature of the Sea, Marine Policy, and either Marine Ecology or
Oceanography (see the American Maritime Studies section in this catalog). Williams College faculty
members serve as the Director and Marine Scientist. Travel includes an offshore voyage on the open ocean
sailing aboard a tall ship, a seminar along the Pacific Coast, and the Mississippi River Delta field seminar,
all of which are cross-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary exercises. Students live in historic, cooperative,
coed houses at Mystic Seaport, the world's largest maritime museum, and have full access to world-class
maritime collections, a maritime library, well-equipped laboratory, and diverse coastal habitats (where field
research can be undertaken in a wide variety of environments, ranging from tidepools and salt marshes to
sandy beaches and estuaries). Students also participate in maritime skills under professional instruction,
with choices such as celestial navigation, music of the sea, boat building, or small boat handling and sail-

ing. Williams-Mystic seeks candidates who are willing to try new things and work in a compelling aca-
demic environment. No sailing experience necessary, and all majors welcome--a typical semester at
Williams-Mystic is represented by 12 to 14 different majors spanning the sciences and humanities.
Sophomores, juniors, and seniors can attend. Participation in Williams-Mystic can also be used in
partial fulfillment of the Maritime Studies Concentration at Williams. Interested students should
contact Williams-Mystic at admissions@williamsmystic.org, call (860-572-5359), visit the web-
site (williamsmystic.org), or obtain a Williams-Mystic catalog from the Dean's office. Applications

WILLIAMS IN NEW YORK
Director, Professor ROBERT JACKALL
Professors: BUCKY, JACKALL, KASINITZ.
Williams in New York is an experiential education program that combines immersion in fieldwork with
traditional scholarship and contemplation. It aims to help students develop critical, reflective habits of mind
to carry with them into the world of affairs. Moreover, it provides a forum to engage alumni and alumnae in
the ongoing intellectual work of the College, a milieu to stoke the unbroken dialogue between generations
of Williams men and women.
In fall 2005, the program will have eight students. Students will live on the top floor of the Williams
Club at 24 East 39th Street, between Park and Madison avenues. Seminars will be held at the Graduate
Center of the City University of New York at 365 Fifth Avenue, only a few minutes away from the Wil-
liams Club.
The curriculum for fall 2005 consists of the following four graded courses:
WNY 301T(F) Fieldwork in New York (W)
Each student will do 15 hours a week of intensive fieldwork in one of several organizations selected by the
director. Commitments for field placements have already been obtained from:
SDistrict Attorney of New York (DANY)
SNew York City Department of Investigation
SNew York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development
SABC News Special Events
SManhattan Institute
SVera Institute of Justice
SThe New York Sun
SSchool for Democracy and Leadership
SWomen's Commission on Women and Children Refugees
SUnited States Attorney, Southern District of New York
SDodgers Theatrical
The focus of each student's tutorial, including readings required, will match his or her fieldwork. Students
will keep careful fieldwork notes and write several short papers about their work. Students will meet with
the instructor every other week in pairs and every other week as a whole group to read, review, and discuss
their respective fieldwork projects.
Format: tutorial/discussion seminar. Requirements: Six papers on fieldwork experiences during the semes-
ter. Full engagement in the discussion seminar.
Satisfies one semester of the Division II requirement.
Hour: TBA JACKALL
WNY 303(F) Slow Motion Riot: The Social Life of the Metropolis
An exploration of the social life of New York, the distinctive, yet paradigmatic modern city. The course
examines the emergence of New York City as an international center of business, finance, and culture, and
as the main gateway to America for an ever-changing array of newcomers from all over the world. Special
attention to the city's ethnic and racial tensions; the experiences of its new immigrants; its cleavages be-

tween wealth and poverty, celebrity and obscurity; its vibrant neighborhoods; and its always contested use
of space. Readings include selections from: Jane Jacobs, The Death and Life of Great American Cities;
Nathan Glazer and Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Beyond the Melting Pot; Marshall Berman, All Things Solid
Melt into Air; E.B. White, Here is New York; Colson Whitehead, The Colossus of New York; Joshua Free-
man, Working Class New York; Tyler Anbinder, Five Points; Min Zhou, Chinatown; William Kornblum,

ing New Yorkers; Nancy Lopez, Hopeful Girls, Troubled Boys: Robert C. Smith, Mexican New York; and
Nancy Foner, The Wounded City.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: full participation in the seminar, 12- to 15-page term paper.
Satisfies one semester of the Division II requirement.
Hour: TBA KASINITZ
WNY 305(F) Craft and Consciousness
A sociological examination of how craft shapes consciousness. How and in what ways do work experi-
ences shape habits of mind, sensibilities, moral rules-in-use, ways of seeing and knowing, images of our
society, and world views? How do men and women in different occupations and professions establish cri-
teria of validity and reliability to assess their work experiences? How do they develop and internalize rules
for discernment that enable them to sort through multiple and always conflicting versions and representa-
tions of social reality? How do they make moral judgments on complex business, political, and social is-
sues? How and with what results do common work experiences shape close-knit occupational communi-
ties in a great metropolis? The course will pay particular attention to the functionally interconnected but
experientially disparate occupational worlds of New York City.
The course will host men and women from a wide range of occupations and professions--from police
detectives to policy analysts, journalists, filmmakers, artists, educators, attorneys, corporate executives, and
scientists--to discuss their work and work worlds with students. Several Williams alumni and alumnae
will participate in the course.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: full participation in the seminar, 12- to 15-page term paper.
Satisfies one semester of the Division II requirement.
Hour: TBA JACKALL
WNY 307(F) Arts and the City
New York City, as the center of artistic production and consumption in the United States, provides un-
matched opportunities for interrogating the place of the arts in modern society. Have technology, the mar-
ket, and politics eroded the transcendent quality of the arts? The marketplace is the arena for the production
and distribution of popular art. But have high art forms also been turned into commodities by market
forces? How have arts activities strayed from their origins by crossing disciplinary boundaries? What is the
role of the technologies of the last fifty years in supplanting, altering, or fusing with artistic creation?
New York is a unique laboratory in which to test the fundamental dichotomies embodied in the city's artis-
tic life: elitist/democratic, traditional/avant-garde, high art/popular art, aesthetic/political, globalized/local,
film/live theatre. This course grapples with such issues in a pragmatic rather than theoretical manner. In
order to confront the ideas in assigned readings, students will attend performances of theatre, opera, and
dance; attend concerts; and visit museums and other cultural institutions as models for discussion and anal-
ysis. Practicing artists and entrepreneurs in the arts will meet the class in order to provoke discussion of
their activities and perspectives.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: full and lively participation in the seminar and its cultural ac-
tivities, final oral report.
Satisfies one semester of the Division I requirement.

WINTER STUDY PROGRAM
REMINDERS ABOUT WSP REGISTRATION
All students who will be on campus during the 2005-2006 academic year must register for WSP.
Registration will take place in the early part of fall semester. If you are registered for a senior thesis in
the fall which must be continued through Winter Study by departmental rules, you will be registered
for your Winter Study Project automatically. In every other case, you must complete registration.
First-year students are required to participate in a Winter Study that will take place on campus; they
are not allowed to do 99's.
Even if you plan to take a 99, or the instructor of your first choice accepts you during the registration
period, there are many things that can happen between registration and the beginning of Winter Study
to upset your first choice, so you must list five choices. You should try to make one of your choices a
project with a larger enrollment, not that it will guarantee you a project, but it will increase your
chances.
If you think your time may be restricted in any way (ski meets, interviews, etc.), clear these restric-
tions with the instructor before signing up for his/her project.
Remember, for cross-listed projects, you should sign up for the subject you want to appear on your
record.
For many beginning language courses, you are required to take the WSP Sustaining Program in
addition to your regular project. You will be automatically enrolled in this Sustaining Program, so no
one should list this as a choice.
The grade of honors is reserved for outstanding or exceptional work. Individual instructors may
specify minimum standards for the grade, but normally, fewer than one out of ten students will qualify.
A grade of pass means the student has performed satisfactorily. A grade of perfunctory pass signifies
that a student's work has been significantly lacking but is just adequate to deserve a pass.
If you have any questions about a project, see the instructor before you register.
Finally, all work for WSP must be completed and submitted to the instructor no later than Thursday,
January 26th. Only the Dean can grant an extension beyond this date.
WINTER STUDY 99'S
Sophomores, juniors and seniors are eligible to propose "99's," independent projects arranged with
faculty sponsors, conducted in lieu of regular Winter Study courses. Perhaps you have encountered an
interesting idea in one of your courses which you would like to study in more depth, or you may have
an interest not covered in the regular curriculum. In recent years students have undertaken in-depth
studies of particular literary works, interned in government offices, assisted in foreign and domestic
medical clinics, conducted field work in economics in developing countries, and given performances
illustrating the history of American dance. Although some 99's involve travel away from campus,
there are many opportunities to pursue intellectual or artistic goals here in Williamstown.
99 forms are available online:
http://www.williams.edu/Registrar/winterstudy/99direct.html
The deadline for submitting the proposals to faculty sponsors is Thursday, 29 September.

AMST 12 Asian Pacific American Creative Writing: From Yarn Wigs to Persimmons
Begin your year with a creative jump-start. We will look at the broad tapestry to which the label
"Asian Pacific American poetry" is applied and read from a wide range of writings, from the raucous,
colloquial works of Lois-Ann Yamanaka to the spare, devotional poems of Li-Young Lee. Using the
readings as springboards, we will challenge ourselves with writing assignments, in class and out. We
will look both to the page and (via audio, video, and, schedules permitting, live presentations by visit-
ing poets) stage. We will write furiously and, with any luck, fearlessly. No prior cultural or creative
experience necessary.

AMST 15 Contemporary American Songwriting (Same as Music 17)
This course will focus on learning how to write and perform songs in a contemporary style. Topics ad-
dressed will include song structure, how to create a lyric that communicates, vocal and instrument
presentation, performing techniques, publicity for events, and today's music industry. This class will
culminate in a public performance of material written during the course.
To successfully pass this course, students are required to create, edit, perform and possibly record two
original songs. These songs must be conceived during the course period (in other words, previously
written material is not usable.) Students will be guided to create both music and lyrics. They may also
be required to participate in a co-write session. One of these songs will be presented during the final
performance, preferably by the student. Attendance at classes, feedback sessions, and all officially
scheduled events is mandatory and crucial. Also, a short writing assignment will be passed in on the
last day of class.
No prerequisites. Students with a musical background and the ability to play and instrument may be
given preference, but anyone interested is encouraged to register. (Bernice.Lewis@williams.edu).

ANSO 11 Berkshire Farm Center Internship
A field placement at Berkshire Farm Center and Services for Youth in Canaan, New York. Berkshire
Farm Center is a residential treatment facility for troubled, at-risk adolescent boys who have been re-
manded to the Farm by the Family Court. These youths come primarily from lower socio-economic
strata, are very ethnically diverse, and hail from both urban and rural areas throughout New York
State. The problems that they bring to Berkshire Farm are multiple. These include: the psychological
scars of dysfunctional families, including those of physical, emotional, and sexual abuse; chemical
dependency; juvenile delinquency; inability to function in school settings; and various other issues.
Residential treatment is a multi-modal approach that includes anger-replacement training, social
skills training, and behavioral modification.
Williams students will commute to Berkshire Farm and work under supervision in one of the follow-
ing areas: school, cottage life, chemical dependency unit, research, recreation, performing arts, or in
individual tutoring.
Requirements: students will keep a journal reflecting on their experiences, and a weekly seminar with
the instructor will draw on service learning experience. Students will also be required to submit a final
10-page paper at the end of the course.
Prerequisites: YOU MUST HAVE A TELEPHONE INTERVIEW WITH THE INSTRUCTOR who

ANS0 12 Children and the Courts: Internship in the Crisis in Child Abuse
The incidence of reported child abuse and neglect has reached epidemic proportions and shows no
signs of decreasing. Preventive and prophylactic social programs, court intervention, and legislative
mandates have not successfully addressed this crisis. This course allows students to observe the Mas-
sachusetts Department of Social Services attorney in courtroom proceedings related to the care and
protection of children. Students will have access to Department records for purposes of analysis and
will also work with social workers who will provide a clinical perspective on the legal cases under
study. The class will meet regularly to discuss court proceedings, assigned readings, and the students'
interactions with local human services agencies. Access to an automobile is desirable but not re-
quired; some transportation will be provided as part of the course.
Requirements: full participation, a journal, and a 10-page paper to be submitted at the end of the
course.
Enrollment limit: 15. Please note: all queries about this course must be directed to the instructor, Judge
Locke (phone messages may be left at 458-4833).

ANSO 13 History and Cinema in Eastern Europe
How can history and identity be represented in film? By watching and analyzing films of different
genres, time periods, and cinematographic traditions, the students learn not only to relate the film to its
cultural context, but also to assess visual and narrative devices that the film employs. This course fo-
cuses specifically on Eastern European films, where the questions of ideological representation domi-
nated the agenda, while rules of the market hardly mattered. The students are invited to explore differ-
ent modes of historical representations, as well as the compositional, narrative and visual devices, in-
cluding the questions of genre conventions and different generational and national (regional) identi-
ties of the film makers, including early Soviet avant-garde, Czech new wave, Balkan cinema.
Along with films, the readings related to the topic will be assigned to accompany the discussion. As
there is no single textbook which would fit the objectives of the course, the reading package with se-
lected articles and extracts from monographs will be offered to students. The tapes will be placed on
reserve in the college library for additional viewing. The readings come from the field of history, cul-
tural studies, film studies, etc. and provide both methodological and factual information about the
problems posed. Along with short extracts on the historical films the students will view the following
full films: October (Soviet Union, Sergie Eisenstein, 1927), Ashes and Diamonds (Poland, Andrzej
Wajda, 1958), Fireman's Ball (Czechoslovakia, Milos Forman, 1967), My 20th Century (Hungary, Il-
diko Enyedi, 1989), The Color of Pomegranites (Soviet Union/Armenia, Paradjanov, 1970), and Un-
derground (Yugoslavia, Emir Kusturica, 1995).
Evaluation will be based on class participation and a final 10-page essay, elaborating the relationship
between film and history, referring to the material and themes discussed in the class.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20.
Cost to student: nominal fee for reading packet.

ARTH 10 Inventing Joan of Arc: The History of a Heroine in Pictures and Film
Joan of Arc (known during her own lifetime most commonly as Jeanne "la Pucelle", or Joan "the
Maid") was one of the most dynamic and yet enigmatic personalities of the European Middle Ages.
Born into a peasant family in the French border province of Lorraine in 1412, she gained control of an
army, won brilliant military victories, crowned a king, and was burnt at the stake as a heretic, all before
her twentieth birthday. Triply marginalized by gender, age, and socio-economic status, she nonethe-
less managed to shake the Church and State establishments to their very core. But who was Joan of
Arc? Nationalist martyr? Pioneer feminist? Champion of the people? Instrument of God's grace? Vic-
tim of post-traumatic stress disorder? Over the centuries since her death, artists--and not just politi-
cians and scholars--have attempted to answer this question, creating myriad visions of la Pucelle un-
der the influence of an ever-changing lens of contemporary tastes and concerns. Through readings
and discussion, this course will survey the history of representations of Joan of Arc in painting, prints,
sculpture, and film, from the time of her death to the present.

ARTH 15 Materials of the Artist: Uncovering Fakes and Forgeries (Same as ArtS 15 and
Chemistry 15)
(See under Chemistry for full description.)
ARTH 24 Sarah Bernhardt in New York
This course focuses on a major exhibition, "Sarah Bernhardt: The Art of High Drama," that will be on
view at The Jewish Museum (92nd/5th) in New York City from December 2, 2005 to April 2, 2006.
This multi-media exhibition of 250 objects (paintings, sculpture, drawings, vintage photographs and
posters, costumes, jewelry, film, sound recordings), curated by Carol Ockman and Kenneth E. Silver,
Chair and Professor of Art History at New York University, focuses on Bernhardt as the first celebrity
actress. In fact, it demonstrates that she established the template for all stars to come. The exhibition
brings attention to Bernhardt's involvement with new forms of popular entertainment (boulevard the-
aters, vaudeville, etc.) and new technologies (photography, film, and sound recording), thus modify-
ing the standard interpretation of Bernhardt as principally a great, classical tragedienne.
"Sarah Bernhardt in New York" constitutes an unprecedented opportunity to learn about an exhibition
from soup to nuts: to study the objects, installation, and catalogue, as well as to experience related pro-
gramming. In addition, students will visit important temporary exhibitions and permanent collections
around the city with an eye to assessing how they create narratives through the choice of objects and
their installation.
In consultation with the instructor, each student will choose a particular exhibition or collection about
which to research and write a 10-page paper.
The course will be offered in New York City where students will reside at the Williams Club from Jan-
uary 3 to January 26.
Enrollment limit: 4.
Cost per student: $1300 (includes lodging and full breakfast; $20 per diem; metro card for in-city
transportation; evening at theatre; museum admission when accompanied by instructor, and required
text). This course is not defined as a "trip" for financial aid purposes. The maximum reimbursement
to financial aid students is $500. Not open to first-year students.

ARTH 25 The Birth of the Modern: Art and Music in Vienna
Back at the turn into the last century, Vienna was one of the primary centers for ground-breaking in-
novations in art, architecture and music ( and also the time and place where Freud defined psychoanal-
ysis.) Using the rich repositories of that culture in the museums and concert halls of present-day Vien-
na, we will explore the artists who introduced "modernism" and analyze the particular qualities that
set them apart from the norm. Our course will begin with a visit to Vienna's major museum of fine art,
the Kunsthistorisches Museum, to view a special exhibition of the great 19th-century Spanish artist,
Goya. The exhibition, called "Goya: The Prophet of the Modern," will be our starting point in discuss-
ing the concept of "Modernism" as it was defined in the early 20th century. What was "modern" about
Goya and do these qualities apply to the ways avant-garde Austrian artists reenvisioned painting and
restructured music? In particular we want to study the works of Schoenberg, Berg and Webern in mu-
sic; Kokoshka, Schiele, and Klimt in painting; Hofmann and Moser in design; and Otto Wagner and
Adolf Loos in architecture.
The class will visit the sites of modern murals, paintings and decorative arts (The Museum für Ange-
wandte Kunst; The Belvedere Palace; The Secession building; The Leopold Museum). For the music,
we will study scores and recordings at the Schoenberg Center in Vienna, the repository of all the com-
Winter Study Program

poser's manuscripts and recordings, as well as those of his pupils, Berg and Webern (and, additionally,
the Center is the place where we can study Schoenberg's Expressionist paintings, so important that
Kandinsky included them in a seminal exhibition of German Expressionist art in 1910.)
In various excursions to villas and churches and walks around town, we'll explore the contributions to
architecture made by Otto Wagner and the audacious Adolf Loos. Comparing the confectionary ar-
chitecture of the Habsburg Palace to the Loos "House without Eyebrows" across from it, might alone
give you the essence of the revolutionary quality of the Viennese avant-garde.
Each student will be expected to develop enough expertise about a given artist that they can lead the
class when we visit galleries and architectural sites.

ART STUDIO
ARTS 11 Drawing Life
Drawing live things is different than drawing dead things since live things tend to move. Together, we
will use charcoal, pencil and ink to draw live models, clothed and nude, plants and animals and shop-
pers in action at the Berkshire Mall. "Drawing Life" will meet for nine hours a week in the Spencer
Studio art building and occasionally wander out into the campus and community with sketchbooks.
Beginning and advanced students are welcome, since the small class size allows for personalized in-
struction.
Evaluation is based on successful in-class projects and weekly homework.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 12. Since most drawing classes give priority to first years, this
class will reverse the order and accept seniors first, then juniors, sophomores and first years.
Meeting times : Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday afternoons.
Lab fee: $100.

ARTS 14 Noir and Neo Noir
This course will combine film studies and video production to investigate film noir and its legacies.
The course will begin with the study of crime movies of the 1940's and 50's like The Maltese Falcon,
Detour, Double Indemnity, Kiss Me Deadly, Sunset Boulevard, The Third Man, Out of the Past, The
Hitch-hiker, No Way Out, Gilda, The Postman Always Rings Twice, The Big Sleep, Gun Crazy, Night
of the Hunter,Touch of Evil, and other films, and will explore their impact in more recent contributions
to the genre, ranging from Chinatown and Serpico to LA Confidential, Mulholland Drive, Bound,
Devil in a Blue Dress, Pulp Fiction, The Usual Suspects, Femme Fatale, and The Deep End. Readings
in film history and criticism will help us to consider the films using a range of methods: How do the
Winter Study Program
­ 341 ­
films emerge in a historical period from a genre of pulp fiction? How do the films use language and
visual style to produce their fictional world? What are the narrative functions of the obsessions, re-
pressions, alienations, and femmes fatales that lurk in the criminal underbelly of the nation, and how
might these stories be seen to stage certain crises of masculinity? How do the films produce and repro-
duce ideas about urban (and sometimes non-urban) spaces? How do the films reproduce and/or shift
American thinking about racial and ethnic cultures, particularly in films like Touch of Evil, Miller's
Crossing,Caught,Devil in a Blue Dress, and Pulp Fiction? How do stars function in the films, ranging
from Barbara Stanwick or Robert Mitchum to Tilda Swinton or Denzel Washington?
In response to these inquiries, students will produce two one-minute videos, two 1-page papers, two
short scripts, and one final 5-minute video. Each assignment will be a response to issues, themes, visu-
al forms, and narrative strategies raised by the films and critical readings.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 12.
Lab fee: $125.
Meeting time: 1-4 p.m., Tuesday and Wednesday, plus 3-8 hours/week of scheduled screenings and 2

This course will use the imagery of landscape, mythology and the natural world associated with an-
cient Greece as a source for painting. Students will research an area of interest or topic related to an-
cient Greece and compile and gather images and ideas that will be incorporated into a painting or se-
ries of paintings.
Students will be evaluated on the basis of regular attendance and completion of their work. Students
will be expected to spend considerable time outside of class researching their subject and gathering
imagery. Students will also find it necessary to spend additional studio time, outside of scheduled
class time, in order to explore, experiment and create strong work. Technical aspects of painting will
be addressed as needed.

ARTS 18 A House in a Box
This is a home design course. Each student will design a house to be built within a 6-meter cube (20
feet). There will be several exercises in which the students will present solutions restricted to the 6 me-
ter limits as well as solutions which could use limited outward expansions for balconies, bay windows
or actual second floor room enlargements.
The students will design the entire living space, including all furniture (volume, size, functionality).
The main design purpose is to get away from the limitations of a floor plan, a two-dimensional-projec-
tion approach to design. The conception of the living spaces will focus on multi-level occupancy,
highly ergonomic built-in furniture and differences of ceiling heights. Special emphasis will be given
to tri-dimensional layer-occupancy design, as it is done in airplane restrooms (and customarily in
product design, as can be seen inside the CPU cabinet of a personal computer).
Due to the familiarity of the themes involved (living in enclosed spaces, personal spatial needs, hu-
man behavior) and to specific exercises, the students will develop their own data sheets with informa-
tion on human dimensions, furniture sizes, hand reaching curves, shelving heights.
Final presentation will be a 1:20 scale model of the house, assembled in such a way as to permit inter-
nal viewing. Drawings, sketches and partial (cut) models can also be included.
This is not a course limited to students in pre-architecture programs or even restricted to art majors.
The exploration exercises will give each student enough information to produce a good design solu-
tion. Although previous studio training and personal drawing talent will help students with their final
presentation, the lack of either (or even both) will not be an impairment to good course performance.
This is a CONCEPT DESIGN course. Presentation model and drawings are just the means of present-

ing the concepts and solutions. There will be no emphasis on the artistic expression or graphic quali-
ties of those items.

ARTS 19 Pinhole Photography
Pinhole Photography offers to the beginner and the seasoned photographer alike an entry way into a
unique way of viewing the world. Ordinary colors and shapes are transformed. The cameras them-
selves can be anything from a shoe box to a paint bucket. The sky is the limit as to where pinhole pho-
tography can take you.
Students will be evaluated on their efforts with building their own pinhole camera. They will be given
instruction as to how to drill a pin hole to the correct size as dictated by their container. They will also
learn the darkroom process for they will be making their own prints, which will be displayed at the end

CHIN 10 Reading and Translating Tang Poetry
The Tang dynasty (618-906) has traditionally been considered the golden age of Chinese poetry.
Poems from the Tang continue to be enjoyed by millions of people and memorized by school children
in mainland China and Taiwan down to the present day. In this class we will learn the basics of reading
Tang poetry in the original literary Chinese in which it was written. We will look at a small number of
poems very closely and examine such topics as rhyme, imagery, allusion, and structure. We will also
look closely at commentaries and annotations of the poems in both modern Chinese and English. This
class requires knowledge of Chinese at least at the level of Chinese 201, but does NOT assume any
knowledge of literary or "Classical" Chinese. The language of instruction will be English.
Evaluation will be based on preparation for class, class participation, a presentation, and a final exam
based on the material covered in class. Students will be expected to prepare assignments outside of

JAPN 10 Stories from the Edges: Japanese and Beyond
Okichi unwillingly became the mistress of the first American consul (1856-1862), Townsend Harris,
at the age of seventeen. Her traumatic story is well known to Japanese and the various ways it has been
told exemplify a cultural fascination with those living in the margins. In this course, we will examine
Okichi's and other border stories that are told in multiple media narratives, from personal diaries to
television dramas. The latter part of the course will be devoted to creating and developing a project on
a subject of each participant's choosing. Projects may take the shape of an ethnographic paper, an au-
dio recording, a mini-documentary film, or even a live performance, according to the particular skills
and interests of each participant.
Evaluation is based on class participation, regular journaling, and the project. We will meet in the
morning as a group an average of three times per week, with allowances made for one-on-one meet-
ings, a few films showings outside the regular class hours, and for those exigencies that develop
around the final projects.
No prerequisites. Materials and discussions will be in English, though the projects may be bilingual
where appropriate. Enrollment limit: 12.
Cost to student: approximately $50.

KAGAYA
JAPN 12 Performative Learning
Performance has outgrown its theatrical meaning and has come to serve as a paradigm for the means
by which we participate in our culture and in our world. That sea change necessitates a rethinking of
what we mean by `learning' and `training'. "Performative Learning" describes the interplay between
the intellect and the viscera necessary to engage in any number of endeavors such as martial arts,
dance, music, theatre, etc. The goals of this course are far-reaching, but the methods of studio activity
will be much more focused: the instructor will draw primarily from experiences training with artists of
the Japanese butoh dance movement, and from teaching movement in an acting conservatory setting
to create an intensive course of training in physical theatre performance. Exercises provide pointed

challenges to both body and imagination, and pose the question: "How do we go about learning, when
the body is at the center of the equation?" They will include carefully structured improvisations and
partnered limb and joint mobilizations, designed to increase proprioceptive awareness and sensitivity
to kinesiology, space, and interplay with others.
Evaluation is based on daily participation, regular journaling, written summaries, and active partici-
pation in discussions on reading assignments. A performance of selections from the coursework will
take place at or near the end of the term.

ASTRONOMY
ASTR 10 Adventures Under The Dome: Communicating Astronomy (Same as English 10)
This course will combine an exploration of astronomy with a study of effective ways to communicate
astronomy to the public. It will cover the presentation of astronomy and related topics, ranging from
print media to multi-media live and taped presentations. We will open by examining how astronomy
is presented in various forms of media, with particular emphasis on language and audience assump-
tions. These will prepare us for several sessions that will focus on planetarium show production and
the show producer's multi-disciplinary media background. Some sessions will be held in the new Wil-
liams College planetarium, with its new Zeiss and digital projectors. There will also be a short (1-day
with possible overnight) field trip to a working production dome in Nashua, NH, to see shows in full-
dome format and talk to artists and designers involved in creating the newest generation of fulldome
video programs for planetarium facilities.
Evaluation will be based on class discussion participation and preparation of a short planetarium pre-
sentation or suitable equivalent in other media. If overenrolled, students will be selected on the basis
of a paragraph describing their interest.
This course is open to students with an interest in and/or aptitude in writing for media and production.
No formal background in astronomy is required, although some knowledge will be extremely helpful.

BIOL 13 Food: An Integrative Approach
We will take a comprehensive and multidisciplinary look at the topic of food. Food is the only thing
we need to survive, although it is something that most of us take for granted. The food industry is the
largest industry in the world, affecting every aspect of our lives. We'll examine how contemporary so-
ciety is impacted by our food systems. We'll explore both global and local issues, using a variety of
disciplines: economics, politics, public health, and environmental studies, to name a few. Students
will be encouraged to bring their own interests and approaches to this topic. The research project can
be literature-based or experiential, practical application or theoretical in nature. Topics to be ad-
dressed include: population growth, the U.S. agricultural system, biotechnology, food safety, organic
farming, eating locally/seasonally, the "externalization" vs. "internalization" of costs, food aid and
trade policy. Readings: articles from various publications will be assigned.
The class will be highly participatory; students will discuss current issues presented in the assigned
readings and documentary films.

CHEMISTRY
CHEM 11 Science for Kids (Same as Special 11)
Are you interested in teaching? Do you enjoy working with kids? Do you like to experiment with new
things? Here is a chance for you to do all three! The aim of this Winter Study Project is to design a se-
ries of hands-on science workshops for elementary school children and their parents. Working in
teams of 2-4, students spend the first two and a half weeks of Winter Study planning the workshops.
This involves deciding on a focus for each workshop (based on the interests of the students involved)
followed by choosing and designing experiments and presentations that will be suitable for fourth-
grade children. On the third weekend of Winter Study (January 21, 22) we bring elementary school
kids with their parents to Williams to participate in the workshops.
You get a chance to see what goes into planning classroom demonstrations as well as a sense of what
it's like to actually give a presentation. You find that kids at this age are great fun to work with because
they are interested in just about everything and their enthusiasm is infectious. You also give the kids
and their parents a chance to actually do some fun hands-on science experiments that they may not
have seen before, and you are able to explain simple scientific concepts to them in a manner that won't
be intimidating. It is a rewarding experience for all involved.
Evaluation is based on participation in planning and running the workshops. Each group is expected
to prepare a handout with descriptions of the experiments for the kids, parents, and teachers.
No prerequisites: You need not be a science major; all that is needed is enthusiasm. Enrollment limit:

CHEM 12 Epidemiology, Public Health and Leadership in the Health Professions (Same
as Leadership Studies 12)
Epidemiology, the study of disease and disability in human populations, has been called the basic sci-
ence of public health and preventive medicine. Epidemiology has made substantial contributions to
the advancement of health and improved illness care through a sharper understanding of the natural
history of disease, the multiple "causes" of disease, and the control of epidemics of both infectious
and (later) non-infectious disease. Epidemiological approaches are used constantly to test new medi-
cines and guide treatment and prevention strategies.
Making use of epidemic exercises, selected original papers from the medical and public health litera-
ture, and a basic text, this course starts by reviewing the history, logic and approaches of epidemiolo-
gy. We then turn to discussions of scientific and social leadership in the health professions. With the
help of guest lecturers/discussion leaders, we explore aspects of leadership in at least three of the fol-
lowing areas: clinical medicine and patient care, international health, basic science discovery and/or
applied research, ethics, and health care evaluation.
Evaluation is based on active student participation and a paper on selected aspects of leadership in
health or epidemiologic analysis based on analysis of original literature concerning a topic of personal
interest.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 12.
Cost to student: $150 for books and reading materials.

CHEM 15 Materials of the Artist: Uncovering Fakes and Forgeries (Same as ArtH 15 and
ArtS 15)
Many artists' materials (in the form of support, pigments, coatings, and binding media) existed in very
specific times throughout history. Knowing this, we can create a timeline and begin to date art objects
by examining their material and how each object was manufactured. In this class, we choose an object
of questionable authenticity and immerse ourselves in it. For example, a painting of questionable au-
thenticity will have the pigments analyzed, the media analyzed, an x-ray will be taken, showing the
paint strokes and method of application. In some cases, a technique called an infrared reflectography
will be utilized to view the underdrawing--the artist (or forgers) original sketches. Visual examina-
tions combined with sophisticated analytical instrumentation will be used to identify the materials of
the object and its method of manufacture. Instruments may include: x-ray fluorescence analysis,
Fourier transform infrared spectrometer, x-ray diffraction, gas chromatography, and scanning elec-
tron microscope. All classes will be held at either the Williamstown Conservation Center under the
direction of the analytical chemist and conservator, or in the Bronfman Science Center.
Evaluation is based upon class participation and a 10-page final paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 9.
Cost to student: $20 for reading materials.
Meeting time: mornings; twice a week for three hours and two hours/person/week beyond class time.

CLASSICS
CLAS 11 The Religions of the Roman Empire and Christianity (Same as Religion 11)
This course will survey some of the many religions that existed within the boundaries of the Roman
empire in the two centuries before and after the birth of Jesus. Taking into account the particular inter-
ests of students who register for this course, it will consider not only the "traditional" state and domes-
tic cults of Rome but also the imperial cult, various mystery religions, and early Christianity. We will
begin by briefly examining how the Romans themselves defined their religion and its purpose(s) and
consider how this definition contrasted with that of participants in the mystery cults and that of early
Christians. We will also examine how the Roman authorities used various cults/religions as political
tools to secure the empire. Finally, through our answers to these questions, we will explore the Roman
authorities' reaction to Christianity.
Each student will be expected to write two papers (10-20 pages total). In a shorter paper students will
try to put themselves in the position of a "traditional" Roman and write about either what they would
believe about their own gods or their resistance to one of the new mystery cults. The longer paper will
be on a topic of each student's choice (after consultation with the instructor), and each student will also
present an oral report on the topic of this paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15. Preference given to majors in Classics and Religion.
Cost to student: less than $15.
Meeting time: mornings, three times a week.

CLAS 12 The Ovidian Renaissance
Ovid's Metamorphoses, a rich and varied poem unified by the theme of physical transformation, was
unmatched as a source of inspiration for Renaissance artists working across a variety of media. We
will explore the ways Ovid's poem figures in artistic works from the Renaissance, including drama,
poetry, painting, sculpture, and music. We will begin by reading the Metamorphoses with a view to-
ward appreciating the stories, themes, and narrative techniques that have long made his work so
appealing. We will then explore the ways figures such as Shakespeare, Spenser, Marlowe, Titian, Ber-
nini, and Monteverdi incorporate and re-imagine Ovid's poem in their own work. We will consider
Ovid's influence on later artists, the contribution of later works to our understanding of Ovid, and the
relationships between various kinds of art.
Requirements: several presentations and a final 10-page paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15.

COMPARATIVE LITERATURE
COMP 11 The Colonialist Visions
From the peak of imperialism to its decline, what were the myths, observations, and prejudices that in-
formed the European view of the colonial enterprise? How is the relationship between colonialists and the
colonized expressed in literature and film? This course will examine what happens to the novel when it ex-
plicitly confronts issues of race, class and ideology, oppression and resistance, the individual and the mass,
the meeting of two radically different cultures and systems of belief. Do men and women narrate the colo-
nialist experience differently? The texts will include some fiction by postcolonial writers. Fiction by Con-
rad, Flaubert, Kipling, Foster, Dineson. Films include adaptations of Foster's Kipling's, and Dineson's
works, and the documentary about Sara Baartman, "the Hottentot Venus."

ECON 10 Excel for Economics
This course is an introduction to the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet software, with applications to eco-
nomics, finance, business, and public policy analysis. A variety of Excel commands and tools will be
introduced, and then applied to examples such as analyzing an investment project, modeling the de-
termination of stock prices, finding data and evaluating evidence on a question of public policy, and
effectively communicating information with a graph or table. These are all invaluable skills for many
of the kinds of jobs Williams students commonly pursue after graduation. Readings will include The
Visual Display of Quantitative Information by Edward Tufte, as well as a guidebook for using Excel
for financial modeling, and some accessible articles on the substantive aspects of economics, finance,
or public policy involved in each application.
Evaluation will be based on a number of hands-on problem sets.
No prerequisites. Preference will be given to students with no prior experience with Finance and with
Excel, and to freshmen and sophomores. Students who have taken Economics 317 (Finance and Capi-
tal Markets) will not be admitted. Enrollment limit: 20.

ECON 11 "Inside" Information Policy
In the post-Enron, Worldcom, Adelphia etc. capital market the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 has sub-
stantially altered the legal framework of the Federal securities laws. Those laws, in the name of preser-
ving "transparency" and with it investor confidence, impose substantial restrictions on how and who
may use information about a public corporation. In addition, Regulation FD ("Fair Disclosure")
adopted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in August 2000, when Arthur Levitt, Jr. '52
was its Chair, attempts to insure that any release of information is made available to all, not just some
investors. Breaking these rules can result in giving up any profit made, substantial fines or even im-
prisonment. Yet some information is different from other information. How do we know what is "in-
side" information and an asset of the business and what is not? Does the theoretical basis for these le-
gally mandated policies on disclosing information, the so-called "efficient" market hypotheses, make
sense? And is there a problem of information overload? What ought a corporate manager do? And
does speaking of "ought" raise issues of ethics and personal standards that transcend legal norms?
Evaluation will be based on class participation and an essay examination requiring analysis of a given
fact pattern. Independent reading and in class reports will be considered for additional credit.
No prerequisites. Some familiarity with business developments from TV, newspapers or magazines
may prove helpful.Enrollment limit: 25.

ECON 12 Blogonomics
The ability to disseminate intellectual and creative works has traditionally been a scarce resource. In
addition to facilitating the creation of intellectual and creative works, information technology, and the
Internet in particular, has enabled many creators to widely disseminate their works without relying on
traditional intermediaries such as newspapers, magazines, software firms, publishing houses, radio
and television stations, and music labels. In this course, we shall look at these technological innova-
tions and consider their impacts on what gets created, how it gets disseminated, and who, if anybody,
pays for it.
Students will be required to produce intellectual or creative content and distribute it to the world via
the Internet. Dissemination may be by blog, iPodcast, or other agreed-upon means. Exhibition of this
project on the last day of Winter Study is required. Attendance and participation will also be taken into
account.

ECON 13 Art and Economics
Art and economics are two disciplines that might seem incongruent. Economics is sometimes por-
trayed as being all about the money while art may just be for art's sake. Even if the art itself transcends
many of the worldly issues of economics, it cannot escape the standard forces of economics. For ex-
ample, artists must sell their work (unless, of course, they want to be starving artists). How is art sold?
Some art is sold at auction, some through dealers, and some artists work through commissions. Why
are different types of art sold through these different mechanisms? What determines the price of art?
Collectors buy art for its enjoyment (or consumption) value as well as its investment potential. How
can one use economics to measure the success of buying art as an investment? In addition to collec-
tors, institutions such as museums also buy art. What are the economics of an art museum? What is the
role for private donations, public subsidies, and entrance fees in sustaining museums? What is an ap-
propriate role for government in the economics of art? Should the government subsidize art? If so,
should the subsidies focus on the creation of art or the preservation and exhibition of art? How should
the government decide what art to subsidize? These are some of the questions that this class will ex-
plore.
Students will prepare a 10-page project based on one of the major themes of the course.
No prerequisites. While the course will use some economic concepts that are covered in Economics
110, the goal of the course is to be a self-contained coverage of how economic analysis can be used to
think about art and art markets. Students who are not economics majors are encouraged to take the
class.

ECON 14 Accounting
The project will examine the theoretical and practical aspects of financial accounting. Although the
beginning of the course will explore the mechanics of the information gathering and dissemination
process, the course will be oriented mainly towards users, rather than preparers, of accounting infor-
mation. The project will include discussion of the principles involved in accounting for current assets,
plant assets, leases, intangible assets, current liabilities, stockholders' equity, the income statement
and the statement of cash flows. Students will be expected to interpret and analyze actual financial
statements. The nature of, and career opportunities in, the field of accounting will also be discussed.
The project is a "mini course." It will present a substantial body of material and will require a consid-

ECON 15 Stock Market
Elementary description and analysis of the stock market. Emphasis will be on the roles of the market
in our economy, including evaluation of business firms and the success of particular capital invest-
ments, allocating savings to different types of investment, and providing liquid and marketable finan-
cial investments for individual savers.
The course will focus on the description of mechanics of trading on various exchanges and other mar-
kets, stock market indexes or "averages" (Dow-Jones, S&P, 500, etc.), how to read the financial news,
historical rates of return on stocks and portfolios, role of mutual funds, beta coefficients, and "random
walk" theory. The course will also involve a brief introduction to financial reports of firms and analy-
sis of financial ratios.
Each student will participate in discussions, do some homework assignments and, as part of a team,
give two presentations and write a 10-page report analyzing the wisdom or folly of having chosen a
particular investment portfolio. The project grade will be determined on the basis of performance on
several quizzes and the written investment portfolio report.

ECON 16 LEGO Mindstorms Robotics
Robotics has been an exciting topic for decades. Current technology allows students to design, build,
and program their own robots using the Lego Mindstorms system. It is straightforward to build the ro-
bots, as they are very similar to Legos toys. Programming the robots may be done using the graphical
software that comes with the Mindstors kits, or one may use more sophisticated, JAVA based soft-
ware. During the first part of the course, students will familiarize themselves with the tools and soft-
ware by creating robots that fulfill a relatively simple set of tasks, such as measuring distance, follow-
ing a maze, and drawing letters. The first project will be done using both the graphical software and
the JAVA based system to ensure programming mastery. After a basic competency in the tools is
reached, the students will propose a more complex project. After instructor approval, the students will
design, build, and program their final project. It may be possible to provide mentoring for local chil-
dren interested in robotics by allowing them to come and interact with the class.
Students will be evaluated on completing the initial projects, as well as on their design and imple-
mentation of their final project. There will also be an exhibition of the project at the end of Winter
Study.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 14.
Cost to student: approximately $10.

ECON 17 Business Economics
In this course, the class will carry out a real-time forecast of the U.S. economy and explore its implica-
tions for the bond and stock markets. The course will build upon principles of both macro and micro-
economics. It will provide an introduction to the work done by business economists and the tech-
niques they use. An economic database, chart-generating software and a statistical analysis program
will be available to each student on the Jessup computers.
The first week will focus on becoming familiar with the database, looking for relationships between
key economic variables, and studying movements in interest rates over the period 1960-2004. Early in
the first week, the class will be divided into teams of 2 or 3 students with each team choosing a particu-
lar aspect of the economy to forecast.
Winter Study Program
­ 354 ­
During the second and third weeks, the class will prepare forecasts of the key components of gross do-
mestic product and will study other key issues such as: Globalization, Energy Policy and the Outlook
for Oil Prices. We will also have several invited guests from the Wall Street investment world speak-
ing on various aspects of the stock market. The fourth week will feature a formal presentation of the
economic forecast with invited guests from the Williams College faculty among others.
The class will meet 3 to 4 times per week in the morning. During the first week there will be two after-
noons of workshops lasting approximately 30 minutes with hands on instruction for each team. Each
student should expect to spend a reasonable amount of time on homework, to participate in short pre-
sentations of their analyses as the work progresses as well as in the formal presentation during the last
week. There will also be a 3-page paper summarizing the result of the forecast project or the special
topic chosen by each team.
To put the forecasting exercise in context, there will be class discussions of business cycles, credit
cycles, long waves in inflation and interest rates and the impact of the Internet on the economy and the
stock market.
Prerequisites: Economics 120 or another semester course in Economics is strongly recommended.
Enrollment limit: 15.
Cost to student: about $25 for text and other materials.
Meeting time: mornings, 3-4 sessions per week. There will be two afternoons of workshops lasting

ECON 18 The American Dream?
The "American Dream"--the idea of achieving prosperity through hard work--contains home own-
ership as a central feature. In advertising and the popular press home ownership is sometimes consid-
ered the defining characteristic of the American Dream. In this course we will explore--through film,
literature, and economics--the role that home ownership plays in defining the economic aspirations
and identities of individuals in the United States and elsewhere. We will view and discuss three films
(Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House, House of Sand and Fog, and The Castle) that present the pa-
thetic, comic and tragic aspects of pursuing this dream. We will read and discuss A House for Mr.
Biswas by V. S. Naipaul, and consider the symbolic and economic significance of home ownership. In
addition to developing an appreciation for its importance, you will hear brief discussions of how an
economist might model the pursuit of home ownership and its significance for the economy, and learn
why so few Swiss own their own homes, and why a larger share of Irish, Spanish and Greeks achieve
the "American" dream than do the Americans themselves.
Evaluation will be based on participation in class discussions, two-page critical essays for each film,
plus a paper of at least 5 pages in length exploring themes from the book and class discussion.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19, with preference (in the event of over-enrollment) given to first-
years and sophomores.
Cost to student: $10 (for the book).

This course examines tax policy towards low-income families in the United States, and has the fol-
lowing three objectives: 1) For students to understand the shift of redistributive policy in the United
States from income support through the transfer system (Aid to Families with Dependent Children/
Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) towards support of working individuals through the tax
system (primarily the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)); 2) For students to understand the chal-
lenges that low income individuals have "making ends meet" and to understand the role that the EITC
has played in increasing the standard of living of the working poor; and 3) To enable students to under-
stand the tax code well enough to prepare simple income tax returns, including those for filers claim-
ing the EITC. Students will be trained by the IRS to prepare income tax returns for low-income indi-
viduals and families. At the end of the term, students will use their newly acquired expertise to help
individuals and families in Berkshire County prepare and file their returns.
Students must complete IRS VITA training; staff one session of tax preparation assistance during the
final week of winter term; and write a ten-page analytical and reflective essay.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 14.
Cost to student: $100 for texts and coursepack.

ECON 20 Introduction to the Economics, Geography and Appreciation of Wine
This course provides an introduction to the economics, geography and appreciation of wine. We will
be studying the economics and geography of wine production, and will also learn to identify, under-
stand and appreciate the major wine types of the world. The course will involve lectures, outside read-
ings, and in-class wine tastings. We will focus primarily on the Old World wine styles and regions in
France, Germany, Italy, Austria, Hungry, Spain and Portugal, but will occasionally make comparisons
to analogous New World style wines.
Evaluations will be based on short quizzes, including blind tastings, and either an oral presentation or
10 page paper at the conclusion of the course.
Enrollment limit: 10. Since the course will include wine tastings, it will also be restricted to those who
are of legal age for wine consumption by the date of the first class meeting. In the event that demand
exceeds the maximum limit for the course, students will be selected on the basis of their academic re-
cord.
Although this course will be no doubt fun and interesting, it is also a serious course in which students
are expected to learn the materials and skills presented in the lectures and wine tastings.
Cost to student: $150.
Meeting time: Monday evening with additional meetings to be determined.

ECON 23 Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) Model
A common tool for applied policy work is the Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model. These
models are used extensively by various NGO's when deciding aid and policy recommendations. Ad-
vanced undergraduates or masters students can attain a basic understanding of these models in a rela-
tively short time frame. The great advantage of these models is that they capture the general equilibri-
um feedback effects of policy proposals on various sectors of the economy. This is of great importance
to applied work, as this allows the identification of the winners and losers from potential policies. The
class will begin with a general overview of CGE models, followed by a detailed construction of a sim-
ple model for the US. During the latter part of the course, students will create a CGE model for a coun-
try of their choice (preferably their home country). This exercise will provide them with a basic model
to use to examine the possible effects of various changes in national policy. Interested students could
continue this project as a potential thesis topic.
Students will be evaluated using problem sets and their country-specific model.
Enrollment/prerequisites: this course is intended for CDE students and is open to undergraduates only
with permission of instructor.
Cost to student: approximately $25 for reading packets

ECON 27 Henry George, Eliminating Poverty
Henry George, an American economist (1839-1897) published Progress and Poverty in 1879. In this
he observes that with increasing wealth there is increasing poverty and he offers a solution to this
problem. We will study Progress and Poverty to understand his theory and his remedy and to under-
stand the possibility of its application today.
George's remedy is to tax land to the exclusion of all other taxes. Today the Georgist movement uses
this idea to encourage cities to modify the property tax, which, in most places, taxes land and buildings
at the same rate, to reduce the tax on buildings and to increase the tax on land to produce the same
yield. We will study the effect of shifting the property tax from buildings to land in the twenty Penn-
sylvania cities that have adopted this idea.
One of the great problems of the world today is that in many countries, a small minority of the people,
own most of the land. We will study the possible use of George's ideas to ameliorate this problem.
Evaluation will be based on attendance and the completion of a 10-page paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20.
Cost to student: none.
Meeting time: mornings, two hours three times a week.

ENGL 11 Anxious Allegories: Horror and Science Fiction Films
This film course will also be a casual tutorial on popular American moods, both cultural and political,
and it will seek to place the films we study in the context of such trends as Fifties conformism and
dread of Communism or the post-Watergate mistrust of government. The class will examine the pos-
sibility that what unites these loose allegories is not only their expression of once-popular fears, but
also their campiness--their impulse to subvert our solemnities, whether intentionally or inadvertent-
ly. The films will include Halloween, Village of the Damned, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, Dawn of
the Dead, Eyes Without a Face, Forbidden Planet, The Exorcist, Them, Starship Trooper, The Shin-
ing, Rosemary's Baby, and The Ring.

ENGL 12 Looking at Contemporary Documentary Photography (Same as Special 27)
This course explores the evolution of modern documentary photography. We will start with Robert
Frank's The Americans, and how Frank's singular vision deeply shaped the next generation of pho-
tographers working the American streets and landscape. Diane Arbus, Bruce Davidson, Lee Freid-
lander, William Klein, Danny Lyon, Gary Winogrand are some of the photographers whose work we
will get to know well . Discussions will include the new wave of independent and Magnum photojour-
nalists (Phillip Jones Griffiths, Josef Koudleka, Susan Meiselas, Gilles Peress, James Nachtwey, Alex
Webb, Ron Haviv and Tyler Hicks) and the wars from Vietnam to Bosnia to Iraq they cover as well as
the personal visions they explore. Insight into the diverse currents of documentary photography will
be covered through the work of Bill Burke, Larry Clark, Larry Fink, Nan Goldin, Emmet Gowin, Sal-
ly Mann, Mary Ellen Mark, Nicholas Nixon, Richard Misrach, Joel Sternfeld, Birney Imes, Regan
Louie, Edward Burtynsky, Laura Letinsky and Simon Norfolk.
Each student will be required to make a brief presentation to the class on a documentary topic of their
choice. A final paper expanding on this documentary topic will be due at the end of the course. Stu-
dents will be evaluated on their classroom presentation, general participation and their written work.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 12.
Meeting time: three mornings a week for two hours. Slide presentations will occupy half of the first
meetings and give way to discussion of issues in documentary photography. Students will be encour-
aged to work on individual projects of their own choice. A field trip to New York will let us see first
hand works from the collections at the Museum of Modern Art, Whitney Museum of American Art
and the International Center of Photography.

ENGL 13 White Coat, Black Coat: Literature and Medicine
This course will introduce students to the long and substantial tradition of imaginative literature about
medicine, encompassing both work by physicians who were/are themselves distinguished writers and
Winter Study Program
­ 357 ­
texts written from the patient's perspective. We shall focus especially on two of this literature's defin-
ing functions: its concern with "speaking the unspeakables" of medicine, the major but often unspo-
ken issues in doctor-patient relationships and in doctors' professional lives as a whole (e.g., detach-
ment, emotional involvement, spirituality, sexuality, feelings of competence and failure), and its high-
lighting of political, social, and cultural issues in health care frequently overlooked in traditional med-
ical education and training. Readings may include: Chekhov's Ward Number Six, Tolstoy's The Death
of Ivan Ilych, selections from William Carlos Williams' Doctor Stories, the poems of Dannie Abse
and John Stone, the stories of Susan Onthank Mates and Thom Jones, contemporary narratives of ill-
ness by Reynolds Price, Lucy Grealy, and Kay Redfield Jamison, and samples from the early litera-
ture of the AIDS epidemic (e.g., Larry Kramer, Paul Monette).
Open to anyone concerned about the subject, but preference to students planning careers in health care
or health policy and students confronting these issues in their own lives or communities. Evaluation
will be based on the completion of two short writing assignments. Attendance and participation will
also be taken into account.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15.
Cost to student: approximately $40 for books.

ENGL 14 Poetry and Painting
In his essay on the relations between poetry and painting, Wallace Stevens asserts a deep affinity:
"Where the poet does his job by virtue of an effort of the mind he is in rapport with the painter, who
does his job with respect to the problems of form and color." Stevens continues an ancient tradition:
long before Horace uttered his famous formulation, "ut pictura poesis," the Greek poet Simonides
said that "poetry is a speaking picture, painting a silent poem." In 1712 Shaftesbury warned his read-
ers to be suspicious of such equations: comparisons and parallels between painting and poetry are, he
wrote, "almost ever absurd and at best constrained, lame and defective." After acquainting ourselves
with the history of this debate, we will study particular poems and paintings, as well as the collabora-
tions between painters and poets. We will confine ourselves to Western writers and painters including:
Blake, Lessing, Ruskin, Turner, Stein, Auden, Stevens, Williams, Demuth, Creeley and Katz.
Requirements: one 10-page paper.

ENGL 15 Victorian Monsters
Victorian fiction conjured many of the monsters that still haunt our cultural imagination: Franken-
stein, Dracula, Jekyll and Hyde, and miraculously resurrected (or surviving) dinosaurs. This course
will focus on the original novels and stories from which these mythic figures emerged: Mary Shelley's
Frankenstein, Robert Louis Stevenson's "The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" Bram Stok-
er's Dracula, and Arthur Conan Doyle's The Lost World, considering their engagement with the dom-
inant cultural anxieties of their day and the grounds of their enduring appeal. We will also discuss a
few of the myriad film permutations of these stories, and students will do independent projects on the
evolution of one of these figures in popular culture.
Requirements: one 4- to 5-page paper and one presentation.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15.

ENGL 19 Structuring Your Novel
This course is particularly designed for students who are currently wallowing in the morass of their
own novels, or who imagine themselves diving in and want to test the mud. Class time will be divided
between lecture/discussions and workshops; for the first half of the course, we'll talk about different
kinds of novels and different strategies for building them. I'll ask you to complete a number of short
sketches or plot summaries, which we will discuss in class. But you'll also be working on a longer,
more detailed summary, a scene-by-scene breakdown of an extended piece of prose fiction, which can
either be some pre-existing project you bring in from outside the class, or else something generated
out of the first two weeks. During the second half of the course, we will workshop these. The goal is to
finish with one functioning, detailed outline and several small workable sketches. Please note that our
time constraints will not permit us to look at or discuss in class any portions of an actual novel, but
only these plot skeletons. I may, however, have time outside of class to look at some finished prose.

ENGL 20 Hypnosis and Social Knowledge
What is hypnosis? What does it suggest about the vulnerability of the self to social and artistic influ-
ence? This course will explore such questions by looking at hypnosis as a narrative subject and as a
model for the relationship of artwork to viewer. Simultaneously we will consider the ways hypnosis is
actually used in psychotherapy and live theater, comparing its powers and limits in social practice to
those imagined for it in art.
Materials for the course will include critical and historical readings; novels and films (for example,
George Du Maurier's Trilby, John Frankenheimer's The Manchurian Candidate, Werner Herzog's
Heart of Glass, the Farrelly Brothers' Shallow Hal) and self-hypnosis CDs. If possible, we'll take an
all-day field trip to watch a performing hypnotist in action.
Evaluation will be based on rigorous class attendance, participation in class and on the field trip, and
completion of a 12-page paper comparative paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15.
Cost to student: $100, for books and field trip.
Meeting time: 9:00-noon, Monday and Wednesday mornings, and one day-long field trip to be ar-

but returned there after the war. His intellectual contributions are too extensive to list--he produced
groundbreaking work in philosophy, musicology, literary criticism, sociology, and political theory.
His magnum opus is called Negative Dialectics, and its questions will be our questions: What is the
responsibility of philosophy in the face of suffering? What kind of thinking is possible in a world re-
duced to rubble? Is it possible to produce a form of thought that does not dominate others, that cannot
be put in the service of their domination? We will read all of Negative Dialectics with occasional, ex-
planatory forays into Adorno's philosophical opponents.
Students will write a single 15-page paper.

ENGL 27 Piracy or Freedom? File Sharing, Open Source and Seed Patents: the Battle
over Intellectual Property
"The Information Wants to Be Free!" Or does it? This course examines the role of copyright, patents,
and other forms of intellectual property ("IP") protection in the digital age. Students will be
introduced to a variety of viewpoints on information sharing and will explore the implications of cur-
rent U.S. and international laws and conventions regarding the protection of various forms of IP, par-
ticularly music, films, computer software, and genetically-modified foods.
The history and evolution of IP protections will be discussed, as will the current systems used to com-
pensate information creators (musicians, filmmakers, computer programmers, bioengineers, etc.).
Battles over the control of IP--from Napster and MP3s to subsistence farmers in India and patented
seed corn--will be explored. Finally, recent innovations in information sharing and protection--in-
cluding CopyLeft, the General Public License, Creative Commons, the Digital Millennium Copyright
Act, Business Method Patents, and others--will be introduced and debated.
Although many legal issues will be discussed, the nature of the inquiry pursued in this course is philo-
sophical, not legal.
Evaluation will be based on a final paper, minimum 10 pages in length, presenting and justifying the
student's position on the complex issues examined in the course. Attendance and class participation
will also be taken into account.

ENVI 11 Images of Greylock: Interpreting Landscape Change (Same as Biology 11 and
INTR 11)
The highest peak in southern New England (at 3491 feet above mean sea level) has long attracted the atten-
tion of residents, outdoor enthusiasts (Timothy Dwight in 1800), literati (including Hawthorne and Mel-
ville), and, led Henry David Thoreau to remark "It would be no small advantage if every college were thus
located at the base of a mountain..." Mt. Greylock has also been the subject of over a century of photogra-
phy, a medium that has produced an archive of the natural disturbances (hurricanes, landslides, blizzards,
etc.) and human interventions (agriculture, logging, charcoal production, road building, tower construc-
tion, etc.) that have occurred on its slopes. The purpose of this course is to collect and interpret historical
images of Mt. Greylock, to digitally restore them, to interpret changes in evident in series of photographs
made at the same location through time, and to document the contemporary views of these sites. The prod-
uct of this endeavor will be a group digital research paper on the historical changes of the Mt. Greylock
landscape, with each student contributing a chapter on a different view.
Evaluation will be based on participation in the collection, restoration, and interpretation of images and
production of the digital research paper.
Prerequisites: none, but access to a high quality digital camera will be helpful. Enrollment limit: 10. Prefer-
ence given to those who have an interest in photographic history and interpretation. Interested students
should contact the instructor and complete a short questionnaire.
Cost to student: approximately $40 for texts.

ENVI 17 Alaska: Land of Pipelines or Pipe Dreams?
The North has frequently been both characterized and mischaracterized by the many waves of miners,
homesteaders, poets, easterners and westerners that have settled there. It is a storehouse of resources, a pris-
tine wilderness, the last great place, or "the land that God forgot." How do we sort through this complexity
and arrive at a common sense of the North? Is this possible or even desirable?
In this seminar course we will approach this issue by posing four questions related to the North: 1) What
are the conflicted assumptions about land use and wilderness that Natives or non-natives hold in Alaska?
2) What are the key elements that describe and control the success or failure of northern development pro-
jects? 3) Is there a pattern, language, or mode of analysis which can be used to best analyze and represent
these issues? And, finally, 4) Is there any way that our twenty-first century world views of wilderness can
lead effectively to sustainable development in Alaska?
These and other questions will be approached through the examination of certain Northern case stu-
dies--the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill and Alyeska, gold extraction in the Pogo and Pebble mines, mining zinc
and lead at Red Dog, the Bering Sea Fisheries and Project Chariot.
Format: seminar/project. Evaluation will be based upon a demonstrated feverish class interest and partici-
pation as well as a 10-page individual report on a topic of the student's own choosing.

Many environmental issues--air and water quality, land use and conservation, toxic chemicals and
hazardous waste, environmental justice issues, public parks, beaches, and forests, and wildlife and
their habitat--are decided, or strongly influenced, at the state level. This course examines how state
environmental laws and policies are made, how they relate to those of national and local governments,
and the effect those laws and policies have on the resources and values that people care about. Topics
to be covered will include: federalism and environmental policy; the role of the media and organized
interest groups in state environmental policy making; environmental justice in state law and policy;
and the electoral significance --or lack thereof--of environmental issues. The course will include
field trips to two state capitols, Boston and Montpelier, for meetings with state officials, media, and
advocacy groups.

GEOSCIENCES
GEOS 11 Science of Jurassic Park
The movie "Jurassic Park" was the one of the biggest hits in American film history and it sparked re-
newed interest in dinosaurs. What are the paleontological facts and theories behind the story and the
dinosaur reconstructions used in this movie? The course will analyze the movie and the book it was
based on by Michael Crichton. We will also read Raptor Red anovel by a "real paleontologist" to learn
more about the world of the dinosaurs. Through discussion we will consider the feasibility of DNA
recombination for recreating dinosaurs. Also we will consider the various facts and interpretations of
dinosaur reproduction, their digestive system, metabolism, locomotion, defense and attack systems,
and their intelligence.
Required reading: Michael Crichton: Jurassic Park, Robert T. Bakker: Raptor Red, selected passages
from DeSalle & Lindley: The Science of Jurassic Park and The Lost World, and a selection of other
scientific dinosaur articles.
Students are expected to write a 10-page paper on a dinosaur topic and present the result orally for

Green and Hoosic Rivers, is a place of great natural beauty. The local landscape is a subject that in-
spires both professional and amateur photographers alike. While Williamstown will be the subject of
most of our work, we will use it to learn principles of universal application. Students will discover the
importance of light in making a photograph. They will also learn camera skills and the mechanics of
photography to make slides, which will be reviewed at biweekly class meetings.
In addition to photographing and critiquing slides, the class will visit collections at the Clark Art Insti-
tute and WCMA to see original work and examine and discuss books on reserve at Sawyer Library.

GEOS 25 Caves and Karst Geology of Northern Spain
From artistic sanctuary for early cultures to drinking water reservoirs for modern cities, cave systems
serve as a vital, albeit mysterious, cradle for civilizations. The stalagmites and stalagtites that adorn
many caves provide important archives of past climate. Rounded cobbles cemented high on cave
walls tell of the underground river systems that once carved channels through the rock, abandoned as
the rivers cut down into deeper levels of the earth. In this field course we explore the geology and
hydrology of the cave and karst system in the Asturias-Cantabrian region of northern Spain. This area
has dramatic relief with 9,000 foot mountains within 100 miles of the scenic rocky coast, a rich cultur-
al history of prehistoric cave paintings. We will work in several cave systems, mapping evidence for
ancient river levels, identifying promising stalagmite fields for paleoclimate reconstruction and mak-
ing preliminary chemical analysis on stalagmites We will also evaluate cave hydrology and risk of
groundwater contamination to cave aquifer systems. Our field work in caves will complement ex-
amination of geological and topographic maps, analysis of historical climatic data, and our ongoing
monitoring of cave dripwater chemistry in the area. In Northern Spain, we will be based in dorms at
the University of Oviedo but will take one extended field trip. Students will complete team projects
including a final poster presentation at the end of the course.
Reasonable physical condition is strongly recommended for moderate hiking inside and outside of the
cave systems. Preference is given to students who have taken a 200 level Geosciences course or who
have other comparable science and field experience.
Enrollment limit: 8.
Students will learn basic geological field techniques and have the opportunity to contribute to original
research on karst hydrology in the area. Final projects will allow them to apply this knowledge of karst
hydrogeology to specific problems, including protection of cave painting resources, protection of
groundwater resources, reconstruction of past climates, and river incision records.
Cost to student: approximately $1500.

on the assumption that Truth is not only knowable but also readily accessible to most, if not all, hu-
mans throughout their lives. Hence, it views humans not as striving toward Truth, as usually repre-
sented in or by biology, art, history, philosophy, literature, psychology, physics, and religion (among
other disciplines), but instead as struggling to evade It. Scicyn was first proposed by F. I. Breucker, a
German-American thinker who died in 2000. She laid out its principles, core terms, and main lines of
inquiry. Her unpublished writings are being compiled and edited by Bruce Kieffer. Introduction #43
presents scicyn in a form that is sufficiently compatible with academic styles of reading and discus-
sion as to be suitable for a WSP course. We will approach scicyn by focusing on its stance towards
those thinkers and writers who are often judged the most cynical in Western intellectual and literary
history: Diogenes of Sinope, Machiavelli, Hobbes, Baudelaire, Nietzche, and Beckett. We will read
selected texts by and on these figures and consider Breucker's critiques of them as unscientific and
therefore false cynics. All readings in English.
Requirements: active participation, three 3- to 4-page presentations/papers.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15. Preference to seniors.
Cost to student: less than $30.
Meeting time: three 2-hour morning meetings weekly.

HISTORY
HIST 10 "Queer" in the 'Fifties: British Histories and Identities
As currently used, the term "queer" refers to any number of identities and practices that fall outside the
realm of normative heterosexuality. By contrast, the term had a more limited meaning in Great Britain
in the 1950s: it was simply the term of choice used by many homosexual men to designate them-
selves-men who viewed the term "gay" to be an offensive, American vulgarism. But what did it actu-
ally mean to be "queer" in Britain in the 1950s? How was homosexuality understood and "queerness"
experienced by men in this decade? This course will attempt to address these questions through an ex-
amination of the historical evidence of a way of life that today, half a century later, seems increasingly
alien, archaic and remote. In many respects, the period from the late 1940s to early 1960s is a crucial
one in "queer" British history: it was then that an increasingly visible male homosexual subculture
Winter Study Program
­ 364 ­
elicited a number of "moral panics" in the media, that novelists and film-makers began to deal "hon-
estly" with what was termed the "problem of homosexuality," that a government commission (the
Wolfenden Committee) recommended the partial decriminalization of male homosexuality, and that a
cautiously reformist homosexual rights movement was established. This course will examine a wide
range of documentary evidence pertaining to these phenomena. We will consider works of fiction
(such as Mary Renault's The Charioteer and Rodney Garland's The Heart in Exile), two feature films
(Victim and The Leather Boys), autobiographies (Peter Wildeblood's Against the Law), official docu-
ments (The Wolfenden Report), tabloid newspaper articles, and a number of medical and psychologi-
cal treatises on the "condition" of homosexuality. In so doing we will attempt to map the complex ar-
ticulation of "deviant" male sexual identities in Britain in the 1950s and explore the subjective experi-
ence of a mode of selfhood very different from our own.
Evaluation based on class attendance and participation, one in-class presentation, and a 10-page pa-
per.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit:15 (preference, if oversubscribed, to students in History and
Women's and Gender Studies).
Cost to student: approximately $40 for books and course packet.
Meeting time: Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday afternoons and two additional film screenings.
WATERS
HIST 11 The Great Kahoona: The Surfer in the Modern Popular Imagination
In his 1784 A Voyage to the Pacific Ocean, Captain James Cook became the first westerner to describe
the ancient Polynesian sport of surfing. Observing a wave-rider in Tahiti, Cook wrote, "I could not
help concluding that this man felt the most supreme pleasure while he was driven on so fast and so
smoothly by the sea." Since then, the sport of surfing has fascinated the modern popular imagination
for its graceful beauty, communion with the sea, and laid-back life-style. This winter study explores
the evolution of the image of the surfer in modern American literature and cinema. We will survey
what literary luminaries like Mark Twain, Herman Melville, Jack London, and Tom Wolfe had to say
about surfing, and we will read three classic surf novels, Daniel Duane's Caught Inside, Kem Nunn's
The Dogs of Winter, and Alan C. Weisbecker's In Search of Captain Zero. We will also watch some of
the most influential movies for the evolution of the image of the surfer-dude (and surfer-babe), such as
Gidget, The Endless Summer, Big Wednesday, Apocalypse Now, Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Blue
Crush, and Riding Giants. The goals of this winter study are to instill students with an appreciation of
surfing's colorful history and culture, give them a taste of the "stoke," and inspire at least some of
them to take up the sport.
Evaluation will be based on attendance, participation, attitude, and a 10-page final paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 30 (expected: 10-20).
Cost to student: approximately $50.00 for books. (Attire in Hawaiian shirts is recommended but not
required.)
Meeting time: afternoons, Tuesday and Wednesday.
GOLDBERG
HIST 12 The Unremembered Genocide: the Armenian Genocide
Between the years 1915 and 1923, the Ottoman Turkish government engaged in the systematic mass
murder of its Armenian population, killing some one and a half million Armenians. Yet, outside of Ar-
menian communities, few people know about this genocide. Through film, literature, and primary
sources, we will study the history of the Armenian genocide and the Armenians' moral and political
struggle to gain worldwide recognition of the genocide. In addition, we will spend one class session
each week researching primary source documents related to the assigned texts, which include Franz
Werfel's best-selling novel from the 1930s The Forty Days of Musa Dagh, director Atom Egoyan's
2002 film Ararat, and selected memoirs and historical accounts.
Evaluation will be based on completion of three short research assignments (3-4 pages each), atten-
dance, and class participation.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15. Priority to first-years and sophomores.
Cost to student: $40 for books and photocopies.
Meeting times: mornings. We will meet three times a week for two-hour sessions. Each week, one ses-
sion will focus on developing research skills and conducting research. The other two sessions each
week will be dedicated to discussion of readings and films.

HIST 13 The Historian as Detective
This course will bring students into close physical and intellectual contact with the papers of notable
nineteenth-century Americans: Presidents, literary figures, and leading social reformers. Students
will have a rare opportunity to work with original manuscripts of people like Governor Thomas
Hutchinson, Thomas Jefferson, John Qunicy Adams, Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, Wil-
liam Cullen Bryant, John Brown, and Dorothea Dix, to cite a few representative examples. All docu-
Winter Study Program
­ 365 ­
ments are part of the Chapin Library's manuscript holdings, and all work for this course will be done
in Williamstown.
Research into any historical topic requires some knowledge of what historical editors do and frequent-
ly calls for editing on the part of the researcher. It is detective work that begins with the simple exis-
tence of a document but then turns it over, analyzes it, relates it, evaluates it, and finally draws conclu-
sions. In this course students will learn to transcribe a document accurately and to make sense of it as
well.
In the first week daily classes will introduce past and present editorial practices and rationales and al-
low work on more easily read Presidential letters. In sessions during each of the second and third
weeks, additional points of historical editing will be discussed, while work is done on somewhat more
challenging letters in the William Cullen Bryant papers and the "reformer files" of the Julia Ward and
Samuel Gridley Howe papers. Class sessions will be held at the end of the fourth week in which stu-
dents will present and discuss an important historical or literary document or letter series each has ear-
lier selected for editing.
Students will be expected to attend all class meetings and present a medium-length paper on the docu-
ment or letter series each student selects as his or her special editing project. The instructors also ex-
pect everyone who registers for this course to commit themselves to the hard work and high research
standards required in serious historical editing.
Enrollment limit: 10.
Cost to student: less than $50 for books and Xerox materials.
Meeting time: mornings, 2-3 times per week. Original documents students will be working with will
be available for consultation from 1-5 p.m., Monday-Friday in Chapin Library.

HIST 14 American Wars: Directed Independent Reading and Research
An independent reading and research course on American wars from colonial times to the present. All
participants will share a few common readings, but there will be no formal classes. Instead, each par-
ticipant will meet individually with the instructor to develop a unique reading list on a topic of their
choice. Once their topic is decided, they will spend the rest of the Winter Study researching and writ-
ing a substantial paper (at least 25 pages) on their topic.
Prerequisites: none, except interest in American military history. Enrollment limit: 20.
Cost to student: $40 for books.
Meeting time: no formal classes.
WOOD
HIST 15 Martin Luther King Jr.'s Moral Vision for Today
We hear much these days about the role of "moral vision" in American politics and social change.
Conservatives seem to have cornered the market on moral values and vision, while progressives and
"secular fundamentalists" flounder in fostering their own moral discourse. This has not always been
the case. During the 1960s the progressive moral vision was a force to be reckoned with, especially as
articulated by Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and the Civil Rights Movement. King's prophetic vision is
even more relevant for our time as for his own. This course will explore King's prophetic moral vision
as a "work in progress"--looking at its grounding in African-American spirituality, its shaping by his
mentors and fellow leaders, and how it deepened to grapple with issues of global peace, economic jus-
tice, human rights, and his "revolution of values." Two films will be shown: Citizen King and The
Promised Land.
Each student will write a 10-page essay on how King's vision speaks to current issues of racism, sex-
ism, homophobia, war, terrorism, poverty, planetary peril, depersonalization, and faith-based politics.
Full class participation mandatory.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20.
Cost to student: approximately $50 for reading materials.
Meeting time: 2-3 afternoons per week.

HIST 16 Genealogy
In this course, students will become familiar with the basic methodology of genealogical research and
use this information to create a family history. Students will conduct research using primary and sec-
ondary sources, including vital records (birth, marriage and death certificates), federal and state cen-
sus records, immigration records, military service and pension records, naturalization records, pro-
bate and court records, newspapers, city directories, and published genealogies. Students will index
vital records in Williamstown Berkshire County and Pownal Bennington County Vermont to learn
what information is included in the records and become familiar with computerized databases. The
course will be held at the National Archives and Records Adminstration Center at Conte Drive Pitts-
field to gather Federal Records and then include field trips to local libraries, local town clerks offices .
Students will complete a family history using both secondary and primary sources. They will become
familiar with the process of historical research including formulating theories, finding evidence
through various media (including oral interviews, records, ephemera, and published sources), and
drawing conclusions based on that research.

HIST 17 American Strategy in World War II: War Plans and Execution
During the Second World War, the United States fought a global conflict. By late 1943, for example,
American forces were in combat in Italy, New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, and the Central Pacific.
The war against the U Boat threat and the air war against Germany continued with increasing intensi-
ty, and the allied staffs were engaged in planning the 1944 invasion of France. To achieve the nation's
basic political objective-the unconditional surrender of Germany and Japan--the United States de-
vised a series of strategic and operational war plans for both the European and Pacific areas of opera-
tion. A number of factors including inter-allied and inter-service disputes, logistics, and enemy ac-
tions frequently led to results that were quite different from the planners' expectations. The course
will examine the major U.S. war plans using selected readings and a number of actual plans. The
course will then explore the realities of battle and the differences between plans and execution.
Requirements: class participation, attendance, and a 10-page essay.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 30.
Cost to student: $40 for books and Xeroxes.
Meeting time: afternoons, twice a week for three hours.

LATS 10 Gender and the Latino Urban Scene
Conventionally the urban scene has been imagined and portrayed in strictly masculine terms. In this
course, we will review classic and more contemporary texts about Latino city life in an effort to think
more critically about how males and females, specifically Latinos and Latinas, experience, navigate,
and possess urban milieus. Working with ethnography, literature, critical essays, and film, we will
consider how gender as well as race and class is depicted, performed, and inscribed in notions of ur-
banity. Course materials include, but are not limited to, ethnographic studies by Elena Padilla, fiction
by Piri Thomas and Angie Cruz, and the films Girlfight and Manito.
Evaluation will be based on class participation, class presentations, and one 10-page paper.

LEGAL STUDIES
LGST 13 The Law and the Literature of the Environment: The Environment on Trial (Same
as Environmental Studies 13)
This course will trace the development of an American consciousness towards the environment
through an examination of our law and our literature. It will consider the historical and political roots
of that development as well. The term "law" includes state and federal judicial decisions and legisla-
tion, particularly during the presidency of Theodore Roosevelt and during the decades which fol-
lowed the year 1960 when much of the legal basis for the American environmental protection move-
ment was established. The term "literature" includes not just the written word but also painting, sculp-
ture, and music. This course will examine the historical and legal choices we as Americans have made
which have put our environment on trial. What has occurred in our development as a people that ex-
plains this quintessentially American phenomenon? Our journey begins with the Puritans of New En-
gland and the planters of Virginia and their predecessors in the New World. Among the other subjects
to be considered are the influence of the frontier and the important role played by the ready availability
of seemingly endless land, Thomas Jefferson and the Lewis and Clark Expedition, Emerson and Tho-
reau, the paintings of Thomas Cole, Albert Bierstadt, Frederick Remington and others, the beginning
of the environmental protection movement in the later half of the 19th century, Frederick Jackson
Turner and the end of the frontier in 1890, the establishment through federal legislation of the forest
reserve and the national park systems, Theodore Roosevelt and the debate between conservation v.
preservation, as presented by Gifford Pinchot and John Muir, the music of Aaron Copeland, Woody
Guthrie and others, Rachel Carson and Silent Spring, environmental "trigger" disasters, the crucial
year, 1960, and the decades that followed, full of new laws and judicial opinions interpreting those
laws, NEPA, EPA and the evolving role of the courts, Mr. Justice Douglas' dissent in Sierra Club v.
Morton, and the approach of the current national administration.
Evaluation will be based on attendance and classroom participation. Students will prepare three short
papers, 3 to 4 pages each, which will present one or more sides of an issue and form the basis for class-
room discussion. They will be asked to defend or reject the conclusions reached or approaches taken
by our courts and legislatures and by our literature, as broadly defined, on environmental issues.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20.This course is appropriate for students eager to explore the ma-
terial presented and prepared to argue assigned positions on important legal, literary and historical is-
sues.

MATH 13 Roulette
Although only considered the "third" table game throughout casinos in the United States (behind
Blackjack and Craps), Roulette is a traditional and fascinating game, having its roots in 17th century
France. Part of the fascination for that game, besides its aristocratic feel is that it allows for both small
and huge wins and offers bets at relatively favorable odds. This course takes a closer, analytical look at
this elegant game. We will study basic probability concepts to derive odds for various bets and learn
how to use the computer to simulate various playing strategies, statistically analyzing their merits or
shortcomings.
Requirements: at least one of the three weekly meetings will be held in the computer lab.
Evaluation will be based on small weekly assignments and not on the amount of cyber dollars won.
No prerequisites are required other than a genuine interest in analytical thinking and computer pro-
gramming. Enrollment limit: 15.
Cost to student: none.

MATH 16 Knitting: The Social History and Craft Form (Same as Special 16)
Creating fabric out of interlocking loops can be traced back to the Neolithic period, and knitted like
artifacts 1600 to over 2000 years old have been found in Egypt, Peru, and Sweden. Knitting requires
little machinery and can be done almost anywhere yet requires a significant amount of learned skill.
Knitting techniques have been handed down through generations, shared in small groups, and trans-
ferred between cultures as trade routes emerged. The social history of knitting is a rich reflection of the
history of culture.
This course examines the social history and technique of this important craft. We will examine the so-
cial history of knitting through a sequence of readings, lectures, and discussions. Reading list in-
cludes: No Idle Hands: The History of American Knitting, by Anne L. MacDonald, related articles
provided by the instructor, and Reader's Digest Knitter's Handbook, by Montse Stanley.
We will engage a series of project samples designed to introduce and improve skills of beginning knit-
ters, starting with simple blanket squares, a knitted cap, and culminating in a final project of a basic
sweater. Students will also be required to select and research some aspect of knitting and write a
10-page research paper. Topics will need pre-approval of the instructor.
Evaluation will be based on participation, projects and a final 10-page research paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15. Preference will be given to first-year and beginning knitters.

MATH 17 Humor Writing (Same as Special 29)
What is humor? The dichotomy inherent in the pursuit of comedic intent while confronting the hercu-
lean task implicit in the comprehension of the transient nature of adversity can ratchet up the devolv-
ing psyche's penchant for explication to a catastrophic threshold, thwarting the ecstatic impulse and
pushing the natural proclivity for causative norms beyond the possibility of pre-situational adaptation.
Do you know what that means? If so, this is not the course for you. No, we will write funny stuff, day
in and day out. Or at the very least, we will think it's funny. Stories, essays, plays, fiction, nonfiction,
we'll try a little of each.
Is laughter the body's attempt to eject excess phlegm? Why did Plato write dialogues instead of mono-
logues? Who backed into my car in the Bronfman parking lot on the afternoon of March 2, 2004?
These are just a few of the questions we will explore in this course. Plan to meet 6 hours a week in the
morning, and to spend at least 20 hours a week on the course. No slackers need apply. Produce or be-
come produce. All students will submit at least one piece of work for publication.
Requirements: reading, attendance, participation and writing at least 20 pages of material.
Prerequisites: sense of humor (broadly interpreted.) Enrollment limit: 15.
Cost to student: no more than $30.
Meeting time: mornings.

MUS 11 Beethoven
This course provides an introduction to the life and music of Ludwig van Beethoven. The composer's
difficult childhood, tragic loss of hearing, clandestine affair with the "Immoral Beloved," tempestu-
ous relationship with his suicidal nephew Karl-biographical elements such as these, together with the
French Revolution and emergence of Romanticism, will form the backdrop for our study of his titanic
artistic struggles and monumental achievements. Students will listen to a broad cross section of Bee-
thoven's music, including piano sonatas, string quartets, symphonies, overtures, concertos, choral
works, and opera. We will explore his ties to Haydn, Mozart, and other composers, his fierce individu-
alism, and his impact on later generations, subjects linked to notions of artistic genius and the sublime.

MUS 15 Math and Music (Same as Mathematics 15)
The course examines some of the myriad ways that mathematics can shaper and inform ways we think
about musical structure, and conversely, how music can instantiate a number of beautiful mathemati-
cal structures and ideas. We will consider how group theory, number theory, probability and stochastic
methods can offer insights into the structure of musical systems (like tonality, and diatonic sets and
scales), into the analysis of individual pieces of music, and into the ways that music can be created and
perceived. We will explore, for example, how the mathematically unique properties of the diatonic set
Winter Study Program
­ 373 ­
(the collection of tones that underlies the major and minor scales) permit or give rise to tonality,
whether other musical universes (those with more or fewer chromatic tones) could exist that would
offer the same riches as our familiar 12-tone universe, and whether and how computers can be taught
to compose meaningful harmonic progressions. For non-math types, musical examples will be used to
present all relevant mathematical concepts.
Evaluation will be based on a series of musical/mathematical problem sets, designed to illustrate rele-
vant mathematical concepts and techniques. Students will then work on a topic of their choice (analy-
sis of a musical work, a composition based on a mathematical model, or on a speculative topic) about
which they will write a short (ca. 5 page) paper and give a class presentation.
Prerequisites: students need to be able to read musical notation. Enrollment limit: 12. Preference will
be given to math majors with musical performance experience or students who have taken a music
theory course.
Cost to student: none.
Meeting time: mornings, Monday, Wednesday and Friday 10-noon.

PHILOSOPHY
PHIL 10 Formal Logic
This course will introduce students to sentential and predicate logic. Its major goal is to give them the
ability to understand the kinds of formalization used in ordinary works of philosophy, i.e., texts that
are not intended primarily for specialists in logic. Depending upon the interests and rates of progres-
sion of the students, there may be some consideration of more advanced topics, such as modal and
tense logic.
Requirements: there will be readings for each class meeting, and usually problem sets.
Method of evaluation: problem sets, some to be completed in class.
Prerequisites: students who have taken courses in logic should not take this course without consulting
with the instructor. Math majors are unlikely to be challenged, but are welcome, particularly if they
are willing to try to help those in the class with less formal sophistication (including the instructor,
who is far from an expert and anticipates honing his relatively modest skills by "teaching" this
course). Enrollment limit: 15. Preference to actual and possible philosophy majors; non-majors who
are considering declaring or adding the major in philosophy should so inform the instructor by email.
Cost to student: maximum of $50 (but probably less); for photocopies and/or books.
Meeting times: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, 10:30-noon.

PHIL 11 Aikido and Ethics
Aikido is a Japanese martial tradition that combines the samurai arts of sword and grappling with the
philosophical desire to create harmony in the midst of chaos. As such, it addresses situations of con-
flict that manifest themselves physically, but also offers insight into how to prevent or redirect the en-
ergies --social, political, or psychological--that might otherwise become conflict in one or another
aspect of our lives.
The physical training will improve each student's strength, balance, posture, fitness, and flexibility.
They will also learn how to throw their friends across the room. Wooden training weapons will be
used regularly to demonstrate the historical origin of various techniques and to visually amplify the
forces at work. Intellectually, students will engage with topics ranging from virtue ethics to conflict
resolution to the proper role of the Warrior/Knight in a just society. Students will train for 2 hours 4 out
of 5 mornings a week, and participate in 2 out of 3 guided philosophical conversations each week held
in a casual setting in the early evenings. Additional relevant experiences, such as meditation practice,
misogi, and Samurai films, will also be scheduled.
Students will be evaluated on the quality of their participation in both physical and intellectual course
components, and a final 10-page paper or project which entails a significant investigation of a topic
emerging from the course experience.
Prerequisites: Prior martial arts training is welcome but not required. Students do not have to be espe-
cially athletic, but they must meet all Williams requirements (e.g. have passed a recent physical, etc.)
for participation in intercollegiate sports. Enrollment limit: 25.
Cost to student: $100 (which buys gi (the uniform), bokken (wooden training sword), and jo (staff).

PHYS 12 Meet the Right Side of Your Brain: Drawing as a Learnable Skill
Representational drawing is not merely a gift of birth or a magical ability, but a learnable skill. If you
ever wanted to draw, but doubted you had the ability or believed you could not learn, then this course
is for you. This intensive course utilizes discoveries in brain research to teach representational draw-
ing. By using simple techniques and extensive exercises you will discover and develop the perceptual
shift from your symbol based left hemisphere to your visually based right hemisphere. This cognitive
shift enables you to accurately see and realistically represent the physical world. You will learn to
draw a convincing portrait, self-portrait, and still life. This course is designed to develop your powers
of observation and enhance your innate creative problem solving abilities, which are applicable in any
field. Students need no previous artistic experience, just the willingness and desire to learn a new skill.
Students will be expected to attend and participate in all sessions. They will also be required to keep a
sketchbook recording their progress and complete a final project.
Evaluation will be based on participation, effort, and development. There will be an exhibition of
coursework on the final day of Winter Study.

PSCI 11 The Gospel According to U2
It has been said that U2 is the "world's greatest rock band"-but is it also (unknown to most) the world's
greatest-and most unusual-Christian rock band? This course explores the theology, spirituality and
politics of U2 expressed through the group's songs, stage performances and human right campaigns.
We will travel from the band's origins in the Shalom Christian fellowship in Dublin to their overtly
Christian second album October (1981); the culmination of their superstardom in Joshua Tree(1987);
through their techno and ultra-ironic 1990s marked by ZOO-TV and Bono's "mock the devil" phase
as Mr. MacPhisto; and a return to their roots in All That You Can't Leave Behind (2000) and How To
Dismantle An Atomic Bomb (2004). Along the way, we will listen to a lot of U2, watch some videos
and tour footage-but it's not all fun and games. We will also read serious theological and philosophical
tracts on U2 lyrics and explore the band's complicated interweaving of faith, sexuality, grace, fame,
doubt, justice, and the meaning of America in a way which makes them a surprisingly popular and
poignant spiritual voice in our superficial and materialistic age. We will also delve into the group's hu-
man rights and social justice work, from Band Aid in the 80s to Debt, AIDS, Trade in Africa (DATA)
today, and in particular explore Bono's Catholic social justice moorings.
How does a band which quotes psalms at the Super Bowl and routinely stirs millions at its concerts to
chant an Old Testament lament ("how long? how long?) get into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame?
How does Bono simultaneously play the role of rock idol and prophet, prompting professions of love
from both star-struck teenage girls and conservative U.S. Senators? Is U2 following the Church, lead-
ing it or rivaling it? How far can you go with a red guitar, three chords and the truth? Answers will
come in the form of regular and active participation as well as two short papers.

PSCI 12 Constitution Making
The last decade has witnessed an extraordinary amount of "constitution making" across the globe.
Many regimes have sought to reorder themselves by way of creating written constitutions. Indeed,
written constitutions, once deemed an "experiment," have become synonymous with legitimate gov-
ernment. But is written constitutionalism actually a viable way to bring the polity into being and order
it? Is there something inherently absurd in attempting to base a government on a written text? This
course will get at such question by comparing different constitutions. While examining particular
constitutional ideas and practices, we'll be asking what we want from written constitutionalism, what
this entails of written constitutionalism, and whether written constitutionalism can in fact deliver.
Requirements: 10-page paper and active class participation.
No prerequisite. Enrollment limit: 15. Seniors and juniors will have priority.
Cost to student: books.
Meeting time: afternoons.

PSCI 13 Politics and the Novel in South Asia
The story of Saleem and his fellow midnight's children in the eponymous book by Salman Rushdie
artfully suggests the ways that individual lives are impacted by the fate of nations. Taking inspiration
from Rushdie, this course will consider works of fiction as lenses through which to engage the post-
Independence politics of South Asia, with a particular emphasis on issues of ethnicity and national-
ism. In addition to Midnight's Children, we will read two to three other novels that consider the mean-
ing of borders and identities in South Asia. We will also view documentaries and Bollywood films that
present themes of the books in celluloid. Our goal is to gain a sense of how stories about the trauma of
conflict and aspirations of nationhood are told. How are characters' identities informed by their politi-
cal and historical milieu, and in turn, how are historical contexts illuminated through stories? Lectures
and several short articles will help provide context for the fiction; other class meetings will include a
mix of discussion and film viewing.
Evaluation will be based on participation in class discussion, a brief (fifteen minute) presentation, and
a ten page paper that analyzes a theoretical concept explored in the course (nationalism, ethnic con-
flict, secession) in the context of one or more of the novels.
Enrollment limit: 20.
Cost to students: $60 (three to four novels and one small course packet of articles).

meetings. Why? The protestors believe globalization is evil, and that it must be stopped. Yet a recent
poll shows that most ordinary Americans believe globalization benefits the country. And the World
Bank argues that globalization reduces poverty and increases overall welfare throughout the world.
Is globalization good or is it evil? To help us understand what globalization is, what it means, and what
we think about it, we'll begin by reading Manfred Steger's Globalization: A Very Short Introduction.
We'll then consider the impact of two specific cases of globalization: McDonald's and movies.
McDonald's has become a symbol of globalization, changing societies all over the world. Movies go
both ways--Hollywood blockbusters play from Berlin to Bangkok, but foreign films play every week
at Images in Williamstown.
Students will then pick one particular aspect of these cases to investigate (such as the impact of Ameri-
can movies on the French film industry, or the affect of McDonald's on daily life in China), and will
present their conclusions to the class. Students will then write a short paper based on their presentation
topic.
Evaluation will be based on each student's attendance, participation, presentation, and six-page paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15. If enrollment exceeds 15, students will be selected by lottery.
Cost to student: $40 for books and photocopies.

PSCI 21 Fieldwork in Public and Private Non-Profits
This course is an internship experience in which students work full-time in a governmental or non-
governmental (including voluntary, activist, and grassroots) organization. Students may find intern-
ships in government and nonprofit organizations in which their work involves significant involve-
ment with public issues. Examples include: town government offices; state or federal administrative
offices such as environmental agencies or housing authorities; interest groups that lobby government
such as the ACLU or Natural Resources Defense Council; nonprofit organizations such as think tanks
or service providers such as Habitat for Humanity; and grassroots, activist or community develop-
ment organizations such as Greenpeace or neighborhood associations. The instructor will work with
each student to arrange an internship; such arrangements must be made in advance of the Winter
Term. Students should first make their own contacts with an institution or agency. The instructor and
and members of the Political Science department and Environmental Studies program are available to
help students find placements, if necessary. Each student's internship mentor shall send a confirma-
tion letter to the instructor verifying the internship and describing the nature of the work to be per-
formed by the intern. Students will read a few short articles distributed at the beginning of Winter
Term and must agree to keep a journal, maintain weekly contact with the instructor, and write a final
paper summarizing and reflecting upon the experience. A group meeting of all students will occur af-
ter winter study to discuss the experiences.
Requirements: internship work; satisfactory evaluation from the institutional sponsor; 10 page final
paper; participation in final meeting.
At the time of registration, interested students should send a resume and letter of interest to Paula Con-

23, but will work independently of other students in the course. Each student will have his or her own
faculty sponsor who will help shape and monitor the project. Professor McAllister and the Gaudino
Board of Trustees will select the four students. The Board places a premium on proposals that foster
the development of habits of mind that illuminate direct experience, undertaken preferably in social
milieux previously unfamiliar to applicants. Students' projects must be academically rigorous and fo-
cused on intellectual problems worked out carefully with faculty sponsors. Projects must also entail
systematic self-reflective examinations of how students' experiences affected them personally. Pref-
erence will be given to projects unconnected with regular course work.
Professor McAllister will meet with the students as a group before and after January. The Gaudino
Fund will defray expenses for all students in the course up to $1000 per student.

PSCI 25 Social Activism in Senegal (Same as Economics 25)
This course introduces students to the work of non-governmental and grassroots health, social and en-
vironmental organizations in Senegal, in French West Africa. In Senegal as elsewhere, local and na-
tional groups have sprung up in response to concerns about poverty, unemployment, disease, and oth-
er pressing issues. Students will meet with activists, and where possible contribute to their work. In
addition to gaining an understanding of the breadth, purpose and genesis of social activism in Senegal,
students will learn of the mixed effect of Western commerce and tourism on the country. Non-govern-
mental groups, both those run by Senegalese and those directed by foreigners, grapple with the legacy
of French colonial structures and the present-day reality of market capitalism in an impoverished
Winter Study Program

country. These circumstances create a politically complex backdrop against which social organiza-
tions struggle to achieve their goals. As such, part of the work of our Williams group will be to under-
stand the challenges and practical impediments these groups face against a background of pervasive
North-South power dynamics and inequality. The first week of the course will be held at Williams,
during which time students will learn about Senegal's history and culture; be exposed to some of the
literature on social activism and grassroots social justice; and learn of Senegal's place in the North-
South economy. This will be followed by 15 days in Senegal, with Dakar as our base. A 2-3 day de-
briefing back in Williamstown will follow.
Requirements: Students will submit a final paper discussing the work of one or two groups whose
work they observed, and are expected to keep a journal of their reflections whilst in Senegal.
Prerequisites: basic, conversational French strongly recommended. Those students who have no
French at all are encouraged to enroll in a French language course in the fall 2005.
Enrollment limit: 8 (expected: 8).

PSYCHOLOGY
PSYC 10 Adventures in Disabilities (Same as Political Science 10)
A dramatic shift in the laws and values shaping the participation of persons with disabilities in Ameri-
can society has led to motorized carts in Professional Golf Association tournaments and modified
exam procedures for some college students. With the help of guest speakers who themselves have dis-
abilities as well as through readings and films, we will explore past and present understandings of dis-
abilities (physical, sensory, cognitive, mental health) and the changing responses to those who have
them. Each student will conduct an investigation, using interviews and site visits, to learn how current
understandings of disabilities have impacted a field in which they are interested. Alternatively, a stu-
dent may focus an inquiry on his or her own disability or that of a family member. The underlying
premise of this course is that we no longer expect the individual with a disability to "overcome her/his
handicap." Rather; it is the role of citizens and leaders to remove barriers to participation and redesign
the environments in which we learn, communicate, work, and use our leisure time to access every-
one's gifts and talents. This is not a burden but an adventure.
Evaluation will be based on class participation, a final 10-page paper, and an oral presentation about
your investigation.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15.
Cost to student: approximately $60.

PSYC 11 The Exonerated
Due to recent developments in DNA testing, increasing numbers of wrongful convictions are being
discovered, sometimes involving prisoners on death row. Post-conviction analyses of these tragic
cases by the Department of Justice, the Innocence Project, and social science and legal researchers,
have cast a critical spotlight on eyewitness errors, forensic junk science, false confessions, perjured
testimony from snitches, police and prosecutorial misconduct, and other problems. This course will
examine this group of cases through readings and first-hand research. Each student will be expected to
review a number of cases, conduct an in-depth analysis of a single case, and write a 10-page research
report of that analysis. The class will attend the off-Broadway play, The Exonerated, and take a field
trip to the Innocence Project at the Benjamin Cardozo Law School, also in Manhattan. This trip will
require one overnight stay.

PSYC 12 How To Think Like a Social Psychologist
This is a course about the field of social psychology, the scientific study of everyday social life. In this
course we will read and discuss classic and contemporary journal articles, discuss the various method-
ologies and techniques employed by social psychologists, and consider the role of theory in social
psychological investigation--all in the service of better understanding how to think like a social
psychologist. The centerpiece of the course will be an opportunity to collect some data in a social psy-
chological experiment of our own design. This course is appropriate for students who are considering
graduate study in psychology or other social sciences or for students who simply wish to learn more
about the field.
Requirements: readings, active class participation and attendance, 10-page paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 10.
Cost to student: $10 for readings.
Meeting time: mornings.

PSYC 13 Fictional Worlds
This course explores the role of fantasy, imagination, and magic in the lives of both children and
adults. We will examine why children love fairy tales, develop imaginary companions, and believe in
supernatural phenomena. We consider why some children are more prone to believe in fiction and
fantasy than others, and what happens to these beliefs in adulthood. For example, are adults who had a
childhood imaginary companion different from those who did not? Does belief in magic disappear en-
tirely in adulthood? Students should be prepared for active participation in class discussions.
Evaluation will be based on class participation and a final 10-page paper.

PSYC 15 Designing for People (Same as Computer Science 15)
Many technologically-innovative and aesthetically-beautiful products fail because they are not sensi-
tive to the attitudes and behaviors of the humans who interact with them. The field of Human Factors
combines aspects of psychology and sociology with information technology, education, architecture,
and physiology, to design objects and information that are easy for people to learn and easy for people
to use. The course will provide students with a theoretical framework for analyzing ease-of-learning
and ease-of-use, as well as practical knowledge of a variety of human factors testing methodologies.
The course will examine usability of a wide variety of designed objects, including buildings, publica-
tions, websites, software applications, and consumer electronics gadgets. Students will perform two
usability projects--a heuristic analysis and a usability test with 8-10 human test subjects--and pres-
ent their findings in two short presentations. Students will demonstrate their understanding of human
factors theory through participation in class discussion.
Evaluation will be based on two 5-page papers and possibly 1 or 2 in-class PowerPoint presentations.

PSYC 16 Community Screening for Alzheimer's Disease
This course will consider memory screening as a strategy to address the increasing prevalence and im-
portance of early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease in Williamstown and surrounding communities.
Students will learn how to administer and interpret neuropsychological instruments used to screen for
Alzheimer's disease (AD). The class will then design and conduct a community screening day for
AD. This will include selecting appropriate screening instruments, selecting an appropriate venue,
raising community awareness of memory problems, and working with local community agencies to
encourage individuals to participate in memory screening. Following the screening day, each student
will analyze the data collected on the screening day and submit a report.
Evaluation will be based upon engagement in the design of the screening day, proficiency in learning
to administer screening instruments, and a 10-page written report of the result of the screening day.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15.
Cost to students: $50.00 for books.
The class will meet 6 hours per week. Meeting will typically be in the morning. Some of these meeting
will be as a class and other meeting will be in smaller groups. Students will be expected to visit The

REL 12 Yoga: A Mind-Body Connection
This class provides an orientation to yoga and builds a foundation for an effective and rewarding per-
sonal yoga practice by integrating textual studies and personal practice. Analysis and comparison of
classic yoga texts from India provide a historical, cultural, and philosophical background for yoga. As
well as discussion of key yogic concepts, class meetings experientially explore philosophical themes
through practicing selected sequences of yoga poses. Poses may include standing poses, inversions,
abdominals, hip-openers, backbends, twists, forward bends, and restoratives. Students receive indi-
vidualized attention on how to work with principles of alignment for their particular bodies and needs.
You learn to express poses with balanced energy, and to energize a variety of heart qualities in the
poses and sequences they practice. In this way students build strength, flexibility, and awareness.
Yoga training is complementary to sports, athletics, and dance. It aids in pursuing academic studies
and creative endeavors, gives tools for handling stress, and cultivates a sense of well-being and bal-
ance.
Required texts: Patanjali's Yoga Sutras, The Bhagavad Gita, Yoga the Iyengar Way, and related ar-
ticles.
Evaluation is based importantly on attendance and participation in all classes and sessions, a personal
practice journal demonstrating particular intentions for practice and appropriate poses and sequenc-

REL 25 Religion, Culture and Performance in Bali
Students in this course will spend the winter study period on the Indonesian island of Bali. The course
will offer an experientially grounded introduction to Balinese culture, religion and the performing
arts.
After an initial period of orientation, students will stay with Balinese families in Singapadu, a small
community in the southern half of the island renowned for its excellence in both the plastic (e.g., wood
carving, mask making) and performing arts (traditional opera, dance and theatre). Local accommoda-
tion and transport will be coordinated with the assistance of an experienced American tour organizer,
who has worked with student groups including the School for International Training.
In the first week, emphasis will be placed on learning the basics of Balinese religion, culture and eti-
quette. Through a brief but intensive course of language instruction, they will learn to speak rudimen-
tary Indonesian, providing access to a world beyond that accessible to the casual tourist or traveler.
Throughout the course of our stay in Bali, students will be encouraged to engage with the local com-
munity, and to learn about day-to-day life in Bali by participating in it. At the end of the first week, we
will take a short `holiday' at the beach, and attend a seminar on the history of Bali's northern coastline
and the growing threats to its unique marine ecology.
In the second week, through lectures and hands-on instruction, students will study the theory and
practice of gamelan orchestra, shadow theatre and other classical performative genres. Emphasis will
be placed on the ways in which these various art forms are used in Balinese religious and cultural life.
At the end of the second week, we will take a two-day trip to Besakih, the massive temple complex in
the central mountainous region of the island. Through on-site study and an archaeological tour, stu-
dents will be introduced to the history and cultural significance of Balinese temple architecture.
In the third week we shall return to Singapadu. Students will have the opportunity to study with a local
mentor and conduct an independent research project on a topic of their choice. This period of super-
vised independent research will comprise the basis for a final paper of 10-15 pages. Preference will be
given to students who have taken Religion 240, in which they will have studied the history of Balinese
Hinduism in some depth.
Students will come away with an experiential understanding of a foreign culture that would take years
to develop by any other means. Through a series of lectures, seminar discussions, practica and inde-
pendent research, they will develop a critical appreciation for a range of topics, including: the plastic
and performing arts, religion, local history, politics, economy, gastronomy, mass media, gender rela-
tions and the impact of the tourist industry on how Balinese represent themselves both to themselves
and to others.
Enrollment limit: 8.
Cost to student: approximately $3000-$3300.

REL 26 Explorations in Solidarity: A Meeting of Minds and Hearts in Nicaragua
This course will explore the lived realities of the hemisphere's second most impoverished nation, and the
relevance of faith and religious community to the struggle for social justice. Students will reflect on these
realities and struggles in the company of subsistence farmers, urban factory laborers, and those working for
progressive social change. The effects of an increasingly globalized economy, a series of natural disasters
(most notably hurricane Mitch), and the changeable attentions of the developed world will be explored
through conversations with ordinary people, using some of the methods of popular education and oral his-
tory. Significant attention will also be given to the efficacy of liberation theology and the base Christian
community movement, as well as other influences--Christian, Marxist and neo-Liberal--on the material
and spiritual well-being of Nicaraguan people.
The experience of the course will include approximately ten days of living (with minimal amenities) in a
subsistence farming community. Students will also attend a number of Christian religious services. (The
course is open to students of any religious background or no affiliation.) Travels and encounters in Nicara-
gua will be facilitated by Elena Hendrick and Luis Aguirre of the Asociacion Kairos para la Formacion, an
organization that links Christian communities north and south through solidarity toward the goal of perma-
nent transformative relationships. Throughout, students will be invited to enter as deeply as possible the
Winter Study Program
­ 383 ­
story of Nicaraguans and to reflect on their own stories as North Americans and the sometimes-volatile in-
teraction between these stories. The goal is to explore the relevance of religious community to the possibil-
ities for restorative justice, and to discover what it would mean to shape a relationship with the people of
Nicaragua according to a paradigm of solidarity--contrasted with the more familiar paradigms of charity
and national self-interest.
The course will entail daily reflection sessions, for which a journal will be kept. Other requirements include
attendance at at least three orientation sessions and approximately 150 pages of reading on Nicaraguan his-
tory and the current political, economic and religious situation prior to departure; participation in a group
oral presentation to the college community upon return to Williamstown; and a final 10-page paper, due
before the first day of second semester, 2006.
Conversational knowledge of Spanish, though not required, is helpful. Willingness to live in physically de-
manding situations is essential. The cost of the trip to the student will be no more than $2,150 (depending
on airfare, and including all food, lodging, round-trip airfare from Miami, all in-country transportation,
fees, etc.). Students are individually responsible for the cost of travel to and from Miami at the beginning
and at the conclusion of the program. Enrollment limit: 10.

RLFR 10 Asterix the Gaul: French Culture through the Prism of the Comic
The longevity and popularity of the Asterix comic strip series over successive generations of French (and
foreign) readers can be explained, in part, by its subtle and incisive rendering of Europeanism through cari-
cature. This course will examine some of the most enduring texts in the Asterix saga as interpretations,
first, of French culture and the way the French view themselves with respect to the rest of Europe and, sec-
ond, of the way they view Europe in dialogue with French cultural norms. Such issues as "la patrie"
(homeland), linguistic characteristics, the idea of France, French provincial distinctiveness, France's view
of homogeneous national character seen through its own cultural diversity, and the relationship of France to
other specific regional cultures will be studied as a way not only of defining the nation's historic legacy, but
of coming to terms with the way it sees its place within the vision of the European Union. Among the texts
to be studied will be Asterix the Gaul, Asterix and the Banquet, Asterix and the Normans, Asterix in Corsi-
ca, Asterix in Britain, Asterix and the Goths, Asterix in Belgium, Asterix in Switzerland. Analysis of the pri-
mary texts will be complemented by secondary cultural readings by prominent interpreters in French cul-
ture. Readings will be in English, but those students who wish to read the texts in the original French
should make arrangements in advance with the instructor. Conducted in English.

gory represents and often erases. From texts of Iraqi-Americans in L.A. to that of Lebanese-Christians
in Toledo to that of Brooklyn's Atlantic Avenue, this class will examine negotiations of ethnic signifi-
cation, stories of immigration and assimilation, the "Othering" of Arabs in America and nostalgic vi-
sions of distant homelands. The class will take a day-trip to Brooklyn to visit the Atlantic Ave. neigh-
borhood and meet with Arab-American writers living in New York.
Students will be evaluated on their active participation and on a final project for the course which can
range from a 10-page essay, to an art piece and written commentary.

RLFR 12 Contemporary Queer Cinema in France (Same as Comparative Literature 12
and Women's and Gender Studies 11)
From the wild streets of "Gay Paris" to the cinematic premieres of the Cannes Film Festival, France
has long been a beacon and a refuge for queer identity. French writers as diverse as Gide, Proust, Co-
lette, and Genet have celebrated gay and lesbian identity in their novels. American expatriates Ger-
trude Stein and Natalie Barney have mentored queer writers and artists in their Parisian salons. And
openly gay couturiers Jean-Paul Gaultier and Yves Saint-Laurent have projected fabulous French
fashion out into the world. In more recent years, queer political activism in France has led to the cre-
ation of the national "PACS" or domestic partnership law, as well as greater rights and protections for
queer men, women, and people living with HIV/AIDS. This course will examine representations of
gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgendered identity in French cinema from 1968 to 2002. Among the
many topics to be discussed will include cinematic representations of the closet, coming-out, race and
ethnicity, lesbian identity and invisibility, bisexuality, trans/gender identity, butch-femme aesthetics,
drag queens, queer political identity, and HIV/AIDS. Our film discussions will be complemented by
readings from contemporary French and American queer theory. Films to include Claude Chabrol's
Les Biches (1968), Édouard Molinaro's La Cage aux folles (1978), Rainer Werner Fassbinder'sQuer-
elle (1982), Cyril Collard's Les Nuits fauves (1992), André Téchiné's Les Roseaux sauvages (1994),
Josiane Balasko's Gazon maudit (1995), Alain Berliner's Ma vie en rose (1997), Claire Denis's Beau

RUSS 25 Williams in Georgia (Same as Special 25)
Williams has a unique program in the Republic of Georgia, which offers students the opportunity to
engage in three-week-long internships in any field. Our students have worked in the Georgian Parlia-
ment, helped in humanitarian relief organizations like Save the Children, interned in journalism at The
Georgian Times, taught unemployed women computer skills at The Rustavi Project, documented
wildlife, studied with a Georgian sculptor, done rounds at the Institute of Cardiology, and learned
about transitional economies at the Georgian National Bank. In addition to working in their chosen
fields, students experience Georgian culture through museum visits, concerts, lectures, meetings with
Georgian students, and excursions. Visit the sacred eleventh-century Cathedral of Sveti-tskhoveli and
the twentieth-century Stalin Museum, take the ancient Georgian Military Highway to ski in the Cau-
casus Range, see the birthplace of the wine grape in Kakheti and the region where Jason sought the
Golden Fleece. Participants are housed in pairs with English-speaking families in Tbilisi, Georgia's
capital city. At the end of the course students will write a 10-page paper assessing their internship ex-
perience.
No prerequisites. Knowledge of Russia or Georgia is not required. Enrollment limit: 12.
Cost to student: approximately $2000.

THEATRE
THEA 10 Self-Production at Williams
This course examines various means of theatrical self-production and how artists may exploit this
model in the pursuit of their ambitions. The primary focus of the class will be to determine how specif-
ic self-production techniques might serve as the foundation for an annual or bi-annual student initi-
ated festival of theatrical works to be performed in the new '62 Center for Theater and Dance. Mem-
bers of the class, in a group effort, will be responsible for determining the very nature of the proposed
festival, including but not limited to overall theme, play or material selection, design, faculty mentor-
ing, production assignments, publicity, and technical feasibility. Guest speakers from the profession
will provide valuable insight into the complexity of producing one's own material.
Evaluation will be based on committed and thoughtful class participation and group effort, as well as
the quality of contribution to final proposals.
In the future, the Williams College Department of Theatre seeks to diversify and expand its seasonal
production offerings. The blueprints generated by this class will be an integral part of this initiative.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15. Preference given to underclassmen.
Meeting time: Tuesday and Thursday, 1-3:50.

SPECIALS
SPEC 10 Quest for College: Early Awareness in Berkshire County Schools
Today's extremely competitive higher education market places significant pressure on students na-
tionwide to start planning for college at an increasingly early age while simultaneously demanding
ever-higher standards of excellence for admission to top schools. "Early Awareness" initiatives aim to
educate middle school students as to what lies ahead on the college horizon, empowering them to
make sound academic and extracurricular choices that will keep open a maximum of options. The first
week of this course will be spent in the classroom, exploring and discussing problems and issues ger-
mane to the national trends towards greater (and earlier) college-related pressures. Students will re-
spond to a series of readings dealing with such issues as tracking, paid test preparation and untimed
testing, early decision, parental and peer pressures, special interests, misrepresentation of informa-
tion, independent counseling, and others. Class time will also be devoted to familiarizing students
with both the nuances of the college admission process and the administration of the early awareness
game, Quest for College. Students will spend the next two weeks visiting 10-12 Berkshire County
middle schools, administering the game and inviting students to the culminating College Day. All 8
students will then work together to plan and run College Day activities for students and their parents.
This day will include a) campus tours, b) general higher education info sessions, and c) financial aid/
scholarship info for the parents. If student and community interest is sufficient, the course may culmi-
nate in a public presentation and open forum early second semester.
Evaluation will be based on completion of field work (school visits), organization and execution of
project to bring local middle school students to the Williams Campus for a day of early-awareness re-
lated activities and a final paper (approximately 10 pages) reflecting on a course-related issue of the
student's choosing.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 8. Preference given to a) students with prior education/admission
experience, b) students with access to transportation c) juniors and seniors. Interested students must
consult with instructors prior to registration.Students will be selected according to the following crite-
ria: a) experience in teaching or admission, b) access to transportation, and c) seniority. Provision
will be stated that interested students must consult the instructors before registration, that instructors
may determine depth of experience and focus of interest.
Meeting time: afternoons.
Cost to student: transportation to field work sites and purchase of text.

GOLDSTEIN
SPEC 15 American Colleges and Universities Past and Present
Did you know that only 3% of American college students receive their degrees from small residential
liberal arts colleges like Williams? This course will help you broaden your understanding of the
American higher education system past and present. We'll begin by tracing the evolution of higher
education in this country from the liberal arts college's ascendancy in the early days through the rise of
the research university in the late 1800s, the post-World War II proliferation of community colleges,
and the recent growth in for profit universities. We'll then explore current topics in the field of higher
education including: athletics and the academy, admission and affirmative action, financial aid, gen-
der and Title IX, multiculturalism/diversity, the curriculum, and faculty hiring and retention. Classes
will meet four times a week and will consist of discussion and guest lectures. In addition, there will be
two required films and a half-day field trip. The class will culminate in each student and/or small stu-
dent groups researching a topic of interest, writing a 10-page paper, and sharing the findings in a class
presentation.
Requirements: regular attendance, 10-page paper, class presentation.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15.
Meeting time: 10-noon, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday plus field trip and two evening
films.

SPEC 19 Medical Apprenticeship
Firsthand experience is a critical component of the decision to enter the health professions. Through
this apprenticeship, students can clarify their understanding of the rewards and challenges that ac-
company the practice of all types of medicine. Apprenticeships are arranged in two distinct ways:
some students live on campus and are matched with a local practitioner, while others make indepen-
dent arrangements to shadow a distant professional. The expectation is that each student will observe
some aspect of medicine for the better part of the day, five days per week. In recent years, students
Winter Study Program
­ 388 ­
have shadowed physicians, veterinarians, dentists, nurses, and public health experts.
In addition to observation in clinical settings, there will be discussion sessions and optional evening
events on campus which give participants further opportunity to reflect upon their experiences.
A 10-page reflective paper is required.
Prerequisites: Interested students must attend an information meeting in early October.
Local enrollment is limited by the number of available practitioners. Preference for placements will
be given on the basis of seniority and demonstrated interest in the health professions.
Cost to students: Local apprenticeships--vaccinations and local transportation. Distant apprentice-
ships--costs will vary based upon location.

SPEC 23 Introduction to Sports Writing
This course provides an introduction to the craft of sportwriting and the many different aspects of
creating a well-written sports article, be it for newspaper or magazine purposes.
Students will learn first hand the art of creating several different types of ledes to an article, the correct
chronological order of a great sports article, how to obtain quotes, the proper place in the article for
those quotes, how to creatively and properly intersperse play-by-play in a solid "game coverage" ar-
ticle and much more.
Students will also learn the differences between writing for a newspaper and magazine, community
journalism versus big city journalism (are there any?) and ethics in journalism (are there any?).
There will be several in-class assignments, some homework assignments, and one final project that,
along with attendance, will be the major part of the grade.
Cost to student: none.
Meeting time: Monday, Wednesday and Thursday, 1-3 p.m. Enrollment limit: 25.

SPEC 24 Eyecare and Culture in Botswana
Continuing the model of recent eye care winter studies to Nicaragua, the trip to Botswana will follow a
similar protocol. We will begin with readings, lectures and videos in Williamstown on the culture and
politics of Botswana. We will then receive a weekend of training in the prescription of reading and dis-
tance glasses. This training will be given by Dr. Bruce Moore and an associate from the New England
College of Optometry. After this first week of classes and instruction, we will travel to Maun, Botswa-
na and conduct a week of clinics in the surrounding areas.
Next will be a three to four day safari in either Chobe or Moremi National Parks to view the abundance
of wildlife in these preserves. Lastly, we will cross the border into Zimbabwe and take the short trip to
view Victoria falls, the highest water falls in the world. We then will return to the U.S.A. for a couple
more classes to conclude the study.
The requirements will be 100% attendance at all classes and readings before the trip. Students will
keep a detailed journal during the trip to enable reflections on their experiences in the context of their
lives at Williams, in the U.S. and future career goals and plans.
In addition to the rewarding experience of providing the service of enhancing the vision of 2000-3000
people during our week of clinics, it is hoped that our students will learn a great deal about the realities

SPEC 35 Making Pottery on the Potter's Wheel
Each class will begin with a lecture-demonstration, followed by practice on the potter's wheel. Each
student will have the use of a potter's wheel for each class. We will work on mugs, bowls, pitchers,
plates, jars, lids, vases, and bottles, and will finish these shapes as required by trimming and adding
handles, lugs, lids, spouts, and knobs. We will also work on several different handbuilding projects.
After the tenth class session, all class work will be biscuit-fired. The eleventh class will be devoted to
glazing the biscuited pieces. Glazing techniques will include pouring, dipping, layering, brushing,
and stamping, and using wax resist and other masking techniques to develop pattern and design. The
completed work will then be glaze-fired. The last meeting will be devoted to a "final project" gallery
show of your best work. Woven into lecture-demonstrations will be presentations on various topics
relating to the science and history of pottery making.
Requirements: attendance at all class sessions and enthusiasm for learning the craft of pottery making.
No prerequisites or potterymaking experience necessary. Enrollment limit: 9.

SPEC 39 "Composing a Life:" Finding Success and Balance in Life After Williams
To be at Williams you have learned to be a successful student, but how do you learn to be successful in
life? How will you define success in both your career and in your personal life? How will you achieve
balance between the two? In short, what will constitute the "good life" for you? We borrow the con-
cept of "composing a life" from Mary Catherine Bateson, as an apt metaphor for the ongoing process
of defining success and balance in life. This course is designed: (1) To offer college students an oppor-
tunity to examine and define their beliefs, values, and assumptions about their future personal and
professional lives before entering the "real" world; (2) To encourage students to gain a better under-
standing of how culture, ideology, and opportunity affect their life choices; (3) To provide an opportu-
nity for students to consider different models of success and balance through "living cases" (in the
form of guests from various professions and lifestyles); and (4) To aid students in contemplating their
career options through individual advising and introducing various career and life planning resources.
Using selected readings, cases, and guest speakers, we will explore both the public context of the
workplace as well as the private context of individuals and their personal relationships in determining
life choices.
Requirements: regular attendance, class participation, field interview, and a 10-page final paper
