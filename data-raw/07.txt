HISTORY OF THE COLLEGE
The chartering of Williams College in 1793 was an act of faith and certainly an act surpassing the
modest intentions of Colonel Ephraim Williams, for whom the college is named.
Colonel Williams had not intended to found a college. Enroute with his regiment of Massachu-
setts militia to join the battle with the French and Indians at Lake George, the Colonel had tarried
long enough in Albany to write his last will and testament on July 22, 1755. In it he bequeathed his
residuary estate for the founding and support of a free school in West Township, where for some
years he had commanded a detachment of militia at Fort Massachusetts, farthest outpost of the
province. The will stipulated that West Township, then in dispute between Massachusetts and New
York, must fall within Massachusetts and that the name of the township must be changed to Wil-
liamstown, if the free school was to be established at all.
On September 8, 1755, Colonel Williams was killed at the Battle of Lake George. On October 26,
1791, after many delays, fifteen scholars were admitted to the free school in Williamstown. Within a
year the trustees, not content with the original modest design of the founder, were captivated by the
idea of creating a college where, as they put it, "young gentlemen from every part of the Union" might
resort for instruction " in all the branches of useful and polite literature." The proposal was extremely
ambitious, to be sure, but ambition was a common American ailment. England did not develop a third
university until the nineteenth century; Williams was the twenty-first institution of higher learning to
flower in onetime British colonies, the second in Massachusetts, the sixth in New England. On June
22, 1793, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts granted a charter to Williams College.
I
The bold decision to plant a college in the wilderness betrayed the intentions of Colonel Wil-
liams; yet the new vision had been fed by the same sort of dreams that had led Ephraim Williams to
see a school and a comfortable community where only a military outpost had stood. The early trust-
ees and the legislature of the Commonwealth were to be remembered for their foresight, but in the
decades after 1793 they had reason to acknowledge that the soil they had chosen was stubbornly
uncongenial--so uncongenial, in fact, that for many years the trustees of Williams spent more time
and energy in trying to close the College than in trying to keep it open.
In 1819 they petitioned to move the college to Northhampton, and in 1821, having been spurned by
the legislature, President Zephaniah Swift Moore took matters into his own hands. Convinced that
almost everything about Williams was impossible--its location, its funds, its enrollment--he led a
group of students over the mountains into the Connecticut Valley. There he became their president
once again, at the struggling new college known as Amherst. As for Williams, one member of the
senior class wrote home to his father: "It remains for us to say whether it shall die suddenly, or whether
it shall linger along for two or three years."
In the past the public had come to the support of the institution. A lottery furnished funds essen-
tial to the opening of the free school. A public subscription was the answer of Berkshire County to
the threat of removal in 1819. What saved the College in 1821 was the willingness of the Reverend
Edward Dorr Griffin to take the job of president and the determination with which he drew upon the
College's reputation for religious conservatism to collect much-needed funds. By 1828, the Rever-
end Griffin could be seen standing in the middle of Main Street, supervising the construction of a
handsome new building, housing a chapel, a library, and classrooms, a testament to his confidence
and his skill. The building is now known as Griffin Hall.
The College which had been taking shape under Griffin and his predecessors was not unlike
many other New England colleges where the classical curriculum and a moral atmosphere served as
the basis for training young men for professional life. The college turned out its share of clergymen,
doctors, lawyers, and teachers, serving the needs of Western Massachusetts and surrounding com-
munities in New York and Vermont. But Williams was not yet a place to which "young gentlemen
from every part of the Union" resorted. In fact, Nathaniel Hawthorne, attending the commencement
exercises in 1838, jotted in his notebook some observations on the Williams students he saw there:
"Country graduates--rough, brown-featured, schoolmaster-looking...A rough hewn, heavy set of
fellows from the hills and woods in this neighborhood; unpolished bumpkins, who had grown up as
farmer-boys."
History of the College
­ 4 ­
Williams seldom knew financial security until the end of the nineteenth century. But it did have
assets that enabled it to develop into a prototype of the small New England liberal arts college. Scen-
ery, a reputation for moral soundness, a loyal body of alumni, and a devoted faculty went a long way
toward compensating for inadequate funds.
Of the scenery, Thoreau remarked, after a visit in 1844, "It would be no small advantage if every
college were thus located at the base of a mountain." For Thoreau the location of Williams was "as
good at least as one well-endowed professorship."
In the early years the religious reputation of the College depended on the essential orthodoxy of
its presidents and faculty. It gathered strength from the famous episode of the "haystack meeting" in
the summer of 1806. Five Williams undergraduates, seeking to continue their prayers and conversa-
tions in spite of a sudden thunderstorm, retired from a grove of trees to the shelter of a nearby hay-
stack, where they were inspired to launch the great adventure of American foreign missions. The
extremely informal ties with the Congregationalists saved it from the sometimes stifling strangle-
hold of an organic denominational connection.
During a crisis in the affairs of the College in 1821, a group of alumni met in Williamstown and
organized the Society of Alumni, dedicated to the future welfare of the College. Their action gave
Williams the distinction of organizing the first college alumni society in history. Alumni loyalty was
rewarded when, in 1868, the College provided for official alumni representation on the board of trust-
ees, an act of recognition in which only Harvard, among American colleges, anticipated Williams.
II
But essentially the College has built its reputation around teachers and teaching. Mark Hopkins,
who was a Williams professor from 1830 to 1887 and president of the College from 1836 to 1872, has
become a symbol of this emphasis. In American education Hopkins pioneered in making the student
the center of the educational experience, and he did it so well that one of his former students, U.S.
President James A. Garfield, immortalized his achievement in an aphorism which has passed into the
lore of American education: "The ideal college is Mark Hopkins on one end of a log and a student on
the other." The Hopkins tradition has become one of the College's great assets. It has been perpetuated
in the lives of generations of teachers.
Scenery, a reputation for building sound character, loyal but not especially affluent alumni, and
devoted teachers could keep the College open, but like most other colleges Williams did not experi-
ence growth and prosperity until the closing decades of the nineteenth century. The scenery, of
course, remained constant, but it developed into an even greater asset as the United States became
more urbanized and industrialized. Williams was still a country college; a Massachusetts court de-
cision of 1888 declared that cows owned by the college were tax exempt. The discovery that busi-
nessmen could profit from liberal education sent college enrollments upward as the century drew to
a close; now more Williams alumni were men of affairs, fewer were clergymen. By 1906, of all the
colleges in New England, Williams drew the largest percentage of students from outside New Eng-
land.
From 1793 through 1870 the Commonwealth of Massachusetts appropriated for Williams College
over $150,000, a sum of such importance that Mark Hopkins himself observed that he did "not see
how the College could have got on" without state aid. A new and more dependable source of financial
support was developed as the century drew to a close. In the 1890's Frederick Ferris Thompson of the
Class of 1856 became the first of many individuals to supersede the Commonwealth as the largest
benefactor of the College. Ephraim Williams' original bequest of $9,297 has since grown by addition-
al gifts and bequests to an endowment valued at approximately $1.3 billion.
III
Williams moved into the twentieth century firm in its intentions to remain a college, at a time when
aspirations toward university status were unsettling many of the old colleges. It adhered to a curricu-
lum that was designed for undergraduates; it made room for the elective principle, but it subjected
course election to safeguards and controls. The idea of a liberally educated man was not jettisoned in
favor of the widely accepted idea of almost complete student freedom in course election. A survey of
the college curriculum in 1925 showed that Williams had combined the principles of prescription and
election, the goals of concentration and distribution, in such a way as to be the only major American
college without any absolutely required courses and without any uncontrolled wide-option electives.
History of the College
­ 5 ­
The Williams curriculum has continued to evolve, but it has not undergone such a series of major
overhauls as characterize curriculums inspired by the popular educational fancy of the moment. Not
having abandoned itself to the elective principle in the nineteenth century, Williams did not need to
rescue itself with the general education principle of the twentieth century.
During its long history much of the life and tone of the college was shaped by students. While the
same influence continues, the competitive pressure for admission since World War II has allowed
for a new and significant degree of selectivity on the part of the College. Among the consequences
of this change have been a quickening of the intellectual life of the College and a reconsideration of
traditions and emphases no longer considered appropriate for an institution of liberal learning.
Among the first traditions to go was compulsory religious exercises, abandoned in 1962 after a
hundred years of gradual but steady erosion. Voluntary worship in the form of ecumenical chapel
services and the activities of student religious organizations carry on another long tradition. In re-
sponse to the concern of undergraduate leaders and the faculty and in recognition of the failure of
Greek Letter Fraternities to fulfill adequately objectives consistent with college purpose, the Trust-
ees in 1962 took the first of a series of actions that replaced fraternities with a residential house sys-
tem. Williams became, as a result, a much more open community. The decision to become coeduca-
tional and the admission of women to Williams as degree candidates in 1970 have reinforced the
spirit of equality and freedom conducive to a climate of learning.
In this atmosphere of change and heightened purpose the curriculum underwent appropriate
transformations, as a careful comparative study of the yearly catalogues readily shows, leading to
the present 4-1-4 curriculum and a more flexible and wide-ranging schedule and program both on
and beyond the campus. Changes in the curriculum included the addition of majors and the
introduction of interdisciplinary programs, along with the expansion of language offerings to in-
clude full, four-year cycles in Chinese and Japanese. Continuing the tradition of putting the student
at the center of the educational experience, Williams in the Fall of 1988 introduced in each depart-
ment at least one course taught as a tutorial, in which, typically, pairs of students meet weekly with
the professor to discuss a paper, problem set, or work of art produced by one of the students. By
1992 some 40 percent of the graduating class had experienced at least one tutorial course either in
Williamstown or in the Williams-Oxford program, run in association with Exeter College, Oxford,
which provides each year for some 30 Williams juniors a year-long immersion in the life of Oxford
University.
This curricular expansion reflected, and in part resulted from, the fact that the makeup of the col-
lege community was changing to mirror more closely the growing racial, ethnic, and religious di-
versity of American society. The percentage of Williams students who identified themselves as
members of one or more American minority group rose to 25 percent; of faculty almost 13 percent.
At the beginning of this decade, President Morton Owen Schapiro inaugurated a strategic plan-
ning process, through which the College community identified priorities for change in the curricu-
lum and in residential life. The size of the faculty is being expanded to provide more curricular op-
portunities for students in tutorials and experiential learning. Requirements have been added in in-
tensive writing instruction and in quantitative and formal reasoning. New programming and struc-
tures are being added to student residential life and major projects have been undertaken to greatly
enhance the College's student center, its facilities for theatre and dance, and its office and teaching
spaces for faculty.

MISSION AND OBJECTIVES
We are to regard the mind, not as a piece of iron to be laid upon the anvil and hammered into any
shape, nor as a block of marble in which we are to find the statue by removing the rubbish, or as a
receptacle into which knowledge may be poured; but as a flame that is to be fed, as an active being that
must be strengthened to think and to feel--and to dare, to do, and to suffer.
President Mark Hopkins '24
Induction Address (1836)
Our colleges will not be rich enough until they are able to bring the education they offer within the
reach of the poorest young man in the land.
President P.A. Chadbourne '48
Induction Address (1872)
Dedicated to the welfare of the great common life of the State, [the College] may not much longer
close its doors to one half of the community because of their sex, neither may it narrow its labors or its
sympathies to any class, to any favored few.
James D. Canfield '68
Centennial Oration (1893)
[Young people] now entering college, if given their biblical life span--and who knows what more or
less than three score and ten?--will be carrying responsibilities well into the 21st century...No one can
pretend to more than a guess at what they will then be called upon to comprehend. This much we do know:
that no training in fixed techniques, no finite knowledge now at hand, no rigid formula they might be given
can solve problems whose shape we cannot yet define. Nor have they time to waste in pursuit of transitory
expedients, the ephemeral, the shallow or the merely popular.
The most versatile, the most durable, in an ultimate sense the most practical knowledge and intel-
lectual resources which they can now be offered are those impractical arts and sciences around which
the liberal arts education has long centered: the capacity to see and feel, to grasp, respond and act over
a widening arc of experience; the disposition and ability to think, to question, to use knowledge to
order an ever-extending range of reality; the elasticity to grow, to perceive more widely and more
deeply, and perhaps to create; the understanding to decide where to stand and the will and tenacity to
do so; the wit and wisdom, the humanity and the humor to try to see oneself, one's society, and one's
world with open eyes, to live a life usefully, to help things in which one believes on their way. This is
not the whole of a liberal arts education, but as I understand it, this range of goals is close to its core.
President John E. Sawyer '39
Induction Address (1961)
The longer history of education in our own culture has been such as to suggest the openness, resil-
ience, flexibility and power of that age-old tradition of education in the liberal arts that at its best is
consciously geared to no less inclusive an activity than that of living itself...[And] no education which
truly aspires to be a preparation for living can afford to ignore the fundamental continuities that exist
between the cultivation of specific areas of specialized knowledge, expertise or skill (without which
we could scarcely endure) and that more fundamental and wide-ranging attempt to penetrate by our
reason the very structures of the natural world, to evoke the dimensions and significance of the beauti-
ful, to reach towards an understanding of what it is to be human, of one's position in the universe, and
of one's relations with one's fellows, moral no less than material. Towards that attempt we seem im-
pelled by the very fiber of our being. In its total absence, while doubtless we survive, we do so as
something surely less than human.
The history, moreover, of that most American of educational institutions, the independent, free-
standing liberal-arts college, witnesses forcefully to the power of that central educational institution
when wedded to the other long-standing conviction that education is not a process that can wholly be
confined to classroom, laboratory, studio or library, but one to which the diverse experience and richly
variegated moments of life in a residential community must all combine to make their particular con-
tribution. Extracurriculum as well as curriculum; play as well as work; fellowship as well as solitude;
the foreign as well as the familiar; discomfort as well as ease; protest as well as celebration; prescrip-
tion as well as choice; failure as well as success.
President Francis Oakley
Induction Address (1985)
At Williams, with a spectacularly talented and devoted faculty and staff, great physical and finan-
cial wealth, and the absolute finest students in all of American higher education, we are obligated to
Mission and Objectives
­ 7 ­
realize a vision of educational excellence worthy of our extraordinary resources. That vision undoubt-
edly involves the optimal use of new technologies to enhance the special relationship between a stu-
dent and a faculty member; the breaking down of departmental boundaries, fostering cutting edge
interdisciplinary teaching and research; a way to link more effectively the education that takes place
within the classroom with the education that takes place in the dorm rooms and dining halls and on the
playing fields; a program that allows our students to venture out into the world in ways that reinforce
their classroom experiences; and a commitment to redouble our efforts to educate our students in an
environment that reflects the great strength of our diverse society and to keep the precious prize of a
Williams education open to the most talented students in the nation regardless of family background.
We have never wavered in understanding that our mission is to provide the highest quality under-
graduate education possible, centered on an appreciation and indeed a love of the liberal arts. We can
build on that legacy. This is a time for Williams to set a new standard of excellence in undergraduate
education for an entire industry crying out for guidance. Let history one day note that our community
had the courage to seize the moment.

THE CURRICULUM
Williams College offers a course of study leading to the degree of Bachelor of Arts. The course
requirements prescribe both the number of courses to be completed and the minimum grade level to
be achieved; the curriculum also requires that each student explore several fields of knowledge and
concentrate in one. The full requirements for the degree include meeting the minimum academic stan-
dards stated below, residing at the College, fulfilling the distribution requirement, completing a major,
and completing the physical education requirement.
The academic year is divided into two regular semesters and a Winter Study Program. The student takes
four courses in each semester and during January pursues a single program of study on a pass-fail basis.
The Winter Study Program, which began in 1967, is intended to provide students and faculty with a
dramatically different educational experience in the January term. The differences are in the nature of
the courses, the nature of the learning experience, and the change of educational pace and format from
the fall and spring semesters. These differences apply to the faculty and students in several ways: fac-
ulty can try out courses with new subjects and techniques that might, if successful, be used later in the
regular terms; they can explore subjects not amenable to inclusion in regular courses; and they can
investigate fields outside their usual areas of expertise. In their academic work, which is graded Hon-
ors, Pass, Perfunctory Pass, or Fail, students can explore new fields at low risk, concentrate on one
subject that requires a great deal of time, develop individual research projects, or work in a different
milieu (as interns, for example, or on trips outside Williamstown). In addition, Winter Study offers
studentsanopportunityformoreindependenceandinitiativeinalessformalsetting, more opportunity
to participate in cultural events, and an occasion to get to know one another better.
REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR OF ARTS DEGREE
Academic Requirement
To be eligible for the Bachelor of Arts degree a student must pass 32 regularly graded semester
courses and receive grades of C minus or higher in at least 19 of those semester courses, pass four
Winter Study Projects, fulfill the four-part distribution requirement, complete all requirements for
the major including an average of C minus or higher, and complete the physical education require-
ment. A student may not repeat a course for which degree credit has been awarded.
Distribution Requirement
The distribution requirement falls into four parts. Please note that courses used to fulfill these require-
ments must be regularly graded.
1) DIVISIONAL REQUIREMENT--designed to ensure that in their course of study at Williams,
students take an appropriately diverse distribution of courses across the full range of the curricu-
lum.
For the purposes of the requirement, courses are grouped into three divisions: Division I, Lan-
guages and the Arts; Division II, Social Studies; and Division III, Science and Mathematics. A full
listing of the subjects in each division appears below.
Students must complete at least three graded semester courses in each division. Two in each divi-
sion must be completed by the end of the sophomore year. No more than two of the courses used to
satisfy the requirement may have the same course prefix. The courses must be taken at Williams or
at programs under the direction of Williams College Faculty.
Courses that fulfill the distribution requirement in Division I are designed to help students become
better able to respond to the arts sensitively and intelligently by learning the language, whether
verbal, visual, or musical, of a significant field of artistic expression. Students learn how to develop
the capacity for critical discussion, to increase awareness of the esthetic and moral issues raised by
works of art, and to grow in self-awareness and creativity.
Courses which fulfill the Division II requirement consider the institutions and social structures that
human beings have created, whether knowingly or unknowingly, and which in turn markedly af-
fect their lives. These courses are intended to help the students recognize, analyze, and evaluate
these human structures in order that they may better understand themselves and the social world in
which they live.
Courses which fulfill the Division III requirement are intended to provide some of the factual and
methodological knowledge needed to be an informed citizen in a world deeply influenced by
scientific thought and technological accomplishment, and to cultivate skill in exact and quantita-
tive reasoning.

Please note: Any Environmental Studies course that is also cross-listed with another subject carries dis-
tribution credit of that subject. Other Environmental Studies courses may fulfill distribution requirements
as indicated under individual course listings.
Williams-Exeter Programme at Oxford University tutorial courses (WIOX) may be used toward fulfilling
the divisional distribution requirement; a student may earn a maximum of three distribution requirements,
with no more than one from each division, for the year.
2) PEOPLES AND CULTURES REQUIREMENT--intended to help students to begin to under-
stand the cultural diversity of American society and the world at large, so that, as citizens of an
increasingly interconnected world, they may become better able to respond sensitively and intelli-
gently to peoples of varied social backgrounds and cultural frameworks. Courses which fulfill this
requirement are thus designed to familiarize students with some dimension of American cultural
diversity or that of the non-Western world. Each student must complete one graded semester
course primarily concerned with : (a) the peoples and cultures of North America that trace their
origins to Africa, Asia, Latin America, Oceania, or the Caribbean; Native American peoples and
cultures; or (b) the peoples and cultures of Africa, Asia, Latin America, Oceania, or the Caribbean.
Students are urged to complete this course, which may also be used to fulfill any of the other re-
quirements, by the end of the sophomore year.
An asterisk following a course title indicates that the course may be used to meet the Peoples and
Cultures Distribution Requirement. A list of courses offered in 2006-2007 that meet the require-
ment is on page 317.
The Curriculum
­ 10 ­
3) QUANTITATIVE/FORMAL REASONING REQUIREMENT--intended to help students be-
come adept at reasoning mathematically and abstractly. The ability to apply a formal method to
reach conclusions, to use numbers comfortably, and to employ the research tools necessary to ana-
lyze data lessen barriers to carrying out professional and economic roles. Prior to their senior year,
all students must satisfactorily complete a Quantitative/Formal Reasoning (QFR) course--those
marked with a "(Q)." Students requiring extra assistance (as assessed during First Days) are nor-
mally placed into Mathematics 100/101/102, which is to be taken before fulfilling the QFR re-
quirement.
The hallmarks of a QFR course are the representation of facts in a language of mathematical sym-
bols and the use of formal rules to obtain a determinate answer. Primary evaluation in these courses
is based on multistep mathematical, statistical, or logical inference (as opposed to descriptive an-
swers). A list of courses offered in 2006-2007 that meet the requirement is on page 321.
4) WRITING REQUIREMENT--All students are required to take two writing-intensive courses:
one by the end of the sophomore year and one by the end of the junior year. Students will benefit
most from writing-intensive courses by taking them early in their college careers and are therefore
strongly encouraged to complete the requirement by the end of the sophomore year. Courses desig-
nated as "writing intensive"--those marked with a "(W)"--stress the process of learning to write
effectively. Such courses include a substantial amount of writing (a minimum of 20 pages), usually
divided into several discrete assignments. Instructors pay close attention to matters of style and
argumentation. Enrollments are limited to 19. A list of courses offered in 2006-2007 that meet the
requirement is on page 326. One of the W courses may be an independent study that meets the
writing intensive criteria.
All Williams-Exeter Programme at Oxford University tutorial courses (WIOX) meet the Williams Col-
lege "Writing Intensive" designation, except for those in the studio arts, mathematics, and the sciences.
Major Requirement
The Major Requirement is designed to assure that all Williams undergraduates will have the experience
of disciplined and cumulative study, carried on over an extended period of time, in some important field of
intellectual inquiry. Juniors are required to declare a major and the selection is normally made at the time of
registration in the spring of the sophomore year.
Majors are offered in the following fields:
American Studies History
Anthropology Japanese
Art Literary Studies
Asian Studies Mathematics
Astronomy Music
Astrophysics Philosophy
Biology Physics
Chemistry Political Economy
Chinese Political Science
Classics (Greek, Latin) Psychology
Comparative Literature Religion
Computer Science Russian
Economics Sociology
English Spanish
French Theatre
Geosciences Women's and Gender Studies
German
GENERAL STRUCTURE OF MAJORS
1) A student ordinarily must elect at least nine semester courses in his or her major field. A major
may also require an additional course and/or one Winter Study Project during the junior or senior year.
A student may also fulfill the minimum requirements for a major by taking eight semester courses
in the major field and two semester courses, approved by a major advisor, in associated fields. In inter-
departmental majors, such as Political Economy, a larger number of courses may be required.
2) A prescribed sequence of courses, supplemented by parallel courses, and including a major
seminar, is required in some major fields. Other majors ask the student to plan a sequence of elective
courses, including advanced work building on elementary courses in the field, and ending in a one- or
two- semester faculty-organized course or project in the senior year. All majors provide a system of
counseling to help students plan programs reflecting individual interests as well as disciplined and
cumulative patterns of inquiry.
Courses in many major programs require prerequisite courses in related areas. A full description
of the detailed structure of each major is found under the heading of that major.
The Curriculum
­ 11 ­
CONTRACT MAJOR
Students who wish to undertake the coherent study of an interdisciplinary subject not covered by
a regularly offered major may propose to be contract majors. Procedures for arranging a contract
major and for honors work in such a major are described in the section, "Courses of Instruction."
Students interested in this option should begin consulting with the Dean's Office and with potential
faculty advisors early in the sophomore year. A student completing a contract major may not do so
in conjunction with a second major. For further details, see page 129.
TWO MAJORS
A student may complete two majors with the permission of both majors and the Committee on
Academic Standing. Although a student may be granted permission to use a course from one major
to fulfill a particular requirement in the other, the student nevertheless must take the minimum num-
ber of courses in each field without counting any course twice. A student may be a candidate for
Honors in either or both of the majors, but a course for Honors in one major may not be used for an
Honors course in the other.
Physical Education Requirement
The Physical Education requirement provides students the opportunity of establishing and main-
taining a general level of fitness and well-being; of developing abilities in carry-over activities; of
discovering and extending their own physical capabilities; and of developing skills in activities with
survival implications, such as swimming, life saving, and water safety.
A swim test is required of all first-year students at the start of the academic year. Students who fail
to complete the test must pass a basic swim course given in the Physical Education program during the
first quarter of the year.
Students must complete four quarters of physical education by the end of the sophomore year. Stu-
dents must enroll in at least two different activities in fulfilling the requirement.
Participation in a fall or spring intercollegiate sport is equivalent to two activity units and partici-
pation in a winter sport is equivalent to three units. A maximum of three credits may be attained
while participating in intercollegiate sports with the exception of a two sport athlete who can fulfill
the physical education requirement by totaling four units in two sports. Students may receive a
maximum of two activity units for participation in a club sport; the remaining two units must come
from the physical education activity program.
Residence Requirement
Students who begin college at Williams must spend a minimum of six semesters in residence at
Williams. Students transferring to Williams from other institutions must spend a minimum of four
semesters in residence at Williams, and those entering as sophomores are expected to spend six se-
mesters in residence. Students are considered to be in residence if they are taking a program of study
under the direction of the Williams College Faculty. Students must be in residence for both semesters
of the final year.
The degree requirements must be completed within eight semesters, including any semesters for which
a student receives credit while not in residence at Williams. Thus, semesters spent away on exchange or
other approved programs at other colleges are included in the eight semesters. Similarly, if a student from
the Class of 2007 or earlier requests, and the Committee on Academic Standing grants, degree credit based
on Advanced Placement scores, then these semesters are also included in the limit of eight.
ADDITIONAL CURRICULAR OPPORTUNITIES
Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate
At the discretion of the appropriate departments or programs, students presenting satisfactory
scores in Advanced Placement tests or International Baccalaureate higher level examinations may be
placed in advanced courses not regularly open to them and/or may receive course credit toward the
major or concentration. Therefore, if granted, this credit may be used as a prerequisite or in partial
fulfillment of the major or concentration requirements. AP and IB credit, however, may not be used to
reduce the normal course load of any semester, to make up a deficiency incurred at Williams, or to
satisfy the Distribution Requirement.
For members of the Class of 2007 or earlier, AP or IB credit (if in two or more subjects) may also
be used for acceleration, i.e. completion of the degree in fewer than four years. Starting with the
Class of 2008, this option is not available.
The Curriculum
­ 12 ­
Certificate in European Languages
Students may pursue a Certificate in four European languages offered at Williams (French, Ger-
man, Russian, and Spanish). The program certifies a particular degree of proficiency, cultural literacy,
and experience with the language in the context of one's college education. In order to gain the profi-
ciency and experience certified by the program, students must have taken a) at least five semesters of
college language (or the equivalent) and b) a standardized proficiency test administered by the depart-
ments. In addition, students are required to gain familiarity with the culture in question by taking at
least one course each in a) the literature, music, art, or philosophy, and b) the history, economics, or
politics of the cultural area. Students must take seven courses altogether, up to two of which may be
taken abroad. Please refer to the respective language programs for details on the specific certificates.
Combined Program in Liberal Arts and Engineering
The 3-2 program enables qualified students to combine a liberal arts education at Williams with
undergraduate professional training in engineering. In this program, a student studies at Williams for
3 years, completing 24 courses and 3 Winter Study Projects. He or she then transfers to a leading engi-
neering school and studies for a Bachelor of Science degree, usually for 2 more years. Upon success-
ful completion of this program, the student receives a Bachelor of Arts degree from Williams and a
Bachelor of Science degree from the engineering school.
During their 3 years at Williams, 3-2 students must complete all of the normal requirements for a Wil-
liams degree, including a major and the distribution requirements. For students majoring in physics, chem-
istry, computer science, or mathematics, the requirements for the senior year courses and major exercise
are waived for the Williams degree. Only students who have taken the prerequisite courses, who have at
least a B average in scientific subjects, and who have a good record in other subjects will be recommended
by their major department and approved by the Committee on Academic Standing for this program.
Williams has a formal agreement with Columbia University that simplifies the application process to
Columbia's 3-2 engineering program. This program has an extensive list of prerequisite mathematics and
science courses, so it is necessary to plan course selections at Williams carefully. The booklet "Choosing
First Year Courses" includes a list of Williams courses recommended to prospective engineers.
A popular alternative to the 3-2 program is to complete the Williams B.A. in the usual 4 years, ma-
joring in one of the sciences, and then go directly to a graduate program in engineering. Please see the
section of this catalog titled "Preparation for Graduate and Professional Study." Also, prospective en-
gineers at Williams have the opportunity to take undergraduate engineering courses at other institu-
tions through various exchange programs. For information about these opportunities, please see the
section titled "Exchange Programs."
The pre-engineering advisor, Professor Jefferson Strait, will be happy to assist students inter-
ested in any of the options leading to engineering careers. Many more details about pre-engineering
can be found in the Physics Department section of the College website.
Co-ordinate Programs Offering Concentrations
In addition to majoring in a field, a student may choose to concentrate elective courses on a single
topic or area. Normally, a student declares a concentration at the time of registration in the spring of
the sophomore year. Concentrations are offered in the following programs:
Africana Studies
Biochemistry and Molecular Biology
Cognitive Science
Environmental Studies
International Studies
Jewish Studies
Latina/o Studies
Leadership Studies
Legal Studies
Maritime Studies
Neuroscience
Science and Technology Studies
Descriptions of these programs appear under the appropriate heading in this publication. If the
co-ordinate program courses are directly related to the major, a student may be allowed to reduce
the number of courses required to complete the major.
The Curriculum
­ 13 ­
Co-ordinate Programs
A number of programs do not formally offer concentrations, but do provide students with the op-
portunity to work in areas that cut across departmental and program lines. These are: Bioinformatics,
Genomics, and Proteomics; History of Science; Materials Science Studies; and Performance Studies.
They are listed in this publication in alphabetical order.
These programs provide guidance only and do not appear on transcripts.
The Critical Reasoning and Analytical Skills (CRAAS) Initiative
To one degree or another, every class at Williams goes beyond its subject--be it mathematics, Ma-
chiavelli, or modernism--to teach intellectual skills that have wide application in other fields as well
as outside of the academy: scientific reckoning, expository writing, rhetorical analysis, oral presenta-
tion, and so on.
Courses offered under the CRAAS initiative foreground such analytical skills. While each CRAAS
class covers a different topic, all are aimed particularly at developing the processes necessary for ex-
cellence in a range of fields: techniques for analyzing ideas, data, texts or artworks; approaches to
interpreting, synthesizing, and developing arguments; strategies for presenting ideas and results.
CRAAS classes typically emphasize the practices of meta-analysis--self-criticism, editing, and re-
vision--with the goal of constant improvement. Many classes feature peer tutoring, small group
work, and intensive one-on-one engagement with the professor. Students should leave a CRAAS
course with a substantially heightened ability to approach problems, analyze texts, and craft argu-
ments in whatever discipline they may go on to explore.
A few CRAAS courses are restricted to advanced students, but the majority are open to all, and
some are specifically targeted for first -year students. Most have strictly limited enrollment. Because
these classes cultivate the general strategies of effective scholarship, students are encouraged to con-
sider taking a CRAAS course early in their academic careers.
A list of CRAAS courses offered in 2006-2007 is on page 316.
Cross-Enrollment Programs
A limited number of students may register at Bennington College or Massachusetts College of
Liberal Arts for courses not offered by Williams. Interested students should contact the Registrar's
Office about arrangements.
Experiential Education at Williams
Experiential education, involving "learning by doing" outside the classroom, has been a relatively
understated but successful part of the Williams curriculum for a number of years. In addition to the use
of traditional laboratory work in the natural sciences and studio work in art, faculty have been chal-
lenging students to become engaged more personally in the Williams curriculum through field work,
whether in the form of research, sustained work on special projects or through placement with com-
munity organizations. Courses which include experiential learning provide students with opportuni-
ties to encounter firsthand the issues that they read and study about, requiring them to apply academic
learning to nonacademic settings and challenging them to use their experiences in those settings to
think more critically and deeply about what they are studying. Courses involving experiential educa-
tion as defined above range from fully integrated off-campus programs such as the Williams-Mystic
Maritime Studies Program (page 337) and Williams in New York (page 338) to courses involving one
small field research project. The amount and nature of the experiential component(s) varies according
to the instructor's judgment. See page 316 for a list of 2006-2007 courses involving experiential
education.
A range of non-credit experiential education opportunities is also available to interested stu-
dents. Community service, internships, research, and the Museum Associates Program of the Col-
lege Museum of Art all provide students the chance to "learn by doing" outside the classroom. In-
formation on each of these opportunities is provided below.
Community Service:
Opportunities to apply creative energy and initiative abound in community organizations in the
Williams College area. Service ranges from tutoring or building homes with Habitat for Humanity,
to working with developing non-profit organizations such as Northern Berkshire Creative Arts. For
more information, go to the Lehman Community Service Council homepage on the College web-

and Coordinator of Community Service (Richard.E.Spalding@williams.edu).
Internships and Research Opportunities:
A wide variety of summer internship opportunities are available to interested students through
the Office of Career Counseling (OCC) and the Center for Environmental Studies (CES). Research
opportunities are also available through individual departments. Information about OCC's Wil-
liams College Alumni Sponsored Summer Internships can be found at http://www.williams.edu/re-
sources/occ/ or by contacting Ron Gallagher, Assistant Director of Career Counseling (Ro-
nald.L.Gallagher@williams.edu). Information about CES's summer internship and research op-
portunities can be found at www.williams.edu/CES/resources/summeropps.htm or by contacting
Sarah Gardner, Assistant Director of the Center for Environmental Studies, Kellogg House (Sa-
rah.S.Gardner@williams.edu). Information about research opportunities sponsored by individual
departments is available from Department Chairs.
Museum Associates:
The Museum Associates Program of the Williams College Museum of Art provides students an
opportunity to broaden their knowledge of art and art history, to learn about the field of museum
education, and to develop valuable communication and public speaking skills while working with the
public. The only academic requirement is the completion of ArtH 101-102. Applications are accepted
every spring. For more information, contact Rebecca Hayes, Director of Education at Rebec-
ca.L.Hayes@williams.edu.

Education website at www.williams.edu/admin/deanfac/exped/ or contact Paula Consolini, Coor-
dinator of Experiential Education at 597-4588 (pconsoli@williams.edu)
Honors Program
Williams awards the degree with honors to those students who have demonstrated imagination,
initiative, and intellectual independence within the major. The Honors Program requires two or three
courses constituting a clearly interrelated pattern of study, whether in the form of a thesis, specializa-
tion within the major, or interdisciplinary study with courses from other programs or departments. At
least one of the courses must be in addition to the minimum number required for the major; one may
be a Winter Study Project. A student who is completing two majors may be a candidate for honors in
either or both of the majors, but a course for honors in one major may not be used as an honors course
in the other. Some programs also award honors for their concentrations.
Individual departments and programs describe special criteria, procedures, and patterns of study
for honors in the "Courses of Instruction" section. Students should consult with their departments
on their honors options prior to the senior year. Before the student has begun the last of the required
course units, the department or program determines whether the student is admitted to honors can-
didacy. The degree is awarded with Honors or Highest Honors at the end of the senior year if, in the
judgment of the department, its criteria of excellence have been met.
Independent Study
When a particularly able student wishes to study a subject not covered by the normal offerings of
the College, arrangements may be made to undertake courses of independent study under faculty
supervision. Such arrangements are made with the appropriate department at the time of registra-
tion.
Study Away from Williams
Students may receive credit for work completed at other institutions or programs. Applications for
study elsewhere require the approval of the chair of the student's major, the Dean's Office, and the
Committee on Academic Standing. Students studying away during the junior year should have al-
ready completed at least two courses in each division toward the divisional distribution requirement,
the writing and quantitative/formal reasoning requirements and the physical education requirement.
Courses completed while away may be used toward the major with permission of the department or
program and/or to fulfill the peoples and cultures requirement. All other degree requirements must be
met with courses taken under the supervision of Williams faculty.
Williams participates in study abroad programs in Spain and France (in cooperation with Hamil-
ton College); in China (as part of the Associated Colleges in China); in Sweden (in cooperation with
The Curriculum
­ 15 ­
twelve other colleges and the University of Stockholm); in Denmark (with the University of Copen-
hagen Danish International Studies); and in Kyoto (the Associated Kyoto Program, run by a group
of eleven colleges). Williams students may also receive credit for approved programs at a wide vari-
ety of other institutions, or for work done directly in a foreign university, if acceptable evaluation is
possible, or accredited four-year American university. Students interested in study away should
consult the Dean's Office. Students must submit a pink petition and essay to the Dean's Office by
March of the preceding academic year for which they wish to study off campus. Students must be in
good academic standing with no deficiencies and follow the procedures as set out in the Guide to
Study Abroad.
The Williams Tutorial Program
The Tutorial Program offers Williams students a distinctive opportunity to take a heightened form
of responsibility for their own intellectual development. No student is required to take a tutorial
course, but any student with the appropriate qualifications and interests is invited to do so.
Tutorials at the 100/200 level are designed primarily for first-year students and sophomores; soph-
omores, and, in many cases, first-year students are usually given enrollment preference for such
courses, though interested juniors and seniors are often welcome. Tutorials at the 300/400 level are
designed primarily for juniors and seniors (and, often, for majors in the discipline); first-year students
and sophomores are welcome to apply, but are urged to consult the instructor before registering.
Tutorials place much greater weight than do regular courses--or even small seminars--on student
participation. They aim to teach students how to develop and present arguments; listen carefully, and
then refine their positions in the context of a challenging discussion; and respond quickly and cogent-
ly to critiques of their work. Tutorials place particular emphasis on developing analytical skills, writ-
ing abilities, and the talents of engaging in rigorous conversation and oral debate.
The ways in which particular tutorials are conducted vary across the disciplines, but here is a de-
scription of how most tutorials at Williams are organized. Tutorials are usually limited to ten students.
At the start of term, the instructor divides the students into pairs. Each pair meets weekly with the
instructor for roughly one hour. Many tutorial courses begin and end the term with a group seminar,
and in a few departments, instructors hold weekly group meetings of all tutorial members to provide
background information designed to facilitate the students' independent work. But the heart of every
tutorial course is the weekly meeting of the two students with the instructor.
At these weekly meetings, one student delivers a prepared essay or presentation (e.g., an analysis of
a text or work of art, a discussion of a problem set, a report on laboratory exercises, etc.) pertaining to
the assignment for that week, while the other student--and then the instructor--offer a critique. In the
following week, students switch roles. Typically, students write five or six essays (usually in the range
of 4-7 pages) during the term, and offer five or six critiques of their partners' work.
Since the program's inception in 1988, students have ranked tutorials among the most demand-
ing--and rewarding--courses they have taken at Williams. While not designed to be more difficult
than other courses, tutorials are nonetheless challenging, with frequent writing assignments and the
expectation that students will be well prepared to participate actively and effectively in weekly discus-
sions. At the same time, students have consistently placed tutorials among the most enriching and
consequential courses they have taken. They have appreciated the close attention to their writing and
argumentation skills; the opportunity to be held accountable, in a detailed way, for the extended im-
plications of their ideas; the chance to develop their oral abilities as they engage in debate; and the
close intellectual bonds tutorials build between teachers and students, and students with each other.
Many students have formed important advising and mentoring relationships with their tutorial teach-
ers.
Registration information: Students register for tutorials as they would for any other course (but
should first check the description for prerequisites and to see if permission of the instructor is re-
quired). Because of limited enrollments and the special arrangements involved in organizing tutorials,
students are encouraged to determine, as early as possible, their interest in and commitment to the
course. Students may not drop or add a tutorial after the first week of class. Tutorials may not be taken
on a pass/fail basis.
More information: Please see page 324 of this catalog for a list of tutorials offered in 2006-2007.
Students may obtain detailed information about particular tutorials from the course descriptions
and the instructors. (All tutorials have a "T" after the course number.) For general information, ad-
vice, or suggestions about the program, please contact Professor Stephen Fix, Tutorial Program Di-
rector for 2006-2007, in Stetson.

Williams-Exeter Programme at Oxford University
Williams offers a year-long programme of studies at Oxford University in cooperation with Exeter
College, Oxford. Based at Ephraim Williams House, Williams' study center at Oxford, the Pro-
gramme is designed to offer the fullest possible integration of the students into the intellectual and
social life of one of the world's great universities. It makes full use of the Oxford tutorial system and
the Oxford three-term calendar is followed.
In addition to extensive opportunities to pursue British and Commonwealth studies, the Pro-
gramme also offers instruction in other fields for which Oxford is particularly noted or which are
represented only marginally or infrequently in the Williams curriculum. Interested students should
consult the Dean's Office and the "Courses of Instruction" section of this catalog.
Williams-Mystic Maritime Studies Program
The William-Mystic Seaport Maritime Studies Program offers students a unique opportunity to
explore the ocean, to travel the Atlantic and Pacific Coasts, and to undertake original research of
their own design in the humanities and sciences. A term at Williams-Mystic satisfies both a semes-
ter's credit and one winter study requirement, as well as intensive writing course credit. Four Wil-
liams courses are offered as an integrated, multidisciplinary curriculum in the semester-long pro-
gram at Mystic Seaport, in Mystic, Connecticut: Maritime History, Literature of the Sea, Marine
Policy, and either Marine Ecology or Oceanography (see the American Maritime Studies section in
this catalog). Williams College faculty members serve as the Director and Marine Scientist. Travel
includes an offshore voyage on the open ocean sailing aboard a tall ship, a seminar along the Pacific
Coast, and a seminar on Nantucket Island, all of which are cross-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary
exercises. Students live in historic, cooperative, coed houses at Mystic Seaport, the world's largest
maritime museum, and have full access to world-class maritime collections, a maritime library,
well-equipped laboratory, and diverse coastal habitats (where field research can be undertaken in a
wide variety of environments, ranging from tidepools and salt marshes to sandy beaches and estu-
aries). Students also participate in maritime skills under professional instruction, with choices such
as celestial navigation, maritime art, music of the sea, boat building, or small boat handling and
sailing. Williams-Mystic seeks candidates who are willing to try new things and work in a compel-
ling academic environment. No sailing experience necessary, and all majors welcome--a typical
semester at Williams-Mystic is represented by 12 to 14 different majors spanning the sciences and
humanities. Sophomores, juniors, and seniors can attend. Interested students should contact Wil-
liams-Mystic at admissions@williamsmystic.org, call (860-572- 5359), visit the website (wil-
liamsmystic.org), or obtain a Williams-Mystic catalog from the Dean's office. Applications are on
the web and at the Dean's office. Financial aid and scholarships are available.
Williams in New York
Williams in New York is a one-semester study away program with a focus on experiential educa-
tion. It is distinctive, rigorous, and highly experiential, integrating traditional scholarship with on-
going fieldwork in related areas. Students attend classes and also spend 15 hours each week in a
workplace environment, gaining hands-on experience that provides them with new insights and
ideas which relate to their coursework. In turn, they bring this new-found knowledge into the work-
place and are able to analyze their experiences against an academic background. The fieldwork
placements are arranged in consultation with a Williams faculty member who serves as program
director. Students are placed in city organizations or agencies, where they work closely with non-
faculty supervisors throughout the semester. Classes are taught by the program director and other
professors from Williams or New York area colleges and universities. The program is headquar-
tered at the Williams Club in midtown Manhattan in close proximity to the New York Public Li-
brary, the City University of New York Graduate Center, Grand Central Station, and other New
York landmarks.

ACADEMIC STANDARDS AND REGULATIONS
Attendance
In order to give students a larger share of responsibility for their own education, Williams College does
not administer a general system of required classroom attendance. The College expects students to make
full use of their educational opportunities by regular class attendance and to assume the academic risks
incurred by absences.
Although no formal system of class attendance is maintained by the College, instructors may set such
standards of attendance as they feel are necessary for the satisfactory conduct of their courses. Students
who fail to meet these standards may be warned by the instructor and notice sent to the Dean that continued
absence will result in their being dropped from the course. A failing grade will be assigned to any course
dropped after the regular course change period. Students who do not attend the first class meeting in a
semester course or Winter Study Project may be required to withdraw by the instructor. Attendance is re-
quired at announced tests and final examinations unless the student is specifically excused by the instructor
or the Dean's Office. Satisfactory attendance in four quarters of activities approved by the Department of
Physical Education is required except for students excused by the Dean and the Director of Health.
Registration
Registration for fall and spring semesters and for the Winter Study Program takes place at designated
periods during the academic year. There may be a $5 per day processing fee for any registration changes
accepted after the announced deadlines.
New students register by mail in early summer; soon after arrival at Williams, they meet with their as-
signed Academic Advisors to discuss the curriculum and their course selections. All course changes for
new students are made after these meetings. During the first two years of study, students are limited in the
number of courses they may take in one department or subject each semester. For full details, see page 45.
Course Change Period
Course changes may be made during a designated period at the beginning of each semester. No course
changes may be made after that period except with the approval of the Committee on Academic Standing,
after consultation with the Dean's Office. During Winter Study, a second Winter Study Project may be
added if the instructor approves but the original Project may not be dropped. A processing fee of $5 per day
may be assessed for each course change accepted after the announced deadline.
First-year and first-semester transfer students may be permitted to withdraw from one course (incurring
a deficiency but no grade penalty) as late as the tenth week of the semester. Upperclass students also may
once in subsequent years withdraw from a course under the same conditions. A withdrawal, recorded on
the transcript as a "W," is granted only with the approval of the instructor and a dean and only if there is
complete agreement between the instructor and the dean that, despite conscientious effort to do the work,
continuation in the course would be detrimental to the overall educational interest or health of the student.
The deficiency thereby incurred must be removed in the normal manner. See references to making up defi-
ciencies on page 18.
Course Load
Students are required to take and complete four courses each semester. In exceptional cases, students
may, upon petition to the Committee on Academic Standing and with departmental approval at the time of
registration, elect a pattern of five semester courses in the fall semester and three in the spring or three in the
fall and five in the spring; a pass-fail course cannot be used as the fifth course in this pattern.
If a student with a disability believes that he/she is unable to pursue a full course of study, the student
may petition the Disabilities and Accommodations Advisory Group for permission to pursue a reduced
course load. Such a petition must be accompanied by a professional evaluation which addresses the stu-
dent's inability to maintain a full course of study and discusses the rationale for a reduced course load.
Upon consideration of a student's petition and supporting documentation, the Disabilities and Accom-
modations Advisory Group makes a recommendation to the Committee on Academic Standing which
renders decisions. Such cases are considered on an individual basis and may be initiated at any time during
the student's tenure at Williams.
Fifth Course Pass-Fail Option
Except in the case of the unbalanced course program described above, a student may, at the beginning of
any semester, enroll in a fifth course that must be specified as the pass-fail course. By the sixth week, a
student must decide whether to continue the course, and if so, whether on a pass-fail or regularly graded
Academic Standards and Regulations
­ 18 ­
basis. A form for designating the option chosen will be sent from the Registrar's Office. A processing fee
of $5 per day may be assessed for 5th course grading option designations accepted after the announced
deadline. A course graded "Pass" may not be used as one of the thirty-two semester courses required to
complete the degree, to fulfill distribution or major requirements, or to make up a deficiency. A pass-fail
course converted to a fifth regularly graded course may be used to fulfill distribution or major requirements
or to make up a deficiency incurred in a prior term. The grade received will be included in the calculation
of the student's cumulative grade-point average.
Winter Study Project
Students must take and pass a Winter Study Project in each of their four years. Winter Study Projects are
graded Honors, Pass, Perfunctory Pass, or Fail. All work for Winter Study Projects must be submitted by
the last day of the Winter Study Program; work may be accepted after this date only with the permission of
a dean. Students who fail their Winter Study Projects will be placed on Academic Probation by the Com-
mittee on Academic Standing and will be required to make up the deficiency (see page 18). Students who
fail through gross neglect of work will normally be required to resign. A student who receives a second
Perfunctory Pass grade in Winter Study will be required to pass a fifth course, which may be graded on the
regular A-E or pass/fail basis, in the following spring or fall semester.
Grading System and Records
Williams uses the following system of grades: A, excellent; B, good; C, fair; D, passing; E, failing.
These letters, with plus and minus value, have the following numerical equivalents in calculating grade
averages:
A+ = 4.33 B+ = 3.33 C+ = 2.33 D+ = 1.33
A = 4.00 B = 3.00 C = 2.00 D = 1.00 E = 0
A­ = 3.67 B­ = 2.67 C­ = 1.67 D­ = 0.67
A permanent record of each student's grades is kept and this official record forms the basis for any aca-
demic action by the College.
A transcript of a student's cumulative academic record is available from the Registrar's Office upon
written request. Transcripts will not be issued for students who are in financial arrears.
Provisions relating to student records, access to them, and safeguards on their use are in the Student
Handbook.
First-Year Student Warnings
In the middle of each semester, instructors report to the Registrar those first-year students whose grades
at that time are unsatisfactory. The students and their academic advisors receive notices of warnings as a
matter of routine. The Dean's Office will inform parents of students who receive two or more warnings
unless instructed not to do so by the student within three working days of the receipt of the warnings.
Extensions of Deadlines
Deadlines for course work are set by the instructor with the following limitations:
 for courses with final exams, the latest that written work may be due is 5:00 p.m. on the last
day of reading period.
 for courses without final exams, the latest that written work may be due is 5:00 pm. on the
third-to-last day of the exam period.
If work is due before these deadlines, the instructor may grant an extension up to these deadlines solely
at his or her discretion. Short extensions beyond these deadlines may be granted by a dean but only with the
concurrence of the instructor. No extensions will be granted beyond the examination period except in the
case of serious illness.
Instructors may require students who have missed announced quizzes or hour tests to present satis-
factory explanations to a dean before they are permitted to make up the exercises.
If a student is absent from a final examination, a make-up examination may be given only with the
permission of a dean and at a time determined by the dean.
Deficiencies
A student receives credit for a course by obtaining a grade of at least D minus. A student may not
repeat a course for which degree credit has been awarded. If the student fails a course, he or she must
make up the deficiency.
Academic Standards and Regulations
­ 19 ­
If a failure occurs in the first semester of a full-year course, the student may, with the consent of the
instructor, continue the course and receive credit for the second semester only. If a failure occurs in the
second semester of a full-year course, credit for passing the first semester may be retained only with the
approval of the Committee on Academic Standing.
A senior who incurs a failure in the first semester in a required major course may be dropped from the
College at midyear.
Normally deficiencies can be made up only by courses taken after the deficiencies have been incurred.
A student must make up a deficiency in one of these ways:
1) obtain a grade of at least C minus in a summer school course, approved in advance by the Registrar,
at a regionally accredited four-year college or university; (The grade will not, however, be included
in the calculation of the student's cumulative grade point average.)
2) pass an extra graded course at Williams in the semester following the failure;
3) in the case of afirst-semester failure ofayear-long language course, obtainagrade of at leastaCminus
in the work of the second semester of that course. The failure for the first semester will, however, re-
main on the student's record and will be included in the cumulative grade point average.
A deficiency must normally be made up before the start of the following academic year, or in the case of
a deficiency incurred in the spring semester, no later than the following fall semester. A student may, in
consultation with the Dean's Office, petition the Committee on Academic Standing with an alternate plan.
Separation for Low Scholarship
It is the policy of Williams College not to permit a student to remain in residence after it has become
evident that he or she is either unable or unwilling to maintain reasonable standards of academic achieve-
ment. At the end of each term, the Committee on Academic Standing reviews all academic records that fail
to meet the following minimum academic requirements:
For first-year students: Three grades of C minus or better and no failures each semester, and
at least Perfunctory Pass on the Winter Study Project
For upperclass students: Four grades of C minus or better each semester, and
at least Perfunctory Pass on the Winter Study Project
Students whose records fail to meet these minimum academic requirements or whose records otherwise
fail to show adequate progress may receive an academic warning, be placed on academic probation, or be
required to resign.
Students who are required to resign from the College for academic reasons are normally not permitted to
return for at least one year from the date of their resignation. A student who has been required to resign
from the College may petition the Committee on Academic Standing through the Dean for reinstatement
on two conditions only: all deficiencies must have been made up and a letter submitted to the Committee
that offers convincing evidence that the student is ready and able to complete work toward a degree at
Williams without further interruption.
When required to resign, students must vacate their rooms promptly. Financial aid students must also
see the Director of Financial Aid before leaving to discuss loan repayment and renewal of aid in the event
of readmission.
A student who fails to meet minimum academic standards in his or her final semester at Williams may
be required by the Committee on Academic Standing to meet them by earning grades of at least C minus
elsewhere before the B.A. will be awarded. If such work is required, it must be completed within three
years unless stipulated otherwise, and the courses must be approved in advance by the Registrar.
Withdrawal from the College in Good Standing
Students may request personal leaves of absence from a dean and, if granted, withdraw from the Col-
lege. Such time away, often as a period of reassessment and self evaluation, can prove to be educationally
beneficial. A withdrawal in good standing may be granted for not less than one semester and not more than
three years. Students who withdraw in good standing are readmitted with the approval of the Dean's Office
and are expected to complete the degree without further interruption.
Students may request permission from a dean to withdraw at any time. If a student is granted a personal
leave of absence after the semester begins, but before the end of the drop/add period, the transcript will list
the date of withdrawal as the day before the term began. If a personal leave is granted after the end of the
Academic Standards and Regulations
­ 20 ­
drop/add period, but before the end of the eighth week of the semester, the transcript will list the date of
withdrawal, but the semester will not count toward the maximum of eight allowed to complete the degree.
If a personal withdrawal is allowed after the eighth week of the semester, the transcript will list the date of
withdrawal and the courses in progress, each with a W; the semester will normally count toward the maxi-
mum of eight allowed to complete the degree and the student will incur deficiencies that must be made up
before returning to the College.
Refunds
Payment refund or credit in the event of withdrawal is described on page 27.
Eligibility for and Completion of Majors
To be eligible for any major, students must have received grades of C minus or better in each course in
the major taken in the first two years of college and Honors or Pass on any Winter Study Project taken in
the major department or program. A senior may enter a major only upon the approval of the department
chair and the Committee on Academic Standing.
All semester courses in the major must be taken on a regularly graded basis. In addition to passing each
major course and, where required, a major Winter Study Project, the student must maintain an average in
the major of 1.67 or higher. Seniors who have an average below 1.67 in the major field normally will not be
allowed to continue. A senior who receives a grade of E in the first semester of a required major course
may be dropped from the College at mid-year. A student who falls below these standards may continue in
the major only with the approval of the Committee on Academic Standing.
A senior major exercise is not required by every department but is by some. All departments requiring
such an exercise specify it as such in the description of their major programs in the "Courses of Instruction"
section, and all students in those departments must complete the exercise satisfactorily.
Eligibility for Extracurricular Activities
A student is eligible to represent the College in any athletic, dramatic, literary, or musical event and be in
the student government, or other organization as a member, substitute, or officer, unless he or she is de-
clared ineligible:
1) by the Dean;
2) by vote of the Discipline Committee; or
3) by vote of the Committee on Academic Standing because of a dangerously low record.
The Student Honor Committee may recommend to the Dean loss of eligibility as a penalty for a viola-
tion of the Honor Code.
Dean's List
All students who attain a semester average of 3.50 or higher in a program of four or more courses are
placed on the Dean's List for that semester.
Phi Beta Kappa Society
Students of the highest academic standing are eligible for election to membership in the Phi Beta Kappa
Society in accordance with the following rules:
1) The requirements for election to membership shall be a grade point average of 3.3 and Honors or
Pass in all required Winter Study Projects. There shall be two elections of new members for each class, at
the end of the junior and senior years.
2) At the end of the junior year, all students in the highest five percent of the class, ranked by cumulative
grade point average, shall be eligible for election provided they have met the requirements and have com-
pleted enough courses to be considered candidates for the B.A. degree in the following year. A student who
leaves Williams at the end of the junior year to attend graduate school may be elected under the above
procedures.
At the end of the senior year, all students not yet elected and in the highest 12.5 per cent of the class,
ranked by cumulative grade point average, shall be eligible for election provided they have met the require-
ments.
3) Students shall be eligible for election only if they have been students at Williams College for at least
two years.
4) Honorary members may be elected from distinguished alumni of at least twenty years' standing. No
more than one such member shall be elected each year.
5) Any student who shall have gained his or her rank by unfair means or who in the judgment of the
Dean of the College is not of good moral character is ineligible to election.
Academic Standards and Regulations
­ 21 ­
6) The name of a member elect shall be entered on the roll only after he or she has accepted the election
and has paid to the Treasurer the regular entrance fee.
7) Any undergraduate member who withdraws from the College before graduation or who falls short of
the minimum Phi Beta Kappa scholastic standing may, upon a two-thirds vote of the members present at
the annual meeting, be deprived of membership in the society.
8) Any undergraduate member who is expelled from the College shall be deprived of membership in
the Society.
9) While connected with Williams College as an officer of instruction or administration, any graduate of
Williams College who is a member of another chapter of Phi Beta Kappa shall be considered a regular
member of the Williams chapter.
10) While connected with Williams College as professor, associate professor or assistant professor, or
an officer of administration, any member of another chapter of Phi Beta Kappa shall have all the privileges
of the Williams chapter, including holding office and voting. While connected with Williams College, any
other officer of instruction or administration who is a member of another chapter shall have all the privi-
leges of the Williams chapter, except holding office and voting.
Awarding of Degrees
By vote of the Trustees, the degree of Bachelor of Arts is conferred at Commencement upon students
who have completed the requirements as to courses and grades to the satisfaction of the Faculty. The right
to a degree may, however, be forfeited by misconduct at any time prior to the conferring of the degree. No
degree in absentia will be conferred except by special vote of the Trustees on petition presented to the
Dean. Diplomas will not be authorized for students who have not paid College charges or have not re-
turned all books belonging to the library.
Graduation with Distinction
The Faculty will recommend to the Trustees that the degree of Bachelor of Arts with distinction be con-
ferred upon those members of the graduating class who have passed all Winter Study Projects and obtained
a four year average in the top:
35% of the graduating class -- Bachelor of Arts cum laude or higher
15% of the graduating class -- Bachelor of Arts magna cum laude or higher
2% of the graduating class -- Bachelor of Arts summa cum laude
­ 22 ­
ACADEMIC ADVISING
A variety of academic advice and counsel is provided to students during the course of their undergradu-
ate education. Instructors, departmental and administrative officers, and some special programs are avail-
able to help students explore and develop their academic interests and talents and take advantage of aca-
demic opportunities available through the College.
In the first year each student is assigned an academic advisor from the faculty or staff. This advisor
discusses course choices and academic requirements with the student. The Dean's Office coordinates this
advising program, reviews the academic progress of individual students, and--when appropriate--calls
students in to discuss their situations.
In the sophomore year, students continue their relationship with their first-year advisor and it is recom-
mended that they seek advice from deans, former advisors, and instructors, along with preprofessional and
other special advisors (see page 411). Sophomores are also encouraged to discuss major options and re-
quirements with faculty members from departments and programs in which they have an interest before
declaring a major in the spring semester.
The student-run Peer Advisor program provides additional advice and information for sophomore stu-
dents in particular, as well as for first-year students and any others with questions about particular courses,
departments, majors, or areas of study. Senior Advisors are nominated by departments and programs from
among the year's senior majors. During the course of the year the Senior Advisors hold several Course and
Majors Fairs, keep informed about any changes in faculty and curriculum in their departments, and gener-
ally make themselves available for consultation by students.
In the junior and senior years students are advised by faculty from their major departments or programs.
Each department or program determines its own advising system for its majors, although chairs are regu-
larly available for consultation.
ACADEMIC ASSISTANCE
Additional programs of academic assistance are also available through the Dean's Office. After confer-
ring with the instructor, a student needing extra help in a particular course may request a tutor recom-
mended to the Dean's Office by the department; costs of this tutoring are covered by the Dean's Office.
Students seeking to improve their writing skills in any course may take advantage of the Writing Workshop.
Trained and supervised by a coordinator, student writing tutors provide help with problems on papers al-
ready corrected and with drafts of papers in progress. The Math and Science Resource Center, a drop-in
help center staffed by student tutors, is also available to students of Biology 101, 102 and 202, Chemistry
151, 153, 155, 156, 251, and 255, Mathematics 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105 and 106, Physics 131, 132,
141 and 142, and Statistics 101 and 201.
EXCHANGE AND STUDY ABROAD
Advising of exchange students and of Williams students wishing to study abroad in the junior year is
coordinated by the Dean's Office. Special orientation and information meetings are held during the fall
semester for new students and for students wishing to study abroad. Orientation and counseling of interna-
tional students is arranged by the International Student Advisor in the Dean's Office.

ACADEMIC HONESTY
All students are expected to be familiar with the Williams College Honor Code and to reaffirm their
commitment to the Statement of Academic Honesty at the beginning of each academic year. The Honor
Code covers all aspects of academic honesty, including the writing of papers and laboratory reports as well
as all quizzes, homework assignments, hour tests, and examinations.
Statement of Academic Honesty
As an institution fundamentally concerned with the free exchange of ideas, Williams College has al-
ways depended on the academic integrity of each of its members. In the spirit of this free exchange, the
students and faculty of Williams recognize the necessity and accept the responsibility for academic hones-
ty.
A student who enrolls at the College thereby agrees to respect and acknowledge the research and ideas
of others in his or her work and to abide by those regulations governing work stipulated by the instructor.
Any student who breaks these regulations, misrepresents his or her own work, or collaborates in the mis-
representation of another's work has committed a serious violation of this agreement.
Students and faculty are to report violations and alleged violations of this agreement. Such reports are to
be submitted to the Student Honor Committee, consisting of eight student members of the joint Faculty-
Student Honor System-Discipline Committee. This committee is responsible for determining the guilt or
innocence of the accused person or persons, and for recommending appropriate punishments to the Dean.
A committee of faculty members to be designated by the Faculty will sit with the Student Honor Commit-
tee in an advisory capacity.
A quorum of three-quarters shall be required for the Committee to meet. A vote of guilty by at least
three-quarters of those present is necessary for conviction. A recommendation for dismissal must be made
by unanimous vote of those present, and shall be carried out only with the assent of the President of the
College.
The Committee is responsible for informing the student body of the meaning and implications of this
statement. The aforementioned faculty committee shall be responsible for informing faculty members of
the meaning and implications of this statement.
Any amendments to this statement must be made through a student referendum in which two-thirds of
the student body votes, and in which two-thirds of those voting vote for the amendment. These alterations
must be ratified by the Faculty.
Adopted 1971
Guidelines
Instructors are encouraged to submit to the Honor Committee a written statement defining how the
Statement of Academic Honesty applies to their courses or laboratories, and to explain such guidelines to
their students. Instructors may set any type of final examination or hour test, ranging from closed-book,
alternate-seating classroom exercises to open-book, "take-home" examinations or papers, and any require-
ments for laboratory exercises. Some instructors encourage cooperation among students but others do not.
If a student is unsure how the Honor Code applies in a particular situation, it is ultimately the student's
responsibility to find out from his or her professor, or from a member of the Honor Committee, how the
Honor Code applies in that situation. An open and highly individualized system can last only as long as
both the students and the faculty work together to create a true academic community.
In written material, students are expected to avoid the possibility of even unintentional plagiarism by
acknowledging the sources of their work. Careful observance of accepted standards of reference and
attribution is required. The basic rules are summarized below. Students are further advised to consult a
recognized style manual to learn how to acknowledge sources correctly. While academic honesty does not
demand a footnote on statements of common fact, it does require that a student provide clear footnotes or
other appropriate documentation and give credit in the bibliography to ideas, interpretations, and facts that
particular sources have contributed to the student's final work.
Academic Honesty
­ 24 ­
The basic rules of attribution require that:
1) A direct quotation (whether a single word or a phrase, sentence, paragraph, or series of paragraphs)
must always be identified by quotation marks, by indenting and single spacing, or by reduced type size of
the quoted material, and a note must be used to state the exact source.
2) A paraphrase of the work of another must be acknowledged as such by a note stating the source.
3) Indebtedness to the specific ideas of others, or the summarizing of several pages, even though ex-
pressed in different words, must be acknowledged by a note stating the source.
4) Every instance of the use of another student's laboratory reports, computer programs, or other mate-
rial must be acknowledged by a note.
5) Even the use of a student's own previous work must be acknowledged; thus, a student must obtain
the prior permission of all instructors concerned before submitting substantially the same paper in more
than one course.
Procedures for Alleged Violations
Students or faculty members who have discovered a violation or a possible violation of the Honor Code
should report it promptly either to the faculty chair or to the student chair of the Honor Committee. As
soon as possible after receiving a report of an alleged Honor Code violation, the Student Honor Committee
will convene to hear the case. The person bringing the charge will present the evidence to the Committee in
the presence of the accused student, who may then speak in his or her own defense both with and without
the accuser present. After the accused student has left the proceedings, the Committee will determine inno-
cence or guilt and, if the latter, will recommend an appropriate penalty to the Dean. Depending on the
circumstances of the violation, penalties then imposed by the Dean may include such possibilities as a
directed grade of E in the course, disciplinary probation, or temporary or permanent separation from the
College.
­ 25 ­
EXPENSES
Within the limits of available funds, Williams endeavors to offer its educational opportunities to all who
qualify for admission. Income from its endowment and annual contributions from its alumni and friends
have enabled Williams to keep its tuition at about half the actual cost per student to the College.
Payment of Term Bills
College bills for one-half of all tuition and fees are mailed to parents twice a year (in mid-July and mid-
December) for payment on August 15 and January 15; a fee of $250 may be charged if payment is re-
ceived after these dates. Term bills must be paid before the semester's classes begin or the student will not
be permitted to enroll in classes or remain in residence at the College. Billing statements for accounts with
outstanding balances or current activity will be issued monthly and are due upon receipt.
All outstanding balances must be paid to the Bursar, and all books and materials must be returned to the
Library, before the student is entitled to a degree or a transcript.
College Bills
College charges for tuition, room, board, and fees for the academic year 2006-2007 are as follows:
Tuition $33,478
Room Fee (including telephone service) 4,540
Full Board 4,410
Student Activities Fee* 172
House Maintenance Fee (upperclass) or First-Year Dues 50
_______
$42,650
Other Expenses
Based on a study of expenses reported by financial aid students, a minimum normal budget for a college
year at Williams includes additional expenses estimated as follows:
Books 800
Clothing, Laundry, Recreation approximately 1200
_______
Estimated year's total, exclusive of travel expenses** $2,000
________________
*A student activities fee for support of non-athletic student organizations is charged to all un-
dergraduates as part of the College term bill. It includes, for example, subscriptions to the col-
lege newspaper, and admission to most drama productions and musical events on campus.
**Travel expenses are not included in figures listed above. The cost of two round-trip tickets is
added into each successful financial aid candidate's award.
Additional Items
A House Maintenance Fee of $50 per year is charged to upperclassmen as a part of the College term bill.
It is used to provide a base for the social and cultural programs of each residential House and to meet any
unusual maintenance expenses for the Houses. First-year class dues of $50 are charged at the rate of $25
each semester.
The Commonwealth of Massachusetts requires that, effective September 1, 1989, all full- and part-time
students enrolled in institutions of higher education located in Massachusetts must participate in a qualify-
ing student health insurance plan offered by the institution or in another health insurance program affording
comparable coverage.
Expenses
­ 26 ­
The College offers a qualifying student health insurance plan to all students. The College will allow
students to waive participation in this insurance plan if the student will certify in writing, before the begin-
ning of the academic year, that the coverage offered by an alternative program chosen by the student is
comparable to that of the qualifying program available at the College.
Information about the student health insurance program offered by the College, including current details
of its cost, is mailed to all students each year. Additional information about this program or about the Com-
monwealth's requirements is available through the Thompson Health Center at (413) 597-3166.
There may be a $5 per day processing fee for any registration changes accepted after the announced
deadlines. There is a charge of $25 for a lost key.
Payment of College Bills
A non-refundable deposit of $200 to reserve a place in the first-year class is required from all admitted
candidates (except certain financial aid recipients) by the Candidate's Reply Date of May 1. The deposit
appears as a credit on the term bill rendered in July.
College tuition statements for one half of all fees are mailed to the billing name(s) and addresses on
record twice a year--in July, payable by August 15, and in December, payable by January 15. Payment
may be made by check, money order, or wire transfer. Credit cards can not be used to pay tuition and fees.
A fee of $250 may be charged if payment is received after these dates.
Students who receive a scholarship(s) that was not awarded through the Williams Office of Financial
Aid must complete a Scholarship Information Sheet and mail it to the Financial Aid Office by early June.
Provisional credit will be posted to the semester bill for the following; anticipated disbursements of direct
loans for which a promissory note has been signed and returned to the Office of Financial Aid, anticipated
disbursements of outside loans approved by the lender, outside scholarships which have not yet been re-
ceived and applied against the student account and any remaining semester contract amount for the Ten
Month Payment Plan. If actual payment for the above provisional credits are not received by the date antic-
ipated, the provisional credit will expire and be removed from the student's account creating a balance due.
A check returned to the College for any reason such as "account closed" or "insufficient funds" will be
charged to the student's term bill and a "return check charge" of $20.00 will be assessed. The College
reserves the right to require that payment be made in the form of cash, cashier check or money order.
Students with bills still unpaid at the start of the semester who have not made satisfactory arrangements
with the Bursar will not be permitted to enroll in classes or remain in residence at the College. Furthermore,
if arrangements for payment after the start of the semester are approved by the Bursar and these expected
payments are not made on time, students may not be allowed to enroll for the next semester.
If efforts by the Bursar's Office to collect the monies owed are unsuccessful, the account could be
placed with a collection agency, and if the delinquency persists, the College's experience with the account
may be reported to a national credit bureau. It is the policy of the College to pass on to the debtor all reason-
able costs associated with collection of the debt through a collection agency. If at any time the student
believes information concerning payment delinquency is inaccurate, he/she should notify the College c/o
The Bursar's Office, P.O. Box 406, Williamstown, MA 01267.
There are several loan options available to parents through outside sources. These include the MassPlan
Loan through the Massachusetts Educational Financing Authority and the Federal Plus Loan Program.
Information on these loans can be found in the brochure A Guide to Borrowing for College.
Williams also offers an installment plan, administered by Tuition Management Services whereby the
yearly charges are paid in 10 equal installments starting in June, with no interest charges. There are no

Financial Aid
Williams has a substantial financial aid program to promote the greatest possible diversity in the social
and economic background of the student population. Students interested in financial aid policies and pro-
cedures should consult Williams College Prospectus,the Student Handbook, or the Office of Financial Aid.
Distinctive Undergraduate Scholarships
Williams College, through the Office of Financial Aid, administers over three hundred endowed schol-
arships, all of which are based on demonstrated need. Students who apply for financial assistance are auto-
matically considered for all these and other endowed scholarships. No separate application is required.

assistance for up to three years of graduate/professional study.
Alumni Funded Tutorials
Tutorials bring a professor and two students together in weekly sessions that epitomize President James
A. Garfield's (Class of 1856) legendary statement: "The ideal college is Mark Hopkins on one end of the
log and a student on the other." They forge student-professor bonds, teach students about arguments, about
arriving at and defending a position, and about responding on the spot to questions, criticisms, and sugges-
tions. They also promote critical reading, the writing of succinct analyses, and oral defense.
The College recognizes the Classes of 1953, 1954, and 1979 with deepest gratitude for supporting Tuto-
rials with their generous 25th and 50th Reunion gifts. Williams is also pleased to recognize the following
individuals who have created generous endowments to support Tutorials, many in honor of their 25th and
50th Reunions: Hugh Germanetti 1954, David A. Gray 1954, Robert L. Guyett 1958, John D. Mabie
1954, and John H. Simpson 1979.
A member of the Class of 1954 Reunion gift Purpose Committee says, "This is the essence of education
and eminently worthy of the full support of the 50th Reunion Class of 1954. I was always aware of the
benefit we each enjoyed as one student among only fifteen or eighteen in our usual classes--would that we
also could have had the benefit of regular two-on-one sessions with a professor. I don't believe we could
offer those who follow us anything richer than that experience."

PREPARATIONFORGRADUATEAND PROFESSIONALSTUDY
Although the principle function of Williams is to provide a broad and solid liberal education that will be
of lasting value no matter what the vocation a student may pursue, the College recognizes that no funda-
mental conflict exists between a liberal education and preparation for a professional career; on the contrary,
a foundation of liberal studies increases professional competence in any field. A student should plan his or
her program of study so as to provide as much educational breadth and enrichment as circumstances per-
mit. A student should also give serious consideration to post-college plans early in the college career.
Each departmental major provides the foundation for graduate study in the corresponding field. Stu-
dents should consult the departmental programs listed under "Courses of Instruction" for requirements,
and for special advice regarding preparation for graduate study. Students should also consult with the ap-
propriate departmental chairman or the special faculty advisors as early as possible in their college careers
to make certain they have taken all the necessary factors into consideration.
Particular attention is called to the foreign language requirements of graduate study. Candidates for the
degree of doctor of philosophy at almost all graduate schools are required to have a reading knowledge of
both French and German. Under certain circumstances another language may replace French. Many grad-
uate schools require also a knowledge of Latin for students of English and Romantic Languages. Candi-
dates for the master of arts degree are required to have a reading knowledge of either French or German.
Students should consult departmental chairmen or the faculty advisors for the requirements in specific
fields of study.
Visual Arts
Students interested in graduate studies in art or architecture should meet with faculty with whom they
have completed advanced work in the areas they wish to pursue. Their counsel and that of the Department
of Art Academic Advisor, Ed Epping, can help the student narrow the search of programs that would best
match the student's needs. The specific requirements of all art and architecture schools offering Master of
Arts and/or Master of Fine Arts is available from their online resource.
The College Art Association (CAA) has written:
"Admission to (graduate) programs should be based on the nature, extent, and quality of un-
dergraduate preparation, including courses in studio, art history, and other academic subjects.
Quality of studio preparation can best be judged on the basis of careful evaluation of work
done at the undergraduate level; therefore, a portfolio review (usually represented by slides) is
regarded as an absolute necessity in the admission process.
While many institutions consider the BFA to be the standard qualifying degree, the fact that the
applicant has attended a BA- or BS-granting institution does not necessarily rule out accep-
tance in most MFA programs. Whatever the undergraduate degree, most entering graduate
students tend not to be completely prepared in one or more of the areas cited above and will
require remedial make-up work...
Some institutions use the MA degree as a qualifying prerequisite for final acceptance into
MFA candidacy, allowing the student to apply the earned credits toward the higher degree."
Students are advised to take into consideration not only current minimum requirements but also recom-
mended courses. A summary of the essential information required for curricular planning may be found in
the "Guide to the Studio Art Major."
Business Administration
Williams offers no special course in preparation for a business career for graduate study in business
administration. The qualities which are important to succeed in business, and which graduate business
schools are seeking, are an ability to reason and to express oneself logically and clearly in written and oral
exposition; a good understanding of the physical and social environment in which business operates; a
solid background in quantitative skills; and an appreciation of human motivations and goals. This means
that a broad liberal arts program is preferred over a highly specialized one.
Preparation for Graduate and Professional Study
­ 31 ­
Within this broad prescription it may be desirable to have at least one year of economics and one year of
mathematics (including statistics and calculus). For those interested in production management or opera-
tion research, additional work in any quantitative course and/or a course in computer science would be
helpful.
But there is no particular major at Williams that is designated as preparation for the business profession.
Students interested in futures in business are encouraged to undertake a broad educational program in the
arts, humanities, and sciences. It is important that one gets involved in extra-curricular activities, one holds
a leadership position, and pursuing relevant summer internship is critical.
Students interested in graduate work in business administration should consult with the Pre-MBA Advi-
sor, Robin Meyer, at the Office of Career Counseling.
Engineering
Many Williams graduates enjoy productive careers in engineering, applied science, or technical
management. Successful engineers need to be able to communicate effectively, reason logically, and
understand both the technical and the social dimensions of a problem. A prospective engineer should
major in one of the sciences (usually physics, chemistry, computer science, or mathematics), while
pursuing a broad liberal arts education at Williams. Most often he or she will complete a Williams
B.A. in the usual four years and then go to an engineering school for professional training leading to a
master's degree or doctorate in engineering. While it may be necessary to make up a few undergradu-
ate engineering courses, the opportunities at Williams to participate in scientific research and the
breadth of a liberal arts education prepare Williams graduates to succeed in engineering graduate
study and in their careers.
The booklet "Choosing First Year Courses" contains a list of Williams courses recommended to
prospective engineers. Students interested in engineering also have the opportunity to take under-
graduate engineering courses at other institutions. Williams maintains formal exchange programs
with California Institute of Technology, Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth College, and
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Williams students can arrange to study at one of these leading engi-
neering schools for one or two semesters, typically during the junior year. Please see the "Exchange
Programs" section of this catalog for more information. The 3-2 program with Columbia University
offers another opportunity to study engineering at the undergraduate level. Please see the "Combined
Program in Liberal Arts and Engineering" section for information.
The pre-engineering advisor, Professor Jefferson Strait, will be happy to help plan course selections and
to discuss the possible paths to a career in engineering. Many more details about pre-engineering can be
found in the Physics Department section of the College website.
Law
Williams graduates regularly proceed directly to law schools on the strength of their liberal education.
As a rule, law schools do not require particular pre-law curriculum for undergraduates. Consequently, ap-
plication and admission to law school is open to qualified students from all academic disciplines. This does
not mean, however, that law schools are indifferent to one's undergraduate academic experience. In fact,
law schools will be very conscious of the quality and rigor of one's undergraduate education. A serious
student, considering law school, will heed this advice and undertake a challenging program.
Students intending to study law should consult with the Pre-Law Advisor, Dawn Dellea, at the Office of
Career Counseling. Also, on a regular basis each fall, law schools from around the country will visit Wil-
liams to provide information and to answer questions of potential applicants. Check the OCC calendar for
notice of these visits.
The Health Professions
Many Williams graduates elect to pursue a career in medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine, public
health, or other health-related fields. All are welcome to seek guidance from the Health Professions Office.
Students interested in medicine and related fields should pursue a broad liberal arts education, letting
enthusiasm for subjects be a guide. In most cases, a student should consider volunteer service and field-
specific internship experience in an effort to confirm interest in the chosen field. With careful planning, any
major can be studied.
Preparation for Graduate and Professional Study
­ 32 ­
In order to pursue a career in a health-related field, a student must pay particular attention to the courses
required for graduate school admission. In certain fields, upwards of twelve courses are listed as prerequi-
sites. The general requirements for many programs are outlined in "Choosing First Year Courses," but each
student considering advanced study in the health fields should plan on meeting with the Health Professions
Advisor early in the college career to ensure that planned coursework will meet specific admissions re-
quirements.
Charley Stevenson, the Health Professions Advisor, will be happy to discuss goals and specific steps
which might help a student realize them.
Pre-College and College Teaching/Research
A central qualification for careers in teaching at any level is proficiency in a major. Students interested in
college teaching and research should prepare themselves at Williams for graduate work in the subject of
their choice. Those interested in teaching at the elementary or secondary level should plan to attain state
certification and/or earn an MAT or M.Ed at a good graduate school. There are many opportunities to do
teaching internships and study education as an undergraduate while at Williams.
Students interested in college teaching should consult with the chairs of the departments in which they
intend to major. Those interested in teaching at the elementary and secondary level should consult with the
Director of the Program in Teaching. Additional advice for both of these options is also available at the
Office of Career Counseling.
Teaching After Williams
There are many options for teaching after Williams, including independent and public school teaching.
Many states now offer streamlined programs to certify public school teachers, and many states offer wide
range of options for acquiring certification while you teach. Students who are interested in teaching are
encouraged to contact Susan Engel, the Director of the Program in Teaching at Williams, to find out how
they might participate in the program.
The Office of Career Counseling has a very active on-campus educational recruiting program that in-
cludes many private schools as well as Teach for America and similar programs. The program begins in
the fall and continues through the spring. Students interested in teaching at independent elementary- or
secondary-level schools or participating in the Teach for America or similar programs directly after gradu-
ation from Williams (certification is not required) should consult with the Office of Career Counseling.
Religious Study
There is no particular path through the Williams curriculum designed or recommended for students in-
tending to prepare for a career as a religious professional, enroll in a seminary or pursue theological educa-
tion. Most undergraduate liberal arts courses can be useful to the prospective minister, priest, rabbi, imam,
or teacher of religion. Ordination requirements vary widely depending on the particular religious commu-
nity or tradition; in some cases it may be possible to make progress on certain credentials in academic study
or field experience during the undergraduate years. A basic foundation in the study of religion is certainly
helpful--sacred texts, scriptural languages, history, philosophy, phenomenology and comparative studies,
etc. Students contemplating advanced academic work in religious studies in preparation for a career in
teaching or scholarship should give serious consideration to concentrated undergraduate study in the field.
Students with vocational interests that may include ordination or certification as a religious professional
are urged to make themselves known to one of the chaplains (or, where appropriate, one of the local clergy)
as soon as these interests begin to come into focus. Those interested in graduate academic programs in
religious studies should consult with the faculty advisor in that field.

GRADUATE PROGRAMS AT WILLIAMS
Master of Arts in Development Economics
The Center for Development Economics (CDE), which opened at Williams College in 1960, offers an
intensive one-year program in economic analysis and quantitative techniques leading to the degree of Mas-
ter of Arts in Development Economics. The program is specifically designed for economists from devel-
oping countries who have already embarked on professional careers in public agencies. The curriculum
requires courses in development economics, macroeconomics, public finance, and econometrics. CDE fel-
lows choose among other courses on related topics in lecture, seminar, and tutorial formats. Williams un-
dergraduates who satisfy course prerequisites, with the consent of the individual instructor, are encouraged
to take courses at the CDE.
Admission to the master's degree program is highly selective, with several hundred applicants each year
for 25 to 30 places. Candidates normally have a B.A. or B.Sc. degree with honors in economics or a related
field, two or more years of relevant work experience, and an effective command of spoken and written
English. CDE fellows are often nominated for the program by public agencies from which they will be on
leave.
All communications relating to the degree of Master of Arts in Development Eocnomics should be ad-
dressed to the CDE, Assistant Director, 1065 Main Street, Williams College, Williamstown, MA 01267, or
e-mail cde@williams.edu .
Master of Arts in the History of Art
In cooperation with the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute, Williams College offers a two-year
course of study leading to the degree of Master of Arts in the History of Art. The objective of the program
is to offer to a small number of students a thorough professional preparation for careers in teaching and
museums, and to enable them to pursue further research whether independently or at other institutions of-
fering higher degrees. The curriculum consists of seminars in art historical subjects and an intensive study
of foreign languages in the context of the general literature of art. Problems of criticism, connoisseurship,
and conservation arising from the study of original works of art are fundamental to the program, and op-
portunities are provided for practical experience in museum work at The Clark, the Williams College Mu-
seum of Art, and the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art. The study of primary materials is fur-
ther extended by field trips to other collections. The degree is normally awarded after two years of resident
graduate study. To earn the degree, students must take ten courses, of which at least six must be graduate
seminars (including ARTH 504). In connection with the preparation of a paper for the Graduate Sympo-
sium, students will register for an eleventh course (ARTH 509), to be graded pass/fail, in their fourth se-
mester. A demonstration of proficiency in reading two foreign languages is required. Of these two, German
is required, and French is recommended. In January of the first year, students participate in a European
study trip with selected faculty; in January of the second year, students must complete a Qualifying Paper.
In addition to all course work, students must, at the end of the second year, present a shortened version of
the Qualifying Paper in a graduate symposium to be held on Commencement weekend. To enter the pro-
gram a successful applicant must have been awarded the degree of Bachelor of Arts or its equivalent from
an accredited institution. An undergraduate major in art is not required for acceptance to the program.
For further information, write: The Director, Graduate Program in the History of Art, Box 8, Williams-
town, Massachusetts 01267, telephone (413)458-9545, or email gradart@williams.edu.

COURSE NUMBERING SYSTEM
Courses designated by a single number are semester courses.
Year courses are designated by an odd number and an even number joined by a hyphen; the work of the
two semesters constitutes an integral, indivisible course. Therefore, if a student does not pass the second
half of a year-long course, he or she forfeits credit for the first half and incurs a deficiency as a result of the
forfeiture. Students who register for a year course are required to do both semesters of that course within
the same academic year.
In some departments, course numbers have special meanings that are explained in their listings.
The (F) or (S) following a course's number indicates the semester, fall or spring, in which the course will
be offered.

MUTONGI*. Assistant Professors: BEAN, CHAKKALAKAL*, E. EDWARDS, LONG*, RO-
BOLIN. Visiting Artist in Residence in Africana Studies and Music: BRYANT. Sterling Brown
Professors: FARRED, GORDON. Mellon Fellow: WINGARD.
Candidates for a concentration in "Africana Studies: African Americans, Africans and the Diaspora"
complete five courses. The two core courses are: AFR 200 as an introductory course (generally team-
taught); and AFR 400, the senior seminar with special topics or themes emphasized each year. An honors
thesis is also an option for students wishing to conduct advanced research and study. Additional courses
may be taken with affiliated faculty and visiting professors associated with the program. We encourage
students to take at least one course in a program/department other than Africana Studies and consider an
experiential learning winter study session; however, the majority of your courses should be selected from
among those offered by core faculty.
Concentrators may focus upon a common theme or comparative studies exploring a common theme
related to Africa, North America/United States, Latin America and the Caribbean. Students may consider a
cluster of courses in the arts, humanities, and the social sciences. Please consult with the program chair and
your advisor to plan a course of study for a concentration in Africana Studies, and visit the Africana Studies
program web site for additional information.
The honors thesis, taken in addition to the five courses with permission of the chair/mentoring faculty,
consists of one or two semesters of work and a winter study.

HONORS PROGRAM IN AFRICANA STUDIES
A candidate for honors in Africana Studies must maintain at least a B+ average in the concentration and
be admitted to candidacy by the program faculty. In addition to the five courses normally required for the
concentration, an honors candidate will enroll in either AFR 491 or 492 plus a Winter Study in his or her
senior year, in order to complete a substantial written thesis or an equivalent project in the performing or
studio arts. A student wishing to become a candidate for honors in Africana Studies should secure a faculty
sponsor and inform the program chair in writing before spring registration of her/his junior year.
An honors project should demonstrate creativity, depth, and intellectual rigor. A candidate for honors is
encouraged to pursue non-traditional projects, such as presentations in the performing arts, visual arts, or
creative writing, as well as more conventional research projects. The advisor will evaluate the honors proj-
ect, and the program faculty will then decide whether to confer honors.
STUDY ABROAD
The curricular impact on potential majors of studying abroad in the junior year would be positive if
students chose to study in countries that reflect the Africana diaspora.
AFR 140(F) Revolutionary African Literature (Same as Comparative Literature 218 and English
250)*
This course will serve as an introduction to postcolonial African literatures, and it organizes a set of African
novels, essays, and poetry around the concept of revolution. In this course, we will attend to how texts represent
(or respond to) social revolutions (decolonization, civil war, feminism, etc.) as well as literary ones (realism,
postmodernism, etc.). In doing so, we will consider a variety of questions: What is "revolutionary" literature? To
what extent can literature be political/revolutionary? What is the relationship between politics and aesthetics?
Readings will include selections from among Amilcar Cabral, Chinua Achebe, Ngugi wa Thiong'o, Ama Ata
Aidoo, Bessie Head, Okot p'Bitek, Zoe Wicomb, Nuruddin Farah, Ayi Kwei Armah, and Tsitsi Dangarembga.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based upon attendance and participation, reading responses, class
presentations, one mid-term essay, and one final research paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 30 (expected: 25). Preference given to first- and second-year students.
Hour: 1:10-2:25 MR ROBOLIN
AFR 160(S) Defining the African Diaspora (Same as Comparative Literature 214 and English 251)*
What is the "African diaspora"? How are we to understand the nature of black belonging? Are the relationships
across the African diaspora mutable? What factors facilitate or complicate black identity over time and space?
This introductory course will take up these questions by turning to (a) key figures and essays and (b) the fiction,
poetry, and film from across the black world. To help better understand the conditions of transnational black
identity, we will turn to the work of W.E.B. Du Bois, Kwame Nkrumah, Amie Cesaire, Paule Marshall, Bessie
Head, Toni Cade Bambara, Marcus Garvey, Frantz Fanon, Caryl Phillips, and Julie Dash. In the process, we will
take up defining cultural and political movements that have emerged over the years: Ethiopianism, Pan-African-
ism, Negritude, and other forms of black internationalism.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based upon attendance and participation, two exams, and two es-
says.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 25 (expected: 20). Preference given to (potential) concentrators in Africana
Studies.
Hour: 11:20-12:35 TR ROBOLIN
AFR 165(F) The Quest for Racial Justice in Twentieth-Century America (Same as History 165)

offered 2007-2008) (W)*
(See under History for full description.)
AFR 200(F) Introduction to Africana Studies*
This team-taught course serves as an introduction to Africana studies and interrogates this interdisciplinary field
of inquiry. It is required for concentrators but open to all students. We will examine the representation, arts and
Africana Studies
­ 48 ­
culture, politics activism, and history of black peoples in the United States, Caribbean, Latin America, and Afri-
ca. In addition to drawing upon key historical, literary and theoretical texts in Africana Studies, the class will
incorporate lectures from core and affiliated faculty to address issues such as the black arts movement and Afri-
cana music; democracy and captivity in the United States; feminism, gender, and sexuality; black radicalism in
the Americas; and identity, class, and race in Latin America and the Caribbean. Accompanying texts will include
documentary and feature films, essays, novels, critical and theoretical studies.
Format: lecture. Evaluations will be based upon two 4- to 6-page papers, 2 exams, and a final project.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 30 (expected: 30). Preference given to (potential) concentrators in Africana
Studies.
Hour: 9:55-11:10 TR E. EDWARDS and ROBOLIN
AFR 207(F) Art of Africa (Same as ArtH 207)*
(See under Art--ArtH for full description.)
AFR 208(S) Writing Africa from Beyond: The Novel of the Diaspora*
In this course we will read a series of novels written, across the postcolonial generations, about "Africa" from
locales outside of the continent. The condition and constitution of Africa," contested so fiercely and for so long
by Africans, Africanists, and (neo­)colonialists, forms the pivotal line of inquiry for the reading of these texts.
Who writes Africa? What do those various locations of enunciation and ideological investment mean? How does
it affect the ways in which the fiction of/about Africa is written? These are some of the central issues which this
course will explore through the novels of writers such as Buchi Emecheta, Ben Okri, and Patrick Chamoiseau.
These authors, like others such as Nouredine Farah and Amitav Ghosh (The Calcutta Chromosome is a novel,
set in colonial and postcolonial India, in which north Africa, surprisingly, features pivotally), will be read for their
capacity to throw into question how "Africa" is conceived and understood through literature. In addition, we will
engage a number of theorists who take up the issue of diaspora.
Format: seminar. Requirements: two written essays, (10 pages each), one class presentation per student, compul-
sory attendance, and consistent participation.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20 (expected: 20).Preference is given to Africana Studies concentrators.
Hour: 8:30-9:45 TR FARRED
AFR 210(S) Black Leadership in American Culture (Same as Leadership Studies 210)*
Recent popular culture and scholarship suggest a total absence of African American political leadership in the
contemporary moment. What does this obsession with the leadership "void" obscure about African American
politics? What does it enable? What is the historical relationship between American popular culture and domi-
nant perceptions about what constitutes genuine political leadership? This course introduces students to funda-
mental concepts in the study of black politics and black culture--activism, representation, identity, democracy,
and nationalism--by considering the construction of black leadership in American culture. In this effort, we will
consider an array of materials, such as films, magazines, newspaper articles, and fiction, that will help us under-
stand the aesthetic dimension of leadership and how popular culture serves as the site through which political
ideals are produced and circulated. Novels include Charles Johnson's Dreamer and Paul Beatty's White Boy
Shuffle; films include Malcolm X and Panther; secondary readings include essays by Adolph Reed, Todd Boyd,
Norman Kelley, and Toni Morrison.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: active participation, written responses to readings, and four 5- to
7-page essays.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 25 (expected: 20). Preference is given to advanced students and Africana
Studies concentrators.
Hour: 9:55-11:10 TR E. EDWARDS
AFR 211(F) Topics in African-American Performance: Theatre and Film of the Harlem
Renaissance (Same as American Studies 211 and Theatre 211)*
(See under Theatre for full description.)
AFR 212(S) Race, Sexuality, and Cinema (Same as Art History 212)*
(See under Art--ArtH for full description)
AFR 220(F) Rhythm and Jazz in America, Brazil and Cuba (Same as Latina/o Studies 221 and
Music 220)*
It is commonly taught that the three primary elements of music are melody, harmony and rhythm. It is the thesis
of this course that rhythm is the most significant among these in defining American, Afro-Cuban and Brazilian
Jazz. With historical, theoretical (The Mystery of Samba: Popular Music and National Identity in Brazil by Her-
mano Vianna, The Latin Beat: The Rhythms and Roots of Latin Music, from Bossa Nova to Salsa and Beyond by
Ed Morales, The Latin Tinge: The Impact of Latin American Music on the United States by John Storm Roberts
among others) and biographical texts (Jelly Roll Morton, Louis Armstrong, Caetano Veloso), recordings and in-
class performance instruction we will examine the rhythmic basis of these genres, the relation of each to their
African roots as well as the cultural influences and artists that helped create them. What is it in these styles that
creates the infectious rhythm that drives the music and inspires movement and dance? Some of the rhythms/sty-
les examined will be New Orleans' Second Line, Shuffle Swing in America, Son, Danzon, Bolero and Rumba
Montuno in Cuba and Samba, Bossa Nova and Baiao in Brazil. All students will learn to play, sing and internal-
ize the distinctive rhythmic elements and feel of each groove. In-class professional demonstrations of the musical
styles being studied will be an important component of this course. There are plans for a field trip to New York
City to hear music and participate in a percussion/performance workshop.
Format: lecture/discussion/performance. Requirements: two 8- to 10-page research papers, basic analysis assign-
ments of musical compositions. Those with appropriate performance skills (instrumentalists, singers, and
Africana Studies
­ 49 ­
dancers) will have the option of substituting a performance accompanied by a two page written description for
one of the two papers. Evaluations will also be based on class participation. Attendance at all classes required. No
previous musical training necessary but familiarity with music notation will help.
Prerequisites: permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference given to those concentrat-
ing in Africana Studies or Music.

be offered 2007-2008) (W)*
(See under English for full description.)
AFR 240(F) Contemporary African American Literature (Same as English 253)*
From the Harlem Renaissance to the postmodern period, black writers in the United States have used the literary
text as a site of meditation on politics, identity, and national culture. Organized through parallel themes such as
slavery and neo-slavery; incarceration and escape; dreams and nightmares; coming of age and growing old; and
the church and the street corner, this introductory-level survey of twentieth and twenty-first century African
American literature will focus on situating narrative interpretation in its historical context. We will draw from
short fiction, novels, film, poetry, and literary criticism by authors such as Zora Neale Hurston, Audre Lorde,
Claude McKay, Ralph Ellison, Lorraine Hansberry, Toni Morrison, James Baldwin, Gwendolyn Brooks, and
Danzy Senna.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: active participation in class discussions, brief written responses to
readings, and four 5- to 7-page essays. No final exam.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 30 (expected: 30). Preference given to first- and second-year students con-
centrating in Africana Studies or majoring in English.

AFR 260(S) South African and American Intersections (Same as Comparative Literature 258 and
English 252)*
Despite very significant historical differences, South African and the United States have undergone analogous
periods of racial segregation and resistance. Such recognizable symmetries have been amplified by writers/art-
ists, which in turn has yielded fascinating cultural connections. This multi-genre course will trace the emergence
of a twentieth-century South African/African American cultural relationship by examining a variety of texts.
Over the semester, we will examine the patterns of influence between both populations in order to help us under-
stand the role of cultural texts in the political arena (in particular, international solidarity movements). In addition
to comparative studies, we will examine literature and artistic works by Peter Abrahams, Richard Wright, Gwen-
dolyn Brooks, Keorapetse Kgositsile, Bessie Head, Audre Lorde, J.M. Coetzee, Gil Scott-Heron, and others.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based upon attendance and participation, reading responses, class
presentations, one mid-term essay, and one final research paper.

AFR 285(S) Religion in Black Film, Media, and Literature (Same as English 285 and Religion 229)*
Debates regarding religious beliefs and practices recur throughout the history of African-American film, media,
and literature. In this course, we will analyze the complicated role of religion, particularly Christianity, in black
communities. Our texts were created during or about slavery, the Great Migration, the U.S. Civil Rights Move-
ment, and the Post Civil Rights Era. We will consider such issues as ways in which religion is shown to empower
and/or oppress black people; ways in which the politics of class, gender, and sexuality inflect black religious
practices; and strategies by which transcendent, spiritual experiences are represented. Films to be analyzed may
include: Spencer Williams' Go Down, Death and The Blood of Jesus; Stan Lathan's Go Tell it on the Mountain;
Spike Lee's Four Little Girls; Julie Dash's Daughters of the Dust; Clark Johnson's Boycott; and Tyler Perry's
Diary of a Mad Black Woman. Some class time will also be spent in the Williams College Museum of Art to

and texts by James Weldon Johnson, Gwendolyn Brooks, Howard Thurman, Ernest Gaines, Lorraine Hansber-
ry, and Alice Walker.

AFR 286(F) Constructing Black Lives in Film and Literature (Same as English 286)*
In this course, we will analyze 20th and 21st century documentary and biographical films, autobiographies, and
memoirs to investigate the different ways in which African-American men's and women's life narratives are
constructed. In particular, we will consider the impact of historical events and processes upon identities, the ways
identities are performed, and the mutually constitutive relationship among race, gender, and sexuality. Films to be
analyzed may include: Marlon Riggs' Tongues Untied and Black Is, Black Ain't; Isaac Julien's Looking for
Langston; Cheryl Dunye's Watermelon Woman; Spike Lee's Malcolm X; Brian Gibson's What's Love Got to Do
With It?; June Cross's Secret Daughter; and Clint Eastwood's Bird. Some class time will also be spent in the
Williams College Museum of Art to critique visual works in terms of identity construction. Readings may in-
clude selections by Anne Moody, Richard Wright, Rosemary L. Bray, Audre Lorde, Jill Nelson, June Jordan,
and John Edgar Wideman.

AFR 300T(F) Racial-Sexual Politics and Cultural Memory (Same as Women's and Gender Studies
415) (W)*
This tutorial focuses on race, gender and violence in 20th-century American political culture. We begin with the
anti-lynching and anti-sexual violence campaigns at the turn of the 20th century, and explore cases throughout
the 20th century that sparked political movements. We conclude with a review of constructions of cultural
memory through scholarly works, media/journalistic discourse, and visual culture concerning contemporary
controversial trials. Assigned materials include film and documentaries, memoirs, academic texts, and writings
by Ida B. Wells, Mamie Till-Mobley, David Marriott. This tutorial is designed for juniors and seniors and em-
phasizes analytical skills. Grades are determined as follows: 60% essays and response papers; 40% final paper
(synthesis of essays to explore one theme).
Format: tutorial. Requirements: alternating weekly, each student delivers a 5-page essay on assigned readings or
screenings, while his or her partner responds with a 1- to 2-page written critique. Each student writes and pres-
ents five essays and five response critiques.

AFR 320(F) Race-Gender in the Black Diaspora (Same as Anthropology 326)*
This advanced seminar will provide students with a transnational understanding of how race, gender, and class
structure the lives of people of African descent. It will also provide students with analytical tools necessary to
critically explore and consciously and constructively participate in the ongoing struggles of people of African
decent for social, economic and political justice. The course examines the ways in which racism and sexism as
articulated processes structure the lives of Blacks in the Diaspora; how gendered racial identities emerge from the
everyday struggles of Blacks enmeshed in specific racial formations; and identity politics in the struggle for racial
justice. The first section of the course provides the theoretical basis for interrogating key concepts such as "rac-
ism," "racial identity," and "racial politics" and how each intersects with gender. The second part of the course
will examine these issues in specific localities: the United States, Mexico, the Hispano-Caribbean, Central Amer-
ica, Great Britain, and Brazil.
Format: advanced seminar. Requirements: class attendance and participation, weekly discussion preparation and
leadership, reading notes and discussion questions, reading quizzes, and a final research paper.
Prerequisites: lower-level Africana Studies coursework or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 12 (ex-
pected: 15). Preference is given to advanced students and Africana Studies concentrators.

This seminar will consider the nature of the "colonial encounter" and its relation to architecture, urban planning,
photography and art traditions in former anglophone and francophone Asian and African colonies. We will also
examine how traces of colonialism merged with the arts in postcolonial situations in the contexts of the construc-
tion of national identities, tourism and international health care. The course will emphasize both the European
colonizers and the colonized peoples in institutional (missionary, government offices, hospitals, military, mu-
seums) and everyday contexts. Throughout the seminar we will explore several issues central to colonialism.
Some of these include: To what extent can colonialism be seen as a monolithic system?; How was colonial au-
thority maintained?; How were people's sense of themselves challenged by confronting different worlds?; and
What role did material culture play in the explicit articulation of "worldviews" about the nature of humanity,
civilization and history, and the more implicit process through which things "taken-for-granted" were continually
redefined and remade? In order to address these issues we will examine several case studies, including: Hanoi;
Phnom Penh; Antananarivo; Bône (Annaba); Rabat; Pretoria; Cape Town; New Delhi; northeastern Democratic
Republic of the Congo; and southern Cameroon.
Format: Seminar. Requirements: research paper. This final project will be individual in scope and the result of the
student's own research interests and needs with respect to the seminar.

AFR 410(S) Race, Culture, and Incarceration (Same as Political Science 302)*
This seminar examines poverty, race, democratic and police cultures and incarceration. The United States has the
greatest incarceration and execution rates in the industrialized world-estimated at about 2 million detained, with
over 3000 on death row. Poor people and people of color comprise the majority of those imprisoned due to the
war on drugs and racial and economic bias in policing and sentencing. This course explores the intersections of
democracy and captivity in penal sites and civil societies. Students study text, artifacts and screen documentaries
concerning: the 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution which abolished slavery while legalizing it for prison-
ers; the 14th Amendment (originally designed to protect the emancipated but largely enforced to protect corpora-
tions as "persons"); the convict prison lease system; contemporary critiques of prison systems; and penal narra-
tives. (See: http://www.williams.edu/african-american-studies/democracy.htm). There is also an experiential
education requirement or field study associated with this course. Readings include works by Michel Foucault,
Ida B. Wells, Angela Y. Davis, George Jackson, Malcolm X, and the political writings of those currently incar-
cerated.
Format: seminar. Requirements: four 3- to 4-page critiques of readings (50%); group presentations (25%); final
project with experiential education component (25%); attendance at all classes and participation in all events.
Prerequisites: previous study of racial politics in the United States.

GENERAL PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The American Studies Program uses interdisciplinary approaches to develop students' understanding of
the complexity of the culture(s) usually labeled "American." Examining history, literature, visual media,
performance, and other forms of expression, we explore the processes of cultural definition as contested by
diverse individuals and groups. We ask new questions about aspects of American life long taken for

granted; we also use American culture as a laboratory for testing classic and contemporary theories about
how cultures work.
NON-MAJORS, FIRST-YEAR STUDENTS, AND SOPHOMORES
American Studies 201 is open to non-majors including first-year students with Advanced Placement
credit in American History. All elective courses are open to students who meet the requirements of the
departments that sponsor those courses. Courses designated as junior or senior seminars are open to non-
majors with permission of the instructor.
RATIONALE FOR COURSE NUMBERING
The introductory course is offered at the 200 level to suggest the desirability of some preliminary train-
ing in college-level history, literature, sociology, or political science. The intermediate courses, designated
as Junior Seminars at the 300 level, are offered primarily for juniors, although they are open to sophomores
who have had 201 and will be away from campus during the spring of their junior year. 400 level courses
designated as Senior Seminars are designed for senior majors.
THE MAJOR
Required major courses:
American Studies 201
300 level courses designated Junior Seminar
400 level courses designated Senior Seminar
Elective courses:
Eight courses: five should be chosen from one of thespecialization fields listed below, the other three
chosen from among any of the electives listed. Students are expected to take courses from at least two
disciplines when choosing the courses that make up their specializations. Students are also required
to take at least one course from a list of pre-1900 courses.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN AMERICAN STUDIES
Candidates for honors in American Studies will undertake a substantial, year-long independent project
during their Senior year. Applicants should have a consistent record of high achievement in courses taken
for the major, and normally will have done work in the field of study of their proposed thesis. Students who
wish to write or produce an honors project should consult with a prospective faculty advisor in their junior
year. Formal application to pursue honors should be made by the time of spring registration in the junior
year. Students must submit a 1- to 2-page preliminary proposal describing the proposed project to the Chair
of the American Studies Program at this time. Final admission to the honors thesis program will depend on
the AMST advisory committee's assessment of the qualifications of the student and the merits and feasibil-
ity of the project. If the proposal is approved, they will be permitted to register for AMST 491, W30, and
AMST 492 the following year. The completed project is due in mid-April. Each student will present a short
oral presentation of his or her thesis at the end of spring semester.
ADVISING
All majors will be assigned a faculty advisor. Majors must meet with their advisor during the first week
of classes during the fall semester and at the time of the spring semester registration period in order to have
their courses and plans for the American Studies major approved. Both majors and non-majors are encour-
aged to talk at any time with the program chair or other affiliated faculty about the major.
AMERICAN STUDIES AND OTHER PROGRAMS
Students majoring in American Studies are encouraged to consider pursuing concentrations in African-
American, Environmental, and Women's and Gender Studies. Many of the courses counted for those con-
centrations may also earn credit toward the American Studies major.
STUDY AWAY FROM WILLIAMS
We encourage students to pursue cross-cultural comparative studies. A major in American Studies can
be combined with study away from Williams for a semester or a year if plans are made carefully. Many
courses that will be approved for College credit may also count toward the American Studies major if their
subject matter is American culture.
Students planning to be away in the junior year should have taken American Studies 201 before they
leave; those away for junior-year spring term should take American Studies 302 in their sophomore year.
Students should consult as early as possible with the chair or their advisor about their plans for fulfilling the
requirements of the major.

AMST 201(F,S) Introduction to American Studies
To be an "American" means something more than U.S. citizenship. In this course, we focus on the problems and
possibilities of American identity. Access to Americanness is shaped by factors such as class, race, ethnicity,
gender, sexuality, religion, and region--categories which themselves change in meaning over time. Given the
geographical, racial, and cultural diversity of the United States, the ways in which Americans imagine nation
American Studies
­ 53 ­
inevitably vary over time, according to place, and among different individuals and groups. Rather than a survey
of any one aspect or period of American history, literature, or popular culture, this course is an introduction to the
interdisciplinary field of American Studies, a field defined both by the range of texts we read (essays, novels,
autobiographies, photographs, films, music, architecture, historical documents, legal texts), and by the questions
we ask of them: How have different Americans imagined what it means to be an American? What ideas about
national history, patriotism, and moral character shape their visions of Americanness? How do the educational
system, mass media, government policies regarding citizenship and immigration shape American identities?
How are boundaries of inclusion and exclusion in the nation drawn? What uses have been made of the claim to
an American identity, and what is at stake in that claim? How have Americans imagined a national landscape, a
national culture, and to what ends?
Format: discussion. Evaluation will be based on a series of short critical essays and a group project.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 25 per section (expected: 25 per section). Preference given to sophomores
and first-year students with AP 5 in U.S. History. One section in the fall; one section in the spring.

This course examines a sampling of Asian American texts from the late nineteenth century to the present and
contextualizes them historically. Produced by writers from various Asian American groups and in a variety of
styles, these works by such writers as Maxine Hong Kingston, Jose Garcia Villa, Younghill Kang, Hisaye Yama-
moto, and Linh Dinh-provide a sense of heterogeneity of Asian American literature. They also force us to ex-
amine the intersections, material and psychic, of historical events/larger structural forces with individuals and
groups. Our readings will prod us to call into question assumptions we make about what is "Asian American"
but also, crucially, what is "American." Both domestic issues (e.g., American politics, racism, links with other
minority groups) and global considerations (e.g., U.S. immigration and foreign policies, the three wars with
Asian countries in the last century)-and how they have shaped Asian American histories and literatures-will fig-
ure importantly in our discussions.

AMST 403(F) American Music (Senior Seminar)
One way to write the cultural history of music is to trace the authority with which different people can say "`You
are hurting my ears' at any given historical moment." So writes Carlo Rotella, one of the historians whose work
we will read in this course as we approach American popular music as an object of cultural studies. We will study
particular performers and styles (e.g. Elvis, Selena, punk and hip hop), but we do so in the context of the histories
of labor; social migration; political and economic shifts; ideologies; and of the culture industry. Moving from the
late-nineteenth-century to the present, and through agrarian to industrial to postindustrial social configurations,
we will study music as a means of expressing resistance and accommodation and as the basis of community-
formation and disruption. We will pay special attention to the recent recovery by American musicians of folk
musics originating outside of American borders: Celtic, African and Cuban in the context of global capitalism
and American hegemony. Texts include works of history, cultural criticism and ethnomusicology; audio perfor-
mance recorded in the field, in the studio, and in concert; and documentary and fiction films.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on a number of written assignments.

ANTHROPOLOGY AND SOCIOLOGY (Div. II)
Chair, Associate Professor ANTONIA FOIAS

NOLAN**. Assistant Professors: SHEVCHENKO*, VALIANI. Visiting Professors:
DOWNEY§§, PRAZAK§. Visiting Assistant Professor: BESSETT.
The Department of Anthropology and Sociology at Williams aims to help students achieve an inte-
grated understanding of biography, history, culture, and social structure in both traditional and modern so-
cieties.
Anthropology explores the full range of human experience by introducing students to the study of tribal
and peasant societies, especially those on the periphery of the West, as well as to the cultural complexities
of stratified, industrial societies such as our own. Integrated with the study of specific peoples is an ex-
amination of the various analytical schemes anthropologists have developed to understand them. Courses
offered in the department represent two of Anthropology's major subfields: sociocultural anthropology--
that is, the comparative study of human social life, institutions, and beliefs--and archaeology, the study of
the origins and lifeways of prehistoric peoples.
Sociology studies the social and institutional intricacies of modern industrial societies and the social
psychological dilemmas facing the individual in our epoch. Sociology courses introduce students to classi-
cal and contemporary social thought about men and women and society, to the systematic analysis of so-
cial institutions and social interaction, and to the social analysis of modern culture. The Sociology major at
Williams emphasizes the humanistic tradition of sociology, stressing qualitative approaches to understand-
ing how social reality is constructed.
MAJORS
The department offers separate majors in both Anthropology and Sociology, with a broad and diverse
array of courses in both disciplines. The department is committed, however, to the unity of the social
sciences. To this end, Anthropology and Sociology offer joint core courses in methodology and theory, as
well as several elective courses in common. All joint courses are designated "ANSO."
Requirements
For the degree in Anthropology or Sociology, students must complete a minimum of nine courses as
outlined below:
(1) Core Courses. Majors in both disciplines must take a sequence of four core courses. Three of these
are joint (ANSO) courses. The sequences are:
Anthropology Joint (ANSO) Sociology
ANTH 101 The Scope SOC 101 Invitation to
of Anthropology Sociology
ANSO 205
Ways of Knowing
ANSO 305
Social Theory
ANSO 402
Senior Seminar
(2) Elective Courses. Majors in Anthropology or Sociology must take five elective courses from the
course listings of their respective disciplines or from the joint ANSO listings. Two of the courses
chosen are normally at the 300 level or above. In close consultation with their departmental advisors,
students may take some selected courses from other disciplines to fulfill major requirements in either
Anthropology or Sociology.
(3) Majors in each wing of the department are allowed to count up to two courses in the other wing to-
wards fulfillment of their major requirements.
STATISTICS AND DATA ANALYSIS
In addition to the nine total courses required for the major, it is recommended that Anthropology and
Sociology majors take Statistics 101 or a comparable course in statistics and data analysis.
Anthropology and Sociology
­ 59 ­
AREA STUDIES CONCENTRATION
Students who wish to combine a major in Anthropology or Sociology with an Area Studies concentra-
tion are encouraged to do so. Courses taken to satisfy an Area Studies requirement may be counted toward
the major with prior approval of a student's departmental advisor. The only exception to this rule is the
Area Studies senior seminar, which cannot ordinarily be counted toward the Anthropology or Sociology
degree.
LANGUAGE STUDY, STUDY ABROAD, AND WINTER STUDY
Departmental advisors will help interested students integrate a major with study abroad, foreign lan-
guage study, or field research during the winter study period. The department encourages Williams stu-
dents to take advantage of established foreign study programs in Egypt, Japan, India, Hong Kong, and
other countries. Because some foreign study programs do not offer courses that can be counted toward the
Anthropology or Sociology degrees, however, sophomores planning to study abroad in junior year must
consult with the departmental advisor before declaring a major.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN ANTHROPOLOGY OR SOCIOLOGY
Honors and highest honors are normally awarded for the completion of a year-long research project that
has resulted in an original thesis of high quality. Students wishing to write an honors thesis should engage a
member of the department faculty as a Thesis Advisor as soon as possible and must submit a proposal for
the thesis for department approval no later than preregistration in the spring of the junior year. If the pro-
posal is approved, they will be permitted to register for Anthropology and Sociology 493-W31-494, during
which they will write and defend a thesis. If their overall work in the major continues to be of high quality
and the thesis is deemed of a similar quality, they may be awarded honors or highest honors in Anthropolo-
gy or Sociology.
ANTHROPOLOGY / SOCIOLOGY COURSES
JOINT CORE COURSES
ANSO 205(S) Ways of Knowing
An exploration of how one makes sense of the social world through fieldwork. Some of the key questions of the
course are: What are the philosophical and epistemological underpinnings of social inquiry? How does one
frame intellectual problems and go about collecting, sifting, and assessing field materials? What are the uses and
limits of statistical data? What is the importance of history to sociological and anthropological research? How
can one use archival and other documentary materials to enrich ethnographic research? What are the empirical
limits to interpretation? What is the relationship between empirical data and the generation of social theory? How
does the social organization of social research affect one's inquiry? What are the typical ethical dilemmas of
fieldwork and of other kinds of social research? How do researchers' personal biographies and values shape their
work? We will approach these problems concretely rather than abstractly through a series of case studies of how
men and women in the world of affairs, ranging from detectives, prosecutors, epidemiologists, and corporate
lawyers, make sense of their worlds in order to act responsibly. We will also draw upon the field experiences of
departmental faculty in settings as diverse as the jungles of Guatemala and Peru, the mountains of Sumbawa,
Gujarat, the seat of ongoing communal violence in west India, Afghan refugee camps, Russian kitchens, the halls
of Congress, big city police departments and district attorney offices, corporate offices on Madison Avenue and
Wall Street, and criminal drug courts across America and the United Kingdom. There will also be some practical
training in basic field methods, census and survey interpretation, and archival research.
Format: seminar. Requirements: a series of short papers and a final exam.
Prerequisites: Anthropology 101 or Sociology 101 or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 25. (expected:
20).
Hour: 1:10-3:50 W JACKALL
ANSO 305(F) Social Theory
An introduction to social theory in anthropology and sociology, with strong emphasis on enduring works by
major thinkers--Marx, Weber, Durkheim, and Freud, among others--who have shaped views of society in the
West and beyond. Several key questions inform exploration of these works: What are the historical roots and
principal attributes of modernity? From the perspective of modernity, how do social theorists understand "the
primitive"? Do society and culture have organizing rules? What role does human agency play in the unfolding of
social life? What are the possibilities and limits of scientific approaches to the study of human social experience?
In considering such questions, we will reconstruct the intellectual and social histories of both disciplines, examin-
ing in particular how they abandoned common ground and language, with sociologists gravitating toward para-
digms of scientific predictability and anthropologists toward relativistic frameworks of interpretation. Finally, we
will examine the migration of ideas from anthropology and sociology to other disciplines and back again. The
course emphasizes major differences between interpretive frameworks as well as common elements that contrib-
ute to a deeper understanding of the social world.
Format: seminar. Requirements: three 5- to 7-page essays.
Prerequisites: Anthropology 101 or Sociology 101 and ANSO 205 or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit:
25 (expected: 15).
Hour: 1:10-3:50 W NOLAN
ANSO 402(S) Senior Seminar (Same as Anthropology 402 and Sociology 402)
This capstone seminar combines intensive discussion and individual research. The first half of the semester will
be dedicated to the discussion of a social issue central to the concerns of both anthropology and sociology. The
Anthropology and Sociology
­ 60 ­
class will meet with the instructor in spring 2006 to decide on that topic. Then, in the second half of the semester,
students will pursue independent, original projects and produce a major term paper. Toward the end of the se-
mester, students will present their projects to the seminar. Students who are not senior majors in anthropology or
sociology are admitted to this course only on the instructor's permission.
Format: seminar. Requirements: full participation, major research project and paper, class presentation.
Prerequisites: senior Anthropology and Sociology majors or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 18 (ex-
pected: 18).
Hour: 2:35-3:50 MR VALIANI
ANTHROPOLOGY COURSES
ANTH 101(F,S) The Scope of Anthropology*
Is there such a thing as "human nature"? Why have human societies developed such a bewildering range of
customs to deal with problems common to people everywhere? This course addresses these questions by
introducing students to the comparative study of human social life and culture. Topics surveyed in the course
include economics, language and thought, kinship and marriage, law and politics, and the wide variations in
human belief systems, including religions. The course also considers the ways that anthropology, a discipline that
was until recently practiced almost exclusively by Westerners, approaches other societies in search of insights on
our own customs and values. Ethnographic descriptions of both "simple" tribal societies and complex modern
ones are a prominent part of the readings.
Format: lecture/discussion of case studies and ethnographic films. Requirements: two short essays, a final ex-
amination and class participation.
Enrollment limit: 30 (expected: 30). Preference given to first-year students and sophomores.
Hour: 1:10-2:25 MR First Semester: D. EDWARDS
1:10-2:25 TF Second Semester: D. EDWARDS
ANTH 103(F) Pyramids, Bones, and Sherds: What is Archaeology?*
Anthropology examines not only living societies, but also prehistoric cultures whose remains are found
worldwide. This course will present how archaeology examines the various aspects of human society from the
physical record of prehistory. How do we study the subsistence and settlement patterns, the political and social
organization, and the economy and ideology of prehistoric societies who have left behind mute material records?
The objective of anthropological archaeology is to bring to life these prehistoric cultures through archaeological
analysis. The different goals, approaches and methodologies of modern archaeology will be discussed
theoretically and then applied to case studies.
Format: lecture/discussion/class presentations of case studies. Requirements: class presentations, two papers,
midterm and final exams.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 40 (expected: 25).

ANTH 214(F) The Rise and Fall of Civilizations (Same as Environmental Studies 224)*
Over the centuries, philosophers and historians have asked how societies evolved from simple hunter-gatherer
bands to complex urban civilizations? Human prehistory and history have shown the repeated cycles of the rise,
expansion and collapse of early civilizations in both the Old and New World. What do the similarities and differ-
ences in the development of these first civilizations tell us about the nature of societal change, civilization and the
state, and human society itself? The course will examine these issues through an introductory survey of the earli-
est civilizations in Mesopotamia, Egypt, India, Mesoamerica and South America. Classical and modern theories
on the nature, origin, and development of the state will be reviewed in the light of the archaeological evidence.
Format: lecture/film/class discussion. Requirements: midterm, final exam, and short paper.

ANTH 225(F) Visible Culture: Documentary and Nonfiction*
This course examines the potential of moving images to reveal aspects of culture normally obscured by the writ-
ten word. We will consider both the theory and practice of documentary film from its inception around 1900 to
the present, paying particular attention to the way documentary filmmakers have approached the representation
of social reality in Western and non-Western cultural settings. Questions that we will consider include: What is
the relationship between written text and image, or between image and story? What is the role of film in an-
Anthropology and Sociology

thropology? What counts as a document?
Team-taught, through a mixture of lectures and discussions. Course requirement: Regular attendance at film
screenings and active class participation. Students will write a 5-page paper on an assigned topic and a 12- to
15-page final paper. There will be a self-scheduled take-home final.

ANTH 243T(S) Dilemmas of Humanitarian Intervention (W)
This course will explore the promises, realities, and implications of humanitarian interventions, including relief
operations, national reconstruction projects, and peacekeeping missions. People in the affluent nations of West-
ern Europe and North America contribute billions of dollars each year in response to solicitations promising to
relieve the suffering of victims of natural disaster, political strife, ethnic cleansing, and refugee crises. Western
governments send thousands of troops to war-torn nations in order to "keep the peace." However, all too often
these efforts go awry and contribute in direct and indirect ways to the natural, economic, and political destruction
already visited upon these countries. This course will consider the reasons and ways in which often well-inten-
tioned actions to relieve the suffering of others go wrong, and ways in which current efforts might be improved.
The course will begin with a consideration of the philosophical, ethical, and social underpinnings of humanitari-
anism, and then examine several classic anthropological studies, including Marcel Mauss's The Gift, which pro-
vide the ground for considering humanitarianism in a more socially nuanced manner. The majority of the course
will focus on specific case studies or relief, reconstruction, and peacekeeping operations, including famine relief
in sub-Saharan Africa, peacekeeping in the Balkans, and reconstruction programs in Afghanistan. In addition,
we will look in depth at the work of one or more aid organizations.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: 5-page essays and response papers due each week. During the final two weeks
of the semester, students will work on 12- to 15-page research papers, submitting rough drafts for in-class review
during the second to last week and final drafts the last week of classes.
Enrollment limit: 10. (expected: 10). The class is open to sophomores, juniors, and seniors.
Tutorial meetings to be arranged. D. EDWARDS
ANTH 251(F) Peoples and Cultures of Africa (Same as Africana Studies 251)*
An introduction to the cultural heritage of Africa. The course challenges myths about the continent and its
peoples by exploring in depth a number of indigenous African cultures, drawing on ethnographic examples from
societies representing major subsistence strategies, geographical and ecological zones, and patterns of culture. To
place current events in > Africa in a meaningful framework we examine the impact of the spread of Islam and
Christianity, the colonial division of the continent, and contemporary realities within nation states. We will locate
indigenous coping strategies within their historical context in order to understand their role in contemporary soci-
ety and identify the social strengths of African societies.
Format: seminar. Requirements: active class participation, a map project, media watch, a research essay, and a
take-home examination.

ANTH 324(S) Empires of Antiquity
Cycles of rise and collapse of civilizations are common in our human past. Among the most fascinating cases are
those of empires, conquest civilizations, or states that encompass a number of different ethnicities, politics and
peoples. However, their rise and often rapid collapse begs an important question: how stable have empires been
in human prehistory? Are they intrinsically unstable political forms? The course will address these questions by
examining the major empires of the Old and New World in pre-modern history; Akkadian; Babylonian; Persian;
Assyrian; Mongol; Roman; Chinese; Ottoman; Aztec; and Inca empires. Using readings by political scientists,
historians, epigraphers, archaeologists and political anthropologists, we will consider the cause of the expansion
and collapse of these empires, their sociopolitical and economic structures as mechanisms for their maintenance
to provide a cross-cultural comparison of the differential success and final decline of all these empires.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: several short response papers and a longer research paper.

of biography, history, culture, and social structure as seen in the work of classical and contemporary social think-
ers, including Marx, Durkheim, Weber, Veblen, Simmel, and Goffman. Special consideration will be given to the
social and cultural problems of capitalism, rationality and irrationality in modern institutions and organizations,
the psychological dilemmas facing the individual in modern society, and the problem of social order and conflict.

SOC 202(S) Terrorism and National Security
An analysis of the roots, goals, and social organization of contemporary radical Islamist terrorism and of the state
efforts to defeat it. A focus on: the recruitment, training, and indoctrination of Islamist terrorists; their ideologies
and self-images; and case studies of specific terrorist attacks and the vulnerabilities of modern societies that such
attacks reveal. The course analyzes the exigencies and dilemmas of ensuring public safety in a democratic soci-
ety. Special attention to: the structure and ethos of intelligence work; the investigation of terrorist networks and
their financing; the relationship between organized and semi-organized crime and terrorism; the legal dilemmas
of surveillance, preemptive custody, and "extraordinary rendition" in democratic societies; and the technology
and organization of ascertaining identities in modern society. The course also addresses the crisis facing Euro-
pean societies-particularly the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Germany-with growing
populations of radical Islamist minorities who reject cultural assimilation into Western social or legal frame-
works, a crisis paralleled in the United States, with important differences, by widespread illegal immigration. An
assessment of the ideology of multiculturalism and its intended and unintended consequences in the fight against
terror. The course also examines the threat of terrorists' use of biological, chemical, and nuclear weapons of mass
destruction and the defenses against such threats. Finally, it appraises the structure and content of mass media
coverage of terrorism, as well as official and nonofficial propaganda on all sides of these issues. Experts in differ-
ent fields will give guest lectures throughout the course.

SOC 218(F) Law and Modern Society
This class is designed to introduce students to the field of law and society. The course begins with an overview of
the various theoretical perspectives on the subject, including Durkheimian, Marxist, Foucauldian, and Weberian
analyses of law and society; as well as the work of those following in the different theoretical schools established
by these scholars. Informed by the theoretical overview, the next part of the course considers empirical research
in selected areas of law, including tort law, criminal trial procedures, abortion and divorce law, "community jus-
tice," and the adjudication of drug offenses. Recognizing that understandings of our own legal practices are en-
lightened through comparisons to other legal systems, the second half of the course is primarily historical/com-
parative in focus. In this section, through an exploration of several case studies, American legal processes and
habits are compared with related legal practices in such places as England, Scotland, Ireland, Australia, Germa-
ny, Norway, and Canada.

SOC 224(F) The Family in American Social Life (Same as Women's and Gender Studies 226)
This course introduces students to a sociological analysis of the family by focusing on different social dynamics
that constitute family life and considering their relationship to broader societal structures and forces. From differ-
ent angles, we will explore a question of central concern: Given the institutional nature of the family as well as
the family ideals and mythologies which circulate in the larger culture, how do people make sense of their own
and others' experience of family life and envision its future? We will examine historical shifts in household and
kinship organization in the U.S. (especially with regard to capitalism); recent changes in family structure and the
public anxieties they generate; as well as the roles which gender, class, sexual orientation, age, race/ethnicity and
religion play in contemporary debates about the family. In doing so, we will consider specific topics such as:
family policy and law, marriage and cohabitation, parenting and carework; the division of household labor, do-
mestic violence, and the impact of reproductive technologies.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: participation in class discussion; several short response papers; one

SOC 225(S) Sex and Gender (Same as Women's and Gender Studies 227)
An introduction to the sociological analysis of sex and gender in the contemporary United States. In the first part
of the course, we will begin with an overview of gender scholarship, identifying major trends and analyzing
methodological assumptions. In the second part of the course, we will investigate more recent alternatives to
conceptualizations of sex and/or gender as dichotomous and discrete, focusing on interpretations of the body and
biology. The third section of the course considers several exemplars of empirical research on gender inequality,
as well as the intersections between gender and other inequalities such as race/ethnicity, social class, and sexual
orientation. Here, specific topics may include education, work, family, the state, and social protest as we explore
the ways in which gender is built into the structures, institutions, and ideologies of social life and how different
groups of men and women experience gender.

The perception of physical space is produced culturally and historically. Moreover, such understandings and
meanings of space are governed by cultural symbols, personal desires and identities, and institutionalized forms
of power. This course will consider the process by which spaces (especially urban ones) are produced and ex-
amine how "the production of space" has been connected to the following themes: knowledge, power, and states;
technology and the city; urban survival and resistance; architecture and urban design; capitalist production and
the city; gender and space; maps, nationalism, and cartographic representations; and "globalizing" cities. Course
participants will also view and critique representations of the city appearing in film.

against ratifying the European Constitution of the European Union. This occurred barely one year after the ex-
pansion of the European union from 15 to 25 members. It would appear then that "Europe' as a political project
is in a state of profound crisis. This course examines the political contest over what the future of Europe should
be by assessing key debates, among them: A secular Europe or a Christian Europe? A Europe of nations or a
federal Europe? An open Europe or a Fortress Europe? A free trade Europe or a protectionist Europe? Will Eu-
rope be multicultural and if so, in what sense?

SOC 320(S) Health, Illness, and Medicine in Modern Society
This course focuses on how illness and health are constructed in interactions among caregivers, patients, scien-
tists, and the public, as well as through the institutional workings of medicine and health policy in the United
States. Employing the conceptual tools of sociology, we will examine how inequalities create disparities in the
distribution of health and illness, influence our ideas about etiology, and shape the ways we seek and receive care.
We will cover the main approaches of medical sociology and look for the ways that medical thought and technol-
ogies affect other areas of social life, and how they are affected in turn. In the latter part of the course, we will
focus on two very different case studies in the area of health, illness and medicine--a historical tracing of the
discovery and treatment of sickle cell anemia and an ethnography of a clinic specializing in assisted reproductive
technologies--to examine these dynamics in depth.

collectively experienced, remembered, or forgotten? This course will consider violence as concept and event,
from various vantage points and with geographical-historical references that include Asia, Africa, Europe, and
the Americas. Topics to be considered include the idea of organized violence and the role of states; violence,
collective memory, and public apologies; militias and cultural identity; mass media and violence; suffering and
gender. Readings draw from approaches to the study of violence that are theoretical, analytical, comparative,
ethnographic, and fictional.
Participants will view visual representations of violence and examine the ways in which violence is used to
construct collective pasts.

Ideas about normalcy are inherent in our understanding of what social life is, as well as what it could and should
be. What does it mean to be "normal?" Is normal" an existing average or an ideal state? How do we distinguish
between the "normal" and the "abnormal?" Between "difference" and "deviance?" Is everyone equally vulner-
able to labels of deviance? This course examines the social construction of normality, drawing from sociological
approaches to the study of deviance, particularly interactionism and labeling theory, and interdisciplinary litera-
tures which examine the history, function, and theoretical significance of normality. We will explore ideas of
subculture, moral panic, and stigma in connection with the topics of physiology and disability; sexuality and
"queerness"; and mental health and madness. In doing so, we will pay particular attention to the normalizing
effects of mainstream media and the power of institutional interests in shaping our collective understanding of
normality. Students will explore specific themes involving the normal and the abnormal through research pro-
jects of their own choosing.

MAJOR
Three routes are offered: the emphasis of the first is on the history of art, and that of the second is on
creative work in studio. The third route through the major allows students to take courses in both halves of
the department in more or less equal numbers.
Note: The Art History and Art Studio routes are strongly recommended for any prospective Art major
who is contemplating graduate study in Art History or Art Studio.
Art History Route
Sequence courses
ArtH 101-102 Aspects of Western Art
ArtS 100 Drawing I (or its equivalent as agreed by the department, to be taken by the end of the
junior year)
ArtH 301 Methods of Art History (ARTH 405 and ARTH 448 may be taken to satisfy this require-
ment. Also, ARTH 451 may be taken to satisfy this requirement in 2006-2007 only.)
One Seminar or Graduate Course
Parallel courses
Any five additional semester courses of art history including three concerned with the following:
1) a period of Western art prior to 1800,
2) a period of Western or non-Western art, prior to 1400, and
3) non-Western art.
Although the structure of the art history route allows for flexible scheduling, the faculty strongly recom-
mends that students proceed through the major in the recommended sequence. Introductory 100 and 200
level courses should be taken in the first or second year. So that they are prepared for the research require-
ments of the seminar classes that cap the sequence, majors are required to take one of the required Junior
major classes, ArtS 319, ArtH 301, ArtH 448 (ArtH 405 and 452, 2006-2007 only) during their junior year.
If the student is studying abroad for the entire junior year, this requirement may be filled in the senior year
(see STUDY ABROAD policy of the Art Department for more information.)

Any four additional Art Studio or Art History courses. At least one elective must be taken in each
wing of the department. At least one of the electives must be an Art History course concerned
with a period of Western or non-Western art prior to 1800.
Art History Route: The history of art is different from other historical disciplines in that it is founded on
direct visual confrontation with objects that are both concretely present and yet documents of the past. We
emphasize analysis of images, objects, and built environments as the basis for critical thought and visual
literacy. In addition to formal and iconographic analysis, we use the work of other disciplines to understand
visual images, such as social history, perceptual psychology, engineering, psychoanalysis, cultural studies,
and archaeology. Because of its concentration on visual experience, the Art History major increases one's
ability to observe and to use those observations as analytical tools for understanding history and culture.
ArtH 101-102 introduces students to a series of critical studies of important works selected from the
history of Western art from antiquity to the present. The critical approach of the introductory course is
maintained in all further courses, especially by assigned study of original works in the Williams College
Museum of Art, Chapin Library, the Clark Art Institute, and Mass MoCA.
An introductory studio course, ArtS 100, in which no artistic talent or prior experience are assumed,
provides vital training in what is a visual as well as a verbal discipline. The requirement of a course in
non-Western art expands majors' geographic as well as cultural horizons, and the requirement of two
courses in art from periods prior to 1800 provides a necessary concentration on earlier moments in culture.
(As the late contemporary architect, Philip Johnson, said, "You cannot not know history.") The junior
course (ArtH 301) develops awareness of the theoretical implications, as well as the possibilities and limi-
tations of different art-historical methods. The requirement of a seminar or graduate course in the senior
year enables students to apply that knowledge of methodology to their most specialized work in the Art
History route.
Art Studio Route: The studio division of the Art major has been structured to foster the development of a
critical understanding of making art; to support creative interests and to develop students' perceptions and
imaginations as they investigate a variety of visual media. Drawing I, ArtS 100 serves as an introduc-
tion to the basic drawing and design principles which establish the foundation for the development of
visual expression. ArtH 101-102, Aspects of Western Art, provides part of the necessary background in the
critical analysis of art. The 200-level ArtS courses provide opportunities to learn the elements of some of
the principal visual arts media: architecture, painting, photography, printmaking, sculpture, and video.
These courses combine technical foundations in the medium with analysis of the interrelation of visual
form and content. The 300- and 400-level courses place a greater emphasis on the application of appropri-
ate visual skills and strategies to particular thematic concerns, and to the development of the student's indi-
vidual vision. All students taking ArtS418 are required to exhibit in the spring of their senior year at the
Williams College Museum of Art or other appropriate venues. Students who choose to take two 300 level
classes do not exhibit at WCMA in the spring of the senior year.
History and Practice Route: This route allows students to study in depth both the history of art and the
making of it. It offers considerable flexibility: students may propose courses of study that emphasize partic-
ular media, themes or methodological issues. To mention just three examples, students may design se-
quences of courses that focus on architecture, gender or narration in both the history of art and contempo-
rary practice. Students may take more courses in one wing of the department than the other, as long as the
minimum requirements in each wing are satisfied. The History and Practice route is especially well-suited
Art
­ 67 ­
to students interested in arts-related careers outside of higher education, including work in art galleries, art
museums, and primary or secondary school education.
Unlike the history or studio routes, acceptance into the History and Practice route is not automatic. The
student must first submit a written application in two copies, one for each advisor from the two wings of the
department, as well as a list of proposed courses; this application and list of proposed courses must be
given to the department secretary before registering for the major.
The application must provide a narrative statement of the theme of the major, and why it cannot be accom-
modated in either history or studio. It is not enough to submit a list of courses; the student needs to show the
coherence and integrity of the plan of study, and how it develops the theme of the proposed major.
Some students will be attracted to both wings of the department but will not have a field of study that falls
between the two. In these cases, it is better for the student to choose between history and studio--taking
additional courses from the other wing as desired. In short, the History and Practice route is reserved for
students with a strong record of achievement who cannot be accommodated in the two wings of the depart-
ment.
History and Practice majors do not participate in the senior studio exhibition at the end of the year.
History and Practice Faculty Advisors: Michael Glier, Ann McCallum, and Ben Benedict in studio; E.
J. Johnson, Peter Low and Michael Lewis in history.
COURSE NUMBERS
First Digit
The 100 level courses in both Art History and Studio are introductions to the field and emphasize
visual and critical analysis. These courses do not require previous experience in the subject and they
are often prerequisites for other courses in the department; 200 level courses are introductions to spe-
cific fields; 300 level courses prepare students for independent research; 400 level courses emphasize
independent research, oral presentation, and active participation and are intended for advanced stu-
dents, usually senior majors.
Middle Digit
Art Studio (ArtS)
Middle digit distinguishes introductory and general courses from those specialized in different media and
arts. 0 = introductory; 1 = general; 2 = architecture; 3 = drawing; 4 = painting; 5 = photography; 6 = print-
making; 7 = sculpture; 8 = video; 9 = independents, honors.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN ART
Students who wish to become candidates for the degree with honors must show prior evidence of supe-
rior performance in the major as well as research capabilities to carry out the proposed project.
Art History:
In order for a project to be considered, the candidate (1) must have arranged for an advisor, and (in
consultation with the advisor) a second reader to supervise and evaluate the project (2) should normally
have had one course with the advisor. In addition, the topic must be within the advisor's areas of compe-
tence and should normally be related to course work which the student has done previously. In the case of
an interdisciplinary proposal, the second reader should normally come from the other discipline.
The student submits a 2-page proposal including a statement about the preparation for the project, a
description of the topic and a general bibliography. Following approval by the faculty advisor and second
reader, this proposal is reviewed by the entire Art faculty, who have the option to request revisions and to
refuse the proposal. Students should keep in mind that a thesis in Art History is not necessary for admission
to graduate study.
It is the responsibility of the candidate to select one of the following routes and to meet all deadlines.
Students who are not making satisfactory progress on their research and writing will not be allowed to
continue with the thesis. The completion of the requirements, however, will not guarantee a degree with
honors. The degree with honors will be awarded for projects demonstrating a high degree of scholarly
achievement and self-motivation. All proposals must be submitted according to the guidelines set out be-
low. The timetable for submission of work, including specific dates, is available in the Art Department
office.
Students may select one of the following options:
1) Full-Year Thesis: Research and writing will be carried out during both semesters and WSP of the
senior year (students should register for ArtH 493-W31-494). The thesis topic, advisor and second
reader must be determined by April 15 of junior year. Students who are on overseas programs
junior year are advised to make arrangements prior to their departure, but they may submit a final
proposal two weeks before the fall semester of senior year if they have made the necessary ar-
rangements. After the thesis is submitted, the candidate for honors shall present an oral defense
before faculty and peers.
2) Half-Year Thesis: Research and writing will be carried out during fall term and winter study or dur-
ing winter study and spring term (Students should register for ArtH 493-W31 or W31-ArtH 494).
For students who choose to complete the mini-thesis in the fall, proposals must be submitted by
Art
­ 68 ­
April 15 of the junior year. For those planning to complete the mini-thesis in the spring, proposals
must be submitted by November 1.
A student's project is judged by two members of the department, the advisor and second reader; in the
case of an interdisciplinary project, a member of the Art Department and a member of the other relevant
department or program functions as advisor and second reader. In rare cases, a third reader may be ap-
pointed by the department at the request of the advisor or second reader.
All routes require that one course and one WSP, in addition to the ten required courses for the major, be
dedicated to the honors project.
Art Studio:
Studio art concentrators who wish to be candidates for honors are required to add a 200-level course,
and to take the 400-level senior tutorial. An additional 300-level tutorial or 200-level course must be added
for a total of twelve courses.
Honors candidates enrolled in the senior tutorial must "evidence" prior experience in the media chosen
for the honors work. This "evidence" may consist of one or more 200-level courses in the medium, course
work at the 300 level and/or a slide portfolio demonstrating the student's proficiency in the media chosen
for the honors project. This work is presented to the senior tutorial instructor at the start of the spring semes-
ter.
At the end of the spring semester of the senior year, the honors candidate will orally defend his/her work
in the senior exhibition at WCMA. The entire studio faculty will attend the defense. Based on the work and
the oral defense, the studio faculty (as a whole) will designate honors, high honors or no honors.
History and Practice:
The route to honors is a combination of the Art Studio and Art History honors routes. At the beginning
of senior year, a candidate for honors in History and Practice makes a proposal to two faculty members,
one faculty advisor from each wing of the department. If both advisors agree to supervise the project, the
candidate enrolls in independent study and works through the fall semester and winter study. The progress
of the project is assessed by both advisors at the end of winter study; if the project is not well enough devel-
oped, the advisors may end it at that time. If the project is allowed to move forward, the student enrolls
either in ArtS 418T Senior Tutorial, if the project is primarily a matter of making art, or in an Honors
Independent Study, if it is primarily a writing project. The final project is submitted to the two advisors,

Although the Art Department encourages students to travel and study abroad, we feel that it is very
important for students to begin their major with a required seminar in their Junior year. The Junior semi-
nars, ArtH 301, ArtH 448, and ArtS 319, prepare students for independent research and/or independent
artistic production which is the focus of the senior year.
a. Studio Art Majors must take the required Junior Seminar (ArtS 319) in their junior year unless they
are planning to study abroad for a full year; in that case they may take the required class in their senior
year.
b. History and Practice students must include their Study Abroad plans in their application to the major
and discuss them with their advisor.
c. Art History students must take one of the required Junior Seminars (ArtH 301 or ArtH 448) in their
junior year unless they are planning to study abroad for a full year; in that case they may take the
required class in their senior year.
ART HISTORY COURSES
ARTH 101(F)-102(S) Aspects of Western Art
A year-long introduction to a history of some European and North American art, this course concentrates on
three-dimensional media in the fall (architecture and sculpture) and two-dimensional media in the spring (paint-
ing, drawing, prints and photography). Even though the course focuses on Western art, it also explores inter-
changes among other cultures and the west, particularly in more recent times.
Both semesters cover the same chronological span, from Ancient Greeks to computer geeks. We organize the
course in this unusual way not only to give students the grasp of history but also to heighten their ability to under-
stand visual objects by coming to grips with only one artistic medium at a time. To train students to look carefully
at art, we use the wealth of art resources in Williamstown: the Clark Art Institute, the Williams College Museum
of Art and the Chapin Rare Book Library. Students spend time with, and sometimes even hold, original works of
art. For the study of architecture we have a unique set of "Virtual Buildings," made expressly for this course, that
approximate the experience of being in structures thousands of miles away.
ArtH 101-102 cannot be taken on a pass/fail basis; however, the course may be audited. Students who have
audited ArtH 101-102 lectures on a registered basis may enroll in any Art History course at the 200 or 300 level.
Both semesters of the course must be taken on a graded basis to receive credit for either semester.
Open to first-year students.

ARTH 104(S) Buddhist Visual Worlds*
The richly decorated stupa gateways at Sanchi, the luscious wall paintings at Alchi, the serene Shakyamuni
seated in the Sokkuram, and the glittering Phoenix Hall at the Byodoin are but a few of the diverse and dazzling
sites we will study in Buddhist Visual Worlds. This introductory survey will begin by covering the origins of
Buddhism in India and then trace the diffusion of the religion into Central Asia, China, Korea, Japan and South-
east Asia. Given the vast geographical and chronological ground to be covered, the material will be organized
around the themes of transmission and transformation. This course will consider how Buddhist art and architec-
ture were adopted and adapted by a variety of cultures. We will pay close attention to how rulers have used the
religion and its art in their attempts to establish legitimate and prosperous governments. The importance of narra-
tive art in the promulgation of Buddhism will be a reoccurring topic of discussion in this course. We will also
examine the construction of the Buddha's body, including not only the iconography of Buddhahood, but also the
variety of formal techniques artists used to represent the Buddha's divinity and wisdom. The spectacular pan-
theon of bodhisattvas and Buddhist deities will also be introduced. Another theme of the course will be the use of
Buddhist art in the performance of rituals. We will thus consider eye-opening ceremonies, during which the
image is animated with the divine presence, and other ritual activities that involve the use of imagery. Finally,
consideration of the reception, interpretation, and creation of Buddhist images in the West will be woven
throughout the semester.
Format: lecture. Requirements: in addition to an in-class midterm and a final exam, students will be expected to
complete one 3-page paper and one 5- to 7-page paper.

ARTH 105(F) Tall Tales and Long Scrolls: Visual Narratives of Asia*
From The Simpsons to The Sopranos, from the Godfather to Grand Theft Auto, visual representations of narra-
tives inhabit our daily lives. In this introductory survey, we will examine stories from Asia and their visual forms.
We will consider the diverse media, formats, and modesof narration employed in the visual recounting of stories.
The narratives to be examined will range from some of the earliest representations of Buddhist tales in India to
the pan-Asian manifestations of the Ramayana. Through a series of case studies, we will investigate a number of
questions. Why are stories given visual form? How might such visual narratives be "read"? What are some of the
possible functions of these stories? How do narratives arise from and interact with their larger religious, political,
and historical contexts? Why do certain narratives circulate broadly, and how are such tales visually adapted
within new cultural contexts?

ARTH 200(S) Introduction to Film Theory and Criticism
Watching films and discussing them are social practices that many of us perform regularly, often without think-
ing about the mechanisms through which films communicate or the ways that films work to shape our interac-
tions with them and with each other. This survey is an introduction to the concepts, methods, and theories that
have come to inform the scholarly critical analysis of film and film culture. We will consider film both as an
industrial art and as a cultural commodity. Using knowledge of film technique to critically engage with specific
films, we will work to understand how film makes meaning within specific historical and cultural contexts and
the social and political implications of those meanings. Our focus throughout the semester will be on developing
students' ability to think critically with and through cinema in an intellectually responsible manner. It is assumed
that developing an ability to think deeply and write critically about cinema enhances our enjoyment of it.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: attendance and participation, completing readings and screenings out-
side of class, written screening reports, two critical essays (5-7 pages each).
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20 (expected: 20).

ARTH 201(F) American Landscape History (Same as Environmental Studies 201)
This is a survey course stressing the description and historical geography of regional, vernacular American set-
tings, with the goal of discerning a national style of spatial or landscape organization. Among the human-altered
environments to be studied are: forestlands, rangelands, croplands, outdoor recreational sites, mines and quarries;
small towns, milltowns, central business districts, and suburbs; power and utilities; housing, industry, commerce,
and institutional uses such as the American college campus; water, road, and rail corridors as examples of cir-
culation nets. Primary evidence will be visual.
One afternoon meeting each week provides discussion and field- or site-visit opportunities, and enables class-
members to obtain a first-hand familiarity with a rural-urban gradient of representative land uses and occupants
of the Hoosic-Hudson watershed and Taconic upland region surrounding Williamstown, as well as experience
with interviewing and field study methodologies.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: four term paper installments on the documentation of an evolving
landscape site or behavior, short class presentation on research, as its "landscape" or type comes up for class or
lecture consideration, and an obligatory all-day field trip.
No prerequisites. Open to first-year students.
This course is conceived as an introduction to ArtH/Environmental Studies 252, 305, 306, and 307.

ARTH 202(S) Reading the Renaissance: Interpreting Italian Renaissance Art and History
Many works of Renaissance art, such as Botticelli's Birth of Venus, Leonardo's Mona Lisa, and Michelangelo's
David, are remarkably familiar to us. But even as they live in our cultural consciousness, we may perceive them
as elevated and remote masterpieces of western culture, housed away in museums halfway around the world.
Just what is it that makes these objects so admired and important? And what might we all have to gain, intellectu-
ally, by considering them? We will focus in depth on a series of individual works of art, learning and honing skills
of observation, visual and contextual analysis, and written and oral expression. But we will also step back from
the objects to explore and balance different approaches and points of view and to consider, more broadly, differ-
ent issues that can factor into the very act of interpretation. The goal of the course is that students emerge from it
with a rich understanding of the selected works in question, as well as a mindfulness of the ways in which the
Renaissance period might inform our aesthetic perceptions and our critical understanding of the construction of
the past.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on several short writing assignments as well as group projects, presen-
tations, and debates.

ARTH 204(S) Women in the American Landscape
Approaching North American landscape history through the lens of gender studies, this topically-oriented
seminar will consider women both in their domestic or indoor roles as workers and family members and in their
"outdoor" roles in, inter alia, gardening, running businesses (often upon the death of their husbands), teaching,
and nursing. Special attention will be accorded to the phenomenon of the pioneer woman, the second
wage-earner, the professional woman. That means we will consider the historical roles of raising food for
household consumption, farms and other enterprises run by or largely populated by women, such as the
schoolhouse, hospital, telephone switchboard, and airline stewards, to name but a few institutions in the
landscape where women have predominated. Writers and scholars coming under scrutiny will include Harriet
Beecher Stowe, Laura Thacher Ulrich. The depiction of women by American artists will be a continual
theme:artists such as Dorothea Lange.

This course is an introduction to a small portion of the rich art and architectural history of the African continent.
Critical issues concerning political, social and religious traditions and how they intersect with art will be
addressed. Focusing on individual case studies from different times and places, the course will offer an overview
of key aspects of African art, including personal adornment, art and leadership, ensemble/assemblage,
performance, rites of passage and impermanence. We will also examine themes such as: the place of African art
in Western museums; the ways in which theories of science, culture and history have informed our
understanding of African art and vice versa; visualizing race, ethnicity and gender; conveying the trauma of
slavery in art; and the packaging of Africa in international exhibitions and in photography.

ARTH 208(S) Art as a Tool of Empire(Same as Classics 220)
The Roman Empire was conquered by force but was maintained by co-opting subjugated elites into wanting
their children to grow up Roman. One important tool was building new cities and re-making old ones into
Roman places. Architecture, painting, sculpture--all the visual arts--were deployed to show that to be Roman
was to share in a high culture and way of life that were irresistibly enticing. We will investigate how functional
infrastructures (roads, water supply etc.) and urban amenities (theaters, baths, porticoes lined with statues, houses
with frescoed walls and mosaic floors etc.) shaped the experience of becoming Roman.
Format: lectures and discussion. Requirements: hour exam, report/paper, final exam.

The styles and meanings of sculpture, architecture, and painting will be explored in relation to the Greek human-
istic ideals that defined the age. Topics include approaches to the representation of the human form; mythological
subjects; artistic personalities; and the building programs of Olympia and Athens. The course will be framed by a
brief introduction to Greek art of earlier periods and discussion of the legacy of Classical Greek art in Western
civilization.

the defeat of Cleopatra and her consort Antony in 31 B.C.E., which marked the end of the Roman Republic.
Sculpture, architecture, painting, mosaics, and the decorative arts will be considered in light of the cultural diver-
sity of the Hellenistic age and its roots in the Classical tradition of the Greeks. Topics include innovations in
sculptural styles and subjects; portraiture and kingship; theatricality in architecture; developments in landscape
painting; artistic patronage; urban planning; and the growth of Rome as a Hellenistic city.

ARTH 212(S) Race, Sexuality, and Cinema (Same as Africana Studies 212)*
An interrogation into the nexus of race, sexuality, and cinema, this course begins with a consideration of how
cinema has constructed normative understandings of race and sexuality before moving into an interrogation of
non-normative racialized and sexualized visual images. Students are expected to be open to and comfortable
with discussing and analyzing a range of representations of race and sexuality, including those presenting hetero-
sexuality, homosexuality, and their variations. One of the primary goals of this course is to provide tools and
strategies that encourage and support students' on-going critical engagements with contemporary media cul-
ture's images of race and sexuality.

What are the effects of globalization on contemporary art? How have artists representated these effects in their
work? How have they navigated the increasingly international character of exhibitions and conditions of
art-making? This course will examine the emergence of a global exhibition circuit in recent years; the escalation
of artistic scale in response to the spatial demands of global "destination" museums; artists' explorations of
economic inequities between first and third world nations; and the representation of the figure of the
artist-traveler and a "nomadic" subjectivity in contemporary practice. The course will focus on such artists as
Hans Haacke, Martha Rosler, Allan Sekula, Mark Lombardi, Renée Green, Rirkrit Tiravanija, Christian Philipp
Müller, John Di Stefano, Andrea Fraser, Gregg Bordowitz, Yinka Shonibare, Ursula Biemann, The Yes Men,

Rembrandt van Rijn, Frans Hals, Jan Vermeer are only the best-known of the many artists who were active in the

degree of symbolic content in their work is disputed: to what extent was Dutch painting an art of description or of
hidden allegory? We will consider this problem and also give special attention to the ongoing reinterpretations of

also as found in some office and industrial "parks," concentrating upon aspects of site design, such as the
fit between physiography and building location. Applying such Lynchian precepts as edge, path and
node, our inquiry will be both diachronic and comparative. What happens when campuses grow, or di-
minish? What happens when their surrounding change, or deteriorate: What uses of space are located
where, and to what extent is their spatial layout an hierarchical one? Why have some campuses few imi-
tators (even if, as in the instance of Thomas Jefferson's "academical village," their plan has been much
extolled)? Among other topics to be considered are: issues of integration within or separation from
Art

towns, accommodations to the automobile and to field sports as spatially consumptive uses (leading to
increasingly spread-out plans); design as a reflection of pedagogical agenda (or even monastic tradi-
tion?); successional uses of the same building or space, especially as increasing enrollments may bring
increasing specialization (of building functions); traffic as a function of buildings; campuses pretty
much created all at once and campuses more polyglot, with generational changes in design and even pur-
pose; "dead," or vestigial spaces, or buildings, such as through the demise of required chapel attendance.
Major attention will be given to seminal designs and designers. Regional examples of a wide variety of
campuses will be visited during field sessions.

Such revolutionary artistic movements as Cubo-Futurism, Suprematism, and Constructivism profoundly in-
fluenced the development of twentieth-century art throughout the Western world--just as the 1917 Russian Rev-
olution upset the world's political balance. This course will investigate Russian art within a cultural framework
and explore the relationship between artistic production and politics. We will begin with a brief overview of
important developments in Russian art that prefigured the twentieth-century artistic revolution: the introduction
of icons from Byzantium, the founding of St. Petersburg and the rise of Western-style portraiture, and the fin-de-
siecle movements that united painting with music and ballet. However, the focus of the course will be
1910-1930, when radical innovation was the order of the day and revolutionary ideas sparked entirely new con-
ceptions of art. We will then look at the Socialist Realist style of the Stalin era, Soviet dissident art and Moscow
conceptualism, ending the semester with an exploration of current trends in post-Soviet Russian art.

ARTH 330T(F) Michelangelo: Biography, Mythology, and the History of Art (W)
One might argue that Michelangelo's enduring fame, and his preeminence in the western art historical canon, is
as much a product of his artistic persona as his artistic achievement. Indeed, the modern notion of the visual artist
as a brooding, even tortured genius of unstoppable creative force finds its roots in the Italian Renaissance. This is
largely due to the singular figure of Michelangelo, whose life and career are more fully documented than those of
any western artist to precede him. And Michelangelo's mythic individuality, alongside his artistic innovations
and contributions, have made him a fundamental force in the shape of the history of art as we understand and
study it today. Students of this tutorial will become well-acquainted with the life and work of Michelangelo
through the examination of a wide variety of primary and secondary sources: contemporary Renaissance
documents, letters, poetry, and biographies; art historical surveys, monographs, and studies; and documentary
and popular film. They will give their critical attention, however, to the intersection between this artist's
biography and his artistic production. We will focus on a number of important questions arising from this con-
nection. What, for example, is the nature and reliability of the evidence used to reconstruct Michelangelo's life
and personality? What are the grounds for interpreting his work according to his philosophical outlook, religious
beliefs, and even sexuality? To what extent was Michelangelo responsible for shaping his own persona for
posterity? Is the myth of this artist distinguishable from his "reality?" And to what extent have all these issues
shaped our own thinking about artists and the history of art?
Format: tutorial. Requirements: evaluation will be based on the quality and improvement of written work (5
weekly papers and 5 response papers, and a final written exercise addressing major themes of the tutorial), and
oral dialogue. This course is writing intensive.

ARTH 400(S) Visions and Tension of Empire: Architecture, Urban Design and the Arts in 19th and
21st Century Colonial and Post-Colonial Worlds of Asia and Africa (Same as Africana Studies
402)*
This seminar will consider the nature of the "colonial encounter" and its relation to architecture, urban planning,
photography and art traditions in former anglophone and francophone Asian and African colonies. We will also
examine how traces of colonialism merged with the arts in postcolonial situations in the contexts of the construc-
tion of national identities, tourism and international health care. The course will emphasize both the European
colonizers and the colonized peoples in institutional (missionary, government offices, hospitals, military, mu-
seums) and everyday contexts. Throughout the seminar we will explore several issues central to colonialism.
Some of these include: To what extent can colonialism be seen as a monolithic system?; How was colonial au-
thority maintained?; How were people's sense of themselves challenged by confronting different worlds?; and
What role did material culture play in the explicit articulation of "worldviews" about the nature of humanity,
civilization and history, and the more implicit process through which things "taken-for-granted" were continually
redefined and remade? In order to address these issues we will examine several case studies, including: Hanoi;
Phnom Penh; Antananarivo; Bône (Annaba); Rabat; Pretoria; Cape Town; New Delhi; northeastern Democratic
Republic of the Congo; and southern Cameroon.
Format: Seminar. Requirements: research paper. This final project will be individual in scope and the result of the

Why did the physical presentation of Scripture change so radically during the course of the first millennium?
What motivated the transformation of the earliest type of biblical books--comprising words inscribed in ink on
fragile papyrus leaves or parchment rolls--into splendid codices written in gold on stained vellum, adorned with
elaborated initials and charts, expanded with prologues and poetry, and embellished with icons inside and on
magnificent treasure bindings? Examining such issues as the origin of the codex as the characteristic form of the
Christian book, the effect of eighth/ninth-century image debates on the concept of the ornamented manuscripts,
and the function(s) of the Bible in church and court,The Word-Made-Flesh will explore the ways in which books
containing sacred scripture were figured as actual embodiments of God. Students will visit the exhibition Bible
and Book at the Freer Gallery in Washington, which the Croghan Visiting Professor Herbert Kessler helped to
organize, and they will prepare research papers based on the precious objects displayed there or available for
study elsewhere.

ARTH 403(F) Capturing the Buddha: Stupas in Theory and Practice*
Stupas, pagodas, chedis, and chortens,; earthen mounds, masonry towers, golden spires, and mountainous mon-
uments--these structures are perhaps the most ubiquitous forms of Buddhist architecture. This seminar will ex-
amine not only the multifarious manifestations of stupas, but also the sources of their enduring power and popu-
larity. From the stupas of ancient India, built to shelter the corporeal remains the historical Buddha Shakyamuni,
to the concrete "pagodas" fashioned by modern American Buddhists, how are these structures imbued with
sacred authority? We will investigate not only how stupas functioned within early South Asian relics cults to
capture and communicate the presence of the Buddha and other eminent monks, but also how relics and stupas
are tools in the propagation of Buddhism throughout the world. We thus examine how worshippers across many
countries have shaped the form of the stupa to suit local aesthetic, devotional and political concerns. Through
interdisciplinary readings and fieldwork projects at local stupa sites, this course will also introduce students to
several methodological approaches to the study of objects and visual culture.
Format: seminar. Requirements: This seminar will include lively student discussion. Throughout the semester,
students will be expected to complete a series of short response papers, an annotated bibliography and a 10- to
15-page research paper.

ARTH 404(S) Prankster, Lover, Hero, and God: Envisioning Krishna*
As the god Vishnu's eighth incarnation, Krishna is famous for his youthful pranks, amorous exploits, and heroic
conquests. This god's intense charisma has inspired not only ardent devotion from his followers, but also a di-
verse array of artistic representations. This seminar will examine Krishna's many manifestations and attempt to
understand the political, religious, and artistic contexts in which images of this god appear and circulate. Over the
course of the semester, we will make extensive use of the collection of paintings and textiles in the William's
College Museum of Art. We will thus also focus on issues of collecting, connoisseurship, and the interpretive
transform of objects within the museum space.
Format: seminar. Requirements: This seminar will include lively student discussion. Throughout the semester,
students will be expected to complete a series of short response papers, and a 20-page final research paper. Stu-
dents will also present their research to the class at the end of the semester.

ARTH 405(S) Seminar in Architectural Criticism (W)
How does one judge a building? According to its structural efficiency or its aesthetic qualities? Its social respon-
sibility--or just its pizzazz? Depending on the building, and the critic, any of these questions might be pertinent,
or impertinent. This seminar explores architectural criticism, that curious genre between literature and architec-
ture, and looks at its history, nature and function. We will read and discuss classic reviews by historical and con-
temporary critics as John Ruskin, Mariana van Rensselaer, Lewis Mumford, Ada Louise Huxtable and Herbert
Muschamp. Insights gained from these discussions will be applied by students to writing their own reviews,
which will likewise be discussed in class. Early assignments will concentrate on mechanics: how to describe a
building vividly and accurately, how to balance description and interpretation judiciously, how to compare. Sub-
sequent ones will be more synthetic, encouraging students to write bold, lively and critical essays. The ultimate
goal is to develop a distinctive and effective voice, and to gain a better understanding of the nature of criticism in
general.
Format: seminar. Requirements: Students will write and revise six papers (5-7 pages) during the semester.
Prerequisites: ArtH 101-102 and consent of instructor. Enrollment limit: 11 (expected: 11). Preference given to

ARTH 406(S) Topics in Roman Religion and the Arts: The Age of Augustus (Same as Classics
406)
The principate of Augustus, Rome's first emperor (27 B.C.E.-14 C.E.), marked a critical period of transition in
the political, religious, social, and artistic life of the ancient Mediterranean--and one that still resonates in our
study of Western civilization today. This seminar explores the ways in which the arts of the Augustan period--
sculpture, architecture, painting, gems, and coins--served the political and social agenda of the new emperor and
expressed his personal vision of empire. Particular attention will be paid to those monuments highlighting Au-
gustus' commitment to Rome's religious traditions, the introduction of an imperial cult, and the special status
accorded priestesses like the Vestal Virgins. Readings in Roman history and literature will complement study of
individual monuments and their contexts.
Format: seminar. Requirements: two oral reports based on readings; seminar presentation; 20 pp. research paper.
Prerequisites: ArtH 101-102 recommended but not required. Enrollment limit 12 (expected: 10).

ARTH 432(F) Domestic Visual Culture in Renaissance Florence (Same as Women's and Gender
Studies 432)
Fifteenth-century Florence nurtured a burgeoning culture of image production. This remarkable proliferation of
images, and the rapid development of visual idioms, has given the Tuscan city a privileged art historical position
as the birthplace of the Renaissance and, traditionally, the basis of the first chapter in the story of artistic
development and progress in the west. The domestic palace, as it emerged during this period, was a crucial site
for the production and reception of new kinds of objects; indeed, many Renaissance touchstones-Botticelli's
Birth of Venus, Leonardo's Mona Lisa, and Michelangelo's Doni Tondo, to name just a few examples-were
originally commissioned for (and viewed within) a domestic setting. In this course we will examine the
Renaissance palace itself, as well as a constellation of diverse images once housed within it including traditional
panel paintings, painted furniture and wall-hangings, ceramics, and ritual objects. We will pose questions about
the relationship between these images and the people who commissioned them and lived with them, focusing
especially on issues of gender and power. Our investigation of domestic art will be grounded in the larger
historiographic problem of Renaissance individualism; in other words, we will use this material in order to
consider, critique, and refine traditional conceptions of the Renaissance as a historical period.
Format: seminar. Requirements: evaluation will be based on oral participation and short response papers, one
oral presentation, and a 15-20 page research paper.
Enrollment limit: 12. Preference given to seniors.

ARTH 448(F,S) Art about Art: 1400-2000 (W)
This thematic seminar will focus on depictions through which artists referred to their own profession and its
products. Images to be discussed include legends of the origin of art, self-portraits and other portraits of artists,
scenes of contemporary and historical artists in their studios, as well as finished art on display. While tracking the
major changes in imagery from the end of the Middle Ages through the twentieth century (with some reference
to earlier developments) we will analyze specific images, comparing their implications with both the social con-
ditions and the theoretical positions then current.
Requirements: a 2-page paper, two 12-page papers, and a class presentation.

ARTH 451(F) Ideal Bodies: The Modern Nude and Its Dilemmas (Same as Women's and Gender
Studies 451)
The nineteenth century is so dominated by the female nude that the very term "nude" has come to stand for the
female body. And yet, the history of the nude during this period is not devoid of male bodies. This course looks at
both male and female nudes in order to understand how the nude became gendered female. Required readings
include Kenneth Clark's classic study The Nude: A Study in Ideal Form (1956) and Lynda Nead's The Female
Nude: Art, Obscenity and Sexuality (1992), with special attention to texts which show how the nude and the
discourse of the ideal function to obscure social issues. We will explore the ways in which certain types of bodies
have been defined in opposition to the white western ideal, and thereby exoticized or marginalized. Our prime
focus is the work of David, Ingres, Géricault, Courbet, Manet, and Renoir but more popular nineteenth-century
images as well as selected works by artists working today will be discussed.
Evaluation will be based on biweekly 1-page papers, short reports, an oral presentation and a 10- to 20-page
paper.

California has long been considered a land of "sunshine and noir," unique in the national and international imagi-
nation as a land of physical recreation and destruction, a land of opportunity and social unrest. In this course, we
will study the visual arts and culture of California from the 1960s to the present. Although we will focus on
southern California, particularly Los Angeles, we will also consider movements in San Diego and the San Fran-
cisco-Oakland Bay Area. The course will approach California pop, conceptual, funk, performance, installation,
public, and media arts to pursue questions of influence and interpretation concerning the relations between space,
place, identity, and style in the visual arts and popular culture. Alongside analyzing California's visual culture, we
will examine the region's cultural geography through historical and theoretical readings. Particular attention will
be given to the region's special relations to Hollywood, the automobile, beach-surf culture, and the great diversity
that characterizes the state.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on two research papers and a presentation.

ARTS 100(F,S) Drawing I
The process of drawing develops a heightened awareness of the visual world. Your subjective experiences and
your objective experiences combine to form a larger perceptual understanding of the environment in which you
live. Drawing allows you an alternative use of these processes and provides a format for stating what you know
about the world. Drawing is an excellent means for improving your skills in observing, seeing distinctions, and
creating new meanings from your perceptions. This is an introductory course which will investigate the proper-
ties of making an image on the two-dimensional page. While drawing is an essential basis for much of the art-
making process, its use is not limited to artists. Design, illustration, engineering, and science are among the many
fields which incorporate drawing.
There are three to five sections of ArtS 100 offered each semester. Although individual faculty members teach-
ing beginning drawing do not follow a common syllabus, they share common goals. Syllabi for each section are
available from the secretary's office in the W. L. S. Spencer Art Building.
Evaluation will be based primarily on the quality and quantity of work produced as well as some attention to the
student's progress. Lab fee.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20. Preference given to Art majors and first-year students. This course cannot
be taken on a pass/fail basis.

ARTS 200(S) Post-Studio Practice
For decades, artists have found ways of practicing their artas concepts, processes, and interjections into the world
that did not require the use of the studio. Partially driven by the interest in conceptual work and in performance
and engagement with the quotidian, the arenas available for art practice exploded in size and context around the
1970s. These new specialties could take different forms and appear through different means. Process-based art
might call for chance methods of "making" or spending time, or giving instructions for someone else to execute;
think of Sol Lewitt's wall drawings or work by Earthwork artists executed by a construction team. The project
may also not result in an object, but rather strive to a non-physical outcome, such as dialogue-based
problem-solving in a social issue arena. Site-based work engages with a place. Place has geographical,
ethnographic, historical and contemporary use features with which to engage audiences who happen upon the
projects. Issue-based work is often developed with input from groups of people to bring awareness in a public
manner to a current event; think of Suzanne Lacy's work about rape, Marty Pottenger's work around money, and
Critical Art Ensemble's work around genetic manipulation of food. And of course these motivations are not
discrete and separate, any given project often incorporating all three. Many questions are raised: Why would an
artist give up The Object? How is this art? What about all the issues out of the artist's control? Why would
Art
­ 77 ­
someone want to give up expertise and control? What is gained and what is lost in this approach to artmaking?
Format: seminar and studio, class will meet twice a week. Requirements: Readings on artists and theory; written
reflections on work of others; weekly exercises; three main projects and their documentation; participation in all
aspects of course.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20 (expected : 15). Preferences: upon over enrollment the instructor will seek
to balance the course by class year and experience.
Hour: TBA DIGGS
ARTS 202(S) Movement and Art Making
This course will investigate the connections between dance and visual art. Students will learn and use techniques
from dance that can apply to the visual representation of action in drawing, painting, photography, video and
other art forms. How is a sculpture or an installation site transformed and informed by movement? We will ex-
amine the older connections such as ritual uses of visual art and dance, the collaboration of choreographer Mar-
tha Graham and visual artist Isamu Noguchi as well as contemporary site- specific dances of performers like
Eiko and Koma and Joanna Haigood. Evaluation will be based on attendance, class participation, quality of the
final project and a journal that documents the project research and process. The class will visit artist studios and
performances as part of research. Classes will consist of dance technique workshops, art making, discussions
with faculty and visiting artists. Labs will be used to generate material, view and discuss process, screenings and
visits.
Format: seminar and studio.
Prerequisites: experience in a visual art medium or experience in dance for example modern, ballet, African, or
hip-hop. Students interested in creative art, but do not have previous training in movement are encouraged to
attend.Enrollment limit: 20 (expected:15). Preference given to students with experience in art or dance.

ARTS 230(F,S) Drawing II
This drawing course will continue to investigate the techniques, principles of organization, and ideas which were
introduced in the Drawing I course. Having become more familiar with the drawing process, students will be
encouraged, through selected problems, to expand and challenge the conventions of markmaking. As with any
discipline, familiarity with the rules allows the users to seek alternatives and develop definitions of how the
drawing process can best be suited to their own visual vocabulary. The range of exercises could include tradition-
al materials on paper as well as combinations of materials more commonly associated with non-art disciplines,
i.e., computers, industrial materials, literature, etc.
Evaluation will be based on evidence of each student's progress, as shown in a portfolio of drawings made in
class and as homework. Attendance and participation in class discussions are also considered as part of the

ARTS 310T(S) Appearance/Disappearance
Appearance and disappearance are conditions that intuitively and intellectually link a subject to its surrounding
environment. We are made aware of things appearing (or disappearing) by the degrees and kinds of contrasts
exhibited by the subject (ideas or objects) in relation to its ground (ephemeral or material). The particular array of
relationships between subject and ground constructs diverse kinds of evidence. From medical research in the
imaging processes of the internal body to the forensic cues offered by the "black box" in-flight recording; from
the military use of camouflage to the video taped "appearances" of Osama bin Laden; from the inability of an
eating disorder patient to recognize a self image to the masquerades we willingly wear-appearance and disap-
pearance have governed the evidences of our actions, beliefs and identities.
This image-based studio examination of the subject will look at material that has been shaped by its link with our
central theme. Each of five studio projects will successively build a cumulative view of how appearance and/or
disappearance might shift a viewer's ability to render any point of view. While work in a variety of media will be
encouraged, most of the studio exercises will be two-dimensional or low-relief in their final presentation.
Format: tutorial. Evaluation will be on the basis of the technical and conceptual strengths of the portfolio, the
weekly paired-student format and full class studio discussions, and regular written analysis of work produced
during this term. Lab fee.

ARTS 312T(F) Fictional Realities
This tutorial will investigate visual art that explores notions of reality in contemporary life. We live in a rapidly
changing, expanding and inter-dependent world; and in a time of global cultural and economic conflict. A lot of
our knowledge about and experience of this world is mediated. We will look at how visual art identifies,
examines and questions the ways that information and experiences, be they personal, political or social, are
packaged and presented. Many contemporary artists are creating works around these issues. Some of the artists
we will look at include: Gregory Crewdson, Janet Cardiff, and Vik Munoz.
Students will be encouraged to explore their own perceptions of reality and how they are influenced through the
production of independent art work. Students may execute work in any, or any combination of, media in which
the student has completed an introductory course.
The course will include several sessions where the class will meet as a group to view image/video/sound
presentations and for discussions of assigned readings and work critiques. In addition, pairs of students will meet
weekly with the instructor to discuss work in progress.
Format: tutorial. Evaluation will be based on attendance, quality of work produced, and a general level of

ARTS 317T(F) The Miniature
This course will involve the critical analysis and production of works of art done on a small scale. If art on the
largest scale is inherently public in nature, what is the nature of the miniature? The miniature has fulfilled many
functions: images of remembrance, the portrait of a beloved, devotional objects, art made as an object of
contemplation and wonder. The language of the miniature is intimate, private, and bears the authority of
understatement. Our involvement with many works of art is likely to be distanced, in time and in space. Our
involvement with the miniature is close, highly personal, and frequent. Course assignments will examine the
inherent qualities of the work in miniature, and ask students to create work to fulfill historically defined and
innovative functions. The assigned work can be executed in any medium in which the student has completed an
introductory course. Students will meet in pairs, together with the instructor, and the students will present critical
responses to the works in progress and upon completion. Readings will be assigned to focus this critical analysis.
In addition to the production of miniatures, each student will research and deliver critical presentations on related
Art

contemporary or historical works.
Format: tutorial. Evaluation will be based on the quality of the assigned work, the engagement in the critique
process, and quality of presentations.
Prerequisites: any ArtS 200-level course. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Preference given to Art majors.
Hour: 7:00-9:40 p.m. M LEVIN
ARTS 319(F) Junior Seminar: Methods in Contemporary Art Practice
Junior seminar is an in-depth exploration of contemporary theory, history, and criticism as it relates to artmaking
practice. Students will be required to read historical and critical writings, study work of contemporary artists,
present materials on contemporary artists, and to make three projects that grow out of issues raised by the course.
Evaluation will be based on short writing assignments, studio projects, and class participation. Lab fee.
Enrollment is limited to Studio Art majors. This course is part of the Critical Reasoning and Analytical Skills
initiative.
Studio and History and Practice majors are required to take this course in the junior year unless studying abroad
during the fall semester.

ARTS 329(F) Architectural Design II
A continuation and expansion of ideas and skills learned in Architectural Design I. There will be four to six
design projects requiring drawings and models, each of which will emphasize particular aspects of architectural
theory and design. Visiting critics will discuss student work. The course is useful for students thinking of apply-
ing to graduate school in architecture.
Evaluation will be based on quality of designs during the term. Lab fee.
Prerequisites: ArtS 220; ArtH 262 highly recommended.
Hour: 1:10-3:50 F MCCALLUM
ARTS 350T(S) The BIG Picture
Installation practices, scale changes and serial imagery are transforming our spatial experience and temporal un-
derstanding of the photographic image. The size of photographic prints has grown enormously in the past thirty
years. Photographs compete with paintings for white wall real estate. There are technological, economic and
aesthetic reasons for this dramatic change in scale. This course will address the conceptual and technical chal-
lenges of large format printing and the making of large composites of photographs. Students will have an oppor-
tunity to work in a variety of media, both chemical and digital, dictated by the nature of the ideas generated in
tutorial sessions with colleagues. Lab fee.
Format: tutorial. Evaluation will be based on the portfolio produced and participation in the weekly tutorial meet-
ings.
Prerequisites: ArtS 255, 256 or 252. Enrollment limit: 10.

ARTS 366T(S) Printed Murals--Works on Paper
This class is designed to introduce students to an exciting process for creating oversized and large scaled mural
prints using the French seam adhesion technique while deconstructing printmaking traditions.
Our primary tools of exploration will be collagraph, woodcut, and monoprint and the combination of all these
techniques. We will explore the subtle nuances of the woodcut surface, build textured paper surfaces with
collagraph and layer veils of both oil and etching inks to weave the processes together into the rich mural surface.
The final paper seam adhesion technique will allow students to challenge traditional printmaking concepts of size
and shape.
Students will be encouraged to develop their ideas over a series of assignments which when pieced together will
create a unified larger image. Each section is printed individually from woodblocks with the press or by hand
with a burin in the ancient Japanese tradition. A unique language is then formed over several plates that can be
either used separately or combined with other plates to form whole new prints--the possibilities are endless.
Rotational printing, ghost printing and stenciling are all encouraged to build up rich and dense images on either
rag or Japanese paper. Hand embellishing with a variety of drawing materials are also employed to add yet
another dimensional layer to these murals. Group critiques or tutorials will also be an integral part of this class.
Format: tutorial. Evaluation will be based on attendance, participation in class, and the quality of work produced.
Lab fee.
Prerequisites: any one of the following courses: ArtS 263, 264, 266, 230, or 241. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected:

ARTS 418(S) Senior Seminar
The primary emphasis of the senior tutorial is on strengthening the student's skill and sensitivity in using critical
analysis for the creation of visual objects and/or events. At the beginning of the term, studio art majors, in con-
sultation with the tutor, will determine the individual projects that will serve as the focus of their work for the
semester. During the course, students are expected to refine their creative directions in a coherent and structured
body of work which will be exhibited at the Williams College Museum of Art. Students are responsible for buy-
ing their own materials. Lab fee.
Prerequisites: completion of all other studio courses required for the art studio route. Enrollment limit: 24. Senior

ARTS 497(F), 498(S) Independent Study
With current staffing limitations, it is difficult for studio faculty to supervise more than a very few independent
studies projects. We feel our curriculum includes rich and varied offerings and believe that the need for most
independent work can be met through those regular offerings.
Prerequisites: no student will be accepted into an independent study project unless he/she has completed two
200-level ArtS courses and one 300-level ArtS tutorial. Permission of instructor is required.
GRADUATE COURSES IN ART HISTORY
Requirements for the Degree of Master of Arts in Art History
The degree is normally awarded upon successful completion of two years of resident graduate study. To
earn the degree the student must earn a grade of at least B- in each of ten courses, at least six of which must
be graduate seminars (including ArtH 504). There is a geographical/chronological distribution requirement
that these ten courses must fulfill (details available from the Graduate Program Office.) In connection with
the preparation of a paper for the Graduate Symposium, students will register for an eleventh course (ArtH
509), to be graded pass/fail, in their fourth semester.
In addition to completing the required courses, students must participate in a group study trip to Europe
during winter study period in the first year, complete a Qualifying Paper in January of the second year, and
satisfy the language requirement in the manner described below (see "Language Courses").
Senior art majors may enroll in graduate seminars, space permitting, with the permission of instructor.
ARTH 501(S) Museums: History and Practice
This course will examine the history of museums in Europe and America, focusing on historical traditions and
current expectations affecting institutional operations today. Historical tradition and current practice as it relates
to museum governance and administration, architecture and installation, acquisitions and collections, cultural
property issues as well as the many roles of exhibitions in museum programming will be addressed along with
museums' social responsibility as scholarly and public institutions in an increasingly market-driven, non-profit
environment. Evaluation will be based on oral presentations as well as two term papers.
Hour: 2:30-5:10 T CONFORTI
ARTH 502(F) Photography and the Graphic Arts During the Second Empire
In this seminar we will pursue an intensive study of French photography during the 1850s and '60s, with an
emphasis on the major technological innovations (the transition from paper negatives to glass, and salt prints to
albumen, as well as photomechanical processes) and the intersections between photography, printmaking, and
painting. We will examine the roles of government commissions, photographic societies, public exhibitions, and
contemporary criticism, as well as crosscurrents between England and France. In addition to exploring commer-
cial photography and amateurism, we will undertake in-depth analyses of the careers of Gustave Le Gray,
Edouard Baldus, Charles Negre, and Charles Marville, and Roger Fenton. This seminar meets in the study room
of the Department of Prints, Drawings, and Photographs of the Clark Art Institute.
Prerequisites: reading knowledge of French strongly encouraged. Enrollment limit: 11.

ARTH 504(F) Methods of Art History and Criticism
This is a seminar in the intellectual history of the history of art, with some concentration on the ways in which this
disciplinary tradition has been challenged by recent critical theory. It will begin its study with the "founders" of
the field and end with issues and problems that generated the "new art history" twenty years ago and "visual
studies" in the last decade. Topics to be covered include: style, iconography/iconology, semiotics, identity poli-
tics, formalism, deconstruction, phenomenology, psychoanalysis, feminism, Marxism, and gender studies. Resi-
dent Clark Fellows will occasionally talk to us on perspectives of their choice. Each student will write one short
mid-term paper and a longer concluding essay, as well as present a couple of the readings to the class. Limited to
and required of first-year students in the Graduate Program in the History of Art.

ARTH 508(S) Art and Conservation: An Inquiry into History, Methods, and Materials
This course is designed to acquaint students with observation and examination techniques for works of art, arti-
facts, and decorative arts objects; give them an understanding of the history of artist materials and methods; and
familiarize them with the ethics and procedures of conservation. This is not a conservation training course but is
structured to provide a broader awareness for those who are planning careers involving work with cultural ob-
jects. Class format will include slide presentations, lectures, gallery talks, hands-on opportunities, technical ex-
aminations, and group discussions. Sessions will be held at the Williamstown Art Conservation Center, Williams
College, the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute, and the Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller Empire State
Plaza Art Collection in Albany. Examination questions may be formulated from exhibitions at these locations.

Six exams will be given. Exams scores will be weighed in proportion to the number of sessions covered by the
exam (e.g., the paintings exam, derived from six sessions of the course, will count as 25% of the final grade).
There is no overall final exam. Some exams may be designated "open book"; however, all work should be a
student's individual effort.

ARTH 509(S) Graduate Student Symposium
This course is designed to assist qualified fourth-semester graduate students in preparing a scholarly paper to be
presented at the Graduate Program's annual spring symposium. Working closely with a student/faculty ad hoc
advisory committee, each student will prepare a twenty-minute presentation based on the Qualifying Paper. Spe-
cial emphasis is placed on the development of effective oral presentation skills.
Requirements: each student is required to present two or three dry runs and a final oral presentation at the sympo-
sium.
Prerequisites: successful completion and acceptance of the Qualifying Paper.
Hour: TBA HAXTHAUSEN
ARTH 513(S) "The Other City": The Stone and Bronze Residents of Roman Cities
In our world, sculpture has its venues: museums, parks, cemeteries, or in front of City Hall. It is, however, prob-
lematic. Its social role is precarious, considering that much of the art elite despises its monumentalism, and the
public finds most contemporary works incomprehensible or offensive. Under the Roman Empire, on the other
hand, marble and bronze sculpture was universally believed to be essential to religion, culture, and political life.
We will interrogate the social role of sculpture in Roman life. Did the Romans, as the Jews and Christians
charged, worship statues as idols? Why were honor and memory best symbolized by works of sculpture? What
were the underpinnings in aesthetic theory behind figurative sculpture? What were the messages conveyed by
so-called "historical" reliefs? Did specific genres define class identities? We will ask these questions, and more.
Students will participate in discussion panels and each one will deliver a report to be revised into a paper.
Hour: 2:30-5:10 W MARVIN
ARTH 545(F) Antwerp, 1550-1650: Art Center of Northern Europe
In the mid-16th century Antwerp became the art center of all Northern Europe. Despite political, religious, and
economic difficulties, the city maintained this position, for much of the seventeenth century. We will study works
by Pieter Bruegel the Elder, Rubens, Van Dyck, and other, less familiar Antwerp artists in their political, social,
and religious context. Other topics will include working method and the implications of collaboration, size, nar-
rative modes, and body language. Requirements: 5-minute oral report, leading discussion on a set of readings,
two thematically interrelated 10-page papers, 20-min. oral report and critical commentary on another student's
oral report. Enrollment limit: 12.
Hour: 1:10-3:50 M FILIPCZAK
ARTH 546(S) What is Genre Painting?
Genre painting is both a firmly established and a puzzling category in Art History. In this course, we will explore
some of the key aesthetic and social questions it provokes: What precisely is it and why does it matter? What
social and cultural forces shaped its development? How was it defined and understood in particular countries and
at particular moments? What was its relationship with other modes and genres of painting, and with wider cultur-
al phenomena such as theater and proverbs? The course will focus on the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries in
the Low Countries, France, and England, and will examine the work of Teniers, Steen, Chardin, Hogarth, and
Greuze among others. The course will be assessed on the basis of oral presentation (normally focused on an
individual painting or group of paintings) and one research paper per student. In addition, students will be ex-
pected to lead discussions of readings and to respond to the presentations of others in the class. The class will be
limited to 12 students, with priority given to graduate students.
Hour: 1:10-3:50 R LEDBURY
ARTH 552(S) Ingres and the Modern Nude
How did the modern nude come to signify the female body? Although the male nude had a period of dominance
in the late eighteenth century, the nineteenth century might be said to have spawned both modernism and the
female nude. This seminar attempts to chart these interrelated developments in French art by exploring the ways
in which the nude functioned in academic training, its relationship to French colonialism, and the complex role of
the classical tradition as it morphs into orientalism and modernism later in the nineteenth century. Although the
course begins in the eighteenth century and continues selectively to the present, Ingres's influential nudes, includ-
ing Achilles Receiving the Ambassadors of Agamemnon (1801), Bather of Valpinçon (1808), Grande Odalisque
(1814), The Source (1856) and The Turkish Bath (1862), and their origins in the Napoleonic period play a central
role. The course emphasizes socio-historical writings since the 1980s as well as theoretical texts on gender, race,
sexuality, and ethnicity that have broadened the terms of art-historical debate.
Hour: 1:10-3:50 T OCKMAN
ARTH 555(F) John Singer Sargent
In this seminar we will consider the life and art of John Singer Sargent (1856-1925). Paintings in the collection of
the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute will focus our discussions and provide the basis for exploring his
art-making and his place within the art-culture of his day. Sargent--born in Italy, trained in France, active in
England--epitomized the cosmopolitanism of American artists in the late 19th century. Consideration of his ca-
reer will encourage us to think about questions of nationality; the mechanisms of fame in the modern art world of
his era; the tension between artistic tradition and innovation; and the fluctuating taste for his art among critics,
collectors, and historians of the past century. Students' responsibilities will include class discussion, weekly sum-
maries of readings, two short papers, an oral presentation (and response to someone else's), and a final research

ARTH 563(F) Minimalism
A research seminar on Minimalist art and its critical reception from the sixties to the present. Focusing primarily

Hour: 2:30-5:10 W MEYER
ARTH 568(S) Cubism and Its Interpretations
No artistic tendency of the early twentieth century had greater international impact than Cubism, which affected
the practice of artists of the most diverse orientation throughout Europe and Russia. It is equally true that no
twentieth-century movement has generated a comparable mass of critical and scholarly literature. Indeed, a study
of the historiography of Cubism can, arguably more than that of any other twentieth-century tendency, serve as a
microcosm of the evolving concerns of art-historical discourse, from the formalism of the early to mid-twentieth
century to more recent concerns with sexuality, semiotics, "primitivism," the market, and social history. This
seminar will closely re-examine the objects of classic Cubism themselves (primarily Picasso, Braque, Gris) as
well as the developing historiographic interpretations of this art. Requirements: students will be responsible for
leading class discussion on one set of readings; an oral report, to be presented in revised, written form at semes-
ter's end; and a 10-minute critical commentary on another student's oral report.

LANGUAGE COURSES
Reading proficiency in two European languages is required for the M.A. degree in Art History at Wil-
liams, and provision for attainment of this qualification is an integral part of the program of study. Of these
two, German is required, and French is recommended. Elementary and intermediate undergraduate
courses offered by the language departments are open to graduate students, and the graduate program of-
fers advanced, one-semester courses in French and German art-history readings. A student who begins
elementary language study after enrollment in the program should expect to take a sequence of courses.
Details may be obtained from the Graduate Program office. Entering students with some previous lan-
guage background will be asked to take a standard reading examination for purposes of placement. Stu-
dents should aim to complete all language work no later than the end of the third semester.
To satisfy the requirement in each of the two required languages, a student must: (a) score 700 or better
on the SAT II reading examination upon enrollment in the program or, (b) complete punctually and satis-
factorily (B- or better) all assignments and tests in the advanced courses. The same standards and expecta-
tions apply to language courses as to other courses and seminars.
Second-year students who have successfully completed German 511-512 and have independently de-
veloped their German language skills during the summer may, before the commencement of their third
semester of study, arrange to take a two-hour translation examination administered by the Graduate Pro-
gram. Students who pass the examination are exempted from German 513.
If appropriate to his or her course of study, a student may petition to substitute another language for
French. Instruction in Italian, Spanish, Russian, Latin, and Greek is regularly offered in the undergraduate
curriculum, whereas independent arrangements must be made for Dutch and other languages.
GERM 511(F)-512(S) Reading German for Beginners (Same as German 111(F)-112(S))
This course is for students who have had no previous study of German.
GERM 513(F) Readings in German Art History and Criticism
Texts are selected from characteristic works of art history and criticism and from the specialized literature re-
quired in concurrent seminars.
Prerequisites: German 511-512 with a final grade of B- or above, or appropriate score on SAT II exam upon
matriculation.
RLFR 511(F) Intensive Grammar and Translation
An intensive grammar course for students interested either in developing or in improving their basic reading
skills in French. Emphasis will be on a general review of grammar and sentence structure as well as on develop-
ing a wide range of vocabulary centered around art history.
RLFR 512(S) Readings in French Art History and Criticism
An advanced translation course specializing in art history. Texts will be selected from fundamental works of art
history and criticism and from the specialized literature required in concurrent art seminars in the Graduate Pro-
gram in Art History.

STUDY ABROAD
Students intending to major in Asian Studies are encouraged to study in Asia during one or both semes-
ters of their junior year. Williams faculty serve on the boards of several study abroad programs in China
and Japan. Opportunities to study in India, Indonesia, Korea, Taiwan,Thailand, and other Asian countries
are also available. Prospective Asian Studies majors who are planning to study abroad should discuss their
plans with their advisor as far in advance as possible. Up to eight courses taken overseas can count toward
graduation, and up to four courses taken off campus may be counted toward the major.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS
Students interested in writing an honors thesis in Asian Studies, Chinese, or Japanese should submit a
proposal to the department chair when they register for courses in the spring of their junior year. The pro-
posal should include a statement of the topic, a general description of the types of materials available for
study and how the study will be carried out, and the name of the faculty member who will serve as advisor.
Admission to the honors thesis program will normally be limited to students who have maintained at least a
B+ average in their courses for the major.
Students admitted to the program should register for ASST 493-W31-494, CHIN 493-W31-494, or
JAPN 493-W31-494. They will be expected to turn in the final draft of their thesis shortly after spring
break and to discuss their results formally with their faculty graders. Their final grades in the three courses
listed above and the award of Honors, Highest Honors, or no honors will be determined by the quality of
the thesis and the student's performance in the oral defense.
THE ASIAN STUDIES ENDOWMENT
The Linen summer grants for study abroad, the Linen visiting professorships, and several other pro-
grammatic activities in the department are supported by an endowment for Asian Studies established by
family and friends in memory of James A. Linen III, Class of 1934, Trustee of the College from 1948 to
1953 and from 1963 to 1982.

COURSES IN CHINESE (Div. I)
The department regularly offers four levels of instruction in Modern Standard Chinese (Mandarin), de-
signed to enable the student to become proficient in aural comprehension, speaking, reading, and writing,
as well as introductory courses in Cantonese, Taiwanese, Classical Chinese, and Chinese linguistics. The
course numbering system for Chinese is sequential. Students move from Chinese 101-102 or 121, 122, to
201, 202, 301, 302, 401, and 402. Independent study (Chinese 497, 498) may be offered depending on
student needs and available resources; interested students must contact the Coordinator of the Chinese Pro-
gram one semester in advance and present a proposal to the Coordinator or the professor with whom they
wish to study by the first day of pre-registration week. Those students entering with proficiency in Chinese
should see the Coordinator concerning placement.
The department also offers courses on Chinese literature and culture in English translation for students
who wish to become acquainted with the major achievements in Chinese literary, intellectual and cultural
history. For the purpose of the distribution requirement, all courses in Chinese are considered Division I
unless otherwise noted.
STUDY ABROAD
Students majoring in Chinese are strongly encouraged to study in mainland China or Taiwan during one
or both semesters of their junior year, during the summer, or over Winter Study. It is important that students
interested in any of these options consult as early as possible with the department and the Dean's Office
concerning acceptable programs.
CHIN 101(F)-W88-102(S) Basic Chinese*
An introduction to Mandarin, the language with the largest number of native speakers in the world, which is the
official language of China and Taiwan, and one of the official languages of Singapore. Course objectives are for
the student to develop simple, practical conversational skills and acquire basic proficiency in reading and writing
in both the traditional and the simplified script at about the 500-character level. The relationship between lan-
guage and culture and the sociolinguistically appropriate use of language will be stressed throughout. Both audio
and video materials will be employed extensively.
Format of spoken classes: dialog performance, drills, communicative exercises. Format of written classes: oral
reading, questions and discussion in Chinese, translation and explanation in English. Evaluation is based on
classroom performance, homework, quizzes, unit tests, and an oral and written final exam.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 10 per section (expected: 10 per section). Preference given to first-years and
sophomores. This is a rigorous, semi-intensive introduction to listening, speaking, reading, and writing. Students
who possess prior background but are not yet ready for Chinese 201 due to insufficient preparation in reading
and writing should speak with the Coordinator about taking Chinese 121, 122.
Credit granted only if both semesters and the winter study sustaining program are taken.

CHIN 131(S) Basic Cantonese*
An introduction to Standard Cantonese, a major regional language of southern China which is spoken by over 50
million people in Hong Kong, Macao, Guangdong, and Guangxi as well as by many overseas Chinese in
Southeast Asia, Hawaii, and North America. Due to the pervasive influence of Hong Kong as well as the
economic transformation of Guangdong Province, the prestige of Cantonese within China has been rising
steadily over the past few decades. Our focus in this course will be on developing basic listening and speaking
skills, though we will also study some of the special characters which have been used for centuries to write
Asian Studies
­ 87 ­
colloquial Cantonese. Since students will ordinarily possess prior proficiency in Mandarin, a closely related
language, we should be able to cover in one semester about as much as is covered in the first two to three
semesters of Mandarin.
Evaluation will be based on classroom performance, quizzes, tests, and a final exam.
Prerequisites: Chinese 202 or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 12 (expected: 8).

CHIN 201(F), 202(S) Intermediate Chinese*
These two courses are designed to consolidate the foundations built in Basic Chinese and continue developing
students' skills in aural comprehension, speaking, reading, and writing. Upon completion of the courses, students
should be able to speak Chinese with fluency on everyday topics, reach a literacy level of 1000 characters
(approximately 1200 common words written in both traditional and simplified characters), read materials written
in simple Standard Written Chinese, and produce both orally and in writing short compositions on everyday
topics. Conducted in Mandarin.

CHIN 223(S) Ethnic Minorities in China: Past and Present (Same as Anthropology 223)*
By 2000, of the 1.3 billion population of China, more than 100 million were ethnic minorities (shaoshu minzu).
Most of these reside in autonomous regions and districts, which constitute 64% of China's total acreage. This
course introduces students to the multiethnic aspect of China's past and present. We will address topics such as
the minority-group identification project; the definition ofminzu; government policy toward and the current situ-
ation of the fifty-five official ethnic minority groups; historical sino-centric views about "foreigners" and "bar-
barians"; ideas of "diversity," "unity," and "sinicization"; and the roles that "barbarians" have played in China's
long history. All readings will be in English.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on in-class participation and presentations, two short re-
sponse papers, one mid-term, and one final paper.
No prerequisites. No knowledge of Chinese language required, though students with Chinese language back-
ground are encouraged to work with Chinese sources if they wish. No enrollment limit (expected: 15). Open to

CHIN 224(F) Cultural Foundations: The Literature and History of Early China (Same as
Comparative Literature 220 and History 315)*
The early history of China witnessed many of humankind's most influential accomplishments, from the devel-
opment of a civil bureaucracy to the invention of printing, the compass, and gunpowder. It also saw the composi-
tion and spread of literary works and styles that continue to be both read and emulated up to the present day not
only in China but throughout the world. The acute awareness of early history and literature that runs through
modern Chinese culture, in its many manifestations and locales, is arguably unrivaled in the modern world. To
understand modern China, one must understand the past that continues to shape it today. The traditional view in
China was that "literature, history and philosophy cannot be separated." Accordingly, this course will look at
both the history and literature of China from the 2nd millennium B.C. to the late 13th century A.D. In a typical
week we will first read and discuss scholarship on the history and culture of a given historical period. In the
following class we will read selections of primary writings (in English translation) from the same period and
analyze them in their historical and cultural context. These writings will range from poems and short narratives to
philosophical works and political tracts. Our goal is to understand not only what modern scholarship says about
early China, but what the people living in that period and culture had to say about themselves and their world.All
readings in English.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: three short papers (5-7 pages), and final exam. Participation in class
discussions expected.
No prerequisites. No enrollment limit (expected: 15). Open to all.

CHIN 251T(S) Crises and Critiques: The Literature and Intellectual History of Early 20th Century
China (Same as Comparative Literature 256T and History 215T) (W)*
The first fifty years of the 20th century saw unprecedented changes in almost every sphere of Chinese society. A
political system that had survived in some form for over two millennia abruptly disintegrated. New ideas chal-
lenged orthodox intellectual culture in profound and complex ways. Chinese intellectuals questioned the value of
inherited traditions while simultaneously facing the real possibility of the near total extinction of those traditions.
Literature, which had historically been an important locus of cultural debates, served this role to perhaps an even
greater extent during this tumultuous period, as writers struggled with questions of how to save a country and
culture wracked by internal disintegration and facing urgent external threats. These debates framed many of the
Asian Studies
­ 88 ­
issues that continue to influence the political, intellectual, and literary cultures of the People's Republic of China
and Taiwan to this day. In this course we will examine a broad range of sources that engage the key debates of
this period. We will address such questions as the role of traditional culture versus that of modern or Western
culture, the role of ideology and politics in literary and artistic production, ideas of nationhood and cultural identi-
ty, and the relationship between the individual and the state. All readings will be in English translation.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: students will meet with the instructor in pairs for an hour each week. Every other
week the student will write and present orally a 5- to 7-page paper on the assigned topic of that week. In alterna-
tive weeks, the student will write a 2-page critique of the fellow student's paper. There will also be a final paper
dealing with the issues addressed during the course. Evaluation will be based on written work and analysis of the
fellow student's work.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Preference given to Chinese majors.
Tutorial meetings to be arranged. NUGENT
CHIN 301(F), 302(S) Upper-Intermediate Chinese*
Although the oral skills will continue to receive attention, there is at this level increased emphasis on reading and
writing. A major goal of the course will be developing students' reading proficiency in standard written Chinese,
the grammar and vocabulary of which differ considerably from the colloquial written Chinese which was
introduced during the first two years of instruction. About half of the course will be devoted to newspaper read-
ing, with the remainder consisting of several modules that may include short selections from modern Chinese
fiction, films, or other types of performance literature. Both simplified and traditional character texts will be used.
Conducted in Mandarin.
Requirements: three 50-minute classes plus a conversation session; primarily reading and discussion; students
are required to write a short essay every other week. Evaluation will be based on classroom performance, home-
work, quizzes, tests, and a final exam.
Prerequisites: Chinese 202 or permission of instructor.
Hour: 11:00-11:50 MWF F. WANG
CHIN 401(F), 402(S) Advanced Chinese*
This course is designed to enhance the Chinese language proficiency of students who are already at relatively
advanced levels. A wide assortment of materials is used including (for speaking/comprehension) audiotapes,
videotapes, and films featuring Chinese speakers from various segments of society; and (for reading) newspaper
and magazine articles dealing with Chinese politics and economics as well as selections from modern Chinese
literature. Conducted in Mandarin.
Requirements: two 75-minute classes plus a conversation session; primarily reading and discussion; students are
required to write a short essay every other week. Evaluation will be based on classroom performance, home-
work, quizzes, tests, and a final exam.
Prerequisites: Chinese 302 or permission of instructor.
Hour: 1:10-2:25 TF F. WANG
CHIN 412(S) Introduction to Classical Chinese*
Classical or "Literary" Chinese was the standard written language of China from around the seventh century BC
until the 1920s and served for many centuries as an important written language in Japan, Korea, and Vietnam as
well. Moreover, remnants of Classical Chinese are still used frequently in Modern Chinese, in both writing (e.g.,
newspaper, road signs and academic writing) and speech (e.g., proverbs and aphorisms). This course will serve
as an introduction to the basic grammar and vocabulary of Classical Chinese. We will focus on philosophical,
political, and historical anecdotes from works from the Spring and Autumn period (770-481 B.C.) through the
Han Dynasty (202 B.C. -220 A.D.), as they served as the foundation for the language. While the main objective
is to develop reading proficiency in Classical Chinese, the course will also serve to enhance proficiency in Mod-
ern Chinese through classroom discussion in Mandarin, translation of Classical Chinese into Modern Chinese,
and comparison of Classical Chinese and Modern Chinese vocabulary and grammar. Conducted primarily in
Mandarin.
Evaluation will be based on classroom performance, homework, tests, and a final exam.
Prerequisites: Chinese 301 or permission of instructor. No enrollment limit (expected: 12).
Hour: 1:10-2:25 MR NUGENT
CHIN 431(F) Introduction to Chinese Linguistics (Same as Linguistics 403)*
Is Chinese--whose nouns "lack" number and whose verbs have no tense--a monosyllabic, "primitive"
language? Are the Chinese characters a system of logical symbols or "idiographs," which indicate meaning
directly without regard to sound? Should (and could) the characters be done away with and alphabetized? Are
Cantonese, Hakka, and Taiwanese dialects or languages? And what is the relationship between Chinese,
Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese? These are some of the questions we will be taking up in this one-semester
introduction to the scientific study of the Chinese language. Topics to be covered include: the phonological,
syntactical, and lexical structure of Modern Standard Chinese; the Chinese writing system; the modern Chinese
dialects; the history of the Chinese language; sociolinguistic aspects of Chinese; language and politics in the
Chinese-speaking countries; and the teaching of Chinese as a foreign/second language. Readings in English and
Chinese, with class discussion primarily in Mandarin.
Evaluation will be based on classroom performance, homework, two short papers, and one longer paper.
Prerequisites: Chinese 302 or permission of instructor.

JAPN 101(F)-W88-102(S) First-Year Japanese*
An introduction to modern spoken and written Japanese, the course will emphasize oral skills in the fall semester,
with somewhat more reading and writing in the spring. The relationship between language and culture and the so-
ciolinguistically appropriate use of language will be stressed throughout. Computer-assisted learning materials
will be used extensively. Classes consist of a combination of "act" classes, conducted exclusively in Japanese,
where students use the language in various types of drills and communicative activities, and "fact" classes, con-
ducted in Japanese and English, where students learn about the language and culture.
Evaluation will be based on daily classroom performance, homework, quizzes,amidterm, andafinal exam.

ASTRONOMY (Div. III)
Chair, Professor JAY M. PASACHOFF
Professors: KWITTER, J. PASACHOFF. Observatory Supervisor/Instructor: SOUZA.
How long will the Sun shine? Are there planets like Earth among the many circling other stars? How did
the universe begin and how has it evolved over its 14 billion-year history? Astronomy is the science that
asks and tries to answer questions like these. We have come a long way toward understanding what makes
the sky appear as it does and how the Universe is fashioned. The Astronomy Department offers courses for
anyone who is interested in learning about the Universe, and who would like to be able to follow new
astronomical discoveries as they are made. All courses in Astronomy satisfy the Division III requirement.
The Astrophysics major, administered jointly with the Physics Department, and the Astronomy major, are
described below.
The beginning astronomy courses are offered on two levels. Astronomy 101, 102, 104, and 330-range
courses are intended primarily for non-science majors, and have no prerequisite. Astronomy 111 is de-
signed for students with some exposure to or interest in physics. It has a prerequisite of one year of high
school physics or permission of the instructor, and a corequisite of Mathematics 104 or equivalent back-
ground in calculus.
Most of the astronomy courses take advantage of our observational and computational facilities includ-
ing a 24" computer-controlled telescope with sensitive electronic detectors, and our own computer net-
work for image processing and data analysis. The Astronomy Department homepage can be found at
http://www.williams.edu/Astronomy.
ASTROPHYSICS MAJOR
The Astrophysics major is designed for students who want a rigorous introduction to the field, and in-
cludes not only those who plan graduate study in astronomy, astrophysics, or a closely related area, but also
those interested in a wide variety of careers. Alumni are not only astronomers but also computer scientists,
geologists, teachers, doctors, lawyers, business school professors, and so on. In recent years, many astro-
physics majors have had a second major in fields as wide ranging as mathematics, geosciences, economics,
and art history. This major emphasizes the description of the Universe and its constituents in terms of
physical processes. Potential Astrophysics majors should consult early with members of the Astronomy
and Physics Departments to determine their most appropriate route to and through the major. An essential
ingredient in such students' undergraduate training is experience in physics and mathematics. Therefore,
the major normally will begin in the first year a student is at Williams with Physics 131, 141, or 151 and
Mathematics 104 or 105 or 106 in the fall. Students with very good background placing them out of Phys-
ics 142 and out of Mathematics 104 may choose to take Physics 201 and Mathematics 105 or 106 instead.
Astronomy 111 will often be taken in the fall of the sophomore year; however, many students take it in the
fall of their first year at Williams, along with physics and math. Students who might place out of physics
courses should read the section on placement under Physics. Students who place out of Physics 131 or 141
into Physics 142 or 151 should particularly consider taking Astronomy 111 in the fall of their first year.
In addition to the major courses described below, other courses in geosciences, mathematics, and com-
puter science may also be appropriate.

Students entering with Advanced Placement in physics and/or mathematics may obtain credit toward the
major for the equivalent of Physics 141 and/or Mathematics 104 and/or 105 or 106 taken elsewhere, but at
least 8 courses in astronomy, physics, and mathematics must be taken at Williams. There are some aspects
of astrophysics that are closely related to chemistry or geosciences. In recognition of this relation, certain
advanced courses in those departments can be accepted for credit toward the Astrophysics major on a two-
for-one basis. It is not possible to double major in Astrophysics and Physics.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN ASTROPHYSICS
The honors degree in Astrophysics will be awarded on the basis of a senior thesis presenting the results
of an original observational, experimental, or theoretical investigation carried out by the student under the
direction of a faculty member in Astronomy or Physics. There are no specific grade requirements (other
than College-wide requirements for remaining in good academic standing) for entry into the thesis research
program; however, a student wishing to do a thesis should have demonstrated both ability and motivation
for independent work in previous courses and in any earlier research involvement. Students doing theses
will normally choose a topic and an advisor early in the second semester of their junior year and usually
begin their thesis work during the summer. During the senior year, those students whose proposals have
been approved will elect two courses and a winter study project in addition to the minimum requirements
for the major. Preparation for the thesis will occupy at least one course (Astrophysics 493) and the winter
study project (Astrophysics 031). At the end of the winter study period, the departments will decide, in
consultation with each student, whether to admit that student to honors candidacy. Both a written thesis and
an oral presentation to faculty and fellow students are required. The degree with honors will be awarded to
those who meet these requirements with distinction. The degree with highest honors will be awarded to
those who fulfill the requirements with unusually high distinction.
The departments will be flexible with regard to the number and timing of courses devoted to thesis re-
search within the general guidelines of two courses and a winter study project over and above the mini-
mum major requirements and the written and oral presentations, especially in cases of students with ad-
vanced standing and/or summer research experience. Students considering unusual requests are urged to
consult with potential advisors or the department chairs as early as possible.
ASTRONOMY MAJOR
The Astronomy major is designed for students with an interest in learning about many aspects of mod-
ern astronomy, but who do not choose to take the advanced physics courses of the astrophysics major. It is
also appropriate as a second major for students concentrating in another field. The Astronomy major em-
phasizes understanding the observed properties of the physical systems that comprise the known Universe,
from the Sun and solar system, to the evolution of stars and star clusters, to the Milky Way Galaxy, to
external galaxies and clusters of galaxies. Because some knowledge of physics and calculus is necessary to
Astronomy, Astrophysics
­ 92 ­
understand many astronomical phenomena, the Astronomy major requires the first two semesters each of
the physics and calculus that are also required of Physics majors and Astrophysics majors.
There are several possible routes through the Astronomy major, depending on preparation and interest.
Students considering a major in Astronomy should consult with members of the department early and
often. A first-year student, unsure about choosing between Astronomy and Astrophysics, may wish to take
not only Astronomy 111 but also Physics 131, 141, or 151 and Mathematics 104 (if necessary) in the fall.
Students who might place out of physics courses should read the section on placement under Physics.

or equivalent placement
The total number of courses required for the Astronomy major is nine. Students entering with Advanced
Placement in physics and/or math may obtain credit toward the major for the equivalent of Physics 142
and/or Mathematics 105 or 106 taken elsewhere. There are some aspects of astronomy that are closely
related to chemistry or geosciences. In recognition of this, certain advanced courses in those departments
can be accepted for credit toward the Astronomy major.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN ASTRONOMY
The honors degree in Astronomy will be awarded on the basis of a senior thesis presenting the results of
an original observational, experimental, or theoretical investigation carried out by the student under the
direction of a faculty member in Astronomy. There are no specific grade requirements (other than College-
wide requirements for remaining in good academic standing) for entry into the thesis research program;
however, a student wishing to do a thesis should have demonstrated both ability and motivation for inde-
pendent work in previous courses and in any earlier research involvement. Students doing theses will nor-
mally choose a topic and an advisor early in the second semester of their junior year and usually begin their
thesis work during the summer. During the senior year, those students whose proposals have been ap-
proved will elect two courses and a winter study project in addition to the minimum requirements for the
major. Preparation for the thesis will occupy at least one course (Astronomy 493) and the winter study
project (Astronomy 031). At the end of the winter study period, the department will decide, in consultation
with each student, whether to admit that student to honors candidacy. Both a written thesis and an oral
presentation to faculty and fellow students are required. The degree with honors will be awarded to those
who meet these requirements with distinction. The degree with highest honors will be awarded to those
who fulfill the requirements with unusually high distinction.
The department will be flexible with regard to the number and timing of courses devoted to thesis re-
search within the general guidelines of two courses and a winter study project over and above the mini-
mum major requirements and the written and oral presentations, especially in cases of students with ad-
vanced standing and/or summer research experience. Students considering unusual requests are urged to
consult with potential advisors or the department chair as early as possible.
ASTRONOMY COURSES
COURSES FOR NON-MAJORS WITH NO PREREQUISITES
ASTR 101(F) Stars: From Suns to Black Holes
What makes a star shine? For how long will the Sun keep shining? What are black holes and how can they form?
Astronomy 101, a non-major, general introduction to the part of contemporary astronomy that includes how stars
form and how they end their existence, will provide answers to these questions and more. The course gives spe-
cial attention to the exciting discoveries of the past few years. Topics include modern astronomical instruments
such as the Hubble Space Telescope, the Spitzer Space Telescope, the Chandra X-ray Observatory, the new gen-
eration of 8- and 10-meter mountaintop telescopes, and results from them; how astronomers interpret the light
received from distant celestial objects; the Sun as a typical star (and how its future will affect ours); and our
modern understanding of how stars work and how they change with time. We will also discuss how pulsars and
Astronomy, Astrophysics

black holes result from the evolution of normal, massive stars and how giant black holes are at the center of
galaxies and quasars. We will discuss the discovery of planets around stars other than the Sun. This course is
independent of and on the same level as Astronomy 102 and 104, though students who have taken those courses
are welcome.
Observing sessions will include use of the 24 telescope and other telescopes for observations of stars, star clus-
ters, planets and their moons, nebulae, and galaxies, as well as daytime observations of the Sun.
Format: lecture (three hours per week), observing sessions (scattered throughout the semester), afternoon labs
(four times per semester), and a planetarium demonstration. Evaluation will be based on two hour tests, a final
exam, an observing portfolio, and laboratory reports.
No prerequisites. No enrollment limit (expected: 40). Non-major course.

ASTR 104(S) The Milky Way Galaxy and the Universe Beyond
It has been only about 85 years since the Sun was discovered not to be at the center of the Milky Way Galaxy, and
only 80 years since our Milky Way Galaxy was determined to be only one of countless "island Universes" in
space. A host of technological advances is enabling us to understand even more clearly our place in the universe
and how the universe began. For example, the Hubble Space Telescope, the Spitzer Space Telescope, and the
Chandra X-ray Observatory bring clearer images and cover a wider range of the spectrum than have ever been
obtainable before; they are speeding up progress on determining the past and future of the Universe. In addition,
the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe spacecraft's study of the early Universe and large-scale mapping
programs are giving clues into how the Universe's currently observed structure arose. They are confirming and
enlarging our understanding of the Big Bang. Astronomy 104, a non-major, general introduction to part of con-
temporary astronomy comprising the study of galaxies and the Universe, explores the answers to questions like:
What is the Milky Way?; Why are quasars so luminous?; Is the Universe made largely of "dark matter" and
"dark energy"?; What determines the ultimate fate of the Universe? This course is independent of, and on the
same level as Astronomy 101 and 102, though students who have taken those courses are welcome.
Observing sessions will include use of the 24" telescope and other telescopes for observations of stars, star clus-
ters, planets and their moons, nebulae, and galaxies, as well as daytime observations of the Sun.

ASTR 330(S) The Nature of the Universe
A journey through space and time from the first 10-43 seconds to the ultimate fate of the Universe billions of
years in the future. Topics include conditions during the first three minutes, creation of the elements, stellar and
giant black holes, the Big Bang and its remnant radiation, relativity, galaxies and quasars, the large scale structure
of the Universe, and current ideas about the future of the Universe and the end of time. In particular, we will
explore the exciting new results on the acceleration of the Universe's expansion, and the precise determination of
its age and fate.
Format: lecture/discussion, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on two hour tests, occasional home-
work, and a final exam.
No prerequisites. Courses in the 330-sequence are meant as general-education courses for students of all majors.

ASTR 219T/419T(F) Observational Cosmology (W)
The past decade has seen the birth of "precision cosmology," based on combined results from Hubble Space
Telescope key projects, cosmic microwave background satellites and ground-based surveys. According to the
derived "concordance model" the universe is 13.7 billion years old and is currently expanding at a rate of 72
km/sec/megaparsec. The model also describes a flat, accelerating big-bang universe that underwent very early
inflation and is now dominated by dark energy and cold dark matter. In this course students will explore the
observations and interpretations that have led to our current understanding of the universe's history and structure.
Topics will include galaxy structure and evolution, the cosmic microwave background (e.g., Cosmic Back-
ground Observer and Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe) distant supernova searches (e.g., High-Z Super-
nova Team and Supernova Cosmology Project), galaxy surveys (e.g., Sloan Digital Sky Survey and 2dF (two-
degree field)) as well as theoretical and supercomputing efforts.
Students will read portions of current texts as well as some more detailed research papers. Astronomy 419T
students will complete additional reading and present papers covering more advanced topics.
Format: tutorial. Evaluation will be based on five 5-page papers; presentation, response and discussion in the
tutorial session; and evidence of growth in understanding over the semester.
Prerequisites: Astronomy 111 and for 219T: Physics 142/151; for 419T: Physics 202. Enrollment limit: 10 (ex-

Biochemistry and molecular biology are dynamic fields that lie at the forefront of science. Through elu-
cidation of the structure and function of biologically important molecules (such as nucleic acids, lipids,
proteins, and carbohydrates) these disciplines have provided important insights and advances in the fields
of molecular engineering (recombinant DNA technology, "intelligent" drug design, "in vitro evolution"),
genomics and proteomics, signal transduction, immunology, developmental biology, and evolution.
The Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Program is designed to provide students with an opportunity
to explore living systems in molecular terms. Biochemistry and molecular biology are at the interface be-
tween the chemical and biological methods of looking at nature; therefore, the program draws heavily
from these disciplines. While chemistry is concerned with the relationship between molecular structure
and reactions, and biology focuses on cells and organisms, biochemistry and molecular biology probe the
details of the structures and interactions of molecules in living systems in order to provide the foundation
for a better understanding of biological molecules both individually and as members of more complex
structures.
PROGRAM
While aspects of biochemistry and molecular biology can be very diverse, a common set of chemical
and biological principles underlie the more advanced topics. With this in mind, the program has been struc-
tured to provide the necessary background in chemistry and biology and the opportunity to study the many
facets of the modern areas of the biochemical sciences. Students interested in the Biochemistry and Molec-
ular Biology Program should plan their course selection carefully. Since it is expected that Biochemistry
321 and 322 would be taken in the junior year, students are advised to take the prerequisites for those
courses in both chemistry and biology during their first two years at Williams. While the program is open
to all students, it is expected that it will appeal primarily to majors in biology and chemistry because of the
number of courses required in those fields. In addition to taking the required courses, students planning to
complete the Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Program are strongly encouraged to elect courses in
mathematics and physics.
The following interdepartmental courses serve as the core of the Biochemistry and Molecular Biology
Program.
BIMO 321 and 322 provide a comprehensive introduction to biochemistry. BIMO 322 is a new require-
ment and applies to 2007 graduates and beyond. BIMO 401, the capstone course for the concentration,
provides students the opportunity to examine the current scientific literature in a wide variety of BIMO-re-
lated research areas.
BIMO 321(F) Biochemistry I--Structure and Function of Biological Molecules (Same as Biology
321 and Chemistry 321) (Q)
This course introduces the basic concepts of biochemistry with an emphasis on the structure and function of
biological macromolecules. Specifically, the structure of proteins and nucleic acids are examined in detail in or-
der to determine how their chemical properties and their biological behavior result from those structures. Other
topics covered include enzyme kinetics, mechanism and catalysis and regulation; the molecular organization of
biomembranes and membrane transport; and the principles of recombinant DNA technologies. In addition, the
principles and applications of the methods used to characterize macromolecules in solution and the interactions
between macromolecules are discussed. The laboratory provides an opportunity to study the structure of macro-
molecules and to learn the fundamental experimental techniques of biochemistry including electrophoresis and
chromatography.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, four hours per week. Evaluation will be based on three hour
exams, a final exam, problem sets and performance in the laboratories including lab reports.
Prerequisites: Biology 101 and Chemistry 251/255 and Chemistry 155/256. No enrollment limit (expected: 25).
Hour: 10:00-10:50 MWF Lab: 1-5 M,W LOVETT
BIMO 322(S) Biochemistry II--Metabolism (Same as Biology 322 and Chemistry 322) (Q)
This lecture course provides an in-depth presentation of the complex metabolic reactions which are central to life.
Emphasis is placed on the biological flow of energy including alternative modes of energy generation (aerobic,
anaerobic, photosynthetic); the regulation and integration of the metabolic pathways including compartmental-
ization and the transport of metabolites; and biochemical reaction mechanisms including the structures and
mechanisms of coenzymes. This comprehensive study also includes the biosynthesis and catabolism of small
molecules (carbohydrates, lipids, amino acids, and nucleotides). Laboratory experiments introduce the principles
and procedures used to study enzymatic reactions, bioenergetics, and metabolic pathways.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, four hours per week. Evaluation will be based on several ex-
ams, an oral presentation, and performance in the laboratories including lab reports that emphasize conceptual
and mathematics analysis of the data generated.
Prerequisites: Biology 101 and Chemistry 251/255. No enrollment limit (expected: 36).

of a wide range of both biological and chemical approaches to addressing important questions in the biochemical
and molecular biological fields.
Format: seminar, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on class discussions and presentations, several
short papers, and a final paper.
Prerequisites: Biology 202 and BIMO 321. Enrollment limit: 12 (expected: 8). Preference given to those com-

To complete the concentration in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, a student must complete all of the
required courses listed below, take one elective not within the student's major from the list below, and at-
tend at least eight Biology and/or Chemistry Department colloquia. Since the Chemistry Department
counts two biology courses and the Biology Department counts two chemistry courses toward the majors
(each of which can be completed with only eight other courses), a student majoring in either chemistry or
biology would have to take only two or three additional courses to complete the program.

ty. There are approximately a dozen colloquia offered each semester among which BIMO concentrators
may choose. Attendance at the honors student research presentations and the spring BIMO Alumni Re-
union poster session also count toward the colloquium requirement. Concentrators may receive credit for
colloquia attended during any of their semesters at Williams College.

Bioinformatics, genomics, and proteomics are rapidly advancing fields that integrate the tools and
knowledge from biology, chemistry, computer science, mathematics, physics, and statistics in research at
the intersection of the biological and informational sciences. Inspired by the enormous amount of biologi-
cal data that are being generated from the sequencing of genomes, these new fields will help us pose and
answer biological questions that have long been considered too complex to address. Research in genomics,
Bioinformatics, Genomics, and Proteomics, Biology
­ 97 ­
proteomics, and bioinformatics will also significantly impact society affecting medicine, culture, econom-
ics, and politics.
The Bioinformatics, Genomics, and Proteomics curriculum involves faculty from the biology, chemis-
try, computer science, mathematics/statistics, and physics departments and was designed to provide stu-
dents with an understanding of these revolutionary new areas of investigation. The introductory level
courses, Computation and biology and Statistics for Biologists are accessible to all students interested in
gaining familiarity with the power of genomic analysis. Students interested in graduate work in bioinfor-
matics, genomics, and proteomics should take the core courses and five of the recommended courses. In-
terested students are also encouraged to participate in independent research with members of the advisory
faculty as they explore the development of these new fields.

The Biology curriculum has been designed to provide students with a broad base for understanding
principles governing life processes at all levels, from biochemistry and cell biology to physiology to ecolo-
gy and behavior. Courses emphasize fundamentals common to all subdisciplines including the coupling of
structure to function, the transfer of energy in living systems, communication, and the molding of diversity
by the evolutionary process. In upper-level courses and in independent and honors research, students have
the opportunity to investigate areas at the frontiers of modern biology.
Although the Biology major is specifically designed to provide a balanced curriculum in the broader
context of the liberal arts, it is also excellent preparation for graduate studies in the life sciences and in the
health professions.
MAJOR REQUIREMENTS
In order to make the major accessible to students with diverse interests, required courses are kept to a
minimum. The Biology major is satisfied by nine courses, as follows:
Biology 101 The Cell
Biology 102 The Organism
Biology 202 Genetics
Any two 300-level courses, each of which must have a laboratory associated with it.
Any one 400-level course other than 493-494.
Any other three courses or any other two courses and two semesters of Organic Chemistry.
NOTE: Independent study courses and AMS 311 (Same as Biology 231) do not fulfill the 300-level or
400-level course requirements. WIOX 216, Biology: Evolution, in the Williams Oxford Program qualifies
for major credit.
Distribution Requirement
In order to ensure that majors broaden their knowledge of biology, one of the elective courses for the
major must include an upper-level course covering biological processes at levels of organization above the
cell. Courses that satisfy this distribution requirement are indicated in the individual course description.
Biology
­ 98 ­
COURSE SELECTION AND PLACEMENT
It is preferable for students who plan to major in biology, or think they may be interested in doing so, to
take Biology 101, 102 during their first year at Williams. It is also possible to begin the Biology major
during the sophomore year, although students should understand that it may require taking two or more
biology courses during several semesters.
Students interested in biology, whether or not they intend to major in it, are encouraged to take Biology
101, 102. It is also possible, with permission of the instructor, to take Biology 203 Ecology, Biology 204
Animal Behavior, Biology 220 Field Botany and Biology 225 Natural History of the Berkshires without
prerequisite. Other biology courses designed specifically for students who do not intend to take additional
upper-level courses in biology include Biology 134 The Tropics: Biology and Social Issues and Biology
133 Biology of Exercise and Nutrition. All of these courses satisfy the Division III distribution requirement;
in addition, Biology 134 satisfies the Peoples and Cultures distribution requirement.
Beginning students should normally enroll in Biology 101 and 102. Students with unusually strong
backgrounds in biology, such as those with outstanding performance on the College Board Biology Ad-
vanced Placement Test, may be permitted to elect a sophomore-level course in lieu of Biology 101 and/or
Biology 102 upon successful completion of a departmental qualifying exam, administered during First
Days.
COURSES RELATED TO THE BIOLOGY MAJOR
Students planning to pursue their interest in biology and related fields after completing their undergradu-
ate degrees are strongly encouraged to take one year of chemistry, at least one semester of mathematics (a
course in statistics is recommended), and one semester of physics. Students may wish to check the require-
ments for graduate admission at relevant universities, and are also encouraged to consult with the Biology
Department's graduate school advisor about prerequisites for admission to graduate programs.
BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
Students interested in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (BIMO) should consult the general state-
ment under Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.
BIOINFORMATICS, GENOMICS AND PROTEOMICS
Students interested in Bioinformatics, Genomics and Proteomics (BiGP) should consult the general
statement under Bioinformatics, Genomics and Proteomics. Biology majors interested in this field are
strongly encouraged to enroll in Life as an Algorithm (Computer Science 106/Biology 106) and Integrative
Bioinformatics, Genomics, and Proteomics (Biology 319).
NEUROSCIENCE
Students interested in Neuroscience (NSCI) should consult the general statement under Neuroscience.
ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
Students interested in Environmental Studies (ENVI) should consult the general statement under Envi-
ronmental Studies.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN BIOLOGY
In order to be recommended for the degree with honors, a Biology major is normally expected to have
completed the equivalent of two semesters and a winter study (031) of independent research culminating in
a thesis which demonstrates outstanding achievement of an original and innovative nature. Although the
presentation of a thesis and associated oral presentation in the fall and poster defense in the spring are re-
quired for consideration for a degree with honors, their completion should not be interpreted as a guarantee
of a degree with honors. The principal considerations in admitting a student to the program of independent
honors research will be mastery of fundamental material and skills, ability to pursue independent study
successfully, and demonstrated interest and motivation. Students interested in participating in the honors
program should consult with the department early in the spring semester of the junior year; approval must
be received before spring registration in the junior year.
The minimum course requirements for a degree with honors in Biology are Biology 101, Biology 102,
Biology 202, two 300-level biology courses (each of which must have a laboratory associated with it), one
400-level biology course, Biology 493, Biology 494, WSP 031, and any other two courses in biology (or
any other one course and two semesters of Organic Chemistry).
In addition to the normal honors route, which includes two semesters (Biology 493-494) and a winter
study of research (WSP 031) during senior year, students have the option, subject to the approval of their
thesis advisor, to begin the honors research during winter study junior year or during the second semester
junior year. Students beginning honors in winter study of junior year would take Biology 494 in the spring
of their junior year followed by Biology 493 in the fall of their senior year; students beginning honors
during the second semester of junior year would take Biology 494 that semester, followed by Biology 493
in the fall of senior year and winter study research in the winter of the senior year.
STUDY ABROAD
Students planning on majoring in Biology are strongly advised to take Biology 202 before going
abroad, since Biology 202 is required for the major and a prerequisite for many upper-level courses; a
Genetics course taken while studying away cannot substitute for Biology202. Biology majors studying
abroad may receive credit toward the major for at most two 200-level electives; the departmental distribu-

BIOL 210T(S) Evo-Devo: The Evolution of Animal Design (W)
What makes a bird a bird and a frog a frog? The key to understanding the mechanisms that generate biological
form and diversity lies in a new and rapidly growing field, termed "evo-devo," that represents a synthesis of
evolution and development. This course, designed specifically for sophomores, aims to explore evo-devo in de-
tail by building on material introduced in Biology 102. Using readings from the primary literature, the course will
consider topics such as how the modification of developmental mechanisms can create novel traits, why some
traits are resistant to change, how the determination of shared ancestral traits differs from those that rise indepen-
dently, and how ecological considerations impact development to modulate evolutionary change.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: after an initial group meeting, students meet weekly with a tutorial partner and
the instructor for an hour each week. Each student will write and present orally a 5-page paper every other week

BIOL 308(F) Integrative Plant Biology: Fundamentals and New Frontiers
Plants are one of the most successful groups of organisms on Earth and have a profound impact on all life. Suc-
cessful use of plants in addressing global problems and understanding their role in natural ecosystems depends
on fundamental knowledge of the molecular mechanisms by which they grow, develop, and respond to their
environment. This course will examine the molecular physiology of plants using an integrative approach that
considers plants as dynamic, functional units in their environment. Major emphasis will be on understanding
fundamental plant processes, such as photosynthesis, growth and development, water transport, hormone physi-
ology, and flowering, from the molecular to the organismal level. Environmental effects on these processes will
be addressed in topics including photomorphogenesis, stress physiology, mineral nutrition, and plant-microbe
interactions. Discussions of original research papers will examine the mechanisms plants use to perform these
processes and explore advances in the genetic engineering of plants for agricultural, environmental, and medical
purposes. Laboratory activities stress modern approaches and techniques used in investigating plant physiologi-
cal processes.
Format: lecture/discussion/laboratory, six hours per week. Evaluation will be based on lab reports, a term paper,

What can computational biology teach us about cancer? In this capstone experience for the Genomics, Proteom-
ics, and Bioinformatics program, computational analysis and wet-lab investigations will inform each other, as
students majoring in biology, chemistry, computer science, mathematics/statistics, and physics contribute their
own expertise to explore how ever-growing gene and protein data-sets can provide key insights into human dis-
ease. In this course, we will take advantage of one well-studied system, the highly conserved Ras-related family
of proteins, which play a central role in numerous fundamental processes within the cell. The course will inte-
grate bioinformatics and molecular biology, using database searching, alignments and pattern matching, and re-
combinant DNA techniques to reconstruct the evolution of the RAS gene family by focusing on the gene dupli-
cation events and gene rearrangements that have occurred over the course of eukaryotic speciation. By utilizing
high through-put approaches to investigate genes involved in various signal transduction pathways, students will
identify pathways that are aberrantly activated in mammalian cell lines carrying a mutant, constantly active Ras
protein. This functional genomic strategy will be coupled with microscopic examination of tissue sections from a
variety of human colon tumors, using phosphorylation-state specific antisera, to test our hypotheses. Proteomic
analysis will introduce the students to de novo structural prediction and threading algorithms, as well as data-
mining approaches to identify specific amino acids involved in protein-protein contacts. Phage display and mass
spectrometry will be used to study networks of interacting proteins in normal colon and colon tumor tissue. For-
mat: lab, with one-hour of lecture per week. Evaluation will be based on lab participation and several short pa-

BIOL 416(S) Epigenetics
After decades of studies emphasizing the role of DNA in heredity, scientists are now turning their attention from
genetics to a variety of heritable phenomena that fall under the heading of epigenetics, heritable changes that do
not result from an alteration in DNA sequence. Research reveals that stable changes in cell function can result
from, for example, stable changes in protein conformation, protein modification, DNA methylation, or the loca-
tion of a molecule within the cell. Using readings from the primary literature, we will explore the epigenetic
nature and molecular mechanisms underlying a diverse array of phenomena such as prion propagation, genetic
imprinting, dosage compensation, transvection, centromere formation, synapse function, and programmed ge-
nome rearrangements. The significance of epigenetic processes for development, evolution, and human health
will be discussed.

MAJOR
Through a variety of individual courses and sequential programs, the department provides an opportuni-
ty for students to explore the nature and significance of chemistry, an area of important achievement in our
quest for knowledge about ourselves and the world around us. The student of chemistry is able to become
aware of the special viewpoint of chemists, the general nature of chemical investigation, some of its impor-
tant results, how these results are expressed, and something of their significance within the fields of science
and in the area of human endeavor as a whole. The Chemistry major provides excellent preparation for
graduate study in chemistry, biochemistry, chemical engineering, environmental science, materials sci-
ence, medicine, and the medical sciences.
A major in chemistry can be achieved in several ways, preferably beginning in the student's first year at
Williams, but also beginning in the sophomore year. Building on a foundation in general chemistry, organ-
ic chemistry, and physical chemistry, a student elects additional advanced courses to complete a major that
is consistent with his or her background in other sciences, interests, and goals. A student's program might
emphasize biochemistry, organic chemistry, physical chemistry, or inorganic chemistry, with additional
courses available in analytical chemistry, environmental science, and materials science. Students consider-
ing a major in chemistry should consult with a member of the department as early as possible in order to
plan a program which best suits their interests and abilities and which makes full use of their previous
preparation.
All students begin their study in the department with either Chemistry 151, 153, or 155. Placement at the
introductory level is based upon performance on the departmental placement test results and consultation
with the chair; results of the College Board Advanced Placement Test or the International Baccalaureate
Exam are also taken into account. The first year is completed with Chemistry 156. In the second year at the
introductory level, students take Chemistry 251 (or 255) and Chemistry 256 (those students who complete
155 are exempted from 256). Completion of a Chemistry major requires either nine semester chemistry
courses or eight semester chemistry courses plus two approved courses from among the following: Biolo-
gy 101; Computer Science 134; Mathematics 103, 104, 105, 106; Physics 131, 141; or any courses in these
departments for which the approved courses are prerequisites. Starting at the 300 level, at least three of the
courses taken must have a laboratory component, and at least one must be selected from Chemistry 361,
366, 364, or 367. (The specific course elected, in consultation with the chair or major advisor, will depend
on the student's future plans.) In addition, the department has a number of "Independent Research
Courses" which, while they do not count toward completion of the major, provide a unique opportunity to
pursue an independent research project under the direction of a faculty member.

For the purpose of assisting students in selecting a program consistent with their interests and possible
continuation of their studies at the graduate level, the following groupings of electives and faculty
advisors are suggested. However, a case can be made for selecting courses from the different groups.
Biochemistry: Chemistry 321, Chemistry 322, Chemistry 324, Chemistry 341, Chemistry 364,
Chemistry 367. Students interested in biochemistry should consult with Professors Gehring, Kaplan,
or Lovett.
Organic Chemistry: Chemistry 341, Chemistry 342, Chemistry 344, Chemistry 364, Chemistry 361,
Chemistry 366. Students interested in organic chemistry should consult with Professors Goh, Rich-
ardson, or Smith.
Physical and Inorganic Chemistry: Chemistry 332, Chemistry 335, Chemistry 361, Chemistry 364,
Chemistry 366, Chemistry 368T. Students interested in physical chemistry should consult with Pro-
fessors Bingemann, Peacock-López, or Thoman. Students interested in inorganic chemistry should
consult with Professors Hasanayn or Park. Students interested in materials science should consult
with Professors Goh or Park.
While any accepted route through the major would permit a student to proceed to graduate study in
chemistry, four electives should be considered a minimum, and at least a semester of research is
strongly recommended.
The department is accredited by the American Chemical Society (A.C.S.), a professional body of aca-
demic, industrial, and research chemists. The A.C.S. suggests the following courses for someone con-
sidering graduate study or work in chemistry or a related area: 151 (153 or 155), 156, 251 (255), 256,
335, 361, 364, 366, 493-494; and at least two courses from 321, 322, 342, 344, 368T, BIMO 401.
Students completing these courses are designated Certified A.C.S. Majors.
BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY (BIMO)
Students interested in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology should consult with the general statement
under the Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Program (BIMO) in the Courses of Instruction. Students
interested in completing the BIMO program are also encouraged to complete the biochemistry courses
within the chemistry major by taking 321, 322, 324, and 367 in addition to the first and second year re-
quired courses.
BIOINFORMATICS, GENOMICS, AND PROTEOMICS (BiGP)
Students interested in Bioinformatics, Genomics, and Proteomics should consult the general statement
under Bioinformatics, Genomics, and Proteomics in the Courses of Instruction. Students interested in these
areas are also encouraged to complete the biochemistry courses within the chemistry major by taking 319,
321, 322, 324 and 367 in addition to the first and second year required courses.
MATERIALS SCIENCE
Students interested in Materials Science are encouraged to elect courses from the Materials Science pro-
gram offered jointly with the Physics Department, and should consult that listing.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN CHEMISTRY
The degree with honors in Chemistry provides students with an opportunity to undertake an indepen-
dent research project under the supervision of a faculty member, and to report on the nature of the work in
two short oral presentations and in a written thesis.
Chemistry majors who are candidates for the degree with honors take the following in addition to a
major outlined above:
Chemistry 493-W31-494 Senior Research and Thesis
The principal considerations in admitting a student to a program of independent research are mastery of
fundamental materials and skills, ability to pursue independent study successfully, and demonstrated stu-
dent interest and motivation. In addition, to enroll in these courses leading to a degree with honors, a stu-
Chemistry
­ 106 ­
dent must have at least a B- average in all chemistry courses or the permission of the chair. At the end of the
first semester of the senior year, the department reviews the student's progress and determines whether the
student is a candidate for a degree with honors. The designation of a degree with honors in Chemistry or a
degree with highest honors in Chemistry is based primarily on a departmental evaluation of the accom-
plishments in these courses and on the quality of the thesis. Completion of the research project in a satisfac-
tory manner and preparation of a well-written thesis usually results in a degree with honors. In cases where
a student has demonstrated unusual commitment and initiative resulting in an outstanding thesis based on
original results, combined with a strong record in all of his or her chemistry courses, the department may
elect to award a degree with highest honors in Chemistry.
EXCHANGE AND TRANSFER STUDENTS
Students from other institutions wishing to register for courses in chemistry involving college-level pre-
requisites should do so in person with a member of the Chemistry Department. Registration should take
place by appointment during the spring semester prior to the academic year in which courses are to be
taken. Students are requested to have with them transcripts of the relevant previous college work.
COURSES FOR NON-MAJORS WITH NO PREREQUISITES
Students with principal interests outside of the sciences may extend a secondary school foundation in
chemistry by electing a basic two-semester introductory course of a general nature or they may elect se-
mester courses designed for non-majors. All courses in chemistry satisfy the divisional distribution require-
ment.
STUDY ABROAD
Students who wish to complete a chemistry major (or chemistry requirements for pre-medical
study) as well as to study abroad during their junior year are encouraged to begin taking chemistry
in their first semester at Williams, and should consult with members of the department as early as
possible.

CHEM 115(S) AIDS: The Disease and Search for a Cure
Since the discovery of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) in 1983, modern techniques of molecular
biology have revealed much about its structure and life cycle. The intensity of the scientific investigation directed
at HIV-1 is unprecedented in history. We now know more about this virus than any other known pathogen. How-
ever, the early optimism concerning the prospects for an effective AIDS vaccine has now waned and HIV strains
that are resistant to drug therapies are common. We are now nearly three decades into the AIDS pandemic and
the World Health Organization estimates that there are more than 40 million HIV-infected persons worldwide.
After an introduction to chemical structure, we examine the molecular biology of the HIV virus, the molecular
targets of anti-HIV drugs, and the prospects for a cure. We discuss the origin, epidemiology and modes of trans-
mission of HIV-1 and HIV-2, and look at how HIV-1 interacts with the human immune system. We also discuss
both old and new methods of vaccine development and the prospects for making an effective AIDS vaccine.
This course is designed for the non-science major who does not intend to pursue a career in the natural sciences.
Format: lecture, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on problem sets, a midterm, quizzes, a final
exam, and class participation.
No prerequisites. No enrollment limit (expected: 50).

CHEM 262T(S) Applying the Scientific Method to Archaeology and Paleoanthropology (Same as
Anthropology 262T) (W)
How do we `know' early hominids migrated from Africa to Europe? What's the origin of Grecian pottery
glazes? Archaeological studies of human environmental impact include materials as recent as nineteenth century
glass, or as ancient as hundred-thousand year old stone tools. Paleoanthropology, the study of early humans,
covers materials that are millions of years old. Natural science can answer many questions, not just how old an
object is, but also where, how and sometimes why an object was made. These answers in turn tell us about
patterns of human development and settlement, and also help us distinguish forgeries from genuine artifacts.
Understanding when we do not know an answer is also important. This tutorial will introduce science students to
interesting applications, and introduce students from anthropology, art history, or just possessing general
curiosity to the methods and limits of `scientific analysis'. Given the wide scope of this field, students will decide
some of the topics. Papers will be thoroughly edited for style, grammar and syntax, as well as the quality of
argument. Students will improve their writing by integrating into successive papers the editorial comments they
receive and also by editing the writing of their tutorial partners.
Format: tutorial. Evaluation will be based on five 5- to 6-page papers.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Preference given to sophomores.

lems of chemical interest such as chemical bonding, chemical reactivity, and molecular spectroscopy. Emphasis
is placed upon developing an understanding of the quantum mechanical basis for classical chemical concepts and
introducing students to current research applications. The laboratory provides an opportunity to utilize quantum
mechanics in the interpretation of optical and magnetic resonance spectroscopy measured on the modern instru-
ments available in the department. Several seminar sessionsgivethestudent direct experience with computation-
al techniques in modern quantum chemistry.
Format: tutorial, one hour per week; laboratory, four hours per week. Evaluation will be based on problem sets,
laboratory work, and tutorial work.
Prerequisites: Chemistry 361 or equivalent background in Physics. No enrollment limit (expected: 5).

The course offerings in Classics enable students to explore the ancient Greek, Roman, and Greco-Ro-
man worlds from various perspectives: art, archaeology, philosophy, religion, and especially literature and
history. Courses are of two types: language (Greek and Latin) and translation (Classical Civilization). The
100-level language courses are intensive introductions to Greek and Latin grammar; the 200-level lan-
guage courses combine comprehensive grammar review with readings from Greek or Latin texts of pivotal
historical periods; the 400-level language courses explore in depth selected authors or topics and the meth-
ods of analysis appropriate to each of them. Courses in which texts are read in translation provide both
introductory surveys and opportunities for more specialized study of the ancient Greco-Roman world from
earliest historical times through late antiquity.
MAJOR
Majors and prospective majors are encouraged to consult with the department's faculty to ensure a well-
balanced and comprehensive selection of Classics courses appropriate to their individual interests. A
course or courses in ancient history are strongly recommended. Majors may also benefit from advice on
courses offered in other departments which would complement their particular interests in Classics. A
reading knowledge of French, German, and Italian is useful for any study in Classics and is required in at
least two of these modern languages by graduate programs in classics, ancient history, classical art and
archaeology, and medieval studies.
The department offers two routes to the major: Classics and Classical Civilization.
Classics: (1) Six courses in Greek and/or Latin, with at least two 400-level courses in one language;
(2) Three additional courses, elected from the offerings in Greek, Latin, or Classical Civilization or
from approved courses in other departments.
Classical Civilization: (1) Either Classics 101, 102, 105, or 224, and either Classics 222, 223, or
323; (2) Three additional courses from the offerings in Classical Civilization or from approved
courses in other departments. (3) Three courses in Greek or Latin with at least one at the 400 level, or
four courses in Latin at any level. (4) A senior independent study is normally required to complete the
Classical Civilization major. Several of the courses elected, including the independent study, should
relate to each other in such a way as to reflect a concentration on a particular genre, period, or problem
of Greek and Roman civilization, including topics in ancient art and archaeology, religion in the Gre-
co-Roman world, and ancient philosophy.
Classics
­ 112 ­
In addition to the courses in Classical Civilization, appropriate courses from other departments or from
approved study abroad programs may be elected for the major. Examples of such courses, which may vary
from year to year, are ArtH 412 (Monsters and Narrative: Greek Architectural Sculpture), ArtH 511 (Dio-
nysos in Greek Art, Poetry, and Ritual), Political Science/Philosophy 231 (Ancient Political Theory), and
appropriate courses at the Intercollegiate Center for Classical Studies in Rome or at another approved over-
seas program.
Senior Colloquium: In lieu of a semester-long major seminar, majors will participate in the Senior Col-
loquium, a student-faculty discussion group that meets several times each semester during the senior year.
Each meeting features a short presentation by a senior major followed by discussion, all in an informal
setting.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN CLASSICS
Students who wish to be considered for the degree with honors will normally present a thesis or pursue
appropriate independent study in the fall and winter study of their senior year. The thesis or independent
study offers students the opportunity to work in depth on a topic of their choosing and to apply and develop
the techniques and critical methods with which they have become acquainted during their regular course
work. It may also include relevant work with members of other departments. In order to write a thesis,
students normally must have a minimum GPA of 3.3 in their major courses and must submit a thesis pro-
posal before the end of the spring semester of their junior year that earns departmental approval. To be
awarded the degree with honors in Classics, the student is required to have taken a minimum of ten semes-
ter courses in the department (not including the thesis or independent study) and to have demonstrated
original or superior ability in studies in the field both through course work and through the thesis or equiva-
lent independent study.
COURSE NUMBERING SYSTEM
Language Courses: The numbering of courses through the 200 level reflects the prerequisites involved.
The only prerequisite for any 400-level course is Greek 201 or Latin 202, or equivalent language prepara-
tion. The numbering of the 400-level courses partially reflects the order in which they are offered over a
two-year period for Greek and a three-year period for Latin. It also indicates a good order in which to take
the 400-level courses but not an essential order, and individual students may enter the sequence at any
point. While not every student will take every course, the rotation of 400-level courses is arranged to permit
exposure, in a three- to four-year period, to most of the important periods and genres of classical studies.
Classical Civilization Courses: The numbering of these courses often suggests a recommended but
rarely necessary sequence of study within a given area of classical studies. Most of the translation courses
do not assume prior experience in Classics or a cross-listed field.
STUDY ABROAD
We strongly encourage Classics majors to study abroad in their junior year, at programs in Italy (espe-
cially the semester-length program at the Intercollegiate Center for Classical Studies in Rome), at programs
in Greece (especially the College Year in Athens, which students need only attend for one semester), and in
the Williams at Oxford Program. Our majors have also had excellent Classics experiences in other study-
abroad programs in Italy and Greece and at various universities in Europe and the United Kingdom. In
addition, we encourage students to take advantage of opportunities available in the summer: study abroad
programs in Italy and Greece, archaeological digs, or even carefully planned individual travel to sites in
Greece, Italy or other areas of the ancient Greco-Roman world. When the college cannot do so, the depart-
ment may be able to provide some financial support for summer study abroad. So that students may learn
more about all these opportunities, as well as how best to prepare for them, the department holds open
meetings twice each year. The department's faculty are always available to advise students, the chair has
materials to share, and students can visit the department's website for information and links to helpful inter-
net sites.
CLASSICAL CIVILIZATION
CLAS 101(S) The Trojan War (Same as Comparative Literature 107) (W)
"The Trojan War" may or may not have taken place near the end of the Bronze Age (c1100), but it certainly
provided poets, visual artists, historians, philosophers, and many others in archaic and classical Greece (750-320)
with a rich discourse in which to engage questions about gender, exchange, desire, loss, and remembrance, and
about friendship, marriage, family, army, city-state and religious cult. This discourse of "The Trojan War"
attained a remarkable coherence yet also thrived on substantial variations and changes over the 300-400 years of
Greek literature we will explore, a dynamic of change and continuity that has persisted through the more than
two millenia of subsequent Greek, Roman, Western, and non-Western participation in this discourse. More than
half the course will be devoted to the Homeric Iliad and Odyssey, after which we will read brief selections from
lyric poetry (e.g. Sappho of Lesbos) and then several tragedies (e.g. Aeschylus' Oresteia, Sophocles' Ajax, and
Euripides' Trojan Women). Depending on time and on the particular interests of the class, we may briefly
consider a few short selections from other ancient Greek and Roman authors and/or one or two modern poets.
We will also watch several films, e.g. Troy, Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?, Gods and Monsters, Fight Club, In the
Bedroom, Grand Illusion, Zorba the Greek.
Format: discussion with short lectures. Evaluation will be based on a series of short papers involving close
textual analysis, two 5-page papers, and contributions to class discussion.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference given to first-year students and sophomores,

CLAS 105(F) The Ancient Novel (Same as Comparative Literature 113)
The "rise of the novel" is often linked to the IndustrialRevolution, but a number of fictional prose narratives most
aptly described as novels were composed and widely read under the Roman empire. While the Roman novels of
Petronius (Satyrica or Satyricon) and Apuleius (Metamorphoses, or The Golden Ass) are better known today,
Greek romances recounting the tribulations of unfortunate young lovers, such as Longus' Daphnis and Chloe
and An Ethiopian Story by Heliodorus, enjoyed enormous popular success in their own time. In this course we
will read a good number (seven or so) of the ancient novels that are extant today. To situate these works in their
original cultural context, we will consider the historical evidence for their production, circulation, and readership.
We will also study these works as precursors of the modern novel, examining, for example, their concern or
disregard for realism, and their treatment of the grotesque, miraculous, and fantastic. We will give equal attention
to the relationship these novels bear to other ancient genres, such as satire, pastoral, epic, and "Lives," including
those of saints.
Format: Discussion, with occasional short lectures. Evaluation will be based on contributions to class, a midterm,
several short papers and one longer, final paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 25 (expected: 15-20). Preference will be given to majors and prospective
majors in Classics and Comparative Literature, and to sophomores and first-years.

GREEK
CLGR 101(F)-102(S) Introduction to Greek
This full-year, intensive course presents the fundamentals of Greek grammar, syntax, and vocabulary and intro-
duces students, in the second semester, to works of the classical period (usually Xenophon and Euripides).
This course is designed for students who are beginning Greek or have studied less than two years of Greek in
secondary school. Credit is granted for the first semester only if the second semester is taken as well. Students
with some previous experience in Greek may want to enroll in CLGR 102 only. (Consult the department.)
Format: recitation/discussion. Evaluation will be based on frequent quizzes, tests, and a final exam.
Enrollment limit: 15 (expected: 8-10).
Hour: 11:00-12:15 MWF First Semester: PORTER
11:00-12:15 MWF Second Semester: CHRISTENSEN
CLGR 201(F) Intermediate Greek
Reading of selections from Hesiod and from Plato, combined with grammar review. The primary goal of this
course is to develop fluency in reading Greek. We will also read the texts closely to explore important continui-
ties and changes in Greek culture between the archaic and classical periods. The emphasis will vary from year to
year, but possible subjects to be explored include: the education and socialization of the community's children
and young adults; religion and cult practices; the performative aspects of epic (and choral) poetry and of prose
genres like oratory and the philosophical dialogue; traditional oral poetry and storytelling and the growth of liter-
acy; the construction of woman, of man; the development of the classical polis.
Format: recitation/discussion. Evaluation will be based on classroom participation, quizzes, tests, and a final
exam.
Prerequisites: Greek 101-102 or two years of Greek in secondary school. Enrollment limit: 12 (expected: 5-10).

CLGR 404(S) Tragedy
Tragedy was a hybrid genre invented in sixth-fifth century Athens, where tragic performances in the city's
festival of the Greater Dionysia played a vital role in the democratic polis. This course will focus on reading in
Greek a complete tragedy of Sophokles or Euripides; we will also read in translation several other tragedies, a
satyr-play, and a comedy of Aristophanes. While focusing on questions of particular importance for the play we
are reading in Greek, we will also situate that play in a larger context by exploring, for instance: aspects of the
social and political situations in and for which tragedies were produced; the several performance genres out of
which tragedy was created; developments in the physical characteristics of the theater and in elements of staging
and performance; problems of representation particularly relevant to theatrical production and performance.
Format: Recitation/discussion. Evaluation will be based on contributions to class, several 1- to 2-page papers
involving close textual analysis, perhaps a mid-term exam, a final exam, and a final paper.
Prerequisites: Greek 201 or permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 12 (expected: 4-5).

CLGR 407(F) The Sophists
This course considers the nature of the sophistic movement and its impact on Athens and Athenian authors in the
second half of the fifth century B.C.E. We will devote the first half of the term to developing an understanding of
the movement through selected readings, both in Greek and in translation, from the extant fragments of Protago-
ras, Gorgias, Antiphon, and other sophistic thinkers; from those dialogues of Plato (e.g., Protagoras,Symposium,
Gorgias) and Xenophon (e.g., Memorabilia) that focus on the sophists and their relationship to Socrates; and
from Thucydides ("Melian Dialogue") and Euripides (e.g., Hecuba), both of whom were profoundly influenced
by the sophists. During the second half of the course we will read, in Greek and in its entirety, Aristophanes'
Clouds, with a focus on trying to understand both the play itself and the complex relationship of its playwright to
Classics
­ 115 ­
Socrates and the sophists. We will also read, in translation, one or two other plays of Aristophanes (e.g., Birds,
Frogs).
Format: seminar, with classes devoted primarily to translation and discussion of the texts we are reading. Evalua-
tion will be based on 75-minute midterm and final exams consisting primarily of translation of assigned Greek
texts, and above all on participation in class, presentation of oral reports, and a substantial final paper.
Prerequisites: Greek 202 or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 7).
Hour: 2:35-3:50 MR PORTER
LATIN
CLLA 101(F)-102(S) Introduction to Latin
This is a full-year course on the fundamentals of the Latin language. The first semester and part of the second
emphasize learning basic grammar; the rest of the second semester is devoted to reading selections from Latin
poetry (e.g., Vergil's Aeneid and some Medieval Latin poetry, e.g., the Carmina Burana) and from Latin prose
(e.g., Pliny's Letters and/or the Vulgate Bible). This course is designed for the student with no previous prepara-
tion in Latin or who has had only a little Latin and wishes a refresher. Credit is granted for the first semester only
if the second semester is taken as well. Students with some previous experience in Latin may want to enroll in
CLLA 102 only: consult the department.
Format: recitation/discussion. Evaluation will be based on frequent quizzes, tests, classroom exercises, and a fi-
nal exam.
Enrollment limit: 18 (expected: 10-12).
Hour: 9:00-9:50 MWF First Semester: HOPPIN
10:00-10:50 MWF Second Semester: WILCOX
CLLA 201(F) Intermediate Latin I: The Late Republic
Reading of selections from Latin prose and poetry, normally from a speech or letters by Cicero and from the
poetry of Catullus. This course includes a comprehensive review of Latin grammar and aims primarily at devel-
oping fluency in reading Latin. At the same time it acquaints students with one of the most turbulent and impor-
tant periods in Roman history and attends to the development of their interpretative and analytic skills.
Format: recitation/discussion. Evaluation will be based on classroom performance, quizzes, a midterm, and a
final exam. Occasional oral presentations or short essays may be required as well.
Prerequisites: Latin 101-102 or 3-4 years of Latin in secondary school: consult the department. Enrollment limit:
12 (expected: 6-10).
Hour: 10:00-10:50 MWF WILCOX
CLLA 202(S) Intermediate Latin II: The Early Empire
Like Latin 201, this course pairs poetry and prose and aims to develop students' fluency in reading Latin while
acquainting them with a vitally important period in Roman history. More than Latin 201, however, this course
attends to the development of students' analytic and interpretive skills. We will read selections from Ovid's
Metamorphoses and from such early imperial prose as Livy's account of the early republic or Petronius' Satyri-
con.
Format: recitation/discussion. Evaluation will be based on preparation for each class, classroom performance,
quizzes, a midterm and a final exam. Several oral presentations and short essays may be required as well.
Prerequisites: Latin 201 or permission of instructor; some first-year students may be advised to enroll in Latin
202 rather than Latin 201: consult the department. Enrollment limit: 12 (expected: 6-10).

CLLA 403(F) The Invention of Love: Catullus and the Roman Elegists
This course will explore the development of Latin love poetry in the first century BCE. Beginning with Catullus,
we will examine the influence of Greek lyric poetry on the evolution of the genre as well as Roman attitudes
toward love exhibited in other literature of the Late Republic. We will then turn to the full development of the
elegiac form in the love poems of Propertius, Tibullus, and Sulpicia. Finally, we will explore the transformation
of the genre in Ovid's Amores. The goal throughout is to investigate the conventions, innovations, and problems
of expressing personal desire and longing amid the social and political upheaval of the transition from Republic
to Principate.
Format: recitation/discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, a midterm exam, a final paper, and
a final exam.

CLLA 408(S) Roman Comedy
Roman comedy flourished only briefly, between the second and third Punic Wars, but its cultural-historical
importance is undeniable. In these fabulae palliatae, Latin comedies staged in Greek costume and featuring
ostensibly Greek characters, Roman attitudes are questioned and mocked, but ultimately reasserted. We will read
the Menaechmi of Plautus and the Adelphoe of Terence, two plays that burlesque the stereotypical relationships
between fathers, brothers, sons, and slaves. We will also consider selections from Cato the Elder, Cicero's letters,
and other primary and secondary texts that shed additional light on Roman familial relationships and their place
in republican society.
Format: discussion/recitation. Evaluation will be based on class participation, several short papers, a midterm and

COGNITIVE SCIENCE (Div. II)
Chair, Associate Professor JOSEPH CRUZ
Advisory Committee: Professors: DANYLUK, KIRBY, H. WILLIAMS. Associate Professors:
CRUZ, ZAKI. Visiting Assistant Professor: SUNDERMEIER.
Cognitive science is concerned with how humans, non-human animals, and computers acquire, repre-
sent, manipulate, and use information. As an interdisciplinary field it combines research and theory from
computer science (e.g., artificial intelligence), cognitive psychology, philosophy, linguistics, and neurosci-
ence, and to some extent evolutionary biology, math, and anthropology. Complex issues of cognition are
not easily addressed using traditional intra-disciplinary tools. Cognitive researchers in any discipline typi-
cally employ a collection of analytic and modeling tools from across traditional disciplinary boundaries.
Thus, the methods and research agenda of cognitive science are broader than those of any of the fields that
have traditionally contributed to cognitive science. The Cognitive Science Program is designed to provide
students with the broad interdisciplinary foundation needed to approach issues of cognition.
THE CONCENTRATION
The concentration in Cognitive Science consists of six courses, including an introductory course, four
electives, and a senior research project.
Minds, Brains, and Intelligent Behavior (COGS 222) is the entry point into the concentration, and
provides an interdisciplinary perspective on issues of cognition. Ideally, it should be taken before the end of
the sophomore year. Emphasizing the highly interdisciplinary nature of the field, the four electives must be
distributed over at least three course prefixes. In the fall of the senior year, concentrators will conduct inter-
disciplinary Research in Cognitive Science (COGS 493), supervised by members of the advisory commit-
tee from at least two departments.
REQUIRED COURSES
Cognitive Science 222 Minds, Brains, and Intelligent Behavior: An Introduction to Cognitive Science

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN COGNITIVE SCIENCE
Formal admission to candidacy for honors will occur at the end of the fall semester of the senior year
and will be based on promising performance in COGS 493. This program will consist of COGS
W31-494(S), and will be supervised by members of the advisory committee from at least two departments.
Presentation of a thesis, however, should not be interpreted as a guarantee of a degree with honors.
STUDY ABROAD
Students who wish to discuss plans for study abroad are invited to meet with any member of the Cogni-
tive Science advisory committee.
COGS 222(S) Minds, Brains, and Intelligent Behavior: An Introduction to Cognitive Science (Same
as INTR 222, Philosophy 222 and Psychology 222) (Q)
This course will emphasize interdisciplinary approaches to the study of intelligent systems, both natural and arti-
ficial. Cognitive science synthesizes research from cognitive psychology, computer science, linguistics, neuro-
science, and contemporary philosophy. Special attention will be given to the philosophical foundations of cogni-
tive science, information theory, symbolic and connectionist architectures, the neural basis of cognition, percep-
tion, learning and memory, language, action, reasoning, expert systems, and artificial intelligence.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: several short papers and self-paced weekly computer lab exercises.
Prerequisites: Psychology 101 or Philosophy 102 or Computer Science 134 or permission of instructors. Back-
ground in more than one of these is recommended. Enrollment limit: 25 (expected: 25). Preference given to first-

COMPARATIVE LITERATURE (Div. I)
Chair, Professor GAIL M. NEWMAN
Professors: CASSIDAY, DRUXES, GOLDSTEIN, B. KIEFFER, KLEINER*, LIMON**, NEW-

Students motivated by a desire to study literature in the broadest terms, as well as those interested in
particular examples of literary comparison, will find an intellectual home in the Program in Comparative
Literature. The Program in Comparative Literature gives students the opportunity to develop their critical
faculties through the analysis of literature in its international and multicultural context. By crossing nation-
al, linguistic, historical, and disciplinary boundaries, students of Comparative Literature learn to read texts
for the ways they make meaning, the assumptions that underlie that meaning, and the aesthetic elements
evinced in the making. Students of Comparative Literature are encouraged to examine the widest possible
range of literary communication, including the metamorphosis of genres, forms, and themes.
Whereas specific literature programs allow the student to trace the development of one literature in a
particular culture over a period of time, Comparative Literature juxtaposes the writings of different cultures
and epochs in a variety of ways. The rubrics of the Program's core courses--Literary Genres, Literary
Movements, Literature and Theory, and Cultural Studies--introduce the student to a variety of critical
methods. Because interpretive methods from other disciplines play a crucial role in investigating litera-
ture's larger context, the Program offers courses intended for students in all divisions of the college and of
all interests. These include courses that introduce students to the comparative study of world literature and
courses designed to enhance any foreign language major in the Williams curriculum. In addition, the En-
glish Department allows students to count one course with a COMP prefix as an elective within the English
major.
Comparative Literature

The Program supports two distinct majors in Comparative Literature and Literary Studies. The major in
Comparative Literature requires advanced work in at least one language other than English and is strongly
recommended for students contemplating graduate study in the discipline. Both majors provide a strong
basis for any career demanding analytical, interpretive, and evaluative skills and allow the student, within a
framework of general requirements, to create a program of study primarily shaped by the student's own
interests.
MAJORS
Comparative Literature
The Comparative Literature major combines the focused study of a single national-language literature
with a wide-ranging exploration of literary forms across national, linguistic, and historical boundaries.
Each student declaring the major must select a single foreign language as his or her specialty, although the
serious study of literature in foreign languages other than the student's specialty is strongly encouraged.
The languages currently available are French, German, Ancient Greek, Latin, Russian, and Spanish. Each
student will also be paired with a faculty advisor with whom the student will meet each semester to discuss
how best to fulfill the requirements for the major.
Eleven courses are required for the major:
Comparative Literature 111 The Nature of Narrative (Literary Genres)
Any three comparative literature core courses. A core course is any course that meets the following
criteria: a) it must treat primarily literature and b) it must be genuinely comparative across cultures
and/or primarily theoretical. The three core courses may be chosen from the offerings of the Program
in Comparative Literature (frequently offered examples include Comparative Literature 232, European
Modernism, and Comparative Literature 340, Literature and Psychoanalysis) or from the offerings of
other departments and programs, including the foreign language programs and English, Religion, Afri-
cana Studies, and Latino/Latina Studies.
Three literature courses in the student's specialty language, in which texts are read in the original. At
least one of the three must be above the 200-level.
Three courses in which most of the course work concerns literature other than that of the student's
specialty language or literary theory. These courses may be selected from Comparative Literature of-
ferings or from other departments and must be approved by the student's major advisor. Only one may
be in English or American literature. Among the offerings of other departments that are possible, the
following employ readings in English translation and are especially appropriate to the major:
English 117, 126, 202, 216, 219, 220, 341, 342, 345, 361, 371, 372
Linguistics 101, 121
Religion 210, 401
Theatre 210, 211, 330, 331
Comparative Literature 402 Senior Seminar (variable topics)
Students who are considering a major in Comparative Literature should aim to acquire intermediate-
level proficiency in their specialty language by the end of the sophomore year. They should also complete
core course requirements by the end of their junior year. Students pursuing the Comparative Literature
major are strongly encouraged to study abroad during their junior year and may receive major credit for up
to 4 courses taken during study abroad. At least three courses towards the major must be at the 300 level or
above. Students are expected to take the version of 402 offered in their senior year, even if they have pre-
viously taken 402.
Literary Studies
The Literary Studies major allows for a wide-ranging exploration of literary forms across national, lin-
guistic, and historical boundaries. Unlike the major in Comparative Literature, the Literary Studies major
does not require the student to choose a specialty language, although the serious study of literature in one or
more foreign languages is strongly encouraged. Each student will be paired with a faculty advisor, with
whom the student will meet each semester to discuss how best to fulfill the requirements for the major.
Eleven courses are required for the major:
Comparative Literature 111 The Nature of Narrative (Literary Genres)
Any four comparative literature core courses. A core course is any course that meets the following
criteria: a) it must treat primarily literature and b) it must be genuinely comparative across cultures
and/or primarily theoretical. The three core courses may be chosen from the offerings of the Program
in Comparative Literature (frequently offered examples include Comparative Literature 232, European
Modernism, and Comparative Literature 340, Literature and Psychoanalysis) or from the offerings of
other departments and programs, including the foreign language programs and English, Religion, Afri-
cana Studies, and Latino/Latina Studies.
Five courses devoted to literature or literary theory that cover at least three different national/cultural tradi-
tions. The courses may be selected from Comparative Literature offerings or from other departments and
must be approved by the student's major advisor. Of the courses taken outside of the Program in Compara-
tive Literature, no more than two may have the same course prefix. Students are strongly encouraged to
Comparative Literature
­ 119 ­
include courses in a foreign language among these five. Among the offerings of other departments that are
possible, the following employ readings in English translation and are especially appropriate to the major:
English 117, 126, 202, 216, 219, 220, 341, 342, 345, 372
Linguistics 101, 121
Religion 210, 401T
Theatre 210, 211, 330, 331
Comparative Literature 402 Senior Seminar (variable topics)
Students who are considering a major in Literary Studies should aim to complete core course require-
ments by the end of their sophomore year. Students who choose to study abroad during their junior year
may receive major credit for up to 4 courses taken during study abroad. At least three courses towards the
major must be at the 300 level or above. Students are expected to take the version of 402 offered in their
senior year, even if they have previously taken 402.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN COMPARATIVE LITERATURE OR LITERARY STUDIES
Prerequisites
Honors candidates in Comparative Literature or Literary Studies are required to have maintained a GPA
of 3.5 in the major to qualify for submitting a thesis proposal. In addition, candidates must demonstrate a
strong interest in a specific topic for which an appropriate faculty advisor will be available in the senior
year.
Timing
Students wishing to pursue a thesis in Comparative Literature or Literary Studies are strongly urged to
secure an advisor by the end of the week after Spring Break in their junior year. By May 15th of their junior
year, candidates must submit to the Program Advisory Committee a one- to two-page proposal and a pre-
liminary bibliography. The Advisory Committee will inform candidates by June 1 whether they may pro-
ceed with the thesis and advise them about any changes that should be made in the focus or scope of the
project. The summer before the senior year will be spent compiling a more detailed bibliography and pre-
paring for the process of writing the thesis.
In their senior year, candidates will devote two semesters and the winter study period to their theses
(493-W31-494). By the end of the Fall semester, students will normally have undertaken substantial re-
search and produced the draft of at least the first half of the project. At this point students should also have a
clear sense of the work remaining for completion of the thesis. In the course of the Fall semester, students
will also have chosen and met with a second reader for the project, who will provide additional guidance
and read the final thesis. By the end of Winter Study, students should have completed a draft of the entire
project. At that time, the Comparative Literature Advisory Committee, together with the advisor, will de-
termine whether the project may continue as an Honors Thesis, or whether its first portions (COMP
493-W) will be graded as Independent Studies.
The second semester of independent thesis work will be spent revising as necessary. The completed
thesis in its final form will be due one week before the last day of classes. At the end of the Spring term, the
student will make a public presentation of the final project, to which members of the Advisory Committee
will be specially invited.
Characteristics of the Thesis, Evaluation, and Major Credit
The topic of the thesis must be comparative and/or theoretical. It is also possible to write a thesis that
consists of an original translation of a significant text or texts; in this case, a theoretical apparatus must
accompany the translation. The complete thesis must be at least 50 and at most 75 pages in length, exclud-
ing the bibliography.
The advisor will assign the grades for the thesis courses (COMP 493-W-494); the Advisory Committee
will determine whether a candidate will receive Honors, Highest Honors, or no honors.
For students who pursue an honors thesis, the total number of courses required for the major-including
the thesis course (COMP 493-W-494)-is 12, i.e., one of the thesis courses may substitute for one elective.
STUDY ABROAD
The Program in Comparative Literature strongly urges its students to study abroad. Students who have
Comparative Literature as a major should seriously consider study abroad in a country where their special-
ty language is spoken; they will likely be able to complete some of the specialty language courses required
for the major during study abroad. Literary Studies students can also benefit from study abroad; literature
courses from abroad are often candidates for credit as major electives.

To study poetry in a comparative light is to travel inside cultures and languages in ways that connect the universal
and the particular, the personal and the political, the traditional and the groundbreaking. This course provides the
opportunity to read poetry from a wide range of traditions, eras, and styles. We will study the poets' own mission,
the culture in which they produced their verse, their language of composition, and the poetic traditions of their
language. Questions of identity, beauty, history, place, technique, and creativity will go hand in hand with
explorations of individual themes in each poet's work. Our comparative focus will also help us formulate useful
questions about the puzzling act of reading poetry in translation. We will also perform translation exercises
according to student skills. Our syllabus will include the study of certain key examples from Persian, Arabic,
Spanish, French, Russian, Polish, Greek, and English traditions, with possible ventures into other languages.
Poets studied will include Omar Khayyam, Hafez, Rumi, Saint John of the Cross, Lorca, Akhmatova,
Szymborska, Adonis, Sappho, Cavafy, Carson, Neruda, Senghor, to name some. Selections from music and
theory will lend support to our investigations.
Conducted in English.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on meaningfulparticipation, short papers, and one final research paper
of 15 pages.
Prerequisites: any 200-level literature course at Williams, or permission of the instructor. No enrollment limit
(expected: 10). Preference given to majors in Comparative Literature and students with knowledge of a foreign
language.

COMPUTER SCIENCE (Div. III)
Chair, Professor ANDREA DANYLUK
Professors: BAILEY, DANYLUK, LENHART, MURTAGH. Assistant Professors: FREUND,
HEERINGA, MCGUIRE, TERESCO.
Computers play an enormously important role in our society. General-purpose computers are used
widely in business and industry and are found in an increasing number of homes. Special-purpose comput-
ers are found in everything from automobile engines to microwave ovens. Understanding and exploiting
the great potential of computers is the goal of research in computer science. Among the many fascinating
research projects in computer science today are investigations of: ways to focus more computational power
on a problem through the simultaneous use of many processors in parallel; revolutionary computer lan-
guages designed to simplify the process of constructing complex programs for computers; the use of com-
puter-generated graphic images in the arts and as a tool for visualization in the natural sciences; and the use
of digital methods in global communications. The Computer Science Department at Williams seeks to
provide students with an understanding of the principles underlying computer science that will enable
them to understand and participate in these exciting developments.
The department recognizes that students' interests in computer science will vary widely. The depart-
ment attempts to meet these varying interests through: (1) its major; (2) a selection of courses intended
primarily for those who are interested in a brief introduction to computer science or who seek to develop
some specific expertise in computing for application in some other discipline; and (3) recommendations
for possible sequences of courses for the non-major who wants a more extensive introduction to computer
science. These offerings are discussed in detail below.
MAJOR
The goal of the major is to provide an understanding of algorithmic problem solving as well as the con-
ceptual organization of computers and complex programs running on them. Emphasis is placed on the
fundamental principles of computer science, building upon the mathematical and theoretical ideas under-
lying these principles. The introductory and core courses build a broad and solid base for understanding
computer science. The more advanced courses allow students to sample a variety of specialized areas of
computer science including graphics, artificial intelligence, computer networks, software engineering,
compiler design, and operating systems. Independent study and honors work provide opportunities for stu-
dents to study and conduct research on topics of special interest.
The major in Computer Science equips students to take advantage of awide variety of career opportuni-
ties. Thus the major can be used as preparation for a career in computing, for graduate school, or simply to
provide an in-depth study of computer science for the student whosefuturecareerwillonlytangentiallybe
related to computer science.
MAJOR REQUIREMENTS
Required Courses in Computer Science
A minimum of 8 courses is required in Computer Science, including the following:
Introductory Courses
Computer Science 134 Digital Computation and Communication
Computer Science 136 Data Structures and Advanced Programming
Core Courses
Computer Science 237 Computer Organization
Computer Science 256 Algorithm Design and Analysis
Computer Science 334 Principles of Programming Languages
Computer Science 361 Theory of Computation
Electives
Two or more electives (bringing the total number of Computer Science courses to at least 8) chosen
from 300- or 400-level courses in Computer Science. At least one of these must be a course designated
as a PROJECT COURSE. Computer Science courses with 9 as the middle digit (reading, research, and
thesis courses) will normally not be used to satisfy the elective requirements. Students may petition the
department to waive this restriction with good reason.
Required Courses in Mathematics
Mathematics 251 Discrete Mathematics
and any other Mathematics course at the 200-level or higher
Students considering pursuing a major in Computer Science are urged to take Computer Science 134
and to begin satisfying their mathematics requirements early. Note in particular that Discrete Mathematics
covers material complementing that in the introductory courses (Computer Science 134 and 136) and is a
prerequisite for many advanced courses.
Students who take Computer Science 105, 106, 108 or 109 may use that course as one of the two elec-
tives required for the major in Computer Science. Those who count Computer Science 109 toward the
major must select an elective different from Computer Science 371 (Computer Graphics) for their project
course. Similarly, students who count Computer Science 108 as an elective cannot select Computer Sci-
Computer Science
­ 124 ­
ence 373 as their second elective, Computer Science 315 may not be used as a second elective in conjunc-
tion with Computer Science 106 and Computer Science 336T may not be used as a second elective in
conjunction with Computer Science 105. Computer Science 105, 106, 108, 109, and 134 are not open to
students who have taken a Computer Science course numbered 136 or higher.
To be eligible for admission to the major, a student must normally have completed Computer Science
136 as well as Discrete Mathematics by the end of the sophomore year. A second Mathematics course at
the 200-level or higher must be completed by the end of the junior year. Students are urged to have com-
pleted two of the four core courses (Computer Science 237, 256, 334, and 361) by the end of the sopho-
more year and must normally have completed at least three out of the four core courses by the end of the
junior year.
Satisfactory participation is required in the Computer Science Colloquium by all senior majors. With the
advance permission of the department, two appropriate mathematics courses numbered 240 or above may
be substituted for one Computer Science elective. Other variations in the required courses, adapting the
requirements to the special needs and interests of the individual student, may be arranged in consultation
with the department.
Potential majors are strongly encouraged to look at the latest copy of the Informal Guide to Courses in
Computer Science, which can be obtained on the World Wide Web at http://www.cs.williams.edu. This
document contains much more information on the major, including suggested patterns of course selection
and advice on courses relevant to different student goals.
LABORATORY FACILITIES
The Computer Science Department maintains two departmental computer laboratories for students tak-
ing Computer Science courses. The workstations in these laboratories also support student and faculty re-
search in computer science.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE
The degree with honors in Computer Science is awarded to a student who has demonstrated outstanding
intellectual achievement in a program of study which extends beyond the requirements of the regular ma-
jor. The principal considerations in recommending a student for the degree with honors will be: mastery of
core material, ability to pursue independent study of computer science, originality in methods of investiga-
tion, and creativity in research. Honors study is highly recommended for those students with strong aca-
demic records in computer science who wish to attend graduate school, pursue high-level industrial posi-
tions in computing, or who would simply like to experience research in computer science.
Prospective honors students are urged to consult with their departmental advisor at the time of registra-
tion in the spring of the sophomore or at the beginning of the junior year to arrange a program of study that
could lead to the degree with honors. Such a program normally consists of Computer Science 493 and 494
and a WSP of independent research under the guidance of a Computer Science faculty member, culminat-
ing in a thesis which is judged acceptable by the department. The program produces a significant piece of
written work. The written work often includes a major computer program, depending on the nature of the
honors work. All honors candidates are required to give an oral presentation of their work in the Computer
Science Colloquium in early spring semester.
Students considering honors work should obtain permission from the department before registering in
the fall of the senior year. Formal admission to candidacy occurs at the beginning of the spring semester of
the senior year and is based on promising performance in the fall semester and winter study units of honors
work. Recommendations for the degree with honors will be made for outstanding performance in the three
honors courses. Highest honors will be recommended for students who have displayed exceptional ability,
achievement, or originality.
INTRODUCTORY COURSES
The department offers a choice of five introductory courses--Computer Science 105: Understanding
the Web: Technologies and Techniques, Computer Science 106: Life as an Algorithm, Computer Science
108: Artificial Intelligence: Image and Reality, Computer Science 109: The Art and Science of Computer
Graphics, and Computer Science 134: Digital Computation and Communication.
Computer Science 134 provides an introduction to computer science with a focus on developing com-
puter programming skills. These skills are essential to most upper-level courses in the department. As a
result, Computer Science 134 together with Computer Science 136 are required as a prerequisite to most
advanced courses in the department. Those students intending to take several Computer Science courses
are urged to take Computer Science 134 early.
Those students interested in learning more about important new ideas and developments in Computer
Science, but not necessarily interested in developing extensive programming skills, should consider Com-
puter Science 105: Understanding the Web: Technologies and Techniques, Computer Science 106: Life as
an Algorithm, Computer Science 108: Artificial Intelligence: Image and Reality, or Computer Science 109:
The Art and Science of Computer Graphics. Computer Science 105 explores the computing technology
that underlies the internet. Computer Science 106 explores models and theories shared between computer
science and biology. Computer Science 108 discusses the techniques used to construct computer systems
that exhibit intelligent behavior from learning to planning and problem solving. Computer Science 109
introduces students to the techniques of computer graphics used for the creation of artistic images. In addi-
tion, all four of these courses provide an introduction to the techniques of computer programming.
Computer Science
­ 125 ­
Although none of our introductory courses assume prior programming skills, some students planning to
take Computer Science 134 who have no prior programming experience may find it useful to gain some
programming experience together with a broader understanding of our field by taking one of the depart-
ment's other introductory courses before enrolling in Computer Science 134. On the other hand, students
with significant programming experience should consider electing Computer Science 136 (see "Advanced
Placement" below). Students in either of these categories are encouraged to contact a member of the de-
partment for guidance in selecting a first course.
STUDY ABROAD
Study abroad can be a wonderful experience. Students who hope to take computer science courses
while abroad should discuss their plans in advance with the chair of the department. Students who plan to
study away but do not expect to take courses toward the major should work with the department to create a
plan to ensure that they will be able to complete the major. While study abroad is generally not an impedi-
ment to completing the major, students should be aware that certain computer science courses must be
taken in a particular sequence and that not all courses are offered every semester (or every year). Students
who wish to discuss their plans are invited to meet with any of the faculty in Computer Science.
ADVANCED PLACEMENT
Students with an extensive background in computer science are urged to take the Advanced Placement
Examination in Computer Science. A score of 4 or better on the exam is normally required for advanced
placement in Computer Science 136.
Students who wish to be placed in Computer Science 136 but who have not taken the Advanced Place-
ment Examination should consult with the department. Such students should have had a good course in
computer science using a structured language such as Java.
PLANS OF STUDY FOR NON-MAJORS
The faculty in Computer Science believes that students can substantially enrich their academic experi-
ence by completing a coherent plan of study in one or more disciplines outside of their majors. With this in
mind, we have attempted to provide students majoring in other departments with options in our depart-
ment's curriculum ranging fromtwo-coursesequences to collections of courses equivalent to what would
constitute a minor at institutions that recognize such a concentration. Students interested in designing such
a plan of study in any department should discuss their plans in detail with a member of the faculty. We
welcome such inquiries from students. To assist students making such plans, however, we include some
suggestions below.
Students seeking to develop an extensive knowledge of computer science without majoring in the de-
partment are encouraged to use the major requirements as a guide. In particular, the four core courses re-
quired of majors are intended to provide a broad knowledge of topics underlying all of computer science.
Students seeking a concentration in Computer Science are urged to complete at least two of these courses
followed by one of our upper-level electives. Such a program would typically require the completion of a
total of five computer science courses and one course in discrete mathematics.
There are several sequences of courses appropriate for those primarily interested in developing skills in
programming for use in other areas. For general programming, Computer Science 134 followed by Com-
puter Science 136 and 237 will provide students with a strong background in algorithm and data structure
design together with an understanding of issues of correctness and efficiency. Computer Science 223 pro-
vides valuable exposure to the techniques and tools needed for the development and maintenance of large
software systems. Students of the Bioinformatics program are encouraged to take Computer Science 106
and 134 at a minimum, and should consider Computer Science 136 and 256. The sequence of courses
Computer Science 109 and 134 would provide sufficient competence in computer graphics for many stu-
dents interested in applying such knowledge either in the arts or sciences. For students requiring more ex-
pertise in the techniques of computer graphics, Computer Science 136 and 371 could be added to form a
four-course sequence.

GENERAL REMARKS
Divisional Requirements
All Computer Science courses listed may be used to satisfy the Division III distribution requirement.
Alternate Year Courses
Computer Science 106, 108, 109, 315, 323, 336T, 337T, 338T, 371, 373, 374T, 432, and 434 are each
normally offered every other year. All other Computer Science courses are normally offered every year.
Course Numbering
The increase from 100, through 200 and 300, to 400 indicates in most instances an increasing level of
maturity in the subject that is expected of students. Within a series, numeric order does not indicate the
relative level of difficulty of courses. Rather, the middle digit of the course number (particularly in upper-
level courses) generally indicates the area of computer science covered by the course.
Course Descriptions
Brief descriptions of the courses in Computer Science can be found below. More detailed information
on the offerings in the department is available in the Informal Guide to Courses in Computer Science.

CSCI 106(F) Life as an Algorithm (Same as Biology 106) (Q)
Can computers reproduce? Can DNA compute? Can evolution give us hints on solving big problems? Is life's
blueprint inefficient? This course looks at the way computers are shaped by biological thinking, and the way that
biologists make use of computational theories. Topics range from artificial life to identification of genes to the
susceptibility of machines to viruses. Lectures investigate new and novel ways of thinking about computers and
biology. Labs experiment with parameters of problems of common interest to computer scientists and biologists.
Students will learn to use common programming tools to aid in the manipulation and analysis of basic biological
data.
Format: lecture/laboratory. Evaluation will be based on performance on problem sets, laboratory assignments,
and examinations.

CSCI 108(F) Artificial Intelligence: Image and Reality (Q)
Over 50 years ago, scientists began to envision a world where computers and humans could converse. In 1956
the field of "Artificial Intelligence" was officially born, and the work on "AI" began in earnest. Walking and
talking robots are still mostly the stuff of science fiction, but AI is close to making them reality. In this course, we
will explore the field of Artificial Intelligence. We will try to answer the question "what makes a machine intelli-
gent?" Among the systems we will explore in lecture will be game-playing systems, systems that learn from their
environments, and systems that create plans for complex tasks. Underlying all the topics addressed in this course
will be two fundamental issues: How can information be represented in a computer so that the machine is able to
make use of it? How can the system manipulate that information so that it is able to perform a task that requires
intelligence? This course will emphasize hands-on laboratory experience. Laboratory projects will focus on the
building and programming of simple robots.
Format: lecture/laboratory. Evaluation will be based on weekly laboratory programming assignments, four prob-
lem sets, short papers, and a final examination having similar format to the problem sets.
This course does not assume any programming experience, but assumes that the student is comfortable working
with a computer. This course is not open to students who have successfully completed a Computer Science
course numbered 136 or above. Enrollment limit: 18 (expected: 18). Preference given to first-year students and
sophomores.
Hour: 11:00-11:50 MWF Lab: 1:10-2:25 R DANYLUK
CSCI 109(S) The Art and Science of Computer Graphics (Q)
This course provides an opportunity to develop an understanding of the theoretical and practical concepts under-
lying 2- and 3-dimensional computer graphics. The course will emphasize hands-on studio/laboratory experi-
ence, with student work focused around completing a series of projects. Students will experiment with modeling,
color, lighting, perspective, and simple animation. As the course progresses, computer programming will be used
to control the complexity of the models and their interactions. Lectures, augmented by guided viewings of state-
of-the-art computer generated and enhanced images and animations, will be used to deepen understanding of the
studio experience.
Format: lecture/lab. Evaluation will be based on progress in the quality of project work. For the highly successful
student, this course may serve as an alternate to Mathematics 211 as a prerequisite for the upper division Com-
puter Graphics course, Computer Science 371. Fulfills the Quantitative Reasoning requirement.
This course is not open to students who have successfully completed a Computer Science course numbered 136
or above. No enrollment limit (expected: 35-40).

COURSES INTENDED FOR BOTH NON-MAJORS AND MAJORS
CSCI 134(F,S) Digital Computation and Communication (Q)
The personal computer, the Internet, DVDs, and HDTV are just a few examples of advances in digital comput-
ing and communication technology that have transformed the mechanism we use to process and communicate
information. This course explores the principles that underlie digital computation and communication. All digital
information processing systems are driven by precise rules or algorithms expressed in computer programming
languages. Students will develop an appreciation for the nature and limitations of such algorithms by exploring
abstract algorithms for complex processes and by learning the basics of computer programming in Java. Pro-
gramming topics covered will include objects, classes, methods, conditional and iterative control structures, and
simple data structures using arrays or lists. The representation of information in discrete, symbolic form is ulti-
Computer Science
­ 127 ­
mately what makes a system digital. We will examine digital techniques for representing information from the
encoding of 0's and 1's on an optical fiber to the compression techniques that made digital video possible, always
examining the tradeoffs involved in the design of such representation schemes.
Format: lecture/laboratory. Evaluation will be based on weekly programming assignments, written problem sets,
one test program, and midterm and final examinations.
Prerequisites: Mathematics 100/101/102 (or demonstrating proficiency in the Quantitative Studies diagnostic
test--see catalog under Mathematics). Previous programming experience is not required. Students with prior
experience with object-oriented programming should discuss appropriate course placement with members of the
department. No enrollment limit (expected: 18 per section).

CSCI 136(F,S) Data Structures and Advanced Programming (Q)
This course builds on the programming skills acquired in Computer Science 134, and it couples work on pro-
gram design, analysis, and verification with an introduction to the study of data structures. Data structures capture
common ways in which to store and manipulate data, and they are important in the construction of sophisticated
computer programs. Students are introduced to some of the most important and frequently used data structures:
lists, stacks, queues, trees, hash tables, graphs, and files. Students will be expected to write several programs,
ranging from very short programs to more elaborate systems. Emphasis will be placed on the development of
clear, modular programs that are easy to read, debug, verify, analyze, and modify.
Format: lecture/laboratory. Evaluation will be based on programming assignments and examinations.
Prerequisites: Computer Science 134 or equivalent. (Discrete Mathematics is recommended, but not required)

This course studies the basic instruction set architecture and organization of a modern computer. Over the semes-
ter the student learns the fundamentals of translating of higher level languages into assembly language, and the
interpretation of machine languages by hardware. At the same time, a model of computer hardware organization
is developed from the gate level upward. Final projects focus on the design of a complex control system in hard-
ware or firmware.
Evaluation will be based primarily on weekly labs, final design project, two exams.
Prerequisites: Computer Science 134, or both experience in programming and permission of instructor. Enroll-
ment limit: 40 (expected: 25).

CSCI 256(S) Algorithm Design and Analysis (Q)
This course investigates methods for designing efficient and reliable algorithms. By carefully analyzing the
structure of a problem within a mathematical framework, it is often possible to dramatically decrease the com-
putational resources needed to find a solution. In addition, analysis provides a method for verifying the correct-
ness of an algorithm and accurately estimating its running time and space requirements. We will study several
algorithm design strategies that build on data structures and programming techniques introduced in Computer
Science 136, including induction, divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, and greedy algorithms. Particular
topics of study include graph theory, computational geometry, string processing, approximation algorithms, and
advanced data structures. In addition, an introduction to complexity theory and the complexity classes P and NP
will be provided.

CONTRACT MAJOR
Contract Major Advisor: CHARLES R. TOOMAJIAN, Jr.
Students with the talent and energy for working independently and with the strong support of two facul-
ty advisors may undertake a Contract Major: a coherent study of an interdisciplinary subject not covered
by a regularly offered major. Such a major must be in an area suitable to the talents of the faculty in resi-
dence and cannot consist of minor modifications to an existing major. A Contract Major also must conform
to the structure and have the coherence of a departmental or program major--i.e., it must embody a disci-
plined cumulative study that moves from an elementary to an advanced level and culminates in a synthesis
similar to a senior major course. Hence a Contract Major usually consists of a program of existing courses,
sometimes supplemented by courses of independent study and the senior course.
The process of constructing a proposal for a Contract Major is both interesting and demanding. As part
of that process, students should consider carefully the advantage of working within existing majors or pro-
grams, taking note of the considerable intellectual pleasures involved in sharing similar educational experi-
ences with other students working within the same field. Students might also consider whether their inter-
ests could be met by completing a regular major and coordinate program, or a double major, or simply by
working outside a major field in courses of special interest. Because the Contract Major represents an ex-
ceptional opportunity provided for students whose interests cannot be met through existing departmental
and interdepartmental majors and programs, it cannot be pursued in conjunction with another major.
Students who wish to explore or propose a Contract Major should consult with the Contract Major advi-
sor and with potential faculty sponsors as early as possible in the fall semester of the sophomore year, and
then--during the sophomore year--follow these procedures:
1) The student must initiate discussion with at least two members of the faculty from differing depart-
ments who expect to be in residence during the student's senior year and who are willing to endorse the
Contract Major and undertake a central role in supervising its implementation, criticism, evaluation, and
ultimate validation. Since in essence faculty sponsors substitute for the student's major department, they
are expected to play an important role in the Contract Major.
The student must develop, in conjunction with the faculty sponsors, a written proposal (forms and
guidelines are available in the Dean's Office) which should contain:
a) a description of the proposed major area of study and an explanation of the reasons for proposing
the Contract Major. A sound and persuasive rationale for the major is crucial for obtaining ap-
proval from the Committee on Educational Policy (C.E.P.).
b) a list of all courses in the proposed major and an explanation for each course choice. A minimum
of nine semester courses, one of which must be designated the senior major course (and taken
during the senior year), must be completed for a Contract Major. Normal rules governing course
grades and grade point average apply for entry into and continuation in a Contract Major.
c) a list of other courses taken or anticipated to meet College distribution requirements, including
grades received in courses already completed.
Contract Major, Critical Languages
­ 130 ­
2) By mid-January, the student must meet with the Contract Major Advisor to discuss and further devel-
op the proposal.
3) By the first day of spring semester classes, the student must submit a complete draft of the proposal to
the Contract Major Advisor for feedback.
4) By the end of the fourth week of the spring semester, the student must submit the final proposal to the
Contract Major Advisor. By this date also, the faculty sponsors must submit their endorsement forms to the
Contract Major Advisor. If the student is essentially proposing to transform an existing coordinate program
(e.g., Africana Studies, area studies programs, Environmental Studies, Women's and Gender Studies, etc.),
into a Contract Major, the chair of that program should also submit to the Contract Major Advisor a state-
ment attesting to the validity of the proposal by the end of the fourth week of the spring semester.
5) The Contract Major Advisor then conveys the proposal, a copy of the student's most recent academic
progress report, the faculty sponsors' endorsement forms, and recommendations regarding the feasibility
and substance of the proposal, for approval by the Committee on Educational Policy. The C.E.P., after
consultation with departments and programs substantially affected by a proposal, will vote on each propos-
al individually and will report the decision to the Contract Major Advisor, who will notify students and
sponsors before the spring registration deadline. If the time needed for C.E.P. review demands it, the Con-
tract Major Advisor may postpone notification to students and permit them to register late without penalty.
In making its decisions, the C.E.P. considers the student's academic record, the coherence and feasibility of
the plan of study, and the degree of support expressed by the faculty sponsors and, if appropriate, program
chairs.
Subsequent changes in a Contract Major must be requested in writing by the student and approved by
the faculty sponsors as well as by the Contract Major Advisor. Where there has been substantial alteration
of the original program, the Contract Major Advisor will forward the student's written request to the C.E.P.
for reconsideration.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN THE CONTRACT MAJOR
The route to the degree with honors in the Contract Major will normally be a senior thesis requiring two
semesters and a winter study of work. In special circumstances a student may propose to substitute a one-
semester course or a winter study course for one of his or her thesis courses and write a mini-thesis. The
Contract Major with honors shall comprise a minimum of eleven semester courses or ten semester courses
plus one winter study. One semester of independent study undertaken for the thesis may be allowed to
fulfill the requirement for a senior major course.
The faculty sponsors shall determine by the end of winter study whether the student is to be admitted to
honors candidacy. If not admitted to honors candidacy, the student may elect not to continue further inde-
pendent study. If admitted to honors candidacy, the student shall submit a written thesis or minithesis to
three faculty readers, at least one of whom shall be a faculty sponsor and at least one of whom shall not be a
faculty sponsor. The outside reader or readers shall be selected by the Contract Major Advisor in consulta-
tion with the faculty sponsors. There will be a one-hour oral exam by the readers, and they shall make a
final decision regarding honors.

CRITICAL LANGUAGES (Div. I)
Coordinator, JANE CANOVA
The Critical Languages Program enables students to study important foreign languages not taught in
regular courses at Williams. Hebrew, Hindi, Korean, and Swahili can be studied for one year at the elemen-
tary level, and Arabic can be studied at the intermediate level during the spring semester.
All courses adhere to the guidelines of the National Association of Self-Instructional Language Pro-
grams (NASILP). Students work independently with standard language textbooks and individual cassette
tapes for roughly ten hours per week and attend two one-hour group review sessions per week with native-
speaking tutors. Language faculty from other institutions conduct the midterm and final exams and deter-
mine the final grades.
To be eligible for a 200-level Critical Languages course, the student must:
z
demonstrate proven capability for independent work and previous success in foreign language study;
z
explain how study of the language will integrate with his or her major or other academic interests;
z
present a letter of recommendation from a Williams faculty member;
z
in some cases take a pretest for placement;
z
have attained sophomore standing or higher;
z
have at least a 3.00 Grade Point Average.
Interested students should obtain an application form for the desired course in early April. Forms are
available at the Center for Foreign Languages, Literatures, and Cultures in Weston Hall. Students must
meet with the program coordinator and hand in the completed application forms no later than one week
before preregistration. The application must be approved before registering for the course.
Critical Languages, Economics
­ 131 ­
Students should note that Critical Languages courses are hyphenated, meaning no credit is given for the
first semester until the second semester is successfully completed. Students must normally begin a course
in the fall semester. It cannot be taken Pass/Fail.
A Critical Languages course will be scheduled only if and when at least two students are accepted into
the course. Students planning to register for the course must attend an organizational meeting the first week
of each semester.
Note: Elementary Arabic and Intermediate Arabic I are offered as regular courses. Please refer to AR-
ABIC listing on page 64.

MAJOR
Students who have not yet taken an economics course should begin their sequence with Economics
110 and should follow the following sequence:
Economics 110 Principles of Microeconomics
(Note that students may not take any economics courses, including Economics 110 and 120, without
having passed the quantitative studies exam or the equivalent.)
Economics 120 Principles of Macroeconomics (Economics 110 or the equivalent is a prerequisite for
120)
Economics 251 Price and Allocation Theory
Economics 252 Macroeconomics
Economics 253 or 255 Empirical Methods
Students in the classes of 2007 and 2008: you may satisfy your empirical methods major requirement
with either Economics 253 or 255, or Statistics 201 and 346. (The statistical methods course should
be taken before any course numbered 400 or above.)
Students in the class of 2009 and succeeding classes: you must complete Economics 255 or the
equivalent to satisfy your empirical methods major requirement. Please note that Statistics 101 or
201 is a prerequisite from Economics 255. Students in the class of 2009 or later who are considering
majoring in economics are thus strongly encouraged to take Statistics 101 or 201 early in their col-
lege careers. Students may take the combination of Statistics 201 and 346 instead of Economics 255.
Economics 253 can not be substituted for Economics 255.
Note that Economics 251, 252, and the Empirical Methods course can be taken in any order. In most
cases all three of these courses are prerequisites for Economics Senior Seminars, at least one of which
is required for the major. Senior seminars are typically taken during senior year (or in some cases
during the spring of junior year). Students are thus strongly encouraged to complete these three core
courses by the end of junior year at the latest.
Elective Requirements:
Students must complete four Economics electives, of which at least two must be selected from ad-
vanced electives numbered 350 to 394 (or from the CDE courses offered), and one of which must be
selected from electives numbered 450-475. (Note: With permission of the Chair of the Department of
Economics, students may substitute an extra 450+ elective for a 350-394 elective. However, in ad-
mitting students to these courses, the department will give preference to students who have not yet
taken a course numbered 450-475.)
The primary objectives of the major are to develop an understanding of economic aspects of contempo-
rary life and to equip the student to analyze economic issues of social policy. The introductory courses
stress use of the basic elements of economic analysis for understanding and resolving such issues. The two
Economics
­ 132 ­
required intermediate theory courses then provide a more thorough grounding in economics as a discipline
by examining the strengths and weaknesses of the price system in allocating economics resources and by
examining the aggregate processes which determine employment, inflation, and growth. A course in statis-
tical methods, either Economics 255 or alternatively, Statistics 201 plus Statistics 346 (students graduating
prior to 2009 may also use Economics 253 to satisfy the statistical methods requirement) equips the major
to understand and apply the basic tools of quantitative empirical analysis. Majors must take four electives,
in at least three of which they apply parts of the theory learned in the required intermediate theory courses.
At least one of the four electives, typically taken in the senior year, must be a "Senior Seminar," an Eco-
nomics course numbered 450-475. Students must have completed Economics 251 and 252 and have com-
pleted the statistical methods requirement before taking a senior seminar.
Should I Major in Economics to Prepare for a Career in Business?
Economics is the study of the allocation of scarce resources among competing ends. As a social science,
it is devoted to developing a better understanding of many kinds of human interaction. It is important to
stress that training in economics is not the same as training in business management. Businesses have spe-
cific goals of their own, including the making of profits, and professional training in business is about
learning how to pursue those goals more effectively. This requires learning quite specialized techniques
and skills that are not the proper focus of an undergraduate liberal arts education. Our undergraduate eco-
nomics courses do not focus on these specialized business skills and techniques; therefore, students who
major in economics or take many courses in it solely because they believe that it is the subject that is "clos-
est to business" are likely to be frustrated and unhappy in their economics courses. We advise students to
acquire a broad exposure to the arts, social sciences and natural sciences, and to major in the subject that
most excites them and engages their interest rather than attempt to acquire extensive pre-professional train-
ing while undergraduates.
Credit for Coursework Done Elsewhere
The normal requirement that nine economics courses be taken at Williams will usually be waived only
on the basis of transferred credit deemed acceptable by the department. Credit is granted based on grades
consistent with college policy on various examinations:
z
Students who receive a 5 on the Microeconomics AP or Macroeconomics AP exam, or a 5 on each,
may place out of Economics 110 or 120, or both, respectively, but major credit will be given for only
one course.
z
The Department will grant major credit for both Economics 110 and 120 to a student who receives a
6 or 7 on the higher-level Economics IB examination, and that student can place into any 200-level
course or intermediate-level micro or macro course.
z
For A levels credit, the Department will grant major credit for both Economics 110 and 120 to a
student who receives a grade of A or B.
Prospective majors please note that instructors in all sections of Economics 251, 252, 253, and 255 and
courses numbered 350 and above feel free to use elementary calculus in assigned readings, lectures, prob-
lem sets, and examinations; therefore, Economics 110 and 120 and Mathematics 103 or its equivalent are
required as prerequisites for these courses, with the exception of 251 which has only Economics 110 and
Mathematics 103 as prerequisites. By elementary calculus is meant differentiation of single variable poly-
nomial functions and conditions for a maximum or minimum; it does not include integration. Students
interested in graduate study in economics will need to study more advanced mathematics; see your advisor
for specific suggestions. Students are also reminded that some courses now have specific mathematics re-
quirements; see course descriptions.
Graduate training in economics requires more mathematical sophistication than does undergraduate
economics. We encourage students who are considering pursuing a Ph.D. in Economics to take Economics
255, Mathematics 105 (or 106), Mathematics 209, Mathematics 211 and Mathematics 301. As graduate
schools also look for evidence of research experience and promise, we strongly encourage interested stu-
dents to write a senior honors thesis in Economics.
STUDY ABROAD
Students who are considering study abroad should consult with the Department's Coordinator for
Transfers/Study Abroad Credits early in the process of planning a year or semester abroad. (See the De-
partment website to determine which professor is the Coordinator for this academic year.) Economics ma-
jors or prospective majors who are considering spending all or part of their junior year abroad are strongly
advised to choose sophomore courses such that they can complete their intermediate theory requirements
(Economics 251, 252, and 253 or 255) prior to the start of their senior year. We recommend as well that
students complete at least part of the major's advanced elective requirement prior to the beginning of the
senior year. Students who hope to pursue Honors in economics but who plan to be away for all or part of
the junior year are strongly advised to meet with the Department's Director of Research prior to going
abroad to discuss options for pursuing honors. (See the Department website to determine the Director of
Research for this academic year.)
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN ECONOMICS
We encourage all majors who have at least a 3.5 GPA in economics courses to consider honors. To be
admitted to candidacy for honors in economics a student must complete a substantial piece of independent
research. Two routes to honors are open: the Specialization Route and the Thesis Route.
Economics
­ 133 ­
1) Specialization Route, consisting of these three units:
a. Development of a thesis proposal;
b. An honors winter study project (W30) in January of the senior year;
c. Economics 491 or 492 Honors Seminar. Students may pursue the Specialization Route to honors in
their senior year, either in the fall semester plus WSP or WSP plus the spring semester. After selecting
an advisor and discussing the topic with the advisor, the student should submit a thesis proposal to the
department for approval. (A description of what should be included in proposals is listed on the depart-
ment's website.) Such proposals frequently build on research papers completed for advanced electives,
but this is not a requirement. Students should submit proposals at the end of the spring semester if they
wish to pursue a fall-WSP thesis, and by the last day of classes in December if they wish to pursue a
WSP-spring thesis. The department provides a memorandum to majors with more details every spring
and fall.
2) Thesis Route (Economics 493-W30-494):
A few students each year will be accepted for year-long thesis research on a subject closely related to the
scholarly interests of a faculty member. A student who hopes to do such independent and advanced
research in close association with a faculty member should begin to work out a mutually satisfactory
topic early in the second semester of his or her junior year. Application to the department must be made
before the end of the junior year by submitting a detailed proposal for work under the supervision of the
faculty member. The WSP of the senior year is also spent on the thesis.
The College Bulletin states that students who wish to receive honors must take at least one course in
addition to the minimum number required for the major. Students who pursue a year-long thesis and
therefore take both Economics 493 and 494 may substitute Economics 493 for an upper-level elective
(excluding those numbered 400-490) if they wish to. Students who pursue the Specialization Route to
Honors may not substitute Economics 491 or 492 for an upper- (or lower-) level elective requirement.
Because economics honors theses frequently make use of empirical economic methods, students con-
sidering writing an honors thesis in economics are strongly advised to complete Economics 255 or Statis-
tics 346 before the end of junior year.
AFRICANA STUDIES AND AREA STUDIES
A major in economics who concentrates in African-American or Area Studies may substitute the non-
economics courses in the concentration for one lower-level elective in the Economics major, but not for an
advanced elective (350-394).
Note on course numbers: Courses between 201 and 299 are lower-level electives and are open to
students who have taken 110 or 120. Courses 350 and above are advanced electives, have intermedi-
ate theory prerequisites, and are primarily designed for Economics and Political Economy majors.
Courses numbered 450-475 are only open to students who have completed Economics 251, Econom-
ics 252, and who have satisfied the statistical methods requirement.
ECON 110(F,S) Principles of Microeconomics (Q)
This course is an introduction to the study of the forces of supply and demand that determine prices and the
allocation of resources in markets for goods and services, markets for labor, and markets for natural resources.
The focus is on how and why markets work, why they may fail to work, and the policy implications of both their
successes and failures. The course focuses on developing the basic tools of microeconomic analysis and then
applying those tools to topics of popular or policy interest such as minimum wage legislation, pollution control,
competition policy, international trade policy, discrimination, tax policy, and the role of government in a market
economy. This course is required of Economics majors and highly recommended for those non-majors inter-
ested in Environmental Studies, Women's and Gender Studies and Political Economy. The department recom-
mends that students follow this course with Principles of Macroeconomics or with a lower-level elective that has
Economics 110 as its prerequisite. Students may alternatively proceed directly to Intermediate Microeconomics
after taking this introductory course.

This is an introduction to the economies and development problems of the poorer countries in Africa, Asia, and
Latin America. We shall discover both the roots and the extent of these problems, and explore possible solutions.
The course begins by investigating how different socio-historical environments have shaped various third world
economies. Then, keeping this in context, it attempts to get an idea of the best feasible policies to tackle a whole
range of critical development issues. These issues include poverty and its alleviation, the population explosion,
employment and migration patterns, raising education and health standards, and making agriculture and industry
more efficient. Finally, we will consider some broader international issues--like patterns of trade, foreign aid,
and the international debt crisis.
Each student will be expected to study these issues for an individual country or region, attempting to get an idea
of the socio-economic context from reading examples of relevant third world literature.

is government intervention in the economy appropriate? What is the most effective form of intervention? What
effects do government policies have on individual incentives? The course will cover issues in both taxation and
spending. Specific programs will be considered such as Social Security, Medicare, education, and public assis-
tance for the poor. We will also discuss rationales and strategies for reforming the U.S. tax system.

nist critiques of economics theory, work on care labor and the shifting boundaries between markets, governments
and households, theories of household bargaining, and discussions of difference. Then we will discuss a series of
interlinked issues including: the contradictory effects of structural adjustment and its successors; the informal
sector and the `invisible assembly line'; the economics of sex work and global sex trafficking; migration and
reproductive labor; microcredit; the economics of the HIV/AIDS pandemic. We will finish by looking at com-

culture? Should support for the arts be provided through private patronage, private philanthropy, or public sector
support? How does the mechanism of support for art affect the productivity and creativity of the artist? Does art
make a good investment for an individual? If so, why do art museums require donations and public support?
What are the impacts on economic vitality and local economic development of cultural and arts organizations?
When these impacts arise, how can (or should) they be used for public policy?

ECON 230(S) The Economics of Health and Health Care (W)
In recent years, the intersection between health and economics has increased in importance. The costs of health
care have been rising, seemingly inexorably. A substantial fraction of the United States population lacks health
insurance, while the rising number of elderly is putting increasing pressure on health spending. Globally, the
HIV/AIDS pandemic is causing severe economic hardship, and many people lack access to basic health care.
More positively, advances in health care have widened the scope of possible treatments. Given the importance of
good health for individual well-being, it is not surprising that health care and how to pay for it are of concern to
individuals and policymakers worldwide. In this course we will analyze the economics of health by applying
standard microeconomic techniques to the problems of health and health care markets. The course focuses on
three broad issues: the inputs to health and the demand for health care, the structure and consequences of public
and private health insurance, and the supply of health care. Special attention will be devoted to topics of current
public policy, including the problems of rising costs and cost containment, health insurance reform, the changing
nature of health care provision, changing public policies in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, hospital com-
petition, and the determinants and consequences of technological change in medicine.

ECON 351(F) Tax Policy (Q) (W)
The tax system is a major element of public policy. In addition to raising revenue for government expenditure
programs, policymakers use the tax system to redistribute resources and to promote a variety of economic
policies. For example, the United States tax system has specific rules to encourage savings, education, and
investment. Inherently, many tax policy choices involve trade-offs between equity and efficiency. The purpose of
this course is to clarify the goals and possibilities of tax policy, mainly through an examination of U.S. federal tax
policy (though the search for possible reforms may lead us to examine policies from other countries). The course
will examine the choice of the tax base (income or consumption), notations of fairness in taxation (e.g., the rate
structure), the choice to tax corporate income separately from personal income, and a variety of specific tax
policy issues (e.g., retirement saving, child care, the "marriage" tax, capital gains taxation, and the taxation of
housing).
Format: seminar/discussion. Requirements: several shorter papers, a research paper, and final exam.

ECON 353(F) Decision Theory (Q)
Studies of decision-making suggest that most people substantially violate even undemanding models of rational-
ity. Are people truly irrational, and, if so, can anything be done about it? This course focuses on normative deci-
sion-making (how we should make decisions under general conditions), descriptive decision-making (how we
do make decisions under actual conditions), and the contrast between the two. We proceed to a view of prescrip-
tive decision-making, or how we might combine normative and descriptive insights to improve decision-making
and judgment. Topics include decision-analytic methods for improving decision-making rigor (e.g., decision
trees); microeconomic concepts and tools for optimization problems; game theory as appropriate; insights from
cognitive psychology on heuristics (short cuts) that sometimes help, but often distort, decision-making; inte-
grated models of judgment that call for both analysis and intuition; insights from the newly-emerging studies of
judgment and wisdom. Until a few years ago, this topic was given normative treatment in departments of engi-
neering, statistics and economics, and was separately taught as a descriptive science in departments of psycholo-
gy. The apparent value of combining the two into a single, prescriptive analysis of decision-making and judg-
ment has led to a recent wave of interdisciplinary approaches such as the one adopted in this course.
Requirements: multiple problems and case analyses, one project, final exam.
Prerequisites: Economics 251 and Mathematics 104 or higher or permission of instructor. Statistics 101 or 201

and investment decisions of multinational corporations are analyzed and compared to the predictions of interna-
tional trade theory. Second, competitive strategies of indigenous and foreign rivals in U.S., Pacific rim, and Euro-
pean markets are explored. Third, the efficacy of government policies in promoting the competitiveness of in-
dustries in global markets is discussed. Case studies of firms, industries, and countries will be utilized.

ECON 368(F) The Economics of HIV/AIDS
Peter Piot, Executive Director of UNAIDS, describes the AIDS pandemic as an `earthquake in slow motion'
--as big a threat to world peace as terrorism. It is also widely understood as the biggest challenge to economic
development in sub-Saharan Africa, as well as presenting a potential disaster for China, India, Ukraine and Rus-
sia. Fully understanding the roots, longterm effects, and solutions to this pandemic requires economic analysis; it
also challenges many of our existing economic models and pushes us to new understanding.
In this class we will consider the roots of the AIDS pandemic in poverty, `unhealthy' economies, and gender
structures. We will discuss competing models predicting the economic impact of the disease, on levels ranging
from rural households through corporations to national macroeconomies. We will look at the significance of
intellectual property rights in determining the development of, and subsequent access to, different treatments.
And we will consider the economics of treatment rollout, including deeply embedded gender issues and debates
around the cost effectiveness of different interventions--how should governments and international agencies
choose how many resources to allocate to treatment as compared to different kinds of prevention?
Format: seminar. Requirements are a short paper, a research paper, and participation in class discussion, includ-
ing presenting research in class.

ECON 372(F) Public Choice (Q)
Public Choice is a discipline right at the intersection of economics and political science. In this course we use the
basic postulates of rational, utility maximizing behavior to analyze the process of political decision making in a
democracy. The course covers topics such as the behavior of voters and politicians in elections, the analysis of
legislative policymaking process, the role of the bureaucrats in government, the role of interest groups and
money in politics, etc. After having developed a perspective on the way a government "actually" functions
(rather than the way it "ought to"¯function), we will go on to reevaluate the role of the government in the lives of
its citizens.

ECON 374T(S) Poverty and Public Policy (W)
Since 1965, the annual poverty rate in the United States has hovered between 10 and 15 percent, though far more
than 15 percent of Americans experience poverty at some point in their lives. In this course, we will study public
policies that, explicitly or implicitly, have as a goal improving the well-being of the poor in this country. These
policies include safety net programs (Aid to Families with Dependent Children/Temporary Assistance to Needy
Families, Food Stamps, Medicaid, and housing assistance), education programs (Head Start and public primary
and secondary education), and parts of the tax code (the Earned Income Tax Credit). We will explore the design
and functioning of these programs, focusing on questions economists typically ask when evaluating public
policy: Does the policy achieve its goals? Does the design of the policy lead to unintended effects (either good or
bad)? Could it be redesigned to achieve its goals in a more cost-effective manner? Through in-depth study of
these programs, students will learn how economists bring theoretical models and empirical evidence to bear on
important questions of public policy.
Format: tutorial. Evaluation will be based on six 5- to 7-page papers and on the quality of the student's oral
presentations and commentary on the work of his/her colleagues.
Prerequisites: Economics 253 or 255 or Statistics 346 or permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 10 (ex-

lyze the strategic interaction between firms to study their ability to protect and exploit market power. Aspects of
strategic decision-making that we shall study include: price discrimination, product selection, firm reputation,
bundling and collusion. We conclude with a discussion of the role of anti-trust policy. Theoretical models will be
supplemented with case studies and empirical papers.

ECON 451(F) The Macroeconomics of National Saving
This seminar provides a detailed examination of topics related to the macroeconomics of national saving (which
is the sum of household, corporate, and government saving). Topics include theoretical and empirical analyses of
the effects of budget deficits on economic growth; general -equilibrium effects of taxation and government
spending; the efficacy of tax-favored saving vehicles, such as 401(k) plans, in promoting national saving and
welfare; the effects of national saving on capital accumulation and labor supply; and the intergenerational conse-
quences of deficits and debt. The emphasis in this seminar will be on quantifying the importance of these topics
using a combination of econometrics and numerical models. Students will have an opportunity to apply these
methods in a required end-of-term research paper.

ECON 452T(F) Economics of Community Development
This course focuses attention on the economic issues that arise in understanding community development. Stu-
dents will address such questions as: why do some cities grow, while others lose population? Why are some
communities successful in attracting new firms and getting existing ones to expand? Why are some communities
regarded as offering better `quality of life' than others? Why do employees of local governments join unions in
higher proportions than any other sector of the economy? How do decisions made in local governments affect
the overall economy, and how does the economy and competition between communities affect local decisions?
Thinking about such questions helps to develop skills in economic analysis and understanding of communities,
the challenges they confront, and how to improve them. Students will be expected to read, discuss, and synthe-
size a variety of analytic approaches into their own analysis of particular community development questions.
Students will be expected to work with and analyze data and to present the results of their analysis.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: students will meet with the instructor in pairs for an hour each week; they will
write a paper every other week, and comment on their partner's papers every other week.

ECON 456(F) Poverty and Place
This course explores poverty and inequality in the U.S., with a particular emphasis on the role of places in shap-
ing the experience of poverty and the public response to it. Topics may include residential choice across and
within metropolitan areas, residential segregation by race and income, urban labor markets, peer and neighbor-
hood effects, crime and incarceration, local public finance, and the interactions of poverty with public health,
family structure, and education. Some time will be spent thinking about how to assess empirical evidence and
developing a working knowledge of econometric techniques used in the readings.
Format: seminar/Discussion. Requirements: frequent short writing assignments, oral presentations, computer lab
exercises, active participation in class discussion, and a final research paper.

In this class, students will learn how to read, critically evaluate, and begin to produce economic research on im-
portant and interesting public policy questions. Applications will be drawn from across the spectrum of public
economics issues and may vary from year to year. Examples of specific topics that may be covered include
education, taxation, social security, saving behavior, labor supply, anti-poverty policy, health, fiscal policy, politi-
cal economy, and the economics of crime and corruption. The course will especially emphasize the critical analy-
sis of empirical evidence on public policy questions. There will be a mix of lecture, seminar discussion, and time
in a computer lab learning to work with data and estimate econometric models.
Format: seminar. Requirements will include a 15- to 20-page research paper (written in stages), a small number
of other short written assignments, and a midterm.
Prerequisites: Economics 253 or 255 or the equivalent. Economics 251, and Economics 120. Enrollment limit:

ECON 459(F) Economics of Institutions
Why are some countries rich and others poor? There are numerous candidate explanations emphasizing factors
ranging from demography to technological innovation to unequal international relations. However, some econo-
mists like Douglass North and Mancur Olson have argued that beneath the profusion of proximate causes the
quality of a country's "institutions" fundamentally determines its economic prospects. The word "institutions" is
used broadly; it can refer to micro-structures like households or macro-structures like the state. The course will
survey the literature on institutions and economic development, discussing both developed and developing coun-
tries. Readings will largely consist of published journal articles and unpublished work of similar quality. Students
should expect to use microeconomic theory and econometrics learned in previous courses. Evaluation will be
based on four short papers of 7-10 pages each.
Format: seminar.
Pre-requisites: Economics 251, Economics 253 or 255 or the equivalent. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19).

ECON 461(S) Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) Modeling
The Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model is an important tool for applied policy work. CGE models
are the primary tool for many government organizations when evaluating policy alternatives and are also used
extensively by various NGO's when deciding aid and policy recommendations. The great advantage of these
models is that they capture the general equilibrium feedback effects of policy proposals on various sectors of the
economy. This is of great importance to applied work, as this allows the identification of the winners and losers
from potential policies. The class will begin with a general overview of CGE models. This overview will be
rigorous and mathematical. This course will use the free programming packages GAMS and MPSGE to imple-
ment various CGE models using real world data. While no previous computer experience is required, some fa-
miliarity with at least one programming language is recommended. During the latter part of the course, students
will create a CGE model for a country of their choice and conduct policy experiments using their model. Inter-
ested students could continue this project as a potential thesis topic.

This course opens with a brief survey of some of the major characteristics, issues, and challenges of financial
systems today, and then examines earlier experience with these phenomena. Topics to be examined include: the
role of finance in economic development historically; the relationship between finance and government, and the
extent to which it has changed over time; the lessons from early stock market, real estate, canal, railroad, and
even tulip bubbles, for modern financial systems; the effect of institutions (laws, norms, and culture) and political
systems in shaping the impact of finance, as illustrated by comparisons between Mexico and the U.S., among
other cases. The course also examines the tools that were developed in earlier epochs to deal with different risks,
evaluate their efficacy, and consider lessons for modern financial regulation. Implications and lessons for current
financial issues will be discussed throughout. Format: seminar. Evaluation will consist of three short papers, one
draft and the final research paper, at least one oral presentation and contributions to class discussions.

ECON 464(S) (formerly 367) Empirical Methods in Macroeconomics (Same as Economics 514) (Q)
Macroeconomics and related fields in international finance and development have evolved specialized empirical
techniques, known generally as macroeconometrics, which are designed to meet the practical challenges that the
data and the empirical questions pose in these fields. The course will introduce the theory and application of these
techniques, and students will learn how to implement these techniques using real world data to address practical
questions drawn from the fields of macro, international finance and development. Topics to which these tech-
niques will be applied include business cycle analysis and forecasting, sources of exchange rate volatility and
determinants of long run economic growth. Computer work and programming will be an integral part of the
course, but no previous training is expected.
Format: seminar. Requirements: short empirical projects, midterm, term paper.

eye towards identifying systematic ways in which behavior deviates from our classical assumptions and generat-
ing new, and hopefully more realistic, assumptions of behavior. We explore the empirical, theoretical and policy
implications of these findings.
Format: seminar. Requirements: one long paper, one short paper, and a series of critiques.
Prerequisites: Economics 251 and 253 or 255 or the equivalent. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference
will be given to senior Economics majors. (Students who have not taken econometrics may apply to be admitted

ECON 466(S) Economic Growth: Theories and Evidence
This seminar will examine recent advances in the study of economic growth. Why are some countries richer than
other countries? What accounts for differences in growth rates across countries and over time? What are the
respective roles of factor accumulation and productivity growth? The answers to these questions have important
implications for policy, both in rich and poor countries,and for development assistance from rich to poor. We will
review literature, including both technical papers and more popular writing, that offer explanations linked to cap-
ital investment, human capital accumulation, policy distortions and poor institutions, geography, agricultural
technology, and other sources. Not only will we seek to learn the main policy messages of these papers, but also
we will try to understand why different models lead to different conclusions and how economic research prog-
resses over time.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on either five 5- to 6-page papers or one long paper and a series of
critiques, as well as class participation.
Prerequisites: Economics 251, 252, 253 or 255 or the equivalent. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected 19). Preference

ECON 503(F) Public Economics
Public economics is the branch of economics concerned with government expenditure and taxation, focusing
primarily on microeconomic aspects of these activities. It provides tools for understanding the effects of govern-
ment policies, as well as a useful conceptual framework for analyzing normative questions such as "what is a
good policy?" This seminar will present the basic principles for public economics, and apply them to topics of
particular importance in developing countries. The course will begin by considering the efficiency of market
economies, and rationales for government intervention in the market, such as public goods, externalities, infor-
mation-based market failures, and equity. Applications include education, health care, aid to the poor, and infra-
structure. We then move on to the economics of taxation, considering what kinds of taxes are used in developing
countries and how they are designed, the economic and distributional effects of taxation, questions of administra-
tion and evasion, and options for reform. Time permitting, we will also address topics such as pubic enterprises,
political economy, and decentralization.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: problem sets, one 5- to 7-page paper, a 15-page final paper, midterm,
and a final exam.
Prerequisites: Economics 251. In addition, an empirical methods course (Economics 253, 255, 510 or 511, or
Statistics 346) must be taken before or concurrently with this class. Enrollment limit: 30 (expected: 25-30). Un-
dergraduate enrollment limited and requires instructor's permission.

ECON 505(F) Finance and Development
This course focuses on the financial system and its role in economic development. The first part explores the
functions of finance, how it contributes to growth, and reviews different models of financial sector development
and their influence on how governments viewed the sector. It will examine experiences with financial sector
repression and subsequent liberalization, and investigate the causes and impact of financial crises. Then it will
study how to make finance effective and how to prevent or minimize crises, analyzing government's role as
regulator, supervisor, standard setter, contract enforcer, and owner. In this final part, attention will be devoted to
the role of institutions (laws, norms, culture) and incentives in financial sector development.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: two short papers, midterm, and a final exam.

ECON 509(S) Developing Country Macroeconomics
This course focuses on the relationship between macroeconomic policies and economic growth in devel-
oping countries. After examining the links between macroeconomic stability and long-run growth, the
rest of the course is divided into three parts. The first part is devoted to the construction of an analytical
model that is suitable for analyzing a wide variety of macroeconomic issues in developing countries.
This model provides the general framework for a more specific analysis of fiscal and monetary policies
in the two remaining parts. In analyzing fiscal policy, the course will consider in particular the require-
ments of fiscal solvency and the contribution that fiscal policy can make to macroeconomic stability. It
will also examine alternative methods for achieving fiscal credibility, including the design of fiscal insti-
tutions. The final part of the course will turn to an analysis of central banking, focusing on central bank

ECON 516T(S) Customs, Laws and Corruption
The scope for corruption and the extent to which it is prevalent in a country is a result of the interplay between
several factors. These include the legal structure, the specifications of official responsibilities, the effectiveness of
enforcement, customs and norms of the specific society, and the resulting social and economic incentives facing
personnel in corruptible office. This tutorial will study these factors--both generally and in the context of specif-
ic developing economies. Our objective is to understand principles according to which efficient rules can be
constructed that optimize economic performance.
Tutorial participants will meet once a week in pairs with the faculty member. Each week, one student will pre-
pare a policy paper and submit the paper to the professor and to the other student in advance of the meeting.
During the meeting, the student who has written the paper will present an argument, evidence, and conclusions.
The other student will provide a detailed critique of the paper based on concepts and evidence from the readings.
The professor will join the discussion after each participant has presented and ask questions that highlight or
illustrate critical points. During a semester, each participant will write and present 5 or 6 policy papers and a like
number of critiques.
Enrollment will be limited to 10 students who will meet weekly in five groups of 2. Course is intended for CDE
Fellows, undergraduate enrollment limited, and only with permission of the instructor.

ECON 518T(S) Child Labor, Education and Development
This tutorial will explore the phenomenon of child labor, which is disturbingly widespread in developing
countries. Child labor is troublesome for at least two reasons: it is inherently abhorrent, and it prevents
children from acquiring the education necessary to develop into productive and empowered adults. We
will study the process by which adults decide (or are forced) to send children to work, and analyze the
effectiveness and sustainability of various policy measures to reduce child labor and improve the welfare
of children.
Tutorial participants will meet once a week in pairs with the faculty member. Each week, one student will
prepare a policy paper and submit the paper to the professor and to the other student in advance of the

ECON 521(S) Urbanization and Development (Same as Economics 388)
If current rates of growth persist, the combined population of urban areas in developing countries will
double in the next 30 years. The land area devoted to urban use is expected to double even more quickly.
The costs of providing housing and infrastructure to accommodate this growth are enormous, but the
costs of failing to accommodate urban development may be even larger. The decisions made in response
to these challenges will affect the economic performance of these countries and the health and welfare of
the urban residents. This course will focus on these challenges. What are the economic forces that drive
the process of urbanization, and how does the level of urbanization affect economic development? How
are housing, transportation, fiscal and development policies affected by urbanization? What policy
choices are available, and which are likely to be most successful in dealing with the challenges of urban
growth?
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: a midterm and a final exam, plus two short papers that evalu-
ate specific problems, policy alternatives, and provide some analysis of relevant data.

In this course, each Fellow carries out an individual research study on a topic in which he or she has particular
interest, usually related to one of the three seminars. The approach and results of the study are reported in a major
paper. Research studies are analytical rather than descriptive and in nearly all cases include quantitative analyses.
Often the topic is a specific policy problem in a Fellow's own country.

COURSES AND COURSE-NUMBERING
The course offerings in English enable students, whether majors or non-majors, to explore literature in a
variety of ways, and to satisfy their interests in particular authors, literary periods, and genres. They empha-
size interpretive skills, systematic and critical thinking, and careful attention to the generic, cultural, and
historical contexts of literature written in English.
100-LEVEL COURSES
At the introductory level, the department offers a range of writing-intensive 100-level courses which
focus on interpretive skills--techniques of reading--as well as skills in writing and argumentation. The
department also offers English 150, Expository Writing, a course focusing on analytic writing skills. All
100-level courses are designed primarily for first-year students, although they are open to interested sopho-
mores, juniors, and seniors. A 100-level course other than 150 is required for admission to most upper-lev-
el English courses, except in the case of students who have placed out of the introductory courses by re-
ceiving a score of 5 on the Advanced Placement examination in English Literature or of 6 or 7 on the
International Baccalaureate.
200-LEVEL COURSES
Most 200-level courses are designed primarily for qualified first-year students, sophomores, and junior
and senior non-majors, but they are open to junior and senior majors and count as major courses. Several
200-level courses have no prerequisites; see individual descriptions for details. 200-level Gateway courses
are designed for first- and second-year students who are considering becoming English Majors, or who are
interested in pursuing upper-level course work in the department. All Gateway courses are writing-inten-
sive. Completion of a Gateway course is a requirement for the major.
300-LEVEL COURSES
The majority of English Department courses are at the 300 level. 300-level courses are open to sopho-
mores, juniors, and seniors. They are normally not open to first-year students, although in exceptional cases
first-year students may enroll in a 300-level course with consent of the instructor.
400-LEVEL COURSES
400-level courses are intensive, discussion-oriented classes that place a premium on independent, stu-
dent-initiated work. Such classes can be structured in a variety of ways. A course might alternate tutorial
sessions with seminar meetings, or it might take the form of a colloquium, with discussions organized
English
­ 145 ­
around individual or group presentations on different aspects of a topic. Or a class might be oriented around
a long final paper on a topic of the student's devising and involve conferences focused on the progress of
that project. Limited to 15 students, 400-level courses are open to students who have completed at least one
300-level English course; they should be attractive to any student interested in a course that emphasizes
intensive discussion and independent work.
ADVISING
All junior and senior English majors are assigned a departmental faculty member as an advisor. Stu-
dents' preferences for advisors are solicited during the preregistration period in April, and assignments are
announced at the start of the school year.
Non-majors who wish to discuss English Department offerings are invited to see any faculty member or
the department chair.
MAJOR
Majors are urged to select a balance of intermediate and advanced courses, and to choose classes from
both the American and British traditions. Each student can fashion his or her own sequence of study within
a basic pattern that insures coherence and variety. This pattern comprises at least nine courses.
They are also urged to elect collateral courses in subjects such as art, music, history, comparative litera-
ture, philosophy, religion, theatre, and foreign languages with a view to supporting and broadening their
studies in literature. In particular, the study of classical and modern languages, as well as of foreign litera-
tures, is strongly recommended.
Requirements
The nine courses required for the major must include the following:
1) Any 100-level English class except English 150. Students exempted by the department from 100-lev-
el courses will substitute an elective course.
2) At least two courses dealing primarily with literature written before 1700 (identified in parentheses at
the end of the course description).
3) At least two courses dealing primarily with literature written between 1700 and 1900 (identified in
parentheses at the end of the course description).
4) At least one course dealing primarily with literature written after 1900 (identified in parentheses at the
end of the course description).
5) At least one "criticism" course (identified in parentheses at the end of course description). A course
fulfilling the criticism requirement entails a sustained and explicit reflection on problems of critical meth-
od, whether by engaging a range of critical approaches and their implications or by exploring a particular
method, theorist, or critic in depth. Please note that when a criticism course also deals with literature satis-
fying a historical distribution requirement (pre-1700, 1700-1900, etc.), the course may be used to satisfy
either the criticism or the chronological requirement, but not both.
6) At least one 200-level Gateway course (listed at the end of the 200-level course descriptions). Gate-
way courses are designed for first- and second-year students contemplating the major or intending to pur-
sue more advanced work in the department; these courses focus on analytical writing skills while introduc-
ing students to critical methods and historical approaches that will prove fruitful as they pursue the major.
(Note: a Gateway course can fulfill a Period or Criticism requirement as well as a Gateway requirement.)
The department will now give one elective course credit toward the major for a course taken in
literature of a foreign language, whether the course is taught in the original language or in transla-
tion. Such a course may not be used to satisfy the department's historical distribution, criticism, or
gateway requirements.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN ENGLISH
The English Department offers three different routes toward honors: a creative writing thesis, a critical
thesis, and a critical specialization. The requirements of each are described below. Candidates for the pro-
gram should normally have at least a 3.5 average in courses taken in English, but admission will not de-
pend solely on course grades. Formal application to pursue honors must be made to the director of honors
by April of the junior year. For the Class of 2006, the Director of Honors is Professor John Kleiner.
All routes require honors students to take a minimum of TEN regular-semester courses (rather than the
nine otherwise required for the major), and to devote their senior year winter study course to their honors
projects. More specifically:
Students doing a creative writing thesis must, by graduation, take at least nine regular-semester courses,
and, in addition, take English 497 (Honors Independent Study, fall) and English 031 (Honors Thesis, win-
ter study) during senior year.
Students writing a critical thesis must, by graduation, take at least eight regular-semester courses, and, in
addition, take English 497 and English 498 (Honors Independent Study, fall and spring) and English 031
(Senior Thesis, winter study) during senior year.
Students pursuing a critical specialization must, by graduation, take at least eight regular-semester
courses, and in addition, take English 497 and English 498 (Honors Independent Study, fall and spring)
and English 030 (Honors Colloquium: Specialization Route, winter study) during senior year.
A student who is highly-qualified to pursue honors, but who, for compelling reasons, is unable to pursue
a year-long project, may petition the department for permission to pursue a critical thesis or critical special-
ization over one semester and the winter study term. Since the norm for these projects is a full year, such
English
­ 146 ­
permission will be granted only in exceptional circumstances. If granted, the standards for admission and
for evaluating the final project would be identical to those that apply to year-long honors projects.
All students who wish to apply to the honors program are required to consult with a prospective faculty
advisor, as well as with the director of honors, before April of the junior year. In April, candidates submit a
1-page preliminary proposal that provides as specific a description as possible of the proposed project. The
director of honors reviews proposals with the faculty advisor, and then makes a recommendation to the
whole department. Students whose proposals are accepted receive provisional admission to the program at
this time. Students not admitted to the honors program are advised, when appropriate, about other possible
ways of pursuing their interests (e.g., independent studies, regular departmental courses).
Admitted students must consult with their advisors before the end of the spring semester of junior year
to discuss reading or work pertinent to writing the formal honors prospectus. This prospectus is a decisive
factor in final admission to the program. The prospectus must be submitted to the Director of Honors and
the advisor (two copies) by July 30 before the fall of senior year. After reviewing the prospectuses and
consulting with advisors, the department's honors committee determines final admission to the program.
Applicants are notified during the first week of the fall term.
While grades for the fall and winter study terms are deferred until both the honors project and review
process are completed, students must do the equivalent of at least B+ work to continue in the program.
Should the student's work in the fall semester not meet this minimal standard, the course will convert to a
standard independent study (English 397), and the student will register for a regular winter study project. A
student engaged in a year-long project must likewise perform satisfactorily in winter study (English 030 or
031) to enroll in English 498 in the spring semester. When such is not the case, the winter study course will
be converted to an independent study "99."
Students are required to submit to their advisor, on the due dates specified below, three final copies of
their written work. While letter grades for honors courses are assigned by the faculty advisor, the recom-
mendation about honors is made by two other faculty members, who serve as readers of the student's
work. These readers, after consulting with the faculty advisor, report their recommendation to the whole
department, which awards either Highest Honors, Honors, or no honors. Honors of any kind are contin-
gent upon satisfactory completion of courses in the major during the spring semester of the senior year.
Highest honors are normally awarded only to students whose performance in both the honors program and
regular courses in the major has been exceptional. All students who are awarded honors participate in a
series of informal presentations at the end of the spring term in senior year.
Creative Writing Thesis
The creative writing thesis involves the completion of a significant body of fiction or poetry during the
fall semester and winter study of the senior year. (With permission of the honors committee, the thesis may
be undertaken during the winter study period and the spring semester of the senior year.) Since a student
will most likely include in the thesis writing done in earlier semesters, a creative writing thesis usually
involves only the fall semester and the winter study period, rather than the full year allotted to complete the
critical essay.
Requirements for admission include outstanding work in an introductory and an advanced workshop, a
recommendation from one of the creative writing teachers (who will then act as thesis advisor), a brief
preliminary proposal, and the approval of the departmental honors committee. No formal prospectus is
necessary. A creative writing thesis begun in the fall is due on the last day of winter study. The methods of
evaluation are identical to those for critical projects (but their page limits do not apply).
Critical Thesis
The critical thesis involves writing a substantial scholarly and/or critical essay during both semesters as
well as the winter study period of the senior year. The formal prospectus, a 2- to 3-page description of the
thesis project, should present a coherent proposal indicating the range of the thesis, the questions to be
investigated, the methods to be used, and the arguments likely to be considered, along with a brief bibliog-
raphy.
Significant progress on the thesis, including a substantial amount of writing (to be determined by student
and advisor), is required by the end of the fall semester. A first draft of the thesis must be completed by the
end of the winter study period. The spring semester is to be devoted to revising and refining the work and to
shaping its several chapters into a unified argument. Ideally, the length of the honors essay will be about
15,000 words (roughly 45 pages). In no case should the thesis be longer than 25,000 words, including
notes. The finished thesis is due on the second Friday following spring break.
Critical Specialization
The critical specialization route is intended to provide students with an opportunity for making a series
of forays into an area of interest that is both broad in scope and related to work undertaken in at least two
courses. At least one of these courses must be in the English Department, and both need to have been taken
by the end of fall term in senior year. The critical specialization must be united by a common area of inter-
est, such as a given literary form or historical period, a topic that cuts across several periods, an issue in
literary theory, a topic that connects literary and cultural issues, a comparative literature or interdisciplinary
topic. Students are encouraged to propose specialization topics of their own devising. The following exam-
ples are meant only to suggest the kinds of topics appropriate to a critical specialization: lyric traditions,
postmodern narrative, magic realism, Dante and modern literature, Freud and literature, the poet as citizen,
new historicist approaches to literature, feminist film criticism.
English
­ 147 ­
In addition to reading primary works, the student is expected to read secondary sources, which describe
or define issues critical to the area of specialization. The formal prospectus, a 2- to 3-page description of the
project, should specify the area and range of the study, the issues likely to be explored, and the methods to
be used for their investigation. This prospectus should also describe the relation between previous course
work and the proposed specialization, and include a brief bibliography of secondary works. The pursuit of
the specialization route requires the following: (1) writing a set of three essays, each about 10 pages long (a
page being approximately 250 words), which together advance a flexibly-related set of arguments. The
first two essays are due by the end of the fall semester, and the third by the end of winter study; (2) develop-
ing an extended annotated bibliography (about 4-5 pages long) of selected secondary sources, explaining
their importance to the area of specialization (due mid-February); (3) meeting with the three faculty evalu-
ators (one of whom is the advisor) during the last two weeks in February to discuss the trio of essays and
the annotated bibliography; (4) writing a fourth essay of 10-12 pages, the purpose of which is to consider
matters that arose during the faculty-student discussion and to reflect on the evolution and outcome of the
intellectual journey undertaken by the student. This final essay is due on the second Friday after spring
break.
The same three faculty members are involved throughout the assessment process, and the standards and
methods of evaluation are the same as for other kinds of honors projects, with the following exception: For
the specialization route, the evaluation will also include the student's performance in the discussion with
the three faculty readers, and that discussion will include not only the student's writing but also secondary
sources.
COURSES
100-LEVEL COURSES (except English 150)
Through small class discussions (limited in size to 19 students per section) and frequent writing
assignments, 100-level English courses ask students to develop their skills as readers and as analyti-
cal writers. Each course assigns 20 pages of writing in various forms. These courses are prerequi-
sites for taking most other English courses. Students who receive a 5 on the AP English Literature
exam may take upper-level courses without first taking a 100-level. All 100-level English courses
are writing intensive.

ENGL 114(F) Literary Speakers (W)
The general purpose of this course is to develop students' skills as interpreters of poetry and short fiction. Its
particular focus is on how--and with what effects--poets create the voices of their poems, and fiction writers
create their narrators. We'll consider the ways in which literary speakers inform and entice, persuade and some-
times deceive, their audiences. Readings will include texts from various historical periods, with particular em-
phasis on the twentieth century (including works by James Joyce, Henry James, Vladimir Nabokov, Robert
Frost, Toni Cade Bambara, Raymond Carver, and Seamus Heaney).
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: a discussion class with emphasis on close reading and frequent, care-
ful writing (about 20 pages, in the form of short papers).
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference given to first-year students.

ENGL 115(F,S) Narrative and Narrative Experience (W)
Forming and sharing and thinking about stories is our primary way of organizing experience: through them we
make life and the world understandable and open to mastery. In this course we will read narratives across time,
from antiquity to the present day, and across their wide diversity of forms, from poetry to novels to comic books,
from plays to film and television. We will investigate the ways in which narrative has been put to use as an orga-
nizer of experience, and the ways in which it has been put to use in specific historical and political situations.
Possible authors and works include Homer, Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Conan Doyle, Joyce, Nabokov,
and Shakespeare, among others.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: 20 pages of writing in the form of short papers. No prerequisites.

ENGL 116(F,S) The Ethics of Fiction (W)
Can made up stories actually be bad for you? (Plato seems to have thought so.) Conversely, can they do you any
good, even transform your vision of what it means to be good? Can reading fiction, that is, shape your moral
character? Or is literature really just entertainment, however sophisticated and intellectually challenging? In this
course, we will explore questions like these about the ethics of fiction, questions that have inspired some
English
­ 148 ­
practitioners of the art to make claims such as: "Surely one of the novel's habitual aims is to articulate morality, to
sharpen the reader's sense of vice and virtue" (John Updike); "You write in order to change the world...and if you
alter, even by a millimeter, the way a person looks at reality, then you can change it" (James Baldwin); "...a writer
[is] as an architect of the soul" (Doris Lessing); "Naturally you're aware that bad art can finally cripple a man"
(Saul Bellow). If you are curious about the subject of ethics, enjoy reading narrative fictions, and are interested in
thinking about the connection between the two, this may be the class for you. We will read a varied selection of
fiction along with a fair amount of scholarship on the links between moral philosophy and narrative forms in
order to refine the critical language we have at our disposal. Writers we will likely read are: James Baldwin,
Wayne Booth, J.M. Coetzee, Fyodor Dostoevsky, George Eliot, Henry James, Doris Lessing, Iris Murdoch,
Martha Nussbaum, Tim O'Brien, and Jean-Paul Sartre.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: active class participation and five papers totaling 20 pages.

This course has a clear purpose. If you had signed up for a course in biology, you would know that you were
about to embark on the systematic study of living organisms. If you were registered for a course on the American
Civil War, you would know that there had been an armed conflict between the northern and southern states in the
1860s. But if you decide you want to study "culture," what exactly is it that you are studying? The aim of this
course is not to come up with handy and reassuring definitions for this word, but to show you why it is so hard to
come up with such definitions. People fight about what the word "culture" means, and our main business will be
to get an overview of that conceptual brawl. We will pay special attention to the conflict between those thinkers
who see culture as a realm of freedom or equality or independence or critical thought and those thinkers who see
culture as a special form of bondage, a prison without walls. The course will be organized around short theoreti-
cal readings by authors ranging from Matthew Arnold to Constance Penley, but we will also, in order to put our
new ideas to the test, watch several films (Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Silence of the Lambs, The Lord of the Rings)
and listen to a lot of rock & roll. Why do you think culture matters? Once you stop to pose that question, there's
no turning back.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: five short papers totaling about 20 pages, class attendance and partic-
ipation.

ENGL 120(F,S) The Nature of Narrative (Same as Comparative Literature 111) (W)*
(See under Comparative Literature for full description.)
ENGL 123(F) Borrowing and Stealing: Originality in Literature and Culture (W)
Someone once said that bad poets borrow and good poets steal, thus suggesting that acts of theft, as well as their
subsequent cover-ups, may lie behind some of the best and seemingly most original works of art in history. And
it's not just the poets. More recently, an exhibition of artworks that employ copyrighted material, called "Illegal
Art," has directly challenged current U.S. copyright law. Given the ubiquity of visual, electronic, and audio sam-
pling in contemporary art, one might wonder if anyone even bothers to create alibis for today's artistic thefts.
This course will investigate ideas about artistic and intellectual influence, inspiration, borrowing, revision, ap-
propriation, and outright stealing. We'll ask a series of questions as we look at a variety of material, mostly liter-
ary, but also visual and musical, that troubles ideas about novel and derivative art. What's so original about origi-
nal art? Where does influence stop and plagiarism begin? What must be forgotten, or remembered, about earlier
works of art for a new one to appear to be just that--new? What becomes of our image of the artist as a lone
figure of genius in works that make ample use of others' material? The course will consider these questions in
part by reading various theories of originality and imitation, as well as recent re-workings of older literary texts,
such as a contemporary re-writing of Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray by novelist Will Self (in a book
sub-titled "An Imitation"). We'll listen to music that relies heavily on the sampling of other works, as well as look
at collage art in various forms. In addition we will read new considerations of copyright law by legal scholars to
gain some sense of originality's shifting legal status. Throughout, we'll refine our sense of the relations among
fiction, art, originality, and imitation by studying some of the best acts of artistic and intellectual theft of the recent
past. Possible authors and works to be studied include Wordsworth and Coleridge, Oscar Wilde, Sigmund Freud,
Vladimir Nabokov, Andy Warhol, Will Self, and essays on copyright law.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: 20 pages of writing in the form of frequent short papers, active class

ENGL 126(S) Stupidity and Intelligence (W)
Stupidity fascinates authors, and they do not merely despise it--they feel it and make us feel it. Why? Around the
same time that psychologists began measuring and ranking intelligence--and stupidity, under various names, of
course occupied the space below (average) intelligence--literary authors were finding types of stupidity within
intelligence. What is stupidity? Why can't it stay sequestered from intelligence? Is there such a thing as literary
stupidity? (Can one be specifically a bad reader not only of books but of life?) What are the problems of intelli-

ENGL 129(F) Twentieth-Century Black Poets (W)*
From Langston Hughes to contemporary poets such as Amiri Baraka and Angela Jackson, African American
poets have been preoccupied with the relations of poetry to other traditions. Vernacular speech, English poetry,
jazz and other musical forms, folk humor and African mythology have all been seen as essential sources for
black poetry. This course will survey major poets such as Hughes, James Weldon Johnson, Countee Cullen,
Robert Hayden, Gwendolyn Brooks, Baraka, Jackson, and Yusef Komunyakaa, reading their poems and their
essays and interviews about poetic craft. We will ask how black poetry has been defined and whether there is a
single black poetic tradition or several.

ENGL 141(F) John Keats (W)
An easeful concentration distinguishes John Keats's superlative poetic gift. Something like it also animates the
letters he wrote to family and friends: an unpretentious readiness to chat about this or that will suddenly flare up
into insights that last an hour, a week, a lifetime. Even the poet's career fits this model. Nothing to write home
about when he got started in his late teens, the poetry of Keats rose, within the few years he had left, to the highest
lyric order, thing after thing of that beauty which, a Grecian urn whispered, was also truth. A focussed semester
will let us read just about everything Keats wrote in prose and verse, together with a recent biography to help us
place what we read within the developing arc of a career pursued under mortal pressure, and with a grace that
we'll look for in the man as well as the words.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: several short papers, one longer one, a little poetry-writing on the
side.

ENGL 145(S) Reading and Writing Science Fiction (W)
This course will explore some of the themes and techniques of modern science fiction by examining a range of
published stories, while at the same time making some new stories of our own. Writers of fiction and non-fiction
often watch each other with suspicion, as if from opposing sides of an obvious frontier. Though the goals of both
forms of writing--the disciplined articulation of brainy thoughts and mighty feelings--are similar, there is a
tendency in both camps to think their methods different and exclusive. The conceit of this class is to imagine that
constructing a plot and constructing an argument, say, are complementary skills, and that the tricks and tech-
niques of one type of writing can profitably be applied to the other. With this in mind, the class is made of two
strands twisted together--a creative writing workshop and a course in critical analysis. There will be short week-
ly assignments in both types of writing, as well as two larger projects: an original science fiction short story and a
critical essay. Assigned readings will include stories and essays by Terry Bisson, Octavia Butler, Rachel Pollack,
Samuel R. Delaney, Karen Joy Fowler, Carol Emshwiller, and John Crowley.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: active participation in class and a minimum of 20 pages of writing,
both critical and creative.

of the Critical Reasoning and Analytical Skills initiative.

ENGL 146(F) Defining Forms: Genre and Interpretation (W)
A writer or artist or filmmaker who decides to create something inevitably has to choose what kind of thing he or
she is going to make. And that choice of form--whether it be a sonnet or a slasher film--affects the artist's
rendering of reality. What is more, our understanding of a work of art is often informed by what kind of work we
think it is; in order to interpret a work of art we often group it with other works by content, form, or style. Genre,
then, is significant in both the creation and understanding of any work of art. This of course raises all kinds of
questions: How do genres shape the ways we understand our experience? How do different imaginative forms
English
­ 150 ­
relate to reality--in other words, how do they reflect and/or frame reality for us? How is our understanding of
experience mediated by literary and artistic forms? In what ways do different genres serve as barometers of social
and cultural concerns? Do certain genres promote certain values or ideological assumptions? Does a writer's
taking up a particular genre constrain creativity or enable it? To try to answer some of these questions we will
read from a number of poetic genres (love sonnets, dramatic monologues, etc.) and then examine several revenge
tragedies; we will also look at some painting (particularly Dutch genre painting), and several film genres
(including westerns and gangster films).
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: three short papers (5-7) pages and several shorter writing
assignments, as well as active class participation.

ENGL 148(F) Life as Fact and Fantasy (W)
"We tell ourselves stories in order to live," writes Joan Didion, suggesting that the urge to create narrative is basic
to our understanding of ourselves, more basic, perhaps, than the need to understand our existence completely and
accurately. This class will examine the meaning of truth when it is applied to the way we understand our lives.
We'll look at the philosophical foundations of the idea that life may be examined objectively and at the ways in
which various authors have responded to the impulse to make stories of their lives. Is identity necessarily a mys-
tery? Is "creative nonfiction" a contradiction in terms? Reading will include literature--factual and fictional--by
Plato, Hume, Defoe, Chekhov, Tolstoy, Capote, Didion, Frey and others.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: active class participation, and five papers totaling 20 pages.

ENGL 209(F) American Literature: Origins to 1865 (Same as American Studies 209)
What is American literature? This course will examine the variety of answers that have been made to this ques-
tion, and the way that those answers differently articulate both what counts as "America" and what counts as
literature. One tradition will be at the center of the story: from Puritans (such as the poets Edward Taylor and
Anne Bradstreet, and the theologian Jonathan Edwards) through the major writers of the American Renaissance
(Emerson, Hawthorne,Thoreau). Along the way, we will consider other American traditions as well: Native
American trickster stories, conquistador literature. In the eighteenth century, we will take up such Enlightenment
writers as Jefferson and Franklin; in the nineteenth, such abolitionist writers as Douglass and Jacobs. Working
through the differences among different figures, eras, and genres we will be asking what makes a literary tradi-
tion: temporal progression, thematic consistency, national identity, etc.? And consider, too, what the way we
construct American literature means for our understanding of the nation today.

texts--both fiction and poetry. We will situate these works not only within the literary movements of the time
(e.g., realism, modernism, and postmodernism), but also within other important historical and cultural occur-
rences (e.g., immigration and migration, civil rights, commodity culture). Throughout, the emphasis will be on
the diverse, sometimes conflicting traditions that make up the American literary canon. Readings may include
works by such authors as Twain, Chopin, Chesnutt, Hemingway, Hughes, Hurston, Faulkner, Ellison, Ginsberg,
Pynchon, Morrison, and Cisneros.

ENGL 248T(S) Bearing Witness (W)
"And I only am escaped alone to tell thee," says the messenger who reports back to Job the disaster he has wit-
nessed. This course will focus on the figure of the "sole survivor," the one who alone returns from a harrowing
ordeal to tell the world the story of what happened. We will ask: what motives and pressures propel the lone
survivor to narrate the experience s/he has undergone? how do these pressures influence the shaping of the story?
In what ways do the stories of "sole survivors" become part of a collective, social account? In the first section of
the course, students will read a number of pre-20th-century narratives of "sole survival," including the books of
Job and Ezekial from the Old Testament, Dante's Inferno, and Blake's Marriage of Heaven and Hell. The final
two sections of the course will each focus on a 20th-century historical event in which survivor testimony has
played an important role: the Holocaust (here, materials will include Lanzmann's documentary film Shoah, Pri-
mo Levi's Survival in Auschwitz, the poetry of Paul Celan, and Art Spiegelman's Mauss); and the proceedings of
South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission following the dismantling of apartheid (here, materials will
include transcripts of testimony, the Handspring Theater's Ubu and the Truth Commission, and Antjie Krog's
Country of my Skull).
Format: tutorial. Students will meet in pairs with the instructor once a week; one student will present a short
analytical paper on the texts covered that week, and the other will write a response paper and join the instructor in
a discussion of both papers. Evaluation will be based on the quality of written work, discussions and oral presen-
tations.

ENGL 249T(F) Hitchcock and Psychoanalytic Theory (W)
While Alfred Hitchcock is best known as the creator of many of Hollywood's most entertaining and enduringly
popular movies, his films have also inspired a large body of impressively searching theoretical and critical work,
particularly in the field of psychoanalytic film criticism. In this tutorial course, intended primarily for
sophomores who have already taken an introductory course in cinema, we will use several of Hitchcock's films
as the staging ground for explorations of psychoanalytic theory and its applicability to popular culture. We will
not be concerned with applying psychoanalytic ideas to Hitchcock's life, as if they constituted the hidden key to
the significance of his filmmaking. Rather, we will explore the ways in which psychoanalytic paradigms might
illuminate the psychology and behavior of his characters, the narrative structures of his films, and the nature and
dynamics of a spectator's engagement with the films. Topics to be discussed will include sadism and masochism,
voyeurism, the uncanny, fetishism, incest and oedipal conflict, repression, and the strange itineraries of desire. No
prior knowledge of psychoanalytic theory is assumed; indeed, this course is meant to serve in part as a brief
introduction to Freudian theory, which will provide the focus of the opening weeks of the course. After this basic
foundation has been laid, readings in psychoanalysis will focus on particular psychoanalytic concepts and
phenomena which have special relevance to a given film. Assignments will include theoretical writing by Freud
above all, but also contemporary feminist, queer, and film theory and criticism by such authors as John Berger,
English
­ 153 ­
Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, Laura Mulvey, Tania Modleski, Christian Metz, Mary Ann Doane, and Stephen
Heath. Films to be studied will include Rebecca, Strangers on a Train, Notorious, Spellbound, Shadow of a
Doubt, Rear Window, Vertigo, and Psycho. A week's assignment, apart from writing, will normally comprise
one film screening and one to three essays on psychoanalytic theory and/or film criticism.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: After two weeks in which we will meet as a group to discuss Freudian theory,
students will meet with the instructor in pairs for one hour each week during the rest of the semester. They will
write a 5- to 6-page paper every other week (five in all), and comment on their partners' papers in alternate
weeks. Emphasis will be placed on developing skills not only in reading, viewing, and interpretation, but also in
constructing critical arguments and responding to them in written and oral critiques.
Prerequisites: a 100-level English course (except English 150), and English 203 or English 204 or equivalent

The personal essay as a literary form has been the site of some of the most inventive and beautiful writing of
recent decades; it is also a form with a long history. This is a course in creative writing, but much of our time will
be given over to literary analysis and imitation. We will trace the history of the form--beginning with essays by
Michel de Montaigne, continuing through the eighteenth, nineteenth and twentieth centuries (Samuel Johnson,
Henry David Thoreau, Virginia Woolf, George Orwell, James Baldwin, James Agee, Truman Capote, Hunter S.
Thompson), and moving into the present. Of contemporary work we will focus primarily on American essayists:
including Joan Didion, Annie Dillard, Harry Crews, Nicholson Baker, John Edgar Wideman, Alice Walker, Da-
vid Foster Wallace, Geoff Dyer, Anne Carson. As this list of names suggests, we will explore the wide range of
writing described by the term "personal essay" including literary journalism, creative nonfiction, memoir and the
lyric essay. Throughout the semester we will consider the particular challenges of this form in respect to point of
view, tone, truth-telling and narrative structure.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based upon class participation (seminar and writing workshop format) and
writing (critical and creative essays).

GATEWAY COURSES
200-level "Gateway" courses are designed for first- and second-year students contemplating the
major or intending to pursue more advanced work in the department; these courses focus on analyti-
cal writing skills while introducing students to critical and historical approaches that will prove
fruitful in later courses. (Note: a Gateway course can fulfill a Period or Criticism requirement as
well as a Gateway requirement. Students contemplating the English major are strongly urged to
take a Gateway course by the end of Sophomore year.)
ENGL 222(F) Studies in the Lyric (Gateway) (W)
This discussion course is designed to introduce students considering the major to the study of lyric poetry by
raising three fundamental questions: How does one read a lyric? How does one talk about a lyric? How does one
English
­ 154 ­
write about a lyric? In the first half of the course we will read groups of poems from a range of historical periods
in order to examine the various elements that make up a poem (line breaks, tone, image, versification, form, lyric
audience). In the second half of the course we will focus on two writers, John Donne and Robert Frost, to see
how an individual poet uses and adapts lyric conventions to develop a distinctive style and vision.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: active class participation and frequent short writing assignments.
Prerequisites: a 100-level English course, except 150. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference given to
first-year students, sophomores, and English majors who have yet to take a Gateway.

ENGL 230(F,S) Introduction to Literary Theory (Gateway) (Same as Comparative Literature 240)
(W)
In this course we will engage with the major arguments in the field of literary theory. Yet it is important that this is
not a catch-all survey class; rather, we will be conducting a continuing debate about the nature of literary mean-
ing and the relationship of such meaning to political and moral problems. Thus we will ask, What determines the
meaning of a text? How can an interpretation of a literary work be deemed true or false? Is the relationship of
literature to politics foundational or peripheral? Is criticism a moral practice? Readings include W. K. Wimsatt
and Monroe Beardsley, Paul De Man, Stanley Fish, Judith Butler, Anthony Appiah, Richard Rorty, and Martha
Nussbaum.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: several short papers amounting to 20 pages of writing and an in-class
presentation.

ENGL 237(S) Gender and Desire 1200-1600 (Same as Comparative Literature 237 and Women's
and Gender Studies 237) (Gateway) (W)
The Middle Ages invented--and the Renaissance refined--the notion of "courtly love"--the humble devotion
of an adoring knight to a beautiful but distant lady. In both its medieval and early modern versions, courtly love
institutionalized the notion of the desiring male subject and the desired female object that continues to reverberate
in contemporary culture. But medieval and Renaissance works do not always, or even usually, endorse these
positions uncritically, and even works that elevate heterosexual love open up surprisingly large spaces for other
kinds of desire. What does it mean, for example, that the fountain of Narcissus occupies the center of the garden
of courtly love in the Romance of the Rose? That despite the Lover's proclaimed desire to "possess" the Rose, it
is the male God of Love he kisses on the mouth? Shakespeare's comedies end famously with triple and quadru-
ple marriages, but how should we read the cross-dressing and gender confusion that occupy so much of the plots
beforehand? As we explore these and other issues, we will supplement our literary readings with theoretical texts
drawn from medieval and Renaissance treatises as well as contemporary feminist, psychoanalytic, and queer
theory. The goal of the course is to sharpen critical reading and writing skills across a broad range of literary
forms and historical, cultural and aesthetic values.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: class participation, four or five papers of varying lengths including
one revision, and occasional oral reports.

In this course, we'll consider detective fiction in the largest sense of that designation, works fromOedipus Rex to
Hitchcock's Rear Window, from Freud's Case Histories to Faulkner's small town Gothics, from potboilers to
Othello. What can these works tell us about interpretive method? (In literature, as in life, we're all detectives, of

ENGL 256(S) Culture and Colonialism: An Introduction (Gateway) (W)
There are many who would argue that the most important event of the twentieth century was neither the Russian
Revolution nor World War II nor the eventual collapse of state communism, but rather the crumbling of the old
European empires, the end of Europe's formal dominion over the non-European world. If you are interested in
literature and start thinking about the history of empire, some interesting questions emerge: A people can decolo-
nize the state; that is, they can send foreign soldiers and governors back where they came from. They might even
be able to decolonize the economy; that is, they might be able to build independent economic institutions for the
benefit of local people. But can a people decolonize culturally? Can you decolonize your beliefs and your lan-
guage and your habits and your arts? Can you, in short, decolonize your head? Should you even bother trying?
What would a decolonized culture even look like? This course will serve as an introduction to these and related
questions: Is European literature imperialist, by nature or by tendency? Is there such a thing as cultural imperial-
ism? Does it operate even in the absence of genuine empires? Does empire generate distinct kinds of writing?
What kind of choices do colonized writers (and other artists) face when trying to address imperialism and its
aftermath?
None of these questions have unambiguous answers. The course will be organized around short theoretical read-
ings--from Franz Fanon, Edward Said, Gayatri Spivak and many others. And we will also, in order to put our
new ideas to the test, read a number of poems and watch several movies, from Homer's Odyssey to Zacharias
Kanuk's The Fast Runner, an Inuit feature released in 2001.

ENGL 258(S) Poetry and the City (Gateway) (W)
In this course we will consider poems generated out of the experiences of urban life. The city provides for poets a
vivid mental and imaginative landscape in which to consider the relation of vice and squalor to glamour; the
nature of anonymity and distinction; and the pressure of myriad bodies on individual consciousness. We will
explore ways in which the poet's role in the body politic emerges in representations of the city as a site both of
civilized values and/or struggles for power marked by guile and betrayal. Taking into account the ways in which
cities have been transformed over time by changing social and economic conditions, we will consider such issues
as what the New York of the 1950s has to do with the London of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centu-
ries, and why poetry as a genre might be particularly suited to representing the shifting aspects of urban life. Poets
will include Dante, Pope, Swift, Blake, Wordsworth, Whitman, Baudelaire, Arnold, Yeats, Crane, Moore, Au-
den, Hughes, Bishop, Ginsberg, Baraka, and Ashbery. We will also draw on essays by Simmel, Benjamin, Wil-
liams, Canetti, and Davis; photographs by Hines, Weegee, and Abbott; the blues, as sung by Holliday and Vaug-
han; and films such as Man with a Movie Camera, Vertigo, Breathless, and Collateral.

Malory, circa 1100-1500. We will pay special attention to the ways in which British/English nationalism, Celtic
magic, French courtly values (those connected with love and chivalry in particular), and Christian morality com-
bine and recombine to produce ever new meaning in familiar elements of the plot: Arthur's birth and establish-
ment as king, the fellowship and adventures of his followers, the adulterous love triangle, the Quest for the Holy
Grail, and, finally, Arthur's death.

ENGL 313(S) Interpretation and Doubt: Shakespeare's Poems and Plays
This course begins with Shakespeare's Sonnets, some of the most mysterious, haunting, and widely debated
poems in the English language. Much of what happens in the sonnets is so intimate, so fraught with desire and
potential scandal, that Shakespeare only hints at what cannot be said. Brilliantly crafted sonnets exist in tension
with the unstable, distraught speaker in the poems, who, like characters in the plays, is embroiled in events and
relationships he only partially comprehends. The interpretive crisis precipitated by the sonnets is reenacted over
and over again in "A Lover's Complaint," Much Ado about Nothing, All's Well that Ends Well, Hamlet, Othello,
Antony and Cleopatra, and A Winter's Tale. We will explore questions of interpretation and cause for doubt in all
these texts. How do interior thought and external circumstance, self-representation and rhetorical persuasion,
truth and deception interact? To what extent do the love affairs in the comedies, tragedies, and romances, like the
lovers' triangle between the sonnet speaker, the young man, and the dark lady, inscribe or expose sexual stereo-
types? How can judgment and interpretation proceed when doubt continually complicates and unravels "simple
truth"?

ENGL 321(S) Samuel Johnson and the Literary Tradition
Johnson has been exceptionally influential not only because he was a distinguished writer of poems, essays, criti-
cism, and biographies, but also because he was the first true historian of English literature, the first who sought to
define its "tradition." We will read Johnson's own works and Boswell's Life of Johnson to discover Johnson's
talents, tastes, and standards as an artist, as a moral and literary critic, and as a man. We next will use Johnson's
Preface to Shakespeare and Lives of the English Poets to examine how this great intelligence assessed writers
from the Renaissance through the eighteenth century. While reading his commentary on Shakespeare and his
critical biographies of Milton, Dryden, Pope, Swift, and Gray, we will analyze selected works by these writers so
as to evaluate Johnson's views and to sharpen our understanding of the relationships between his standards and
our own.

ENGL 322T(S) Novel Arguments (W)
What does it mean to say that a novel has an argument--that, in other words, it advocates certain beliefs and
offers reasons in support of them? We will examine this central question through close reading of European and
American nineteenth-century novels by authors including Jane Austen, Charles Dickens, Harriet Beecher Stowe,
Gustave Flaubert, and Mark Twain. The history of the novel in the nineteenth century is one of contending
ambitions: social commentary, popular entertainment, and "high" art. Studying this period of literary history is,
therefore, ideally suited for an inquiry into theoretical concerns about the meanings of fiction, among them: In
what sense can fiction persuade? Are particular beliefs or principles "argued" by the form of the novel, even
against an author's conscious wishes? To explore these questions, we will also read critical works exemplifying
differing answers to the question of how the novel possesses arguments about issues such as class, industry,
slavery, and consumer culture.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: Students will meet with the instructor in pairs for one hour each week. They will
alternate between writing 5- to 7-page papers and commentaries on their partner's papers. Students will be
evaluated on their written work, their oral presentations of that work, their analyses of their colleague's work, and
on a final, comprehensive essay that will address the themes engaged in the tutorial.

ENGL 324(F) Topics in Eighteenth-Century Literature
While not a survey, this course will explore a wide range of literature of the eighteenth century. Topics and areas
of possible focus might be: the invention of what we would call public discourse at the beginning of the century,
in satires and in newspapers; the development of the novel; the appearance of a female reading public, and the
associated increase in the number of popular, publishing women writers; the beginnings of American literature;
the literature of feeling and sensibility; and the ways the growing British Empire is enabled by and depicted in
culture. Possible authors studied might include Jonathan Swift, Alexander Pope, Eliza Haywood, Ben Franklin,
Henry Fielding, Fanny Burney, Oliver Goldsmith and Thomas Gray.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: class attendance and participation, three essays of about seven pages
each.

ENGL 327(S) Fictions of the British Raj *
The great impact of the British Raj--the 200-year dominion of the British Empire over most of the Indian sub-
continent--on the people of what we now know as India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh sometimes leads us to forget
how powerfully India influenced the British in turn. British colonizers found themselves both fascinated and, in
turn, subtly shaped by the largely imaginary India that their ideology had led them to project, and as the Empire's
struggle to control a vast and bewilderingly diverse land showed increasing strains, they were forced to recognize
the ways in which what it meant to be English had been distorted and re-defined by their projections and by the
exercise of their own power. Conversely, educated Indians were induced to construct for themselves hybrid, An-
glicized identities and modes of behavior that complicated their social and political relations with the less fortu-
nate majority of their fellow Indians. This course focuses principally on fiction about India written in English
during the last half-century of the Raj (1900-1947), by both Indian and British novelists. In it we will consider
such issues as what it might mean to be "authentically" Indian; how religion complicates political identity and
behavior in British India; to what extent adapting to British structures of authority--even simply writing in En-
glish--may compromise an Indian's efforts to speak and act for his or her people; how the politics of coloniza-
tion are reflected in ideologies and conflicts of gender; in what ways the identity and social relations of both
Anglo-Indian and indigenous communities were changed by the emergence of nationalist movements such as
Gandhi's Congress party and the Muslim League; and how such socio-political issues are mediated in the
successive modes of fiction (Victorian romance, modernism, social realism) adopted by the writers we will stu-
dy. While some readings will introduce important religious and political contexts, as well as theoretical models
for understanding colonialist ideologies, our principal analytic attention will be literary, focused on novels such
as Kipling's Kim, Forster's A Passage to India, Narayan's Swami and Friends, Anand's Untouchable, and Rao's
Kanthapura. We will also study films by the great Indian director Satyajit Ray, and may read one or two works
translated into English from Bengali (e.g., Tagore's The Home and the World) or set in our period but written
after it (e.g., Rushdie's Midnight's Children).

ENGL 330(F) Victorian Relativity
Is everything relative? Absolutely. Did it always use to be? Well, that depends. It depended a lot, during the
nineteenth century, on the literary imagination as it gave shape to new cultural forms. The dramatic monologue,
the split-level or skew-narrated novel, children's and social-science fiction, philosophical dialogue were literary
modes that, steeped in ambivalence over headlong capitalism and emergent democracy, exercised the Victorian
mind in such habits of thought as Darwin's radical ecology presupposed and Einstein's equations codified. We'll
sample the genres just named in fictions by James Hogg, Emily Brontë, Herman Melville, R. L. Stevenson,
English
­ 158 ­
Bram Stoker, Henry James; poems by Tennyson, the Brownings, the Rossettis, Augusta Webster; essays by J. S.

guiding class discussion. In addition, we'll also take a more or less deep plunge into IVANHOE: not the Scott
novel, but a digital game for multiple players, based on a mainframe at my home institution in Virginia, that's all
about textual manipulation and offers a relativizing education in itself.

ENGL 333(F) The Nineteenth-Century Novel
Imagine this: a form of art and entertainment that purports to be able to represent everything--intimate, even
inaccessible human thoughts and feelings, love, class, the city, shopping, sexuality, bureaucracy, social bonds,
industrialization, nationalism, even modernity itself. In this course we'll try to understand the scope of the nine-
teenth-century novel's jaw-dropping representational aspirations: its claim to comprehend in its pages both the
dizzying complexity of new social, political, and economic structures, as well as delineate in finest detail the
texture of individual minds and lives. We'll pay attention to the fictional modes by which apparently intractable
social problems are resolved, through a sleight of hand act we seem never to tire of, in the realm of romantic love.
And while we might think of the nineteenth-century novel as an Empire of the Little, endlessly occupied with
giving significance to the smallest acts of ordinary human life, we'll think about the broader historical and social
conditions the novel both represents in its pages, and is a crucial not-so-silent partner in promoting and contes-
ting. We'll also interest ourselves in the kind of under-the-counter work the Victorian novel does on behalf of
British empire, as well as empire's own behind-the-scenes work for the novel. Since so many of these stories of
everyday life seem as familiar to us as everyday life, we'll work hard to maintain what is strange and specific
about the nineteenth century even as we recognize within these works the birth of so much that is modern in our
own culture. Likely authors include: Austen, C. Brontë, Thackeray, Dickens, Eliot, Collins, Wilde, Hardy, Con-
rad.

ENGL 338(F) Literature of the American Renaissance (Same as American Studies 338)
In the United States, the 1840s and 1850s produced a clutch of writers--Emerson, Hawthorne, Melville, Whit-
man, Poe, and Dickinson--whose works were framed as the "American Renaissance," a watershed of American
literary history. Controversially added to this canon--in a gesture that greatly expanded the field, but which also
had the effect of misrepresenting it as an era in which white and African-American, and male and female shared
a single literary field--were major works by Frederick Douglass and Harriet Beecher Stowe. To undertake a
study of the American Renaissance is, then, to have the pleasure of exploring an inordinately rich period of liter-
ary history, and the challenge of negotiating and explaining the links of works that have dramatically distinct
relationships to the literary culture and to national politics. These writers share more broadly in a historical shift in
the construction of private life: historians and cultural theorists explain that the rise of the nuclear family, the
discipline of psychology, and the idea that one's emotions are a form of personal property of the utmost impor-
tance, are recent formations, just taking shape in the nineteenth century. American authors in the antebellum era
(the decades before the Civil War) all share a complex investigation into the life of the emotions, the concept of
personal experience, and the representation of intimate human relationships. As we move through fiction by
Hawthorne, Melville, Stowe, and Harriet Wilson, the poetry of Whitman and Dickinson, and the essay and auto-
English
­ 159 ­
biography of Emerson, Thoreau, and Douglass, we will explore throughout how these authors deploy emotion,
how they conceive of emotion's relationship to the individual person and to the culture at large, and how they
variously dramatize the affective leverage of relationships, including heterosexual romantic relationships, rela-
tionships of slaves to their owners, and masculine relationships both homosocial and erotic. We will explore this
essential period of American literature, then, by inquiring into the ways these authors figure intimacy, emotion,
and experience, as a venue to explore more broadly the formations of literary work and its interventions into the
culture of a nation heading toward Civil War.

ENGL 342(S) Representing Sexualities: U.S. Traditions (Same as Women's and Gender Studies
342) (W)
In this course we will explore the way literary and other cultural texts produced in the U.S. represent and
construct queer sexualities. We will start with works considered to be some of the "first" definitively and/or
openly queer writings in America, and consider how they set the terms and tropes for representing queer identi-
ties, identifications and desires. From the outset, we will also consider how sexuality and race, as well as gender
and ethnicity, intersect in these texts. We will then move to study two rich cultural spaces: Harlem and Paris of
American expatriates. Baldwin's Giovanni's Room will serve as a bridge to fifties culture. In this section we may
discuss pulp fiction, queer subcultures, and the emergence of openly lesbian and gay writings. Finally the course
will focus on cultural texts from the last twenty years that represent the racial, ethnic, and class diversity of queer
communities, as well as the richness of its literary and cultural forms. Some of the main questions we will con-
sider are: What historical shifts and social conditions enable the formation of gay, lesbian, bisexual and trans-
gendered identities? How is the emergence of these identities tied to shifts in conceptualizing race in the U.S.?
How is desire itself racialized? What role does the literary and/or reading play in the constitution of identity and
community? What are the rewards and limits of established literary genres (such as the novel) when called upon
to represent queer lives? When do such lives need new literary and cultural forms? To what degree do queer
literatures constitute a canon, or multiple canons, with identifiable relations between older and more recent texts?
Readings may include works by authors and theorists such as Whitman, Dickinson, James, Hughes, Nugent,
Grimké, Larsen, Stein, Barnes, Baldwin, Bannon, Isherwood, Highsmith, Rich, Delany, Lourde, Moraga, Troya-
na, Kushner, Fisher, Cuadros, Chee, Zamorra, Sedgwick, Eng, Harper, Somerville, Foucault, Muñoz, and Rupp.

ENGL 346(F) The Human Face in the Modern Imagination (Same as ArtH 307, Comparative
Literature 356, and INTR 346) (W)
This is a class about faces: how we think about them, how we represent them in images and words, and how we
respond (or sometimes do not) to the meanings they express. Psychologists have shown that we are born with an
innate preference for face-like visual patterns, and as our minds develop, the cognitive importance of faces only
grows with age and enculturation. Idiomatic phrases such as "face to face," "to lose face," "to show one's face,"
and "two-faced" suggest how deeply intertwined is the human countenance with our everyday grasp of psycho-
logical concepts like mind, identity, and character. As Wittgenstein once remarked: "The face is the soul of the
body." In this seminar, we will explore attempts by artists, scholars, and scientists to describe, comprehend, and
sometimes even capture what makes the human face so special. We will look at images of faces and masks in
modern literature and art (Wilde, Picasso, Pound, Bacon, Arbus, Warhol, Coetzee, Close, Burson, Viola, Sher-
man, Pineda); art historical writings about the face and portraiture (Pater, Gombrich, Brilliant, Koerner); philo-
sophical reflections on the meaning of faces (Wittgenstein, Levinas, Deleuze); close-ups of the face in silent films
(Griffith, Eisenstein, Dreyer); writings on faces and masking practices by anthropologists and sociologists (Sim-
mel, Mauss, Bakhtin, Goffman); and psychological research on face perception and recognition (Ekman, Bruce,
Young, Baron-Cohen, Farah).
Format: discussion/seminar (with occasional lectures). Requirements: active participation in class discussions,
four 2-page response papers, and one 15-page research paper.
Prerequisites: a 100-level English course, except 150; it is recommended, but not required, that students have

ENGL 347(F) Henry James
This course will be devoted to the work of Henry James, whose brilliant, demanding innovations of prose style
and acute psychological and ethical explorations mark the shift from the nineteenth-century to the modern novel.
James writes about what it meant for American and European societies around the turn of the century to be
mutually exposed to, and by, one another. In so doing, he raises questions about what it means to be civilized, to
be smart, and to be rich. We will consider how the drama of consciousness is played out in his characters'
struggles with love and conscience, and in his own preoccupation with capturing stylistically the narrative logic
of the passions. We will read the novellas Daisy Miller, The Beast in the Jungle, The Aspern Papers, and The
Turn of the Screw; the novels Portrait of a Lady, The Bostonians, The Ambassadors, and The Golden Bowl; and
assorted critical writings.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: one 5- to 7-page and one 8- to 10-page paper.

ENGL 353(S) Modern Poetry
In this course, we will explore the tangled and controversial means by which poets writing chiefly between the
two World Wars tied the political, social, and intellectual ferment of the era to the fate of poetry. Both dire and
admiring accounts of these poets' work point to a central impulse to aestheticize political and philosophical prob-
lems. Considering issues such as occultism, Irish nationalism and unrequited love in the poetry of W. B. Yeats;
pedantry, religious conversion, and baby-talk in that of T. S. Eliot; and cosmopolitanism, isolationism and insur-
ance in that of Wallace Stevens, we will consider the ways in which these poets' work both plays out and eludes
accusations of self-reflexive lyricizing. We will examine the roles of aristocratic bias, abstruse erudition, and pro-
to-fascism in their work, as well as critics' tendencies to equate these impulses. Although we will focus chiefly
on the work of these three poets, we will also refer to the poetry of William Carlos Williams, Ezra Pound, Robert
Frost, Marianne Moore and Langston Hughes, considering whether the populism and comparative stylistic ac-
cessibility of some of these poets is an antidote to, or another means to formulate, the concerns of so-called "high
modernism."

ENGL 356(F) Dead Poets' Society (Same as Women's and Gender Studies 356)
Ted Hughes's publication of Birthday Letters in January, 1998, was portrayed in the press and reviews as break-
ing a 35-year silence on his wife Sylvia Plath's suicide in 1963. What made this volume of poems a bestseller
was its confessional and biographical drama. Hughes addresses his dead spouse and returns to all of the major
events in their shared life, simultaneously exposing his feelings and intuitions about what went wrong in their
marriage and why Plath was driven to take her life. Less evident to the general reading public was that Birthday
Letters extends a dialogue between Plath and Hughes on the nature of poetry and poetic identity that began in
their courtship. Plath felt that Hughes initiated her into a strong feminine voice, and she, in turn, was responsible
for introducing Hughes's poems, perceived as infused with violence and virility, to an American audience. The
poems that made Plath famous posthumously, however, were those written in response to her separation from
Hughes and to his extramarital affair, and were collected in a volume titled Ariel that was altered by Hughes and
published after her death. This course will explore the Plath-Hughes marriage, both biographically and poetical-
ly. Topics may include: the conflict between Plath's confessional sensibility and Hughes's sense of her intrusion
on their private life; the role of biography generally in literary interpretation; the vilification of Hughes by femi-
nists and the impact they had on both his poetry and the way he published Plath's poems, journals, and novel; and
the extent to which some of Hughes's final publications constitute "having the last word" on both personal and
poetic disagreements with his dead wife.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: active participation in class, one 4- to 5-page paper; one 6- to 8-page
paper, two oral presentations in class. There will also likely be a field trip to Smith to look at the Plath archive.
Prerequisites: a 100-level English course, except 150. Enrollment limit: 15.
Sophomores intending to apply to the Williams-Exeter program may find this course of special interest, since
there will be an international conference on Plath and Hughes at Oxford in October 2007 in which they may be
invited to participate.

ENGL 358T(F) Sounding Concord (W)
Sounding Concord explores how that village shaped the social imagination of Thoreau, and of his fellow
townsmen R. W. Emerson, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Margaret Fuller, and Bronson and Louisa May Alcott. We'll
look at the models of individual autonomy and social compact fostered by village life. We'll also listen for the
characteristic sound of Yankee culture, in the hope of discovering how the "scandalous poverty" of the provincial
town became the terrain in which these writers learned to speak American.

ENGL 360(F) Joyce's Ulysses
This course will explore in depth the demanding and exhilarating work widely regarded as the most important
novel of the twentieth century, James Joyce'sUlysses, which both dismantled the traditional novel and revitalized
the genre by opening up new possibilities for fiction. We will discuss the ways in which compelling issues of
character and theme (e.g., questions of heroism and betrayal, oedipal dynamics, sexuality and the politics of gen-
der, civic engagement and artistic isolation, British imperialism and Irish nationalism), are placed in counterpoint
with patterns drawn from myth, theology, philosophy, and other literature, and will consider the convergence of
such themes in an unorthodox form of comedy. In assessing Ulysses as the outstanding paradigm of modernist
fiction, we will be equally attentive to its radical and often funny innovations of structure, style, and narrative
perspective. In addition to Joyce's novel, readings will include its epic precursor, Homer's Odyssey, as well as
biographical and critical essays. (Students unfamiliar with Joyce's short novel A Portrait of the Artist as a Young
Man, which introduces characters later followed in Ulysses, are urged to read it in advance of the course.)

ENGL 380(S) The Art of Modern Crisis
The first half of the twentieth century was marked by extraordinary social and political upheaval. The same era
witnessed a feverishly creative revolution in the nature and strategies of artistic representation. In this course we
will examine what these two kinds of crisis have to do with one another: how a wide range of startling innova-
tions in literary and cinematic art may be seen as responses to the particular pressures of the historical crises they
represent. Focussing mainly on Britain, we will study such diverse historical crises as the spread of anarchism
around the turn of the century; the sensational advent of a public discourse of homosexuality in the trials of Oscar
Wilde; the Irish and the Bolshevik revolutions; the woman's suffrage movement and the emergence of the so-
called "New Woman"; World War I and II; and the Cold War. Novels, poems and films will be studied for their
distinctive, often dazzling aesthetic strategies for representing these crises, and will include such works as Con-
rad's The Secret Agent, Bely's Petersburg, Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway, poems of Yeats and Owen, Ford's Parade's
End, Eisenstein's Potemkin, Heller's Catch-22, and Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove.

Psychoanalytic thought offers one of the most subtle and startling accounts we have of the nature of gender and
sexuality, one that suggests how inextricably sexuality is bound to language, to the limits of culture, and to the
problem of identity as such. We'll be interested in these issues in their own right; we'll be equally interested in the
surprising ways psychoanalytic thought opens up literary, cinematic and visual works--psychoanalysis is, in the
end, a form of reading. The course will weave together theoretical texts and fictions from As You Like It to Some
Like it Hot. We'll explore Antigone, "chick flicks" and "buddy" films, courtly love lyrics and novels (Balzac,
Woolf, Duras) in the light of thinkers such as Freud, Jacques Lacan, Jacqueline Rose, Leo Bersani and Lee
Edelman.

ENGL 390T(F) History in Theory (W)
In this tutorial, conceived primarily for juniors and seniors, we will consider the ways in which a number of
important theorists have conceptualized the historical past and our relation to it, and will explore the usefulness of
such models for interpreting a range of modern literary and cinematic texts. Readings will be drawn from
theoretical writings by Edmund Burke, G. E. Hegel, Karl Marx, Max Weber, Walter Benjamin, Hayden White,
Michel de Certeau, and Henri Lefort; literary texts such as Herman Melville's Bartleby the Scrivener, Thomas
Mann's Disorder and Early Sorrow, Peter Weiss' Marat/Sade, Marguerite Duras' The Lover, Tony Kushner's
Angels in America, and Tom Stoppard's Arcadia; and films such as Sergei Eisenstein's October: Ten Days That
Shook the World, Leni Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will, William Wellman's Nothing Sacred, and Gillo
Pontecorvo's The Battle of Algiers. We will consider such topics as the mutual influences of historiography and
literary theory; the competing claims of aesthetic and ideological valuations of a work; the volatile uses of
documentary style; historical repetition as literary trope; the aesthetics of fascism; the relation of charismatic
leadership to democracy; and the uses of melancholy in representing historical crises.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: Students will meet with the instructor in pairs for an hour each week, will write a
5-page paper every other week (five altogether), and comment on their partners' papers in alternate weeks. Em-
phasis will be placed on developing skills not only in reading and interpretation, but also in constructing critical

ENGL 393(F) Staging Identities: Selfhood, Theatricality and Performance in Twentieth Century
Drama (Same as Theatre 393)
The construction of selfhood is always to some extent a performative act--"All the world's a stage / And all the
men and women merely players" as Shakespeare's Jacques famously remarks. And that performance is
inherently dual, since constituted both for the audience of the wider social world and for the "self" who seeks to
act. Drama as a genre, with its constant negotiation of the competing claims of illusion and the operations of
reality, has invariably been centrally interested in the exploration of social identity, in the tensions between public
and private selfhood, and in the functions of "performance." In this course we will examine theatre's response to
the challenge of self-fashioning in the modern era, and consider the wider ontological status of performance as a
category within the context of twentieth century drama and theatrical staging. Readings will include plays by
Strindberg, Wilde, Shaw, Pirandello, Beckett, Pinter and Stoppard, along with selected criticism, theory, and
psychoanalytical writings.

ENGL 394(S) Gothic Theory
In strict literary terms, the word "Gothic" refers to any fiction that exudes a brooding atmosphere of gloom or
terror. The Gothic is the literature of the ghostly or the macabre. In a course on the Gothic, then, you might expect
English
­ 163 ­
to read a lot of creepy old novels set in castles, where the doors bang and the candles flicker and the shadows inch
their way across the rooms. But ours is a culture that is absolutely permeated by Gothic language and Gothic
imagery. If you look not only at fiction written in English, but also at our movies, our journalism, even our phi-
losophy, you will see how often and how easily these all slip into the Gothic mode.
So this course is an introduction to the Gothic, but on the understanding that the Gothic is not just some literary
genre--it is, rather, one of our primary means of imagining our relationship to the world. Why, we will have to
ask, do we so often imagine our world in terms of ghosts and monsters and killers on the loose? We will begin by
reading a few classic Gothic novels. We will go on to consider several examples of the contemporary pop Goth-
ic--a few choice horror movies: The Shining, Night of the Living Dead, Audition. And we conclude with a more
detailed consideration of some prominent philosophers and theorists who, upon close inspection, turn out to be
Gothic writers of a special kind: When Marx describes capitalism, he often calls it a vampire or a werewolf.
When Freud describes the structure of the human self, he makes it sound as though each of us is possessed by
demons or spirits. When Foucault traces out the all-encompassing networks of power that surround us, he does
so with a paranoia worthy of the edgiest action thriller. And when some of the finest minds writing now try to
spell out a new ethics for our new world, they tell us that our first responsibility is to treat our ghosts kindly. So
again, the pressing question: Why do our best thinkers think we're all living in a horror movie?

ENGL 404(F) Auteur Cinema and the Very Long Film (Same as Comparative Literature 324)
This course will focus on six master works by six major film directors: Michelangelo Antonioni's L'Avventura;
Bernardo Bertolucci's The Last Emperor; Ingmar Bergman's Fanny and Alexander; Francis Ford Coppola's
Apocalypse Now!; Federico Fellini's 8 1/2; and Akira Kurosawa's The Seven Samurai. These films were not
always well received: the audience to L'Avventura at Cannes yelled "Cut!" in exasperation with Antonioni's
desultory editing; Pauline Kael regarded both Fanny and Alexander and The Last Emperor as far inferior to
Bergman's and Bertolucci's youthful efforts, arguing that both had betrayed their former intellectual rigor with a
new sentimentality; Fellini was roundly criticized for narcissism and egotism in casting the heartthrob Marcello
Mastroianni as himself and devoting such a long film to his personal creative blockage; and Coppola's
Apocalypse Now! was perceived as a disaster in terms of its budget, its prolonged shooting schedule in a jungle
environment, and its devastating impact on the health of its cast and crew. Only The Seven Samurai seems to
have been recognized immediately as a masterpiece. All of these films are self-reflexive works, representing both
the distinctive personalities of their directors and their individual stylistic and thematic concerns--what makes
them examples of auteur cinema. During the first half of the course, we will meet to discuss these films
individually together with selected readings. At the same time students will be assigned one of these directors to
research for a long paper and oral presentation during the second half of the course.

English

texts by Marx and an analysis of concepts such as base and superstructure, alienation, fetishism, reification,
mediation, determination, ideology, hegemony, and praxis. Then we will trace the appropriations of Marx in

will concentrate on analyses of literature and other cultural artifacts by Williams, British "cultural studies"
theorists, and American cultural critics such as Frederic Jameson and bell hooks.

ENGL 414(F) Poetry and Prose of John Donne
"Wit!-Wonder-exciting vigour, intenseness and peculiarity of thought," Samuel Coleridge wrote, "this is the wit
of Donne!" There is no greater, more daring or more witty, writer of love poems, divine poems, or religious prose
in the English language. Donne wrote in a wide variety of classical genres: elegy, epigram, satire, love lyric,
epithalamion or marriage song, verse epistle, holy sonnet, hymn, familiar letter, meditation, sermon. Yet he
constantly reinvigorates conventional language with "new-made idiom," turning traditional forms to unpredict-
able ends.
This intensive, discussion-oriented seminar will explore the following questions. What are the characteristic
marks of Donne's style, and how does his writing evolve over the course of his career? Since Donne's poetry was
not printed until after his death, what was the impact of his coterie audience? How does Donne conduct an amo-
rous courtship in and through verse? To what extent are biography and history pertinent and helpful in under-
standing Donne's writing? What are the religious premises and purpose of Donne's religious writing? What
made Donne so appealing to T. S. Eliot and the modernists, and more recently, the post-modernists? What are the
compelling issues in contemporary Donne criticism?
In addition to regular classroom presentations, students will write short weekly assignments in preparation for a
15-20 final paper.

philosophy, literature, or film, Cavell is a thinker worth knowing, and by the end of this seminar, we'll know him
very well. We'll begin by reading from, and studying Cavell's responses to, the writings of Wittgenstein and
Austin, in order to understand the development of his distinctive views about meaning, skepticism, and morality.
Then, as we make our way through his major writings, we will take the time to read what Cavell reads, or
watches, as the case may be. For example, we will study Shakespeare's King Lear on its own before reading
Cavell's famous essay on that play, "The Avoidance of Love." We will then do the same before reading his
reflections on Beckett's Endgame, Thoreau's Walden, and Hollywood comedies such as Bringing Up Baby and
The Philadelphia Story.
Format: discussion/seminar with four weeks of the semester organized as a tutorial, during which students will
meet in pairs with the instructor once a week for one hour; during the tutorial sessions, one student will present a
5pp. analytical paper on the texts covered that week, and the other will write a response paper and join the
instructor in a discussion of both papers. Requirements: active participation in class discussions, four tutorial
papers total, and one final (15pp.) research paper.
Prerequisites: a 300-level English course and at least one course in philosophy, or permission of the instructor.
Enrollment limit: 15 (expected:10). Preference given to junior and senior English and Philosophy majors.

ENGL 420(S) Decadence and Aestheticism
"Fin de Siecle": the end of the world, or at least the end of century, was the cry of many in the last years of the
19th century. Despair over the seeming perilous decline in moral standards, scandalously avant-garde fashions in
art and writing, anxieties brought on by Britain's uneasy rule over its colonies, and the advent of new dissident
sexual and social identities, led some to fear (and others to celebrate) that the ways of Victorian Britain were not
long for this world. This course will consider aestheticism and decadence as late-nineteenth-century literary and
artistic responses, both scandalized and scandalizing, to this terrifying and exhilarating period. We'll read writers
such as Oscar Wilde, who reveled in amoral manifestos like "art for art's sake" by elevating artifice and shallow-
ness to the first principles of life, both in his work and through his own outré existence. In addition to reading
Wilde and his fellow aesthetes, we'll think about the ways in which nineteenth-century literary forms, such as the
detective novel, work both to contain and diffuse the many anxieties of the fin de siècle. Throughout, we'll seek
to understand the relays between the aesthetic and social dimensions of these works. This seminar will involve
intense discussion and independent work, will familiarize students with the terrain of current theory and critical

work on Victorian culture, as well as build skills in researching criticism and developing arguments. Authors
likely to include: Eliot, Kipling, Stevenson, Stoker, Doyle, Schreiner, Wilde, Wells, Conrad, James.
Format: seminar/discussion. Requirements: productive discussion; written work culminating in a 20-page re-
search paper.
Prerequisites: a 300-level course or permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 15 (expected:10). Preference
given to junior and senior English majors.

ENGL 434(F) William Blake
In this course we will study the illuminated works of the poet and printmaker William Blake. Our texts will
include Songs of Innocence and Experience, The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, Visions of the Daughters of
Albion, America, Europe, and Jerusalem, all of which we will read in facsimile editions. We will also read a
range of historical and critical materials. Our discussions will attempt to articulate and explore the particular ways
in which Blake's books challenge us as readers of literature, as consumers of cultural products, and as political
thinkers.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: frequent informal short writing assignments, one 5-page, and one
longer (10-15) paper, preceded by conference.
Prerequisites: one 300-level English course or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 15 (expected:10). Pref-

ENGL 485T(F) The Practice of Revision: Fiction Writing Tutorial
Writers get better by learning to revise more often, more completely, and more intelligently--which means, in
turn, learning to assess what we're actually getting on the page, learning to talk usefully about our work and the
work of others, and learning to evaluate our readers' critiques. In this tutorial, which is designed for those who've
had significant workshop experience and want to improve their revision skills, students will gain practice in each
of those areas.
Format: tutorial with occasional group meetings. Requirements: Students will meet in pairs with the instructor
for an hour each week; every other week they will present a piece of new or revised fiction. Presentation will
include a reading of a 3- to 4-page selection from the piece (which will be turned in the previous day, and may be
up to 15 pp long) and oral assessment of its structure, intentions, and perceived strengths and weaknesses. In
alternate weeks, students will respond orally and in writing to their partner's fiction and its presentation, followed
by discussion of both presentations and the fiction itself. Reading and responding to published fiction will also be
required.
Prerequisites: English 384 or 385; or permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Selection
based on writing samples.

CONCENTRATION IN ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
The Environmental Studies Program, within the liberal arts mission of Williams College, provides stu-
dents with an opportunity to explore how humans interact with the environment, including physical, bio-
logical, philosophical, and social elements. The program is designed so that students will understand the
complexity of issues and perspectives and to appreciate that most environmental issues lack distinct disci-
plinary boundaries. Our goal is to aid students in becoming well-informed, environmentally-literate citi-
Environmental Studies
­ 167 ­
zens of the planet who have the capacity to become active participants in the local and global community.
To this end, the program is designed to develop abilities to think in interdisciplinary ways and to use syn-
thetic approaches in solving problems while incorporating the knowledge and experiences gained from
majoring in other departments at the College.
The concentration in Environmental Studies allows students to pursue an interdisciplinary study of the
environment by taking elective courses in the natural sciences, the social sciences, and the humanities and
the arts. The purpose of the program is to provide the tools and ideas needed to engage constructively with
the environmental and social issues brought about by changes in population, economic activity, and values.
Environmental controversies typically call upon citizens and organizations to grasp complex, uncertain
science, contending human values, and ethical choices--in short, to grapple with matters for which the
liberal arts are a necessary but not sufficient preparation. Environmental Studies accordingly includes
courses in natural sciences, social sciences, humanities, and the arts, in order to equip students with the
broad educational background needed to analyze complex environmental matters and to fashion pragmat-
ic, feasible solutions.
The program is administered by the Center for Environmental Studies (CES), located in Kellogg House.
Founded in 1967, CES was one of the first environmental studies programs at a liberal arts college. In
addition to the academic program, CES is the focus of a varied set of activities in which students lead and
participate, often with other members of the Williams community. The Matt Cole Memorial Library at
Kellogg House holds a substantial collection of books, periodicals, unpublished documents, maps, and
electronic media. Kellogg House also houses a Geographic Information Systems laboratory as well as
study and meeting facilities available to students and student groups. The Center administers the Hopkins
Memorial Forest, a 2500-acre natural area northwest of campus, where field-study sites, a laboratory, and
passive-recreation opportunities may be found in all seasons. CES also operates an environmental analysis
laboratory at the Science Center.
The Environmental Studies Program has three overlapping components:
 The concentration in Environmental Studies, which consists of a set of seven courses.
 The Four Places goal. (See below.)
 Honors in Environmental Studies; a senior thesis is encouraged but not required.
Concentration Requirements
Seven courses are required: four are core courses to be taken by all students earning the concentration; three are
distribution courses to be selected from the lists below.
Core courses
101 Humans in the Landscape
203 Ecology
302 Environmental Planning and Design Workshop
402 Senior Seminar
The core courses are intended to be taken in sequence, although there is some flexibility allowed. Envi-
ronmental Studies (ENVI) 101 is a broad introduction to the field, emphasizing the humanities and social
sciences. ENVI 203 is a course in ecology (offered in Biology) that provides a unified conceptual approach
to the behavior of living things in the natural world. ENVI 302 puts teams of students to work on planning
projects of immediate importance in the Berkshires. ENVI 402, the senior seminar, is an opportunity for
concentrators majoring in a wide variety of disciplines to draw together their educational experiences and
provide a personal accounting of how they understand the interdisciplinary character of environmental
studies and its connections to their future lives and careers. The core course structure affords students free-
dom to explore and to specialize in diverse fields of study, while sustaining a focus on environmental ques-
tions throughout their time at Williams.
An interdisciplinary course emphasizing field science, ENVI 102 (Introduction to Environmental Sci-
ence), is strongly recommended for all students interested in the concentration.
Distribution Courses
In order to earn the concentration a student must take one course from each of the following three
groups. Courses may be counted both toward the concentration in Environmental Studies and toward a
disciplinary major.

Variations from the requirements of the concentration must be approved in writing by the director of the pro-
gram. Students are urged to consult with program faculty and the director as soon as they develop an interest in
the concentration or if they intend to participate in study away opportunities.
In addition to courses fulfilling the concentration requirements, the following electives and related elec-
tives are offered:
Environmental Studies 397, 398 Independent Study of Environmental Problems
Environmental Studies 493-W31-494 Senior Research and Thesis
Winter study courses play an important role in the program, offering opportunities to experiment in
fields unfamiliar to the student, and for interdisciplinary topics to be developed by faculty working alone
and in teams. Students are urged to review each year's winter study offerings bearing in mind their interests
in the environment.
Rationale for Course Numbering
The numbering sequence of the four required courses reflects the order in which they should be taken,
although Environmental Studies 302 may be taken in the senior or sophomore year if a student is away
junior year. Cross-listed courses are assigned the same number as the departmental number whenever pos-
sible.
Four Places--A Goal
The human place in natural landscapes is intrinsically geographic, and learning about humans in partic-
ular places is an essential part of environmental studies. By the time each student in Environmental Studies
Environmental Studies
­ 169 ­
graduates, she or he should have developed intellectual insight into and personal experience of four places:
"Home"; "Here"--the Berkshires; "There"--an alien place; and "The World"--a global perspective. For
practical purposes, "There" is a place where the geography is unusual in the student's experience (e.g.,
developing country, inner city, arctic), so are the socioeconomic circumstances (for example, per capita
income might be a small fraction of a year's tuition at Williams), and the working language is not standard
English. Although this goal is not a requirement for the concentration, it is a significant aspect of the pro-
gram, and CES resources are aimed in part at enabling all students to meet this goal. For example, students
are encouraged to pursue summer internships in their "Home" communities, or to do semester or winter
study courses at locations outside the temperate zones ("There"); field courses in natural science or history
courses emphasizing New England can deepen familiarity with "Here." Students concentrating in Envi-
ronmental Studies should plan winter study courses and summer work or study experiences with the Four
Places goal in mind, particularly the experiences "There" and at "Home." Courses not in the list of elec-
tives for the concentration may be considered as substitutes, on a case-by-case basis, if they also meet the
Four Places goal in a way not otherwise available in the program. Students should see the program director
for further information.
Honors in Environmental Studies
A student earns honors in Environmental Studies by successfully completing a rigorous, original inde-
pendent research project under the supervision of two or more members of the faculty, including at least
one member of the CES faculty. The research project should be reported and defended both in a thesis and
orally. A student may undertake an honors thesis and submit it to both his or her major department and
Environmental Studies; petitions for a joint honors project should be approved by the department chair and
the director of the program no later than the beginning of the student's senior year. Students who pursue
honors in Environmental Studies alone should enroll in Environmental Studies 493-W31-494, Senior Re-
search and Thesis, in addition to completing the requirements for the concentration.
Because most research requires sustained field, laboratory, or library work that is difficult to combine
with conventional coursework, students are strongly encouraged to spend the summer before senior year
doing honors research. Funds to support student research are available from restricted endowments of the
Center, and an open competition is held each spring, to allocate the limited resources. Some departments
also provide limited support for summer thesis research. Students and their faculty sponsors should plan
the thesis with the possibility of summer research in mind.
Honors in Environmental Studies will be awarded on the basis of the academic rigor, interdisciplinary
synthesis, independence, and originality demonstrated by the student and in the completed thesis.
STUDY ABROAD
The Program in Environmental Studies encourages its concentrators to study abroad if feasible, and
there are a variety of study abroad programs that include courses and experiential learning about the envi-
ronment. Students should speak to the chair of the program as early as possible in making their plans in
order to confirm what courses abroad will be eligible for credit as an elective course in the concentration.
Students may not use study abroad classes to fulfill any of the program's core course requirements.
ENVI 101(S) Humans in the Landscape: An Introduction to Environmental Studies
This course introduces environmental studies in the context of the liberal arts--natural and social science and the
arts and humanities. By the end of the semester, a student should be able to recognize and to investigate the
natural, economic, and industrial bases of daily life, and to analyze the social challenges of altering humans'
imprint on nature. These skills are necessary but not sufficient for developing a stance toward environmental
quality as an element of civilized life.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on two quizzes (testing detailed recall), written exercises
(testing ability to grasp and make use of ideas important to the course), and a final exam; attentive participation in
class and conference discussions also counts.
No enrollment limit (expected: 30-40). Required course for students wishing to complete the Environmental
Studies concentration.
Satisfies one semester of the Division II requirement.
Hour: 10:00-10:50 MWF Conference: TBA K. LEE
ENVI 102(S) Introduction to Environmental Science
Introduction to Environmental Science introduces students to current scientific methods used to assess environ-
mental quality, rectify impaired systems, and limit future detriment. Through hands-on study of several local
sites, we probe five global themes: alteration of the greenhouse effect and carbon cycle; acid deposition; toxic
metals in the environment; water quality; and prospects in waste treatment and remediation.
Discussions of case studies from other parts of the world illustrate the global analogues of these local studies.
Following these group projects, students design and complete independent projects in subjects of particular inter-
est to them.
Format: two, 75-minute workshop/discussion sessions, and one, 4-hour field/laboratory session each week.
Evaluation will be based on reports of field and laboratory projects, participation in discussion, and an indepen-
dent research project.
Enrollment limit: 36 (expected: 25). Preference given to first-year students. This course is designed for students
who have a strong interest in Environmental Science.
Satisfies one semester of the Division III requirement. This course also satisfies "The Natural World" require-
ment for the Environmental Studies concentration.

Natural resources--forests, pastures, and waterways--are a foundation of rural livelihoods and local governance
in much of the developing world. Natural resource management is therefore an important vehicle not only for
reducing environmental degradation, but also for promoting rural economic development and good governance.
This course examines the nexus of natural resources management, rural livelihoods, and governance systems as
it relates to sustainable development and biodiversity conservation efforts. It builds a grassroots perspective by
situating community-based systems of natural resource management in progressively broader contexts --re-
gional, national, and international. Students explore a variety of conceptual and practical tools for understanding
the nature, wealth and power nexus and for balancing the needs and aspirations of local populations with the
objectives of conservation and development programs.
Format: seminar. Requirements: Each student completes, in stages, a long research paper integrating environ-
mental, economic and institutional analysis around a case study of sustainable development and/or environmen-
tal conservation. Students design their paper around their specific environmental and geographic interests.

ENVI 270T(F) (formerly 308T) Environmental Policy (Same as Political Science 270T) (W)
Over the past generation, the environment has emerged as a significant policy arena. This course discusses
environmental policy and politics from the perspective of the constellation of professionals, managers, and
activists involved in the implementation and formulation of policies. The technical and social challenges of
environmental policy strain long-accepted notions of democratic representation and rationality. We examine
institutional forms, and survey the conflicts that shape the governance of natural resources, property, and
ecosystem services. This course emphasizes domestic environmental policy but also draws examples from inter-
national contexts.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: each student completes, in stages, a research project on an environmental policy
or controversy. A 12-page background paper at mid-semester describes the issues and actors. The subsequent
research paper incorporates the background paper, with revisions, into a 20-page analysis of the case and its
governmental dynamics, including policy recommendations. There is also a 90-minute exam on the course
readings.

ENVI 302(F) Environmental Planning Workshop
This interdisciplinary course introduces the theories, methodologies, and legal framework of environmental
planning and provides students with experience in the planning process through project work in the Berkshire
region. The first part of the course introduces the students to planning literature through analysis and discussion
of case studies. In the second section of the course students apply their skills to the study of an actual planning
problem. Small teams of students, working in conjunction with a client in the community, research and propose
solutions to a local environmental planning problem. The project work draws on students' academic training,
extracurricular activities, and applies interdisciplinary knowledge and methodologies. The course culminates in

ENVI 307(F) Environmental Law (Same as Political Science 317)
In recent decades, a complex web of environmental laws has altered our approach to land use and resource man-
agement, raised public health standards, and forced business and government to reinvent their relationships with
one another and with local communities. This course examines how environmental laws develop, from the dis-
covery of a problem, through the passage and implementation of legislation, to changes in the behavior of regu-
lated industries, and, finally, to site restoration and the prevention of new harms. Students will examine the roles
played by four main groups: citizens--organizations, elected officials, the business sector, and the bureaucracy.
We will use case law and source materials like agency permits and consent agreements to show how these four
groups often establish a "checks and balances" relationship with one another, helping to assure that the laws we
enact provide real environmental relief without unduly interfering with the delivery of public services or creation
of goods.

ENVI 313(F) (formerly 211) Global Trends, Sustainable Earth
This course examines the possibility of sustainable development, an economy in which material prosperity
pursued together with preservation of the life-support systems of the human and natural world. Over the past 200
years the human presence on the planet has changed dramatically, as seen in long-term trends of environmental
modification, population growth, and economic change, including patterns of consumption. These and other data
are reviewed, in an effort to illuminate the idea of a gradual transition toward sustainability. Sustainability is
examined as an emergent phenomenon--not a simple idea imposed from above, but the product of decentralized
learning, market innovations, and social changes at many scales. Simulation exercises providing metaphors of
emergent phenomena are used to stimulate imagination and thinking.
Format: seminar. Requirements: a long research paper designed by the student, several simulation exercises, and
a brief final exam.

FIRST-YEAR RESIDENTIAL SEMINAR
The First-Year Residential Seminar is a program designed to help students explore new ways of inte-
grating their social and intellectual lives. Students who participate live together in the same residential unit,
and take the seminar together during the fall semester. Enrollment in the seminar is restricted to students in
the program. The seminar explores topics and issues that can be expected to promote lively discussions
both in and out of class. It may be team-taught and may contain interdisciplinary subject matter.
All entering first-year students have the opportunity to express interest in participating ; if more students
are interested than there are spaces available, selection is done randomly. Participants must commit them-
selves to taking FRS 101.
FRS 101(F) Interpreting Human Experience (W)
How we make sense of the world, and of our lives, depends to a considerable degree on the intellectual method-
ologies we apply to the task of interpretation. Freud, for instance, saw selfhood and perception as fundamentally
determined by the structures of the psyche itself; Marx, by contrast, argued that our sense of reality is conditioned
primarily by our material and social circumstances; more recently, historian of science Thomas Kuhn has em-
phasized that the underlying assumptions which shape the very questions we pose as thinkers significantly influ-
ence and limit what data, and thus what reality, we are most likely to observe. This course aims to provide a
foundational experience for the liberal arts education, by engaging with key religious, political, literary, anthro-
pological, philosophical and psychoanalytic texts with a view to complicating our sense of the purposes and
possibilities of intellectual life and confronting the challenges of epistemology. Readings will include works by
Plato, John Stuart Mill, Marx, E.M. Forster, Freud, Rousseau, Brecht, Dangarembga, and extracts from the Bible
and the Qur'an. In keeping with the aims of the FRS program, the course is intended to foster productive connec-
tions between what we discuss and debate in class and your broader experiences as students. The course will

MAJOR
The Geosciences major is designed (1) to provide an understanding of the physical and biological
evolution of our planet and its interacting global systems, (2) to help us learn to live in harmony with our
environment, and (3) to appreciate our place within the vastness of Earth history. Forces within the Earth
are responsible for the development of mountain ranges and ocean basins. Waves, running water, and gla-
ciers have shaped the surface of the Earth, providing the landscapes we see today. Fossils encased in sedi-
mentary rocks supply evidence for the evolution of life and help to record the history of the Earth.
Students who graduate with a major in Geosciences from Williams can enter several different fields of
geoscience or can use their background in other careers. Students who have continued in the geosciences
are involved today, especially after graduate training, in environmental fields ranging from hydrology to
earthquake prediction, in the petroleum and mining industries, federal and state geological surveys, geo-
logical consulting firms, and teaching and research in universities, colleges, and secondary schools. Gradu-
ates who have entered business or law have also found many applications for their geoscience background.
Other graduates now in fields as diverse as art and medicine pursue their interest in the out-of-doors with a
deeper appreciation for the natural world around them.
The Geosciences major sequence includes, after any 100-level course, six designated advanced courses,
and two elective courses.
Sequence Courses (required of majors)
201 Geomorphology
202 Mineralogy and Geochemistry
215 Climate Changes
301 Structural Geology
302 Sedimentology
401 Stratigraphy
Elective courses may be clustered to provide concentrations in selected fields. Suggested groupings are
listed below as guidelines for course selections, but other groups are possible according to the interests of
the students. Departmental advisors are given for the different fields of Geosciences.
I Environmental Geoscience. For students interested in surface processes and the application of geolo-
gy to environmental problems such as land use planning, resource planning, environmental impact analy-
sis, and environmental law. Such students should also consider enrollingin thecoordinate program of the
Center for Environmental Studies.
103 The Interconnected Earth
104 Oceanography
206 Geological Sources of Energy or
208 Water and the Environment
214 Remote Sensing and Geographic Information Systems
215 Climate Changes
(Students interested in Environmental Geosciences should consult with Professors Dethier or Stoll.)
II Oceanography, Stratigraphy and Sedimentation. For students interested in the study of modern and
ancient sedimentary environments and the marine organisms that inhabited them.
101 Biodiversity in Geologic Time
104 Oceanography
206 Geological Sources of Energy
212 Invertebrate Paleobiology
(Students interested in Oceanography, Stratigraphy, and Sedimentation should consult with Professors
M. Johnson or Cox.)
III The Solid Earth. For students interested in plate tectonics, the processes active within the Earth, the
origin and deformation of rocks and minerals, and mineral exploration.
102 An Unfinished Planet
105 Geology Outdoors
303 Igneous and Metamorphic Petrology
Geosciences
­ 175 ­
(Students interested in The Solid Earth should consult with Professors Wobus or Karabinos.)
With the consent of the department, certain courses at the 200 level or higher in Biology, Chemistry,
Mathematics and Statistics, or Physics may be substituted for elective courses in the major. Credit may be
granted in the Geosciences major for American Maritime Studies 211/Geosciences 210 (Oceanographic
Processes) or American Maritime Studies 311/Biology 231 (Marine Ecology) taken at Mystic Seaport.
Students considering graduate work in geosciences should also take courses in the allied sciences and
mathematics in addition to the requirements of the Geosciences major. The selection of outside courses
will depend on the field in which a student intends to specialize. Most geoscience graduate schools require
a year of Chemistry and Mathematics through 105. For those going into Environmental Geoscience,
courses in computer science or statistics are recommended. For those considering Oceanography, Stratig-
raphy, and Sedimentation, Biology 102 and Biology 203 are suggested. For students entering Solid-Earth
fields, Physics 131 and 132 are recommended.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN GEOSCIENCES
In order to be recommended for the degree with honors, a student is expected to have completed at least
two semesters and a winter study project (031) of independent research culminating in a thesis which dem-
onstrates outstanding achievement of an original and innovative nature. The principal considerations in
admitting a student to a program of independent research are mastery of fundamental material and skills,
ability to pursue independent study successfully, and demonstrated student interest and motivation.
Further advice on the major can be obtained from the department chair.
STUDY ABROAD
Students planning on studying abroad should meet as early as possible with the Department Chair to
plan study-abroad courses and to discuss how potential courses might be used in the Geosciences major. In
recent years students have found that courses offered by universities in New Zealand, particularly the Uni-
versity of Otago, provide an excellent complement to courses offered at Williams. Courses offered at Nor-
wegian Technical Universities and at several universities in the United Kingdom have also been accepted
as part of the Geosciences major. Many other study-abroad programs, however, do not usually offer
courses that are acceptable substitutes for courses required by the Williams Geoscience major.
GEOS 101(F) Biodiversity in Geologic Time (Same as Environmental Studies 105)
Is planet Earth now undergoing the most severe mass extinction of species ever to have occurred during its
4.5-billion-year history? By some calculations, the expanding population of a single species is responsible for the
demise of 74 species per day. This provocative question is addressed by way of the rock and fossil record as it
relates to changes in biodiversity through deep geologic time before the appearance of Homo sapiens only
250,000 years ago. Long before human interaction, nature conducted its own experiments on the complex rela-
tionship between evolving life and changes in the physical world. This course examines ways in which wander-
ing continents, shifting ocean basins, the rise and fall of mountains, the wax and wane of ice sheets, fluctuating
sea level, and even crashing asteroids all shaped major changes in global biodiversity. Particular attention is
drawn to the half dozen most extensive mass extinctions and what factors may have triggered them. Equal con-
sideration is given to how the development of new ecosystems forever altered the physical world. How and
when did the earliest microbes oxygenate the atmosphere? Do the earliest multicellular animals from the late
Precambrian portray an architectural experiment doomed to failure? What factors contributed to the explosive
rise in biodiversity at the start of the Cambrian Period? What explanation is there for the sudden appearance of
vertebrates? How and when did plants colonize the land? What caused the demise of the dinosaurs? Is the present
dominance of mammals an accident of nature? The answers to these and other questions are elusive, but our wise
stewardship of the planet and its present biodiversity may depend on our understanding of the past. Concepts of
plate tectonics and island biogeography are applied to many aspects of the puzzle.
Format: lecture; one laboratory per week (some involving field work); plus one all-day field trip to the Helder-
berg Plateau and Catskill Mountains of New York, and a half-day trip to the Geology Museum at Amherst Col-
lege. Evaluation will be based on weekly quizzes and lab work, a midterm exam, and a final exam.

GEOS 102(S) An Unfinished Planet
The Earth is a work-in-progress, an evolving planet whose vital signs--as expressed by earthquakes, volcanic
eruptions, and shifting plates--are still strong. In a geological time frame, nothing on Earth is permanent: ocean
basins open and close, mountains rise and fall, continental masses accrete and separate. There is a message here
for all who live, for an infinitesimally brief time, on the moving surface of the globe. This course uses the plate
tectonics model--one of the fundamental scientific accomplishments of this century--to interpret the processes
and products of a changing Earth. The emphasis will be on mountain systems (on land and beneath the oceans)
as expressions of plate interactions. Specific topics include the rocks and structures of modern and ancient moun-
tain belts, the patterns of global seismicity and volcanism, the nature of the Earth's interior, the changing configu-
rations of continents and ocean basins through time, and, in some detail, the formation of the Appalachian Moun-
tain system and the geological assembly of New England. Readings will be from a physical geology textbook
and primary source supplement, selected writings of John McPhee, and references about the geology of the
Northeast.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; lab (several involving field work), two hours per week; one required all-
day field trip during the last week of the semester to the Connecticut Valley and the highlands of western Massa-

GEOS 103(F) The Interconnected Earth (Same as Environmental Studies 103)
Hurricane Katrina. Banda Aceh Tsunami. Antarctic Ozone Depletion. Salton Sea. Qiqsuqqaqtuq. These names
and short phrases, some obvious in origin, some not so well known, but just as profound, serve to remind us that
our planet is made up of a number of complex, dynamic, and interrelated systems. Today, more than ever in
human history, the impact of our activities are apparent on a global scale, as we alter the environment for our-
selves and the rest of earth's inhabitants. These intertwined systems include the solid earth (geosphere), gaseous
earth (atmosphere), polar icecaps (cryosphere) and liquid fresh and saltwater (hydrosphere), and the total mass of
current and former living organisms (biota) that draw on the energy and resources of the Earth Systems for sur-
vival. Most importantly, seemingly small changes in one system can have profound effects on the behavior of all
others. In this course, we will examine the interconnectedness of these systems with emphasis on present-day
interactions. We will explore how Earth Systems react to external stresses or changes, the time scales associated
with major and minor perturbations, and the non-linear return to a steady state. We will carefully consider the
ways in which earth scientists quantify these behaviors to predict future changes using current data. We will
examine the evidence that human activity can alter Earth Systems stability and the permanence and scale of such
alteration. We will also consider how scientific data inform government policies and popular views of how these
systems evolve and interact.
Format: Lecture, three hours per week. Laboratory, two hours every other week, several involving field work.

GEOS 105(F) Geology Outdoors (W)
An introduction to geology through student field projects. The mountains, lakes, rivers, and valleys of the Wil-
liamstown area provide unusual opportunities for learning geology in the field. Student projects will include the
study of streams as active agents of erosion and deposition, the effects of glaciation on the New England land-
scape, and the history of mountain building in the Appalachians. Following several group projects introducing
the techniques of field geology, students will pursue independent projects on subjects of particular interest to
them. This course departs from the standard science course format with three lectures and a required lab each
week. Instead, emphasis is placed on learning through active participation in field projects and presentation of
results through high quality writing. The class will meet two afternoons each week from 1:00 to 3:45 p.m. There
will be two all day field trips. This course is designed for students who have a serious interest in geology or other
natural and environmental sciences, the outdoors, and writing.
Format: discussion/field laboratory, six hours per week. Evaluation will be based on participation in field work
and discussions, five 8-page papers based on field projects, and an oral presentation of independent projects.
Students will use detailed comments on their papers to improve their writing style in successive assignments.

GEOS 205(F) Earth's Strategic Resources: Origin, Recovery and Control (Same as Environmental
Studies 207)
At the dawn of the twenty-first century, there is a great demand for earth's strategic resources, both in first-world
and developing countries; reserves dwindle, controversy ensues over the damage done to the environment by
their extraction and processing, and conflicts arise over control of their pricing and distribution. An understand-
ing of these conflicts requires insight into the geological processes that form and distribute strategic earth materi-
als. This class serves as introduction to understanding the geologic processes that control formation, distribution,
and extent of strategic earth materials reserves (stone and gravel, base metals, ores, gems, petroleum, nuclear
energy sources, and specialty materials for medical, technological, and military sectors), cost and environmental
impacts of extraction, and efforts to control these resources. We will also address the current fossil fuel situation
and prospects for alternate energy resources.
Format: lecture, three hours per week, with integrated in-class exercises. Grading will be based on two hour
exams, a final, exercises, and a semester project.

GEOS 212(S) Invertebrate Paleobiology (Same as Biology 211)
This course offers an introduction to the study of prehistoric life. The fossils of marine invertebrates provide an
excellent foundation for this purpose, because they are widespread and abundant, they are often well-preserved,
and they have a record that reaches back in time over 600 million years. The intellectual discovery of fossils as
organic relics and the ways in which fossils were used by earlier generations to support conflicting views on
nature are briefly surveyed. The lecture topics that follow are organized to illustrate the various directions ex-
plored by paleontologists today to solve a broad range of questions. These include: biological and paleontologi-
cal views on the species concept relevant to taxonomy; ongoing debate over the timing and mechanisms of
evolution; biostratigraphy as a means to correlate sedimentary rocks; functional morphology as a means to re-
construct the biomechanics of extinct species; analysis of fossil assemblages to interpret the ecology of ancient
environments; paleogeography as related to patterns in biodiversity, and the possible causes of mass extinctions.
Laboratory exercises utilize superb fossil collections to study the processes of fossilization and to survey the
biology and taxonomy of the major invertebrate phyla.
Format: lecture/laboratory; field trip to the Lower Devonian Helderbergs of New York State. Evaluation will be
based on weekly lab reports, a midterm paper, a midterm exam, a lab practicum, and a final exam.

GEOS 214(S) Remote Sensing and Geographic Information Systems (Same as Environmental
Studies 214)
Remote sensing involves the collection and processing of data from satellite and airborne sensors to yield envi-
ronmental information about the Earth's surface and lower atmosphere. Remote sensing enhances regional map-
ping of rock types and faults and analysis of vegetation cover and land-use changes over time. A Geographic
Information System (GIS) links satellite-based environmental measurements with spatial data such as topogra-
phy, transportation networks, and political boundaries, allowing display and quantitative analysis at the same
scale using the same geographic reference. This course covers the principles and practice of remote-data capture
and geographic rectification using a Global Positioning System (GPS), as well as the concepts of Remote Sens-
ing, including linear and non-linear image enhancements, convolution filtering, principle components analysis,
and classification. Principles of GIS include display and classification, spatial buffers, and logical overlays.
Weekly labs focus on practical applications of these techniques to data from Hopkins Memorial Forest, the Berk-
shire region, and other areas of North America.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, weekly.

GEOS 217T(F) Planetary Geology (Same as Astronomy 217T) (W)
The diversity of our solar system is incredible. No two plants are exactly alike, and as we acquire more data and
higher-resolution images, our sense of wonder grows. However, we can't hike around and hammer rocks on
Geosciences

Venus or Titan, so we have to infer composition, form, texture and process from remotely-captured images and
sparse chemical and spectral data. This leaves plenty of room for interpretation and hypothesising about geologi-
cal processes on other bodies. Through reading recent research papers we will examine a number of topics, in-
cluding the possible Late Heavy Bombardment of the moon, tectonics on Venus, water on Mars, hidden oceans
on Europa, and the methane weather cycle on Titan.
Evaluation will be based on six 2500-word papers, discussion, and critical analysis. There will be a strong focus
on polished writing and argument, and papers will be thoroughly edited by the professor for style, grammar and
syntax. Students will improve their writing by integrating into successive papers the editorial comments they
receive, and also by editing the writing of their tutorial partners.
Prerequisites: one Geosciences course, or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10).
Preference given to sophomores.

GEOS 218T(S) The Carbon Cycle and Climate (Same as Environmental Studies 218T) (W)
Carbon dioxide is the most important atmospheric greenhouse gas, and human activities are adding carbon to the
atmosphere at unprecedented rates. Yet only half of the carbon we emit each year remains in the atmosphere
because biological, geological, and chemical processes continually cycle carbon from the atmosphere to the
ocean, to land plants and soils, and to sediments. The workings of the carbon cycle are at the center of many
controversies surrounding the causes of past climate changes and the outcome of future global warming. How
was the earth's climate steered by past changes in the carbon cycle, billions and millions of years ago? Will natu-
ral processes continue to take up such a high percentage of carbon emissions as emissions continue and climate
changes? Can and should we coax natural systems to take up even more carbon? How might carbon emissions
be reduced on the scale of the Williams campus? We will explore these issues through readings of current journal
articles and reports.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: The class will meet weekly for a one-hour orientation to the topic, and students
will meet in pairs for one hour each week with the instructor. Each student will orally present a written paper
every other week for criticism during the tutorial session. Evaluation will be based on the five papers and each
student's effectiveness as a critic.
Prerequisites: one introductory course in Biology, Chemistry, or Geosciences or one course cross-listed in the
Environmental Studies program. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Preference given to sophomores and jun-
iors.
This course satisfies "The Natural World" requirement for the Environmental Studies concentration.
Hour: 8:30-9:45 M STOLL
GEOS 301(F) Structural Geology (Q)
The structure of the Earth's crust is constantly changing and the rocks making up the crust must deform to ac-
commodate these changes. Rock deformation occurs over many scales ranging from individual mineral grains to
mountain belts. This course deals with the geometric description of structures, stress and strain analysis, de-
formation mechanisms in rocks, and the large scale forces responsible for crustal deformation. The laboratories
cover geologic maps and cross sections, folds and faults, stereonet analysis, field techniques, strain, and stress.
Format: lecture/discussion, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on
weekly laboratory exercises, problem sets, a midterm exam, and a final exam. Many of the laboratories and
problem sets use geometry, algebra, and several projection techniques to solve common problems in structural
geology.
Prerequisites: Geosciences 101, 102, 103, or 105 or permission of instructor. No enrollment limit (expected: 12).
Hour: 11:00-12:15 MW Lab: 1-4 M KARABINOS
GEOS 302(S) Sedimentology (W)
The composition and architecture of sediments and sedimentary rocks preserve information about the rocks that
were eroded to form them, the fluids and forces that transported them, the mechanisms by which they were de-
posited, and the processes by which they were lithified. This course will provide an introduction to the principles
of sedimentology, including sedimentary petrology, fluid mechanics, bedform analysis, and facies architecture.
Format: lecture/discussion, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours per week; two half-day and one all-day
field trip. Evaluation will be based on laboratory work, writing assignments, an hour exam, and a final exam. Ten
written critiques (each 350-400 words) of specific assigned papers from the sedimentological literature are de-
signed to teach clear written expression and careful analytical reading. Papers will be thoroughly edited for style,
grammar and syntax. Students will improve their writing by integrating editorial comments into successive pa-
pers. Each student will compile his/her papers as a growing body of work, and each new paper will be read and
edited in the context of the previous submissions. Prerequisites: Geosciences 202 (may be taken concurrently
with permission of instructor). Enrollment limit: 16 (expected:12).
Hour: 11:20-12:35 TR Lab: 1-4 R COX
GEOS 303(F) Igneous and Metamorphic Petrology
The origin of metamorphic, plutonic, and volcanic rocks are examined in the light of field evidence and
experimental work. Rock texture and composition are used to interpret the environment of formation of
individual rock types, and important assemblages are related, where possible, to theories of global tectonics.
Laboratory work emphasizes the study of individual rock units and rock suites in hand specimens and by
petrographic and x-ray techniques.
Format: lecture/discussion, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours per week; several field trips including
one all-day trip to central New Hampshire. Evaluation will be based on lab work, one hour test, and a final exam.

GEOS 401(F) Stratigraphy
Study of the composition, sequence, and correlation of layered sedimentary rocks is traditionally applied to geo-
logic mapping and the reconstruction of ancient environments. Through the use of various time scales, stratigra-
phy is the unifier of historical geology while also at the heart of conceptual debates over the uniformism or epi-
sodicity of geological processes. During the first half of the course, emphasis will be placed on the various meth-
ods of correlation based on physical means and the use of fossils. The second half of the course will focus on
plate migrations and the relationships between climate and depositional environments as a model for the broad
scale interpretation of sedimentary sequences. This part of the course will be conducted as a seminar, with stu-
dents responsible for topics on the paleogeographic linkage of climate-sensitive facies and natural resources. As a
final project, students working individually or in pairs will present a detailed analysis of North-American strati-
graphic relationships during a specific interval of Cambrian to Cretaceous time. In sequence, these class reports
will provide highlights of the geologic history of the North-American continent through Paleozoic and Mesozoic
time.
Format: lecture, three hours a week; one three-hour lab per week during the first half of the course (including
field problems); independent projects during the second half of the course; one major field trip. Evaluation will
be based on weekly lab assignments during the first half of the semester, seminar participation, and the comple-
tion of a final project during the second half of the semester, as well as a midterm and a final exam.

GEOS 404T(S) Geology of the Appalachians (W)
The Appalachians are the eroded remnants of a mountain range that once rivaled the Alps and, perhaps, the
Himalayas in elevation. They formed hundreds of millions of years ago in three distinct collisions with other
continents. The Appalachians record a rich geologic history of continental rifting, formation and closing of ocean
basins, continental collision, and mountain building. We will read papers that describe the history of the
Appalachians beginning with the Late Precambrian opening of the Iapetus ocean, through the Paleozoic
orogenies that formed the Appalachians, and ending with the formation of the Atlantic. The history of the
Appalachians remains controversial, in part, because of diverse perspectives that geologists bring to their work
and interpretations, such as different specialties, guiding paradigms, and field areas. The readings are designed to
illuminate the roots of the important controversies as well as the geologic history of this well studied mountain
belt.
Format: tutorial; after an initial group meeting, students will meet in pairs for one hour each week with the
instructor. Each student will orally present a written paper every other week for criticism during the tutorial
session. Evaluation will be based on the five papers and each student's effectiveness as a critic.
Prerequisites: one upper level Geosciences course. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10).

LANGUAGE STUDY
The department provides language instruction to enable the student to acquire all four linguistic skills:
understanding, speaking, reading, and writing. German 101-W-102 stresses communicative competence
and covers German grammar in full. German 103 combines a review of grammar with extensive practice
in reading and conversation. German 104 aims to develop facility in speaking, writing, and reading. Ger-
man 111-112 offers an alternative introduction to German with a focus on reading competence. German
201 emphasizes accuracy and idiomatic expression in speaking and writing. German 202 combines ad-
vanced language study with the examination of topics in German-speaking cultures. Students who have
studied German in secondary school should take the placement test given during First Days in September
to determine which course to take.
STUDY ABROAD
The department strongly encourages students who wish to attain fluency in German to spend a semester
or year studying in Germany or Austria, either independently or in one of several approved foreign study
programs. German 104 or the equivalent is the minimum requirement for junior-year abroad programs
sponsored by American institutions. Students who wish to enroll directly in a German-speaking university
should complete at least 201 or the equivalent. In any case, all students considering study-abroad should
discuss their language preparation with a member of the department.
LITERATURE IN TRANSLATION
The department regularly offers courses on German literature in translation for students who have little
or no knowledge of German, but who wish to become acquainted with the major achievements in German
literary and intellectual history.
German

ADVANCED STUDIES
The department offers a variety of advanced courses for students who wish to investigate German litera-
ture, thought, and culture in the original. German 202 is given each year and is recommended as prepara-
tion for upper-level courses.
THE CERTIFICATE IN GERMAN
To enhance a student's educational and professional profiles, the department offers the Certificate in
German. It requires seven courses--three fewer than the major--and is especially appropriate for students
who begin study of the language at Williams.
Students who enter Williams with previous training in German may substitute more advanced courses
for the 100-level courses; they can also be exempted from up to two of the required courses.
Students must receive a minimum grade of B in each course taken in the sequence. In addition, they
must score of at least 650 (out of a possible 800) on the ETS (Educational Testing Service) Proficiency
Test.
Appropriate elective courses can usually be found among the offerings of German, Art History, History,
Music, Philosophy, Political Science, and Theatre.

THE MAJOR
The German major offers students an interdisciplinary approach to German intellectual and cultural his-
tory by combining courses in German language and literature with courses in History, Philosophy, Music,
and other appropriate fields.
For students who start German at Williams, the major requires a minimum of ten courses: German
101-102, 103, 104, 201 and 202; two 300-level German courses; and two electives from either German
courses numbered above 202 or appropriate offerings in other departments.
For students who have acquired intermediate or greater proficiency in the language before coming to
Williams, the minimum requirement is nine courses: German 202; two 300-level German courses; and six
other courses selected from German courses numbered above 102 and appropriate offerings in other de-
partments.
Examples of appropriate courses in other departments are:
ArtH 267 Art in Germany: 1960 to the Present
Comparative Literature 232 European Modernism: Modernity and Its Discontents
History 239 Modern German History
History 338 The History of the Holocaust
Music 108 The Symphony
Music 117 Mozart
Music 118 Bach
Music 120 Beethoven
Philosophy 309 Kant
Students may receive major credit for as many as four courses taken during study abroad in Germany or
Austria in the junior year.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN GERMAN
Students earn honors by completing a senior thesis (German 493-W31-494) of honors quality.
Students interested in honors should consult with the department chair no later than April 15 of their
junior year. The usual qualifications for pursuing honors are: (1) an overall GPA of 3.33 or better, (2) a
departmental GPA of 3.67 or better, (3) a strong interest in a specific topic for which an appropriate faculty
advisor will be available in the senior year.

tensely influencing one another. The course will examine French-German intellectual achievements and rela-
tions against the backdrop of the political and social metamorphoses of France and Germany from the reign of
Louis XV to Bismarck's creation of the Second Reich. Readings will be drawn from the works of Voltaire, Les-
sing, Rousseau, Kant, Goethe, Condorcet, Schiller, Madame de Staël, Novalis, Nerval, Büchner, Baudelaire,
Marx, George Sand, and Nietzsche. All readings in English translation, but students with competence in French

GENERAL STATEMENT OF GOALS
The core objectives of the History department are the cultivation of a critical understanding and aware-
ness of the past and the development of our students' intellectual, analytical, and rhetorical abilities. In
pursuit of the first objective, through its curricular offerings the department seeks both to expose students to
the richness, diversity, and complexities of human history over long periods of time and in different geo-
graphic regions and to provide students with the opportunity to explore aspects of the past in depth. At the
same time, the department endeavors to develop students' ability to think historically and to foster in them
an appreciation of the contested nature and the value of historical knowledge by confronting them with the
variety of ways in which historians have approached and interpreted the past, engaging them in issues that
provoke historical debate, and familiarizing them with the nature and uses of historical evidence. By en-
gaging students in the critical study of the past, finally, the department seeks to develop their ability to
formulate historically informed opinions and their analytical and rhetorical skills generally. While mem-
bers of the department attempt to accomplish these multiple objectives individually through their particular
courses and their other contacts with students, the department seeks to do so collectively through the struc-
ture of the History curriculum and the requirements of the History major.
COURSE NUMBERS
The course numbering system used by the History Department reflects the different types and objectives
of courses offered at each level. The different course levels are distinguished less by degree of difficulty
than by the purposes that the courses at each level are intended to serve and the background knowledge
they presume.
First-Year Seminars and Tutorials (102-199): These writing-intensive courses give students an opportunity
to explore an exciting historical topic in-depth, learn about the discipline of history, and improve their re-
search and writing skills. Because these courses emphasize the acquisition of skills required for the ad-
vanced study of History, they are ideal for students contemplating a major in History.
Each 100-level seminar is normally limited to nineteen students and focuses both on training in research
skills (such as using the library, navigating on-line resources, formulating a research question and develop-
ing a research agenda, and learning how to use different types of evidence) and on the acquisition of read-
ing skills (such as how to interpret different kinds of historical writing and the arguments historians make).
These seminars especially emphasize the importance of writing and include varied assignments that stress
the mechanics of writing and revision and focus on issues of argumentation, documentation, and style.
Enrollment preference in 100-level seminars is normally given to first-year students and then to sopho-
mores.
Each 100-level tutorial stresses the importance of interpreting historical evidence and evaluating the argu-
ments made by historians and likewise fulfills the writing-intensive requirement. Enrollment in these
courses is limited to ten students, each of whom is expected to write five or six interpretive essays and
present five or six oral critiques of another student's work. First-year students and sophomores will normal-
ly be given equal enrollment preference in 100-level tutorials, although first-year students will not normal-
ly be permitted to enroll in a tutorial during the first semester.
Because first-year seminars and tutorials serve as an introduction to the study of history, only one course of
each type may count toward the History major; these courses can also be used to meet the department's
group and concentration requirements.
Introductory Survey Courses (202-299): These courses are open to all students and are intended to provide
a basic understanding of the history of peoples, countries, and geographic regions over relatively long
time-spans. Most of all, they will provide students with the background necessary for more advanced study
in history at the 300 and 400 level. They are offered in either small or large formats, depending on the
individual course.
Junior Seminars (301): Junior seminars explore the nature and practice of history, are required for the de-
gree in History, and are normally restricted to junior History majors. Although these seminars vary in topic
and approach, each focuses on the discipline of history itself--on the debates over how to approach the
past, on questions of the status of different kinds of evidence and how to use it, on the purpose of the study
of history. Focusing on questions of methodology, epistemology, and historiography, these courses ask:
What kind of knowledge do historians claim to produce? What does it mean to study the past? How do
historians approach the project of studying the past? Each year several junior seminars will be offered;
prospective majors must select two junior seminars at the end of their sophomore year and will then be
History

assigned to one of their two choices. Students who plan to study abroad during their junior year may take
their Junior Seminar in the spring semester of their sophomore year, and those planning to be away for the
whole of their junior year are strongly encouraged to do so.
Advanced Electives (302-399): These advanced, topical courses are more specialized in focus than are the
introductory survey courses (202-299) and are intended to follow such courses. Enrollment is often limit-
ed. Because these courses may presume some background knowledge, the instructor may recommend that
students enroll in an appropriate introductory course before registering for an advanced elective.
Advanced Seminars (402-479): These are advanced courses normally limited in enrollment to fifteen stu-
dents. Each seminar will investigate a topic in depth and will require students to engage in research that
leads to a substantial piece of historical writing. All History majors are required to complete either an ad-
vanced seminar (402-479) or a tutorial (480-492). Instructors may recommend prior coursework in the
area of the seminar. Preference is given to senior History majors, followed by junior History majors.
Advanced Tutorials (480-492): These are advanced reading and writing courses that offer an in-depth anal-
ysis of a topic in tutorial format. Tutorials are limited in enrollment to ten students and preference is given
to senior History majors. All History majors are required to complete either an advanced seminar
(402-479) or a tutorial (480-492). Instructors may recommend prior coursework in the area of the tutorial.
The writing of five or six essays and the oral presentation of five or six critiques of another student's essays
are central to tutorials.
Within each of these levels, courses are further divided by geographical area:
Africa and the Middle East 102-111 202-211 302-311 402-411
Asia 112-121 212-221 312-321 412-421

ADVISING
Both majors and non-majors are encouraged to talk at any time with the department chair, the depart-
ment administrative assistant, or any other member of the department about the History major.
All majors will be able to choose a faculty advisor. All majors must meet with their advisor, or the de-
partment chair, during the first week of classes during the fall semester and at the time of the spring semes-
ter registration period in order to have their courses and plans for the History major approved. Students
who are interested in the senior honors program or graduate school should contact Professor Waters. Pro-
spective study abroad students should contact Mrs. Swift.
ADVANCED PLACEMENT
Students receiving a score of 5 on any AP history examination will be guaranteed a place in the 100-lev-
el History seminar of their choice.
THE MAJOR
The major consists of at least nine semester courses as follows:
Required Courses in the Major
One Junior Seminar (History 301)
At least one Advanced Seminar (History 402-479) or Tutorial (History 480-492)
Elective Courses
Seven (or more) additional semester courses in History, at least one of these to be chosen from each of
the following three groups:
Group A: History of the United States
Group B: European History (including Russian History)
Group C: History of Asia, Africa and the Middle East, and/or Latin-American and the Caribbean
In addition, students must take at least one course dealing with the premodern period (designated Group
D in the catalog); this may be one of the courses used to fulfill the group requirement (Groups A-C).
A single course can meet the requirement for no more than one of Groups A through C. Only one First-
year seminar and one First-year tutorial (102-199) may be used to meet the group requirements.
Concentration in the Major
All students are required to adopt a concentration within the History major. The concentration should be
selected in consultation with a faculty advisor at spring registration during the sophomore year. A list of
concentrations is appended below and a list of the courses that fall within each concentration is available
from the History Department office and can also be found on the department's website. Students must
choose to concentrate in one of these eighteen broad areas unless they petition the department's Curricu-
lum Committee to substitute a concentration of their own design. A concentration will consist of at least
three courses linked by common themes, geography, or time period; only one of those courses can be a
100-level seminar while at least one must be a 300- or 400-level course. Courses in the concentration may
History
­ 185 ­
be used to fulfill the group requirements. In selecting courses to meet their concentration requirement, stu-
dents should be aware that not every course is offered every year. Courses taken abroad may be included in
the concentration with the approval of the chair.
Concentrations:
1. Africa and the African Diaspora
2. Asia and the Asian Diaspora
3. The Middle East
4. Comparative Slavery
5. Ancient, Medieval, and Renaissance Europe
6. Early Modern Europe
7. Modern Europe
8. Gender and Sexuality

10. Imperialism, Nationalism, and European Expansion
11. Latin America and the Caribbean
12. Latin America and the Latina/o Diaspora
13. Religion
14. The Twentieth-Century World
15. Colonial North America and the United States to 1865
16. The United States Since 1865
17. Race and Ethnicity in North America
18. Urban and Environmental History
19. War and Revolution
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN HISTORY
The History Department offers a thesis route to the degree with honors in History. This involves a ten-
course major as well as an independent WSP. Students wishing to undertake independent research or con-
sidering graduate study are encouraged to participate in the thesis program and honors seminar.
Application to enter the honors program should be made by spring registration in the junior year and
should be based on a solid record of work of honors caliber, normally defined as maintaining at least a B+
average in courses taken for the major. Students who intend to write an honors thesis must submit a pro-
posal to the History Department at this time. Students who will be away during the spring semester of their
junior year should make arrangements to apply before leaving. Normally, it is the responsibility of the indi-
vidual student to procure the agreement of a member of the department to act as his or her thesis advisor,
and the student must therefore consult with a member of the department about a thesis topic and a possible
thesis advisor prior to submitting a proposal to the department. A student who is uncertain of which mem-
ber of the department might be an appropriate advisor, or who otherwise is unable to find an advisor,
should contact the chair of the honors committee. An honors thesis proposal must be signed by a member
of the History Department. Normally, the thesis topic should be related to course work which the student
has previously done. Students should be aware, however, that while the department will try to accommo-
date all students who qualify to pursue honors, particular topics may be deemed unfeasible and students
may have to revise their topics accordingly. Final admission to the honors program will depend on the
department's assessment of the qualifications of the student and the feasibility of the project.
Once the student has been notified of admission to the honors program, he or she should register for
History 493, Senior Honors Thesis Research Seminar, in the fall semester, for History 031 during winter
study, and for History 494, Senior Honors Thesis Writing Seminar, in the spring. In addition to doing the
research for and writing a thesis of approximately 75-100 pages, students will attend special presentations
under the History Department's Class of 1960 Scholars Program.
During the fall, students should work regularly on their research and consult frequently with their advi-
sors. Throughout the semester, honors candidates will also present written progress reports for group dis-
cussion to the seminar (History 493). Performance in the seminar will be evaluated on the basis of class
participation and completed written work and will determine if a student will continue in the thesis pro-
gram. For students proceeding to History 031 and History 494, performance in the fall semester will figure
into the thesis grade calculated at the end of the year.
Students who are deemed to be making satisfactory progress on their research and writing at this point
will be allowed to continue with the thesis. They will devote the entire winter study period to thesis work.
They should conclude their research during winter study and complete at least one chapter of their thesis
for submission to their advisor before the end of winter study. At the end of winter study, the honors com-
mittee will formally consult with advisors and make recommendations to the department concerning
which students should be allowed to proceed with the thesis. During the early weeks of the second semes-
ter, students will present a draft chapter of their thesis to the honors seminar.
Completed theses will be due in mid-April, after which each student will prepare and make a short oral
presentation of his or her thesis for delivery at the departmental Honors Colloquium. Another student who
has read the thesis will then offer a critique of it, after which the two faculty readers of the thesis will offer
their own comments and questions. Finally, there will be a general discussion of the thesis by students and
other members of the department.

LANGUAGE
Study of a foreign language is basic to the understanding of other cultures. Particularly those students
who might wish to do graduate work in History are encouraged to enroll in language courses at Williams.
STUDY ABROAD
The History Department considers immersion in and familiarity with a foreign culture not only to be
valuable in themselves, but also to provide an important way of understanding the past. Students who ma-
jor in History therefore are encouraged to study a foreign language and to consider studying abroad during
their junior year. History courses taken as part of a study abroad program that is recognized by the college
normally can be used to satisfy departmental distribution and general requirements, up to a maximum of
three courses (this limit does not apply to tutorials taken as part of the Williams-Exeter Program; no courses
taken abroad, even at Oxford, can be used to satisfy the junior seminar and advanced seminar/tutorial re-
quirements). Students who plan to study abroad during their junior year may take their Junior Seminar in
the spring semester of their sophomore year, and those planning to be away the whole of their junior year
are strongly encouraged to do so.
Students interested in studying abroad during their junior year should discuss their plans with a member
of the department as well as with the department study abroad advisor, Mrs. Swift. Approval of departmen-
tal credit for courses taken abroad normally must be obtained from the chair or from the study abroad
advisor prior to the commencement of the study abroad program.
COURSES
FIRST-YEAR SEMINARS AND TUTORIALS (102-199)
These writing-intensive courses give students an opportunity to explore an exciting historical topic in-
depth, learn about the discipline of history, and improve their research and writing skills. Because these
courses emphasize the acquisition of skills required for the advanced study of History, they are ideal for
students contemplating a major in History.
Each 100-level seminar is normally limited to nineteen students and focuses both on training in research
skills (such as using the library, navigating on-line resources, formulating a research question and develop-
ing a research agenda, and learning how to use different types of evidence) and on the acquisition of read-
ing skills (such as how to interpret different kinds of historical writing and the arguments historians make).
These seminars especially emphasize the importance of writing and include varied assignments that stress
the mechanics of writing and revision and focus on issues of argumentation, documentation, and style.
Enrollment preference in 100-level seminars is normally given to first-year students and then to sopho-
mores.
Each 100-level tutorial stresses the importance of interpreting historical evidence and evaluating the argu-
ments made by historians and likewise fulfills the writing-intensive requirement. Enrollment in these
courses is limited to ten students, each of whom is expected to write five or six interpretive essays and
present five or six oral critiques of another student's work. First-year students and sophomores will normal-
ly be given equal enrollment preference in 100-level tutorials, although first-year students will not normal-
ly be permitted to enroll in a tutorial during the first semester.
Because first-year seminars and tutorials serve as an introduction to the study of history, only one course of
each type may count toward the History major; these courses can also be used to meet the department's
group and concentration requirements.

HIST 117T(S) Clash of Empires: China and the West, 1800-1900 (Same as Asian Studies 117T)
(W)*
As ever greater numbers of Western traders sought access to China's products and markets in the early nineteenth
century, their ideas of free trade, hopes for commercial expansion, and expectations for international intercourse
clashed with the policies and practices of the Qing Dynasty's multi-ethnic empire. This conflict reached a climax
in the mid-century Opium Wars, in which China's defeat inaugurated a period of Western domination by several
powers (including Britain, France, the United States, and later, Japan). Despite its weakened position, the Qing
dynasty continued to contest the definition and scope of Western privilege in China through the end of the centu-
ry. Historians have long disagreed over how to interpret this "clash of empires," some seeing Western involve-
ment in China as exploitative imperialism and others seeing it as a positive, modernizing force. In either case,
however, this conflict profoundly affected China's national development in the twentieth century, and continues
to inform contemporary China's view of itself and its international position.
This tutorial course will examine a series of significant points of contention between the Qing Dynasty and ex-
panding Western powers during this period. These will include the opium trade, Christian missionaries, extrater-
History
­ 187 ­
ritorial privilege, Western technology, the looting of Chinese artworks and antiquities, and contests over sover-
eignty in Tibet and Manchuria. We will examine both Western and Chinese perspectives on these conflicts, how
the period has been remembered and interpreted, and how it continues to affect Chinese and Western perceptions
of China's place in the world.
Format: tutorial. Students in the tutorial will meet in weekly one-hour sessions with the instructor and a class-
mate. Each week, students will alternate between writing a 5- to 7-page paper on the assigned readings (to be
presented orally in class) and writing and presenting a 2-page critique of his/her classmate's paper. The course
will conclude with a final paper that examines one of the issues raised in class in greater depth.
No prerequisites.Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Preference will be given to sophomores, and then first-year
students, who have not previously taken a 100-level tutorial.

HIST 118(F) "Ten Years of Madness": The Chinese Cultural Revolution (Same as Asian Studies
118) (W)*
In 1966 Mao Zedong launched the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in an attempt to restore revolutionary
purity to the Chinese Communist Party and society. The Cultural Revolution decade (1966-1976) is remembered
most often as a period of political violence and intense struggle, over which Mao reigned as supreme leader. In
this course, we will complicate this standard interpretation by examining the Cultural Revolution in a variety of
ways: as an elite political struggle, an attempt to proletarianize culture and the arts, a social movement, and a
youth movement. The course will address themes of participation and complicity, new gender roles, impact on
different social groups, and differences between rural and urban experience. In addition to relevant historiograph-
ical works, the course will use memoirs, fiction, films, and ethnographies.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class participation, several short papers, and a final research paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference will be given to first-year students, and then

FIRST-YEAR SEMINARS AND TUTORIALS: EUROPE AND RUSSIA (122-141)
HIST 124(S) The Vikings (W)
Viking raiders in longships burst through the defenses of ninth-century Europe, striking terror in the hearts of
peasants, monks, and kings for the next three centuries. Yet the impact of these sea-born Scandinavians on
European civilization was more complex and constructive than portrayed by medieval chroniclers. Vikings acted
as merchants, craftsmen, farmers, settlers, and mercenaries, and they colonized regions beyond the edges of the
known world like Russia, Iceland, and North America. This course explores the complicated relationship of the
Vikings with the medieval world and examines important developments within Scandinavian society such as
kingship, trade, and Christianization. At the same time, we will consider the methodological difficulties
presented by the diverse and often contradictory historical sources for the Vikings such as monastic chronicles,
archaeology, inscriptions, and Scandinavian sagas.
Format: seminar/lecture. Evaluation will be based on class participation and several papers and assignments.

HIST 129(S) Blacks, Jews, and Women in the Age of the French Revolution (W)*
The French Revolution was an important turning point in world history. Besides ushering in an age of liberté
(liberty) and egalité (equality), it also postulated the existence of a new revolutionary fraternité (brotherhood)
between peoples of all backgrounds. Would revolutionary fraternity include women, African slaves, and Jews in
the new democratic polity? French men and women debated these questions in ways that have had a direct
impact on our contemporary discussions of race, gender, religious freedom and ethnicity. In this course, we will
explore these debates, their Enlightenment roots, and the legacy of these debates for France's minorities today,
especially those of Arabic and Islamic origin. Students will be introduced to various types of historical sources
(rare books, art, opera, plays), as well as to the lively historiographical debates between historians of France
concerning methodology, politics, and the goal of historical research.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class participation, oral reports, 1-2 short papers, a 15- to 20-page
research paper, and a final examination (may be an oral and/or take-home exam). The class will also be expected
to go on a couple of field trips.

HIST 136(F) Before the Deluge: Paris and Berlin in the Interwar Years (W)
Paris and Berlin were the two poles of Europe in the 1920s, rival capital cities of two historically hostile nations
that had only just put an end to the carnage of World War I. Paris was the grande dame; Berlin the upstart. In the
History
­ 188 ­
1920s, these two pulsating metropolises became the sites of political and cultural movements that would leave a
lasting imprint on European society until the present day. This course focuses on the politics, society, and culture
of these two cities in their heyday in the 1920s. We will also consider their fate in the 1930s, first as depression set
in, and then as the Nazis came to power. Devoting half the semester to Paris and the other half to Berlin, we will
examine a range of parallel topics in both contexts, including the impact of World War I, the growing popularity
of right-wing political movements and the increase in political violence, shifting gender norms and sexual mores,
and new developments in the realms of art, film, theatre, cabaret, and literature.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class attendance and participation, several short papers, and a final
research paper.

HIST 141(F) Modernism, Leisure, and Subjectivity in Fin-de-Siècle Russia (W)
This course introduces students to the artistic movements, everyday life, and socio-cultural upheavals of urban
Russia in the fin-de-siècle (1881 to 1914). The fast-paced, consumer-oriented modern city, with its celebrities,
fashions, and technological wonders, gripped the imagination of imperial Russia's urban denizens.The inhabit-
ants of St. Petersburg and Moscow, conscious of living in a new era, embraced and grappled with the Modern
Age as journalists, impresarios, and artists narrated and interpreted it. We will explore the ways revolution and
war, industrialization, the commercialization of culture, and new sensibilities about the self and identity were
reflected in modernist art and thought, literature, and autobiographical writings. We also will look closely at the
realms of elite entertainment and popular amusement in an attempt to relate consumer culture to notions of gen-
der and sexuality, the redefinition of status and privilege, and concepts of leisure. Historians have offered com-
peting explanations of how and why the rapid social, economic and cultural changes of this period contributed to
the fall of the Russian monarchy and the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917. Our primary goal will be to use sources
to assess their arguments and, hopefully, make our own. Texts include: historical scholarship, literary works,
philosophical and sociological writings, music, visual art, and film.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class participation, several short essays, and a final research paper.

FIRST-YEAR SEMINARS AND TUTORIALS: UNITED STATES (152-191)
HIST 154T(S) The American Way of War: The First Three Centuries (W)
Is there an historically distinct American way of war? How have Americans experienced warfare? From the
earliest days of European settlement through the final campaigns against American Indians west of the Missis-
sippi, Americans have often been at war. Long before the United States became a world power those conflicts
had determined many of the basic contours of American society, culture, and nationhood. This tutorial will in-
vestigate the nature and development of American wars over the period 1600 to 1900. Though some attention
will be paid to the American Revolution and the Civil War, the tutorial will concentrate primarily on lesser
known but still historically significant wars, including King Philip's War, the Seven Years War, the War of 1812,
Jackson's Indian Wars, the Mexican-American War, the Plains Indians Wars, and the Spanish American War. All
but the last were fought to conclusion in North America itself. How did Americans fight these wars? How did
American militaries establish control over such a huge and varied continent? What role did military institutions
play in the development of a distinctive American society? Did war abet social mobility, or lend itself to social
control? What role did race play in the creation and sustaining of martial goals? What was the relationship be-
tween local military institutions and centralist attempts to create a national and/or professional army? What was
the impact of warfare on American culture, on concepts of masculinity, and national or community images?
Despite the fact that Americans have often conceived of themselves as a peace-loving people, war from the be-
ginning has played a key role in shaping their society and nation. It is exactly the nature, meaning, and paradoxes
of American wars that this tutorial will attempt to unravel.
Format: tutorial. Students will meet with the instructor in pairs for an hour each week. Each student will write
and present orally a 7-page essay every other week on the readings assigned for that week. In alternate weeks,
students will be responsible for offering an oral critique of the work of their partner.

­ 189 ­
reading a number of key books in the field, and then we will turn to the College library's extensive holdings of
microfilm records dealing with both agricultural and industrial slavery. In consultation with the instructor, each

HIST 165(F) The Quest for Racial Justice in Twentieth-Century America (Same as Africana

On August 28, 1963, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. delivered arguably some of the most recognizable phrases of
the civil rights movement in his famous "I Have a Dream" speech. While significant and clearly central to the
quest for racial justice in twentieth-century America, Dr. King's leadership should be understood within the
context of ongoing national and grassroots political activism before, during, and after the 1963 March on
Washington. This introductory course focuses on the social, political, and public policy perspectives that
informed twentieth-century struggles for black civil rights. Using a variety of sources (memoirs, photography,
film, and music), we will consider historical debates as well as the period's impact on our understanding of
African American and American history.

HIST 192(F) War and the Disruption of Nature (Same as Environmental Studies 192) (W)
Everyone knows war is bad for the environment, but the ways in which wars affect people's environments go far
beyond simply the devastation from bombs and other offensive attacks. Wars fundamentally disrupt how soci-
eties utilize and allocate a wide variety of resources, such as land, energy sources, and water. Moreover, with the
enormous loss of human life and with the devastation of regional or national economies, wars set off a chain of
political and societal reactions that have profound transformations in how people interact with nature for decades
to follow. This course will look historically at the environmental dislocations produced by wars and even military
production during peaceful time, focusing in particular on the twentieth century. After doing a broad review of
the larger historical themes of the course, we will explore several case studies that span different continents.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class participation, weekly short writing assignments and frequent
peer editing, several short papers, and a final 6- to 8-page research paper.

sections. The first section of the course focuses on the consequences of the slave trade on African societies and
on the Africans' interaction with European merchants, explorers, and missionaries in the decades preceding
colonial conquest. The human consequences of the trade lingered long after the abolition of the slave trade across
the Atlantic ocean. Many African societies were strengthened, often at the expense of their neighbors; other
societies were weakened, thus setting the stage for colonial conquest. During the second half of the nineteenth
century, however, competition among Europeans for control of raw materials for their nascent industries led to
colonization, and in some cases, to white settlement in Africa.
The second section of the course investigates the process of colonial conquest and the dynamics of colonial rule
History

in Africa. It looks especially at the ways in which colonialism affected various groups of Africans, and at the
ways, both subtle and overt, in which Africans resisted or collaborated with colonial rule in order to achieve their
goals. The colonial period, brief in time, yet profoundly significant in its impact, was ushered out partly by the
rising tide of African nationalism.
The last section of the course, then, examines the rise of new nation-states, their colonial legacies, post-colonial
economies, and systems of justice, education, and governance.

China expanded from scattered Neolithic settlements to become one of the world's most complex and sophisti-
cated civilizations. During this process, it experienced dramatic transformation as well as remarkable institutional
and cultural continuities. This course will examine Chinese history from prehistoric times to the "early modern"
seventeenth century. It will address topics such as the creation and transformation of dynastic authority, the rein-
terpretation of Confucian thought, the transmission of Buddhism, the conquest of China proper by "barbarian"
peoples, the composition of elites, and change in daily life, popular culture and China's place in the East Asian

nominally Communist government, extremes of urban wealth and rural poverty, increasing participation in the
international community and intensifying nationalist rhetoric. This course will examine China's historical en-
gagement with the modern world in order to gain perspective on our current views. It will cover the Qing
(1644-1911) dynastic order, encounters with Western and Japanese imperialism, the rise of Chinese nationalism,
Republican and Communist revolutions, the "other Chinas" of Taiwan and Hong Kong, economic liberalization,
and globalization.

This course explores the development of European and Mediterranean civilizations during the thousand-year
period known as the "Middle Ages." At the beginning of this period the Romans ruled a massive empire that
stretched from Britain to north Africa and from Spain to Iraq. A millennium later, this classical and pagan world
had broken apart into three successor civilizations: medieval Europe, the Byzantine empire, and the Islamic
world. This course investigates how this momentous transformation occurred. We will examine such topics as
relations between Romans and "barbarians," the spread of Christianity and Islam, the development of kingdoms
and empires, the Vikings and crusades, saints and religious reformers, art and architecture, cities and trade, the

This course introduces students to the era of the European domination of the world, a time of revolutionary
excitement and fervor, of war and travesty, of profound social and economic change, and of great intellectual
ferment. Topics include the French and Russian Revolutions, the Revolutions of 1830 and 1848, the Industrial
Revolution, German and Italian Unification, European imperialist expansion, processes of secularization and
religious revival, and the origins of World War I. With an eye toward exploring the origins of today's complex
attitudes toward race, ethnicity, and gender, the course will also investigate racial thought, anti-semitism, and
feminism in the nineteenth century.

HIST 228(S) Europe in the Twentieth Century
This survey course has two goals: to introduce students to the fundamental issues and experiences of the last
century of European history, from the eve of World War One to the present, and to teach students to be historians.
Toward that end, students will be required, in class and in written assignments, to use primary sources in con-
junction with secondary source readings to pose questions and suggest interpretations about the past. Wars, de-
pression, political changeovers, urbanization, technological advancements all have a profound impact on the
lives of ordinary people; so, too, ordinary people shape those historical developments. We will focus on learning
how to empathize with people from the past and to understand their experiences on their terms. What was it like
to return to civilian life after fighting in the First World War? What were the experiences of Europeans between
the wars? Why did so many Germans support Hitler and what was it like for different segments of European
society to live through World War II? In a divided postwar Europe, what hopes and betrayals did Europeans on
different sides of the Iron Curtain experience in the realms of social, economic, and legal justice? How have
Europeans since the fall of the Berlin Wall attempted to confront their pasts? By the end of this course, students
will be familiar with the central themes of the history of twentieth-century Europe and understand how to ana-
lyze historical documents, which students can replicate in their future research and writing.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, several quizzes, an exam, and two
papers.

HIST 237(S) Modern France: From the French Revolution to Rioting Banlieues
Revolution, war, occupation and civil strife--these have been endemic in France since the fragile birth of the first
Republic in 1792. Why has this country, known for its universal ideals of brotherhood, for its early emancipation
of the Jews, and for its impressive female activism during the heady days of the Revolution, given rise to the
absence of a strong feminist movement in the contemporary era, unparalleled wars of colonial atrocity (Haiti,
Vietnam, Algeria), and a native pro-Nazi regime responsible for sending thousands of Jews to concentration
camps during World War II? We will explore these questions while surveying French history from 1789 to the
present, paying special attention to French imperialism in Africa, Asia, and the Caribbean. Toussaint l'Ouverture,
Napoleon, Tocqueville, Dreyfus, Zola, DeGaulle,Ho Chi Minh, Senghor, Cartre, Camus, Beauvoir, Fanon, Ces-
aire. These will be some of our guides through France's tumultuous present. French film, food, and music will

HIST 240(F) Muscovy and the Russian Empire
Between the fourteenth and the seventeenth centuries the princes and political elite of Muscovy created a vast
multi-national empire in Eastern Europe and Asia. Over the next 150 years their imperial heirs transformed and
extended this empire, to the point that on the eve of the Crimean War (1853-1855) many believed it to be the
most powerful state in Europe. But defeat in the war exposed the weakness of the imperial regime and helped to
provoke a process of state-led reform that failed to avert, and may well have contributed to, the collapse of the
regime in the February Revolution of 1917. Using a combination of primary and secondary sources, this course
will explore the character of the Muscovite and the Russian empires and the forces, processes, and personalities
that shaped their formation, expansion, and, in the latter case, decline.
Format: discussion/lecture. Evaluation will be based on class participation, a map quiz, several short essays based
on class readings, and a final self-scheduled exam.

Less than seventy-five years later, the experiment appeared to end in failure, with the stunning collapse of the
Soviet Union in December 1991. Using a combination of primary and secondary sources, this course will
explore the nature and historical significance of the Soviet experiment, the controversies to which it has given
rise, and the forces, processes, and personalities that shaped the formation, transformation, and ultimate collapse
of the Soviet Union.

These communities were formed through conquest, immigration, and migration. In examining the causes of
migration, we will consider economic and political conditions in the countries of origin, U.S. foreign policies,
and the connections between the United States and the countries of origin. We will explore the ways in which
migration processes are mediated through labor recruitment, immigration and refugee policies, and social
networks. We will analyze how Latinos and Latinas have been incorporated into the economies of the regions of
the United States where they settled. Focusing on the historical experiences of Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, Cubans,
and Dominicans, this course will also address more recent immigration from Central and South American
countries.

JUNIOR SEMINARS (301)
Junior seminars explore the nature and practice of history, are required for the degree in History, and are
normally restricted to junior History majors. Although these seminars vary in topic and approach, each
focuses on the discipline of history itself--on the debates over how to approach the past, on questions of
the status of different kinds of evidence and how to use it, on the purpose of the study of history. Focusing
on questions of methodology, epistemology, and historiography, these courses ask: What kind of knowl-
edge do historians claim to produce? What does it mean to study the past? How do historians approach the
project of studying the past? Each year several junior seminars will be offered; prospective majors must

are strongly encouraged to do so.
HIST 301A(F,S) Approaching the Past: History, Theory, Practice
This course will explore how the discipline of `History' has come to assume its present form and how a number
of historians since the 1820s have understood their craft. We will begin by discussing the work of three great
nineteenth-century historians (Macaulay, Marx, and Ranke) who believed that historical "truth" existed and
could, with skill, be deciphered. Next we will explore the philosophy and practice of the cultural and social histo-
rians of the 1960s/1970s, comparing and contrasting it with that of their nineteenth-century predecessors. We
will then consider the work of those recent theorists who have tried to refute historians' claims to be able to
capture the "truth" of the past, focusing on the state of the field in the wake of challenges posed to its epistemo-
logical foundations by "post-modernism." We will conclude with an assessment of the state of the discipline
today. In general, we will be less concerned with "the past" than with what historians do with "the past." Conse-
quently, we will focus primarily on those abstract, philosophical assumptions that have informed the practice of
history.
Format: discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, a 250-word position statement ("What is
History?"), two 9- to 11-page interpretive essays, and a take-hone final exam.
Enrollment limit: 20 (expected: 15-20). Restricted to History majors.

HIST 301F(F) Approaching the Past: Remembering American History
Much of what we know and understand about American history is rooted in the received narrative of our national
history, a history that is constructed of individual, collective, and a national memory of the past and its meanings.
This course will examine some forms through which American historical memory is presented and (re)present-
ed, such as monuments, museums, novels, film, photographs, and scholarly historical writing, by considering a
number of pivotal events, institutions, or eras in American history: slavery, race, and the Civil War; the Great
Depression; World War II; the Sixties and the war in Viet Nam; and the events and aftermath of September 11,
2001.

HIST 301G(S) Approaching the Past: Westward Expansion in American History
For historians of the United States, the Anglo-American settlement of the West has been a critical lens for
viewing the development of the nation. But historians have never reached any consensus on what the process of
westward expansion, or the influence of the West as a region, has meant to American history. Did the frontier
build American character, as Frederick Jackson Turner argued in 1893? Did it establish patterns of conquest that
shaped American policy toward other parts of the world, as some current historians would argue today? Has the
West been an exceptional place or representative of the nation at large? How should we even define "the West" or
"the frontier"? These are some of the questions we will explore as we survey the historiographical trajectory on
the subject from the mid-nineteenth century to the present.
Format: seminar. Requirements: class participation, weekly writing, short essays, and a final paper.

HIST 323(S) Leadership, Government, and the Governed in Ancient Greece (Same as

Visionary, opportunist, reformer, tyrant, demagogue, popular champion: concise characterization of
influential leaders is often irresistible. But placing leaders in their much less easily encapsulated
political, social, and religious contexts reveals them to be far more complicated and challenging subjects.
Among the questions that will guide our study of Greek leadership: Was the transformative leader in a
Greek city always an unexpected one, arising outside of the prevailing political and/or social systems?
To what extent did the prevailing systems determine the nature of transformative as well as of normative
leadership? How did various political and social norms contribute to legitimating particular kinds of
leader? After studying such leaders as the "tyrants" who prevailed in many Greek cities of both the
archaic and classical eras, then Athenian leaders like Solon, Cleisthenes, Cimon, Pericles, Cleon, and
Demosthenes, and Spartans like Cleomenes, Leonidas, Brasidas, and Lysander, we will focus on
Alexander the Great, whose unique accomplishments transformed every aspect of Greek belief about
leadership, national boundaries, effective government, the role of the governed, and the legitimacy of
power. Readings will include accounts of leadership and government by ancient Greek authors (e.g.
Homer, Solon, Herodotus, Thucydides, Plato, Aristotle, Demosthenes, all in translation) and
contemporary historians and political theorists.
Format: discussion/lecture. Evaluation will be based on contributions to class discussions, three short
papers (4-6 pages each), a midterm exam, and an oral presentation leading to a significant final paper

Europeans have not only constantly been at war with other Europeans, but also with neighboring cultures and,
indeed, most peoples around the globe. This course will introduce students to the history of European warfare
from its origins in the classical and medieval periods to its maturation in the early modern period (1450-1815),
and its disastrous culmination in the nationalist struggles of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Has there
been a distinctively "European Way of War" from the beginning? How do we explain failure and success in
European wars? What exactly happened at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels of war? And what caused
changes in the organization and waging of European war from one period to the next?
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, one short research paper, and mid-
term and final exams.
No enrollment limit (expected: 30). Open to all.

HIST 329(S) The Christianization of Europe (Same as Religion 214) (W)
The most important development in the history of Europe was its conversion to Christianity during Late Antiqui-
ty and the early Middle Ages. In the fourth century the Roman emperors embraced Christianity as the new
religion of their Mediterranean empire, and in subsequent centuries bishops, monks, and missionaries gradually
converted the barbarian peoples of Europe to the new religion. In the process, Christianity transformed the
peoples and kingdoms it came into contact with and bequeathed to them the legacy of the Roman imperial past.
This course explores how the late Roman empire became Christian and how Christianity influenced the polities
and societies of early medieval Europe. In the process we will explore such topics as the emergence of Christian
doctrine and monasticism, the lives and thoughts of the Church Fathers, the role of saints and missionaries, the
function of relics and miracles, the formation of the Church and Papacy, the politics of conversion of kings and
kingdoms, the development of Christian art and literature, and the impact of Christianity on everyday religious
practices and beliefs.
Format: seminar/lecture. Evaluation will be based on class participation, a midterm and final exam, and several

HIST 338(F) The History of the Holocaust (Same as Jewish Studies 338)
In twenty-first century America, the murder of approximately six million European Jews by Nazi Germany re-
mains a central event in our political, moral, and cultural universe. Nevertheless, the Holocaust still confounds
historians' efforts to understand both the motivations of the perpetrators and the suffering of the victims. In this
course, we will study the origins and implementation of the Holocaust from the divergent perspectives of perpe-
trators and victims. Our goal will be to investigate deeply the interaction of individual lives and world historical
events. We will also examine the Holocaust within the larger context of the history of World War II in Europe and
the historians' debates about Germany's exterminatory war aims. Course materials will include diaries, bureau-
cratic documents, memoirs, films, and historical scholarship.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class participation, a map quiz, six thought papers (4 pages) based

While the First World War had a highly equivocal outcome which most Americans found unsatisfactory and
failed to lead to a lasting peace, the Second World War ended in triumph and shaped the world for the rest of the
twentieth century. This course will compare the leadership of two American Presidents in two world wars. Areas
of particular focus will include their initial response to these conflicts and the development of their stance to-
wards them; the definition of their war aims; the foundation and maintenance of their alliances; the military plan-
ning and conduct of the wars; the impact of the wars upon domestic politics; and their attempts to secure peace
settlements that reflected their objectives. The course will combine secondary readings with some work in pri-
mary sources to allow students to become familiar with the atmosphere of these two periods.

During the course of the semester, we shall investigate two broad, interrelated topics: slavery in the antebellum
South, and the impact of slavery on Southern civilization. Our approach will be primarily topical. In the first half
of the course, we shall look at subjects like the foreign and domestic slave trade, patterns of work and treatment,
the nature of the master-slave relationship, resistance and rebellion, and slave cultural, social, and family life. The
second half of the course will concentrate on the influence of the institution of slavery on the mind, social struc-
ture, and economy of the Old South, and slavery's impact on Southern politics and the decision for secession in
1860-61.

The politics surrounding the environment today are a super-heated source of conflict, at the same time that most
opinion polls show that Americans widely embrace many environmental protections. While environmental con-
cerns have long been a part of local politics in America, this course will largely explore the emergence and prom-
inence of environmental issues in national politics, from the first organized conservation efforts in the late-nine-
teenth century to the present-day concerns with the global environment. Throughout the course we will investi-
gate both how changes in the environment have shaped American politics and how political decisions have al-
tered the American and even world-wide-environment.

HIST 373(F) Va Va Vroom!--A Nation on Wheels
Arguably the single most powerful agency shaping life in the United States since the beginning of the twentieth
century has been the automobile. Making cars go--building and maintaining them and the systems they
require--is by far the nation's largest industry. From cities and towns to the smallest hamlets and the uninhabited
wilderness beyond, the American landscape has been totally transformed by the automobile. In a hardly less
important vein, automobiles have left an indelible imprint on the dreams we dream. They have also changed
forever where we live; the way we rear our children; how and what we consume; the demands we make on
government; the crimes we commit; the way we enforce the law--even the way we go to our graves. The course
will consider this protein phenomenon selectively and in detail. Readings will be drawn from a wide variety of
sources.

This course explores the shifting and contested meanings and experiences of sex and sexuality, primarily in
North America, from the pre-colonial period to the present. We will pay close attention to changing definitions
and experiences of sexual deviance and norms. We will explore as well the role of sexual practices and ideologies
in creating and maintaining hierarchies of class, race, and gender. Topics include the place of sex in histories of
conquest and colonization; Victorian sexual ideology and behavior; the formation of diverse heterosexual, les-
bian, gay, and transgender identities, cultures, and communities, the "sexual revolutions" of the 1910s and 1960s;

HIST 392(S) Spiritual Conquest & Expulsion: Jesuits in the Atlantic World, 1540-1773
The Jesuit Order bears the dubious mark of distinction of being the only missionary group to be expelled from
the empires of France, Spain and Portugal, and suppressed by the Catholic Church in the eighteenth century.
Infamous for this failure, the Jesuits are also legendary for their martyrdoms, successful conversion strategies,
precise records of indigenous voices, and pan-European membership. This course takes the Jesuit Order as a case
study of Atlantic history, a new subfield that looks beyond the analytical categories of nation and empire. The
same Jesuit transnationalism and global outreach that provoked the suspicion of European monarchs inspires
today's Atlantic historians to seize on the Jesuits as a window into understanding the expansion of Catholicism in
the early modern period. This course surveys the history of the Jesuit Order from its founding in Europe to its
papal suppression, considering key moments such as the barring of women from the Order and the Chinese Rites
controversy. We will particularly consider the controversial Jesuit reductions in Paraguay and seventeenth-centu-
ry Jesuit martyrdoms in Canada. Readings alternate historical scholarship with primary sources by Jesuit lumi-
naries Ignatius Loyola, Matteo Ricci, Antonio Ruiz de Montoya, Andrés Pérez de Ribas, Paul le Jeune and Jo-
seph-François Lafitau. We will explore how the self-reported actions of these men shaped conceptions of Jesuits
as both heroes and conspirators in a rapidly expanding world.

HIST 395(S) Fashioning Bodies: Dress, Consumption, and Gender from the Renaissance to the
Present (Same as Women and Gender Studies 395)
This course explores costume and fashion as vehicles for the (re)creation and expression of gender, class, and
sexual identities in Europe and the United States. We will begin by looking at the relationship between fashion
and the political and economic power of the courts of early modern Europe. Revolutionary ideologies will be
linked to sartorial politics, consumption of clothing to colonization, and changes in the style of clothing to shift-
ing social norms. As our focus turns to the fashion industry in the twentieth century, when mass-produced cloth-
ing increased the possibility for reflexivity and imaginative play in dress, we will relate representations of the
dressed body to the formation of diverse cultural communities, beauty ideals, and status hierarchies, examining
both the normative and subversive potential of fashion. The course considers work in the fields of art history,
cultural history, sociology and anthropology, feminist theory, and fashion journalism to ask questions such as:
What are the origins of consumer societies? When, why, and how were fashion and consumption feminized? Is
clothing a language? What cultural, political and social meanings do certain forms of dress generate? What is the
relationship between prevalent understandings of the body and fashion? How is clothing used to stigmatize or
differentiate individuals and communities? Topics include: the origins of uniforms and sportswear, eroticism and
androgyny in fashion, the cultural politics of ethnic" clothing, and the relationship between the fashion indus-
try and cinema.

and its aftermath in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Topics to be covered include Napoleon's Egyptian
Campaign, Anglo-French rivalry over the Canal and the Suez crisis of 1956, the Algerian Revolution and the
anti-Islamic coup in 1991-2, and the migration of North Africans to Europe in the post 1945 period. Racial ten-
sions, battles over headscarves, and Jewish-Muslim relations in contemporary France, are among the topics to be

HIST 425(F) The First Crusade (Same as Religion 215) (W)*
The First Crusade (1095-1131) was one of the most remarkable episodes in the history of the Middle Ages.
Responding to the call of Pope Urban II, a mass movement of armed pilgrims marched almost 2000 miles from
western Europe to the Holy Land to reconquer Jerusalem from Turkish invaders. In the eyes of these crusaders,
they were undertaking a Christian pilgrimage and penitential war through which they hoped to win salvation,
glory, and treasure. In the eyes of others, however, the crusaders were savage barbarians who understood little of
the sophisticated civilizations they encountered and who butchered innocent Jews, Muslims, and fellow
Christians in God's name. This seminar explores the origins, course, and impact of the First Crusade from social,
History

cultural, theological, political, economic, and military perspectives. Special attention will be given to analyzing,
comparing, and contrasting different accounts of the First Crusade--not only those of western Christians, but
also of Jews, Byzantine Greeks, Muslims, and other witnesses. Through this study of the First Crusade, we will
examine one of the defining events of the Middle Ages and uncover the roots of much ethnic, religious, and
political conflict in our modern world. Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on several short papers, a map

This seminar studies the movements and themes of Russian thought from the Enlightenment to 1917, situating
works of Russian philosophy and literature, when appropriate, within the broader context of Western intellectual
traditions. We will explore how ideas about human nature and society inspired and gave meaning to political
reform, terrorism, and revolution in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and ponder their relevance in
Russia today. The course covers themes such as the individual and society, morality and love, and time and es-
chatology, as well as topics like: the problem of national identity, conservatism and radicalism, the forging of the
intelligentsia" tradition, the commercialization of culture, and revolutionary language in 1917. Readings in-
clude texts by Pushkin, Belinsky, Dostoevsky, Herzen, Tolstoy, Solvyov, Berdiaev, as well as modernist works
(Bely, Blok, Ivanov) and Marxist writings (Plekhanov, Bogdanov, Lenin). We also will read secondary historical
literature, watch films, and listen to music in order to gain a deeper understanding of the cultural environment in

spread of Communism into South Vietnam that became the most controversial conflict since the Civil War, and
the broader, simultaneous changes in American society to which it made such a profound and lasting contribu-
tion. The first half of the course will examine the decisions that led the United States into the war, the course of
the fighting, the strategy of the enemy, and the reasons for our departure. The second half will begin with a look
at the United States in 1961 and show how the war, combined with the advent of the Boom generation, trans-
formed virtually every aspect of American life over the following fifteen years, and laid the foundation for the
political conflicts that have dominated American society ever since.

to contemporaries to represent definitive aspects of "American" development. We will begin with Boston--the
country's first "big" city and the nominal capital of Puritan New England--in the colonial and early national
History

periods. From there we will move to Chicago, the transportation and commercial hub of the emerging national
economy in the nineteenth century. Finally we will turn to Los Angeles, "The City of Dreams" and the center of
the popular entertainment industry in the twentieth century. In each case, drawing on a variety of sources, we will
examine the city's origins, the factors that promoted its growth, and the distinctive society it engendered. Then
we will consider some of the city's cultural expressions--expressions that seem to characterize not only chang-
ing the nature of urban life, but the particular meanings each city gave to the nation's experience at the time. What
made these cities seem simultaneously, as they did, so alluring and so threatening to the fabric of national com-
munity and identity?

of-the century to the present. As we discuss the period from the interpretive frameworks that have guided schol-
arship in black urban studies, we will focus on selected themes such as migration, the black family, political
activism, and culture. We will explore the various dimensions of the black urban experience by using primary
resources, scholarly analyses, music, and film.

These are advanced reading and writing courses that offer an in-depth analysis of a topic in a tutorial
format. Tutorials are limited in enrollment to ten students and preference is given to senior History majors.
All History majors are required to complete either an advanced seminar (402-479) or a tutorial (480-492).
Instructors may recommend prior coursework in the area of the tutorial. The writing of five or six essays
and the oral presentation of five or six critiques of another student's essays are central to tutorials.

HIST 482T(S) Memory, History, and the Extermination of the Jews of Europe (Same as Jewish
Studies 482) (W)
The atrocities committed by Nazi Germany during the Second World War continue to trouble historians in their
attempts to understand and represent them in all their magnitude and horror. Beyond historians, the complicity of
segments of European societies in perpetrating those atrocities continues to raise thorny questions for postwar
European nations about what their responsibilities are toward that past.
This tutorial will focus on a series of questions relating to the historicization and memorialization of the exter-
mination of European Jews. They include: Is the Holocaust unique? Is it a Jewish story or universal story? Does
the Holocaust raise different issues for the historian than other historical events? How should the Holocaust be
represented and what are the implications of different means of representing it? What role, if any, did European
Jews play in their own destruction? Has Germany faced up to its past? Were Germans also victims of World War
II? Who were the "bystanders" as compared to the "perpetrators"? Were the postwar trials of perpetrators a trav-
esty of justice? How appropriate are the different uses that Israel and the United States have made of the Holo-
caust? By the end of the course, students will have grappled with the ongoing controversies that have arisen
among scholars, governments, and lay people about the meaning (and meaninglessness) of the Holocaust for the
postwar world. In a world in which extraordinary acts of violence continue to be perpetrated and more and more
nations' pasts are marked by episodes of extreme criminality and/or trauma, exploring the manner by which one
such episode has been remembered, avenged, and adjudicated should prove relevant for future consideration of
other societies' efforts to confront their own traumatic pasts.

HIST 487T(F) The Second World War: Origins, Course, Outcomes, and Meaning (W)
1991 marked the fiftieth anniversaries of the Nazi invasion of Russia and the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.
Though war had come to Europe as early as 1939, when Germany invaded Poland, after 1941 the war became a
truly global conflict of unprecedented extent, ferocity, and destructiveness. As late as 1943 it still appeared that
the Axis powers might win the war. But, by the end of the 1945, the bombed-out ruins of Germany and Japan
were occupied by the Allies, who were preparing to put the surviving Axis leaders and generals on trial for war
crimes.
This tutorial will concentrate on a number of important questions and issues which arise from a study of World
War II. What were the origins of this central event of the twentieth century? How and why did the war begin?
Why did the war take the course it did? What were the most crucial or decisive episodes or events? How did the
Allies win? Why did the Axis lose? Could the outcome have been different?
Many of the topics examined will also have to deal with important questions of human responsibility and with
the moral or ethical dimensions of the war. Why did France, Britain, and the Soviet Union not stop Hitler earlier?
Who was to blame for the fall of France and the Pearl Harbor fiasco? Why did the Allies adopt a policy of exten-
sive firebombing of civilian targets? How could the Holocaust have happened? Could it have been stopped? Did
the Atomic bomb have to be dropped? Were the war crime trials justified?
By the end of the tutorial, students will have become thoroughly familiar with the general course the war fol-
lowed as well as acquiring in-depth knowledge of the most decisive and important aspects of the conflict. Stu-
dents will also have grappled with the task of systematically assessing what combinations of material and human
factors can best explain the outcomes of the major turning points of the war. Students will also have dealt with the
problem of assessing the moral and ethical responsibility of those persons, organizations, and institutions in-
volved in the war.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: each student will write and present orally an essay of approximately seven
double-spaced pages every other week on a topic assigned by the instructor. Students not presenting an essay
have the responsibility of critiquing the work of their colleague. The tutorial will culminate in a final written
exercise.

scholarship that addresses the body as a subject of historical research and interpretation, paying particular atten-
tion to the constitution of the body in relation to historical configurations of gender, race, sexuality, and ability/
disability.

THE THESIS AND INDEPENDENT STUDY (493-499)
HIST 493(F) Senior Thesis Research/Writing Seminar
This seminar is a colloquium for the writers of honors theses. Although each student's major work for the fall
will be the writing of a thesis in consultation with an individual advisor, students will gather for occasional meet-

ings in order to present and critique each other's proposals and drafts and to discuss common problems in re-
search and the design of a long analytical essay. Evaluation will be based on class participation and completed
written work, and will determine if a student will continue in the thesis program. For students proceeding to W31
and HIST 494, performance in the fall semester will figure into the thesis grade calculated at the of the year. The
quality of a student's performance in end the colloquium segment of History 493, as well as his or her perfor-
mance in all aspects of the May colloquium at which these are presented and critiqued, will be figured into the
overall grade the student is given for History 493-494 and the departmental decision to award Honors or Highest

HISTORY OF SCIENCE
(Div. II & III, see course descriptions)
Chair, Professor DONALD deB. BEAVER
A major in the History of Science is not offered, but the occasional Contract Major in it or a related
interdisciplinary field is possible. Courses in the History of Science are designed primarily to complement
and strengthen work in other major fields. Although any of the courses may be taken separately, studying
related courses in other departments will enhance their value, because by nature, History of Science is in-
terdisciplinary.
The following will serve as examples: the 101 course is an introduction to science and technology stud-
ies, and concentrates on key aspects of contemporary science and technology relevant to many issues of
living in a technological society. Scientific Revolutions (HSCI 224) deals with the emergence of modern
science in the 1600s and 1700s, and with subsequent revolutions in scientific thought; as such it comple-
ments courses related to modern European history. History of Science 240 traces the influential role of
science and invention in the shaping of American culture, and complements offerings in American Studies
and American History. HSCI 320, an historical overview of the ideas, practice, and organization of medi-
cine, provides context for related coursework in History, Philosophy, and the Premed Program.
HSCI 101(S) Science, Technology, and Human Values (Same as Science and Technology Studies
101)
A study of the natures and roles of science and technology in today's society, and of the problems which techni-
cal advances pose for human values. An introduction to science-technology studies. Topics include: scientific
creativity, the Two Cultures, the norms and values of science, the Manhattan Project and Big Science, the ethics
and social responsibility of science, appropriate technology, technology assessment, and various problems which
spring from dependencies engendered by living in a technological society, e.g., computers and privacy, automa-
tion and dehumanization, biomedical engineering.
Format: seminar. Requirements: two or three short exercises, two papers (3-5 pages and 5-10 pages), and two
hour exams.
Enrollment limit: 25.
Satisfies one semester of the Division II requirement.
Hour: 10:00-10:50 MWF D. BEAVER
HSCI 224(S) Scientific Revolutions: 1543-1927 (Same as History 294)
How much does science create the sensibilities and values of the modern world? How much, if any, technical
detail is it necessary to know in order to understand the difference between propaganda and fact?
This course investigates four major changes of world view, associated with Copernicus (1543); Newton (1687);
Darwin (1859); and Planck (1900) and Einstein (1905). It also treats briefly the emergence of modern cosmogo-
ny, geology, and chemistry as additional reorganizations of belief about our origins, our past, and our material
structure.
We first acquire a basic familiarity with the scientific use and meaning of the new paradigms, as they emerged in
historical context. We then ask how those ideas fit together to form a new framework, and ask what their trans-
scientific legacy has been, that is, how they have affected ideas and values in other sciences, other fields or
thought, and in society. Knowledge of high-school algebra is presupposed.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on five problem sets, four short papers (3-5 pages), and two
hour exams.
Enrollment limit: 30. Open to first-year students.
Satisfies one semester of the Division III requirement.

HSCI 240(S) Technology and Science in American Culture (Same as History 295)
Although technologically dependent, the American colonies slowly built a network of native scientists and
inventors whose skills helped shape the United States' response to the Industrial Revolution. The interaction of
History of Science, Interdepartmental Program
­ 204 ­
science, technology, and society in the nineteenth century did much to form American identity: the machine in
the garden, through the "American System of Manufactures" helped America rise to technological prominence;
the professionalization and specialization of science and engineering led to their becoming vital national
resources. Understanding these developments, as well as the heroic age of American invention (1865-1914),
forms the focus of this course: how science and technology have helped shape modern American life.
Format: seminar. Requirements: class discussion, six short reports (1-2 pages), and a final exam.
Enrollment limit: 20. Open to first-year students.

INTR 223(F) Image, Imaging and Imagining: The Brain and Visual Arts
The brain interprets the visual world and generates cognitive and emotional responses to what the eyes see. It is
also responsible for creating visual objects. This course first examines how we see and how our brains organize
and perceive what we see. In that context, we will investigate how visual artists have used or challenged per-
ceptual cues in their work. We then will study Gestalt perceptual laws and illusions, and see how they have been
used in works of art. We will also consider the influence of "disturbed" brain function of artists on their work (for
example, autism, schizophrenia, and epilepsy). In the second unit, we will discuss the history and use of neuroi-
maging (brain scans), and the questions posed by Dumit's ethnography of neuroimagers, "Picturing Person-
hood," for example, how neuroimages are used in public discussions of mental illness, violence, and addiction.
We will also examine neuroimaging studies questioning whether the brains of visual artists are lateralized or
specialized differently from non-artists. In the final unit, we will explore how visual artists are using brain images
Interdepartmental Program

in their artwork, and how they have portrayed brain syndromes and mental states. The course will culminate with
the development of an exhibit.

INTR 224(F) After God (Same as Religion 224 and Philosophy 224)
The beginning of the twenty-first century has been marked by a global revival of religion that few people antici-
pated. During the 1960s, sociologists and social critics argued that modernization necessarily involved secula-
rization. As developing economies underwent the process of industrialization, the argument went, traditional be-
liefs and practices were invariably left behind. At the same time, leading theologians were echoing and elaborat-
ing Nietzsche's declaration of the death of God. By the 1980s, the disappearance of religion and the death of God
seemed distant memories. While modernism entailed the eclipse of religion, postmodernism has been accompa-
nied by the return of the religious. This course will consider the complicated relationship between postmodern-
ism and religion in recent philosophy, theology and critical theory. The inquiry will begin by investigating the
impact of media and information technologies on society and culture. The emergence first of what Guy Debord
described as 'the society of the spectacle' and then network culture creates a new infrastructure that transforms
socio-political structures, economic policies and cultural practices. These changes were coterminous with three
very different, though closely related, developments: the death of God theology, the initial appearance of the
New Religious Right and post-structural philosophy and theory. Through a careful reading of selected texts by
some of the major figures of this important period, this course will explore the unexpected resurgence of religion
during the last half of the twentieth-century and assess the implications of these developments for the early de-
cades of the twenty-first century. Far from "a thing of the past," religion prefigures the future now approaching.
Works to be considered include: Robert Venturi et al., Learning from Las Vegas, Guy Debord, Society of the
Spectacle, Jean Beaudrillard, Symbolic Exchange and Death, Thomas Altizer, The New Gospel of Christian
Atheism, Martin Heidegger, Selections, Emmanuel Levinas, Totality and Infinity, Georges Bataille, Visions of
Excess, Theory of Religion, Julia Kristeva, Powers of Horror, The Feminine and the Sacred, Slavoj Zizek, The
Fragile Absolute, Jean-Luc Nancy, The Ground of the Image, Of Divine Places, Jacques Derrida, Acts of

INTR 260(F) Games, Play and Virtual Worlds (Same as English 260)
We are living during an era in which the real is becoming virtual and the virtual is becoming real. With the in-
creasing miniaturization and distribution of digital devices as well as the growth of bandwidth and globalization
of networks, we are rapidly approaching a condition of ubiquitous computing. The computer revolution of the
1970s and 1980s and the network revolution of the 1990s prepared the way for the virtual revolution now occur-
ring. The intersection of the real and the virtual can be tracked in the convergence of financial networks and
online gaming. On the one hand the currency of the realm in financial capitalism includes new instruments rang-
ing from futures and derivatives to swaps and virtual capital. On the other hand, the fastest growing sector on the
entertainment business is online gaming, whose "real" revenues already exceed the income from films. Though
most of these games are set in medieval fantasy worlds, they are organized around the goal of accumulating
virtual assets that can be exchanged within the game world. The "real" and the virtual meet on eBay, where the
virtual assets for games can be bought and sold for "real" money. Though the technologies are new, games, play
and virtual worlds are as old as humanity itself. Religious myths as well as art and literature create virtual worlds
for single or multiplayer role-playing games. By considering the psychological, social and cultural dynamics of
virtual realities, this seminar will examine the continuity and discontinuity between modernity and postmodern-
ity. Students will be required to subscribe to and participate in a Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing
Game (MMORPG) for the entire semester. Class sessions will be devoted to discussions of the games in relation
to readings that help to illuminate the complexity and multiplicity of virtual worlds. The approach to this topic
will be insistently interdisciplinary - philosophical, psychological, aesthetic and economic lines of analysis will
be explored. The texts to be considered include: Lewis Carroll, Alice in Wonderland, Bruno Bettelheim, The
Uses of Enchantment: The Meaning and Importance of Fairy Tales, Johan Huizinga, Homo Ludens: A Study of
the Play Element in Culture, Stephen Kline,Digital Play: The Interaction of Technology, Culture and Marketing,

INTR 292(S) What is Life? (Same as Religion 292 and Chemistry 292)
The 21st century will be the biological century. Developments in biology, biochemistry, and bioinformatics will
be as transformative as computers and information technologies were in the 20th century. These changes will
recast the question of life and will pose difficult social, political, and ethical challenges. For centuries philoso-
phers and scientists have attempted to define life. How does life begin and where does it end? What is the differ-
ence between the living and the non-living? What makes human life distinctive? Recent advances in science and
technology have complicated these questions but at the same time have opened new possibilities of communica-
tion between philosophy and science. In this course, we will draw on a variety of disciplinary approaches to
integrate scientific and philosophical approaches to the question of life. Topics to be considered include: origin of
life, evolution, co-evolution and symbiosis, cells and organisms, organization and complex adaptive systems,
replication and reproduction, disease and self-preservation, information and bioinformatics, viruses and para-
sites, molecular, cellular and organism cloning, stem cells, abortion, tissue engineering, gene therapy, artificial
life, implants and prostheses. In addition to the philosophical and scientific aspects of these issues, we will ex-
amine their social, ethical and political implications. Readings drawn from texts and articles written by scientists
and philosophers.
Format: discussion/lecture. Evaluation will be based on midterm exam and final paper.

INTR 316(S) Nothing, God, Freedom (Same as Religion 316 and Philosophy 316)
What "is" nothing? Is God nothing? Is nothing God? Can nothing be figured? Can the void be represented? Are
nothingness and emptiness the same? Is nothing an absence? How is nothing related to loss, lack and disaster? Is
silence nothing? Is nothing freedom? Is freedom divine? Does creativity presuppose nothing? Is nothing nihilis-
tic? Throughout history, nothing has assumed many guises and evoked a variety of responses in different
religious and cultural contexts. While in some traditions nothingness is the void deemed divine or the sacred
plenitude in which everything is grounded and from which creativity emerges, in others nothingness is an empti-
ness that leads to nihilism. In this seminar, we will explore the interrelation of nothing, God and freedom in
religious, philosophical, literary, and artistic texts. Special attention will be given to the questions nothingness
poses for strategies of representation and signification. Is nothing representable or unrepresentatble? Can nothing
be signified? Is nothing silent or is silence nothing? Is nothing visible or is the invisible nothing? Is nothing de-
structive or creative? Why is nothing important now? Might nothing be the guise of the divine in a world from
which the gods have fled? And might such a divine be the groundless ground of freedom? Works to be consid-
ered include: Poe, Haunted (CD), Igmar Bergman, Persona (film), Gary Hill,Incidence of Disaster (video), Paul

In this era of cultural, technological and economic globalization and also of pressing international crises
including environmental degradation, poverty and underdevelopment, terrorism and pandemics, knowl-
edge of the world beyond the United States is an essential part of the liberal education that is the goal of the
Williams experience. Both within and outside the classroom the College provides a rich array of opportu-
nities to pursue that goal. The International Studies Program is designed to increase awareness of those
opportunities and to provide a centralizing mechanism to encourage gaining such knowledge with per-
spectives that are cross disciplinary and comparative.
The program administers a number of tracks that provide students with the opportunity to pursue study
of one area of the world or theme as a way of complementing the work they have done in their majors.
Students will be expected to take courses in at least two departments to fulfill the requirements of a track. In
addition to completing International Studies 101, they will be expected to do five courses in a track includ-
ing an approved senior exercise. Students may not count a course toward more than one track in the pro-
gram. They may pursue two tracks but will need to meet the course requirements for each track with a full
complement of courses.
TRACKS
Tracks are of two kinds. The first type focuses either on a particular region of the world or a contact zone
where several cultural traditions encounter each other. The second type is organized thematically and will
explore a cultural, political, economic or technological issue globally. Each track will be administered by
faculty teaching in that track in consultation with the steering committee. Each track may set an additional
requirement of a level of language competency for its concentrators. Each track may also require one of the
elective courses to be comparative, i.e. course that might not cover material directly dealing with their area,
but would enrich the student's experience with tools for comparative inquiry. At present the program con-
sists of the following tracks:
Area Tracks Thematic Tracks
African Studies Borders, Exile and Diaspora Studies
East Asian Studies Economic Development Studies
Latin American Studies
Middle Eastern Studies
Russian and Eurasian Studies
South and Southeast Asia Studies
To complete a track, students must take a section of International Studies 101, complete five additional
approved courses within the track, attend the weekly International Studies colloquium and complete a se-
nior exercise. Credit for work done on study abroad will likely provide one or more of the electives for
many concentrators.
International Studies 101
All students wishing to pursue the program should take a section of International Studies 101 early in
their careers. These courses will usually be team taught. The topics and regions covered will vary and be
selective, but all will be designed to place cultural, political, economic and technological issues in con-
versation with one another to illustrate the necessity of having a broad range of disciplinary tools available
to pursue an individual track.
Study Abroad and Internships
Study abroad and/or overseas internships are an essential component of International Studies. The pro-
gram in coordination with the Study Abroad Advisor and the Office of Career Counseling will advise stu-
dents on opportunities in these areas. One or more courses completed on an approved study abroad pro-
gram can be counted toward the five elective courses requirement.

Colloquium
Concentrators will be expected to attend fifteen sessions of the International Studies colloquia in their
senior year, and are urged to do so throughout their careers at Williams. We hope that it will become a
regular event for all concentrators. The colloquium meets weekly at the Center for Development Econom-
ics and is designed to feature faculty, students, CDE fellows and outside speakers addressing issues of wide
interest to those in International Studies.
Senior Exercise
All concentrators must also complete a senior exercise. This will be a substantial piece of writing (20-25
pages) that would allow a student to draw together both their disciplinary skills and expertise in a particular
area. It might be work done either in the context of a senior capstone course in a relevant department or in
the context of a shared seminar sponsored by the International Studies program. In both cases it would
culminate in a public presentation by each concentrator of his/her work in class or in the context of the
International Studies Colloquium.
Honors
A candidate for honors in International Studies must maintain at least a B+ average in the concentration
and be admitted to candidacy by the program faculty. An honors candidate must complete her/his project
in a semester (and Winter Study). An honors candidate will prepare a forty page thesis or its equivalent
while enrolled in the senior thesis course, 491 or 492 (and Winter Study). This course will be in addition to
the courses required to fulfill the concentration.
A student wishing to become a candidate for honors in International Studies should secure a faculty
sponsor and inform the program chair in writing before spring registration of her/his junior year.
INST 101(F) Asia and the World (Same as Asian Studies 201 and Political Science 100)*
Asia looms large in contemporary world politics: Japan is gradually assuming an expanded regional national
security role; The People's Republic of China is emerging as a multifaceted Great Power; India is challenged by
rising ethno-nationalism. This course will explore both the historical background and current dynamics of politi-
cal and economic issues in these three countries, drawing on themes of imperialism, nationalism, and globaliza-
tion. It is an introductory class and, therefore, no prior coursework in political science or Asian studies is neces-
sary.
Format: predominately lecture. Requirements: two short papers and a final exam.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 60 (expected: 60).

THE PROGRAM IN JEWISH STUDIES
Jewish Studies describes the academic field concerned with the experience and culture of the Jewish
people. Covering a wide temporal and geographical range, Jewish Studies embraces both the waters of
Babylon and the tenements of the Lower East Side. The subject cuts across numerous fields including
Ancient Near Eastern Studies, Religion, Classics, History, Anthropology, Sociology, Art History, English,
Middle Eastern Studies, Hebrew, Women's and Gender Studies, American Studies, Comparative Litera-
ture, Romance Languages and Literature, German and Russian Studies, and Political Science. Jewish
Studies as a subject and object of scholarly inquiry is more than 100 years old, emerging, as did the study of
religion in general, in the context of nineteenth century efforts to make religious texts open to scientific and
especially historical forms of investigation.
Williams offers a variety of courses specifically directed to students interested in Jewish Studies. In
addition, many other courses incorporate topics relevant to the study of Judaism. Students are encouraged
to integrate courses from diverse disciplines with a focus in Jewish history, religion, literature, language,
and thought. Thus, rather than emphasizing a particular method of inquiry, Jewish Studies courses bring
together students from different departments who share an interest in a common topic. As a result, Jewish
subjects are analyzed from a multitude of perspectives (religious, philosophical, political, historical, psy-
chological, literary, etc.). Williams offers two types of courses related to Jewish Studies: Courses directly
focusing on Jewish topics and courses partially devoted to some aspect of Judaism. Most courses in Jewish
Studies are open to all students without prerequisites. The specific catalogue entry for each course should
be checked for details. The concentration in Jewish Studies is recommended for students interested in a
sustained intellectual experience in the field.
CONCENTRATION IN JEWISH STUDIES
The concentration in Jewish Studies serves two primary functions. First, it provides a formal structure
enabling students to develop knowledge of the history, thought, texts, and practices of the Jewish people.
Second, students will learn to apply this competency to the analysis of issues related to Jewish Studies
emerging from disciplinary perspectives. Through the Jewish Studies concentration, students will be able
to examine topics according to the methods particular to majors as well as in comparison with other disci-
plinary approaches. Thus, Jewish Studies enhances one's specific knowledge of Judaica and the general
capacity to think interdisciplinarily.
Students wishing to concentrate in Jewish Studies must take 5 courses with at least 2 different prefixes: 1
core course, 2 central courses, 1 elective, and 1 capstone course.

Elective
Students may meet the elective requirement with one of the courses partially related to Jewish Studies or
another central course. Since the elective requirement enables students to situate issues in Jewish Studies
within a broader disciplinary context, the elective must be taken after REL/JWST 203 and simultaneously
with or after at least one core course. In a course partially related to Jewish Studies, a student will normally
focus at least one of the major writing assignments on a topic relevant to Jewish Studies or approximately
one-third of the course will be devoted to Jewish subjects. The list of relevant electives changes constantly
so the course catalogue should be checked for details. Listed below are examples of courses partially re-
lated to Jewish Studies. Students may meet the elective requirement with a course not listed here, subject to
the approval of the Chair of Jewish Studies.

Croghan Professorship
Each year, in addition to the regular course offerings listed above, Williams sponsors the Croghan Bi-
centennial Visiting Professor in Religion who offers one course in Judaism and/or Christianity. Past Crog-
han Professors have taught courses on the Mishnah (Shaye Cohen), the historical Jesus (John Dominic
Crossan), and Ancient Mediterranean Religions (Ross Kraemer).
Overseas Studies
Studying in Israel is highly recommended for students interested in Jewish Studies. Many students have
spent a semester or year at Hebrew University. With the approval of the Jewish Studies coordinator, stu-
dents may count a study-abroad program towards one core requirement.
Funding
The Bronfman Fund for Judaic Studies was established in 1980 by Edgar M. Bronfman `50, Samuel
Bronfman II `75, and Matthew Bronfman `80. The Bronfman Fund provides opportunities for the Wil-
liams community to learn about Jewish history and culture, both within the College's formal curriculum
and through the planning of major events on Jewish themes.
The Morris Wiener and Stephen R. Wiener `56 Fund for Jewish Studies was established in 1997
through the estate of Stephen R. Wiener `56. The Wiener gifts have provided an endowment to support a
faculty position in modern Jewish thought, and are used to underwrite an annual lecture, forum or event
relevant to contemporary Jewish life.
JWST 101(S) Judaism: Innovation and Tradition (Same as Religion 203)
What is the relationship between modern notions of Jewish identity, thought and practice and the Hebrew Bible?
How does the modern Reform movement link itself to the laws of the rabbinic sages? Are there consistent values
and ideals that mark Jewish moral thought throughout its history? What elements of the Jewish tradition have
enabled its elasticity and historic persistence? By providing an introduction to the traditions of Jewish thought
and practice through the ages, this course will take up these questions. Though the course's method of progres-
sion will be primarily chronological, commencing with myths of Israel's beginnings and culminating with con-
temporary debates over Jewish identity, we will additionally emphasize the strong ties between methods of Jew-
ish thought and practices and the surrounding cultural environments in which they developed. We will approach
the tradition not only with historical concerns, but with literary and philosophical aims as well. We will analyze
the interpretive strategies, theological presuppositions, and political aims that accompany the tradition both in its
continuities and its ruptures. Finally, we will consider the extent to which we can speak of Judaism under the
category of religion, considering as well the other categories that have been proposed for Judaism, Jews and
Jewish Studies, Latina/o Studies
­ 213 ­
Jewishness, such as nation, people, race and ethnicity, and the motivations behind such designations. Texts will
include the Hebrew Bible, Holz (ed), Back to the Sources; Halbertal, People of the Book; Mendelssohn, Jerusa-
lem; Hertzberg (ed), The Zionist Idea; Levi, Survival in Auschwitz as well as excerpts and articles available in a
course packet.
Format: lecture/discussion. Assignments will include participation in class discussion, three short papers (5-7
pages) and a take-home final exam.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit 30 (expected 15). Preference given to Religion majors and Jewish Studies
concentrators.

Open to students who have completed (or are completing) the four required courses for the Jewish Studies con-
centration, this course enables students to integrate their background in Jewish Studies with the disciplinarity
normally associated with a departmental major. Team-taught by members of the JWST advisory committee, the
course consists of three parts. 1) Introductory sessions on methodological issues in Jewish Studies. 2) 4-6 week
period of individual meeting with faculty member while working on a 15- to 20-page research project. 3) Final
month devoted to seminar style presentation and discussion of papers. Students participating in the seminar must
sign up for an approved independent study. A student writing a thesis relevant to Jewish Studies for a departmen-
tal major may petition the chair of Jewish Studies to allow the thesis to meet the capstone requirement in place of
JWST 491.
Evaluation will be based on participation in discussions and final paper and presentation.
Prerequisites: fulfillment of requirements of Jewish Studies concentration. No enrollment limit, however, chair of
Jewish Studies must approve participation in the course (expected: 8).

Latina/o Studies is an interdisciplinary and comparative field of study that explores the histories and
experiences of Latinas and Latinos in the United States. Latinas and Latinos include peoples who come
from or whose ancestors come from Latin America and the Spanish-speaking Caribbean. The program
seeks to cover the widest range of experiences, encompassing Mexican-Americans, Puerto Ricans, Cu-
bans, and Dominicans, as well as more recent migrations from a wide variety of Central and South Ameri-
can countries. Courses, most of which use a comparative approach, seek to provide students with the tools
to continue their work in areas of their particular interest. Focusing on a diverse group with a long history in
the United States, which is also one of the fastest growing populations in the contemporary era, provides an
Latina/o Studies
­ 214 ­
opportunity to explore complex dynamics globally and within the context of the United States. The pro-
gram examines topics such as the political and economic causes of migration, the impact of globalization,
economic incorporation, racialization, the formation and reformulations of identities and communities, the
uses of urban spaces, inter-ethnic relations, artistic expression, aesthetics, and visual and popular culture.
THE CONCENTRATION
The concentration in Latina/o Studies requires five courses. Students are required to take the introducto-
ry course (LATS 105), one 400-level Latina/o Studies seminar, and three electives. Two electives must be
core electives, and one elective can be a related course in Comparative Ethnic Studies or in Countries of
Origin and Transnationalism. The three electives must include two different disciplines, and at least one
elective must be at the 300 or 400 level. Additional courses may be approved by the Chair. Students, espe-
cially those considering graduate work or professional careers in the field, are encouraged to enroll in
Spanish language courses at Williams.

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS
Honors in Latina/o Studies may be granted to concentrators after an approved candidate completes an
honors project, delivers a public presentation of the work, and is awarded an honors grade by her/his advi-
sor and two other faculty readers. In consultation with the advisor, faculty readers may be from outside the
Latina/o Studies Program.
The honors project will be completed over one semester plus winter study. It may consist of a conven-
tional research thesis of 40-70 pages or of other forms of presentation (e.g., video, art, theater). It may also
combine a shorter research thesis with another medium.
To be accepted as a candidate for honors in Latina/o Studies, a student must meet these criteria:
1) Submit and earn approval of a project proposal in April of the junior year. The proposal should be no
longer than 5 pages and should lay out the project's aim and methodology, identify the student's advi-
sor for the work, and include evidence of competence in the necessary media for projects that include
non-thesis forms.
2) Achieve a grade point average of at least 3.33 in LATS courses at the time of application.
Students admitted to the honors program must submit a 5-8 page revised proposal, with an annotated
bibliography, by the second week of classes in the fall semester of her/his senior year. They should register
either for LATS 493 in the fall semester and LATS 031 in Winter Study, or for LATS 031 in Winter Study
and LATS 494 in the spring semester. These courses will be in addition to the 5 courses that make up the
regular concentration.
STUDY ABROAD
Study abroad and other off-campus programs offer excellent opportunities for students to build on, and
expand, the intellectual interests they develop as part of the Latina/o Studies concentration. Through their
connections to various institutions in the U.S. and other nations, Latina/o Studies faculty can help place
students in U.S. borderlands programs as well as programs in Mexico, Cuba, and other "countries of ori-
gin." Any student seeking to include courses as part of a concentration in Latina/o Studies should feel free
to contact the Program chair or other faculty. A maximum of 1 course taken away from Williams can count
(as an elective) toward the completion of the concentration.
LATS 105(F) Latina/o Identities: Constructions, Contestations, and Expressions*
What, or who, is a Hispanic or Latina/o? At present, individuals living in the United States who are classified as
such number approximately 40 million, constituting the country's largest "minority" group. In this course, we
will study the interdisciplinary field that has emerged in response to this growing population, as we focus on the
complex nature of "identity." Viewing identities as historically and socially constructed, we begin with a brief
assessment of how racial, ethnic, class, and gendered identities take shape in the Hispanic Caribbean and Latin
America. We then examine the impact of (im)migration and the rearticulation of identities in the United States, as
we compare each group's unique history, settlement patterns, and transnational activity. Identity is also a con-
tested terrain. As immigrants and migrants arrive, the United States' policymakers, the media, and others seek to
define the "newcomers" along with long-term Latina/o citizens. At the same time, Latinas/os rearticulate, live,
assert, and express their own sense of identity. In this light, we conclude the course with an exploration of these
diverse expressions as they relate to questions of class, race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, and national
origins.
Format: discussion. Evaluation to be based on student participation and several short (1- to 5-page) papers
throughout the semester.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 25 (expected: 20-25). Preference given to Latina/o Studies concentrators.

LATS 203(S) Chicana/o Film and Video (Same as ArtH 203)*
Hollywood cinema has long been fascinated with the border between the United States and Mexico. This course
will examine representations of the U.S.-Mexico border, Mexican Americans, and Chicana/os in both Holly-
wood film and independent media. We will consider how positions on nationalism, race, gender, identity, migra-
tion, and history are represented and negotiated through film. We will begin by analyzing Hollywood "border"
and gang films before approaching Chicana/o-produced features, independent narratives, and experimental
work. This course will explore issues of film and ideology, genre and representation, nationalist resistance and
feminist critiques, queer theory and the performative aspects of identity. Film screenings will be scheduled as a
lab.
Evaluation will be based on one short paper, mid-term exam, final exam and take home essays.

LATS 241T(F) Redefining the "Helping Hand": Community-Based Approaches to Latina/o
Language and Identity in the Northern Berkshires (Same as Spanish 241T) (W)*
With a specific focus on the "politics of helping" and the Northern Berkshires' Latin American immigrant popu-
lation, this tutorial will examine the multiple facets of a Latina/o identity rooted in the region's rural, as opposed
to urban, spaces. Beginning with an historic, political, and cultural overview of Berkshire County and the Latina/
o populations who comprise the majority of its newest immigrants, students will then be trained in formal inter-
viewing techniques. Following a brief period of information-gathering and establishing contact with local Latina/
o immigrant residents and service organizations, student teams will next identify and design a Spanish-language
service project that they feel best addresses a particular need within the community. Community partnerships
may include, though are not limited to, the following organizations: The ESL Program at Brayton Elementary
School (North Adams), the Berkshire Immigrant Center (Pittsfield), the Northern Berkshire Community Coali-
tion (North Adams), and local Americorps VISTA representatives (Williamstown and North Adams). At semes-
ter's end, student teams will be required to present their completed service projects to their partner organizations
and fellow classmates. Please note that this course is intended for Spanish heritage speakers, or those whose
primary exposure to the language has occurred in a domestic/informal context.
Format: tutorial. Evaluation to be based on student participation, several short papers (3-5 pages) throughout the

theatre and performance in its broadest U.S. articulations, from mainstream Broadway productions to grass roots
community carpas, from oppositional site-specific interventions to disembodied performance praxis in cyber
space. We will pay particular attention to the intrinsic connections between social movements and popular cul-

LATS 346(S) Latinos in/and the Media: From Production to Consumption (Same as Comparative

As Latina/o Studies and Media Studies scholars have long noted, the media plays a key role in the construction of
(trans)national identities. As such, this interdisciplinary course will focus on the areas of advertising, print media,
radio, television, and audience studies in an attempt to answer the following: How do Latinos construct identity
(and have their identities constructed for them) through the media? How are Latina/o community practices
shaped by the media, and vice versa? What research methodologies best capture the complex relationship be-
tween consumer, producer, and media text? How are Latina/o stereotypes constructed and circulated in mass
media? Where do issues of consumer agency come into play? How might media provide a means for affecting
social change at both the local and global levels? In what ways do popular media impact our understanding of
race, gender, sexuality, class and nation? Readings include literary and theoretical works by contemporary writ-
ers and scholars such as Arlene Dávila, Alberto Fuguet, Vicki Mayer, Yeidy Rivero, América Rodríguez, and
Angharad Valdivia.

LATS 409(S) Tracing the Roots of Routes: Transnationalism and its (Dis)Contents (Same as

In the age of satellite television, e-mail, and readily available international phone cards, transnationalism is rapid-
ly becoming the norm as opposed to the exception. However, what does it really mean to "be transnational"?
How do the lived experiences of transnational individuals and communities merge with (and differ from)
theoretical notions of the transnational? How do the practices and concepts of diaspora, globalization, and
transnationalism overlap? How does the growing number of transnational citizens and residents in this country
shape "American" identity on the local, national, and global scales? In this interdisciplinary, comparative course
we will analyze contemporary theories regarding the origins and impacts of transnationalism, key critiques re-
garding the field of transnational studies itself, and transnationalism's role in the "New" American Studies. Case
studies examined in this course include China, Colombia, Haiti, India, and Mexico, among others.
Format: discussion. Evaluation to be based on student participation, 1 student-led discussion period, and a se-
mester-long research project to be graded in various stages.

LATS 471(F) Comparative Latina/o Migrations (Same as History 471) (W)*
Policymakers, scholars, the media, and others are increasingly describing the world as "global" and immigrant
groups as "transnational." Yet, this course will ask to what extent these are recent developments or historically
rooted phenomena. Similarly, the increasing popularity of the umbrella terms "Hispanic" and "Latina/o" can
mask widely divergent migration histories. In this course, we will develop the theoretical perspectives needed to
untangle a complicated web of differences and similarities in migration histories. We will then use these
migration histories to develop a comparative analysis of the experiences of different Latina/o groups in the
United States. For example, how do we explain differences in socioeconomic status or political perspectives?
Our discussions will also address the emergence of Latina/o Studies as an interdisciplinary and comparative field
of study, as well as methods used in studying Latino and Latina history, specifically oral histories, government
documents, newspapers, and interdisciplinary approaches.
Format: seminar/discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation and presentations, a short
historiographical essay, an annotated bibliography, and a research paper based in part on primary sources.

Leadership Studies focuses on the universal phenomenon of leadership in human groups. Leadership
Studies asks what leadership means within a wide variety of social contexts-whether in a family, a team, a
theatre company, a philanthropy, a university, a multinational corporation, or a nation state waging war. It
seeks to understand the dynamics of the relationships between leaders and followers. It studies authority,
power, and influence. It seeks to grasp the bases of legitimacy that leaders claim, and followers grant, in all
of these relationships.
Through a wide range of courses in the social sciences and the humanities, a number of questions are
addressed through the curriculum. How have men and women defined leadership and what are the bases
of leaders' legitimacy in different historical contexts? How do leaders in different contexts emerge?
Through tradition, charisma, or legal sanction? How do different types of leaders exercise and maintain
their domination? What are the distinctive habits of mind of leaders in different historical contexts? What
are the moral dilemmas that leaders in different contexts face? What are the typical challenges to estab-
lished leadership in different historical contexts? How does one analyze the experiences of leaders in wide-
ly disparate contexts to generate systematic comparative understandings of why history judges some lead-
ers great and others failures. How and why do these evaluations about the efficacy of leaders shift over
time?
To meet the requirements of the concentration, students must complete one of the two sequences out-
lined below (6 courses total).

LEAD 125(S) Power, Leadership and Legitimacy: An Introduction to Leadership Studies
(Same as Political Science 125)
Leadership has long been a central concept in the study of politics. Philosophers from Plato to Machiavelli have
struggled with the question of what qualities and methods are necessary for effective leadership. Social scientists
throughout the twentieth century have struggled to refine and advance hypotheses about leadership in the areas of
economics, psychology, and sociology. Nevertheless, despite all of this impressive intellectual effort, the study of
leadership remains a contested field of study precisely because universal answers to the major questions in lead-
ership studies have proven to be elusive. This course is designed to introduce students to many of the central
issues and debates in the area of leadership studies.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: a midterm and final exam and 2 short papers.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 30 (expected: 30). Preference given to first-year students and sophomores.

LEAD 220(F) Women and Leadership (Same as History 381 and Women's and Gender Studies

As more and more women claim leadership roles in the United States and worldwide, overcoming centuries of
patriarchal barriers, important questions arise: Have women, across time and cultures, exercised leadership dif-
ferently than men? Does leadership by women carry advantageous potential to achieve transformational rather
than incremental change? How can we examine the history of women's leadership without falling into "essen-
tialism" on one side and gender blindness on the other? How has leadership by white women differed from lead-
ership by black and Latina women?
This course will explore these questions and others comparatively by examining a wide array of leadership expe-
riences, starting with mythic cults of the Virgin Mary and Virgin of Guadalupe and culminating with contempo-
rary grassroots leaders in South Africa and other African countries. The bulk of the course will focus on black,

rating various theories of foreign policy into discussions of critical debates. The course also provides an anatomy
of the modern foreign policy establishment and a flavor of how institutional actors behave. Armed with this
understanding, students will learn how to be thoughtful consumers and critics. Finally, they will step into the
shoes of the advisor and produce policy recommendations for a series of contemporary dilemmas of American

LEAD 275(S) The Art of Presidential Leadership
In this seminar, we will focus on the leadership of some of the greatest American presidents--Washington, Jef-
ferson, Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin Roosevelt--as well as some of the most controversial--Lyndon Johnson
and Richard Nixon. We will investigate how these presidents developed as leaders before as well as after their
election to the presidency. How did they determine their goals, assemble their leadership teams, and mobilize
followers? What challenges did they face and what principles guided them? What failures did they meet and
why? Can we relate these historical examples to the American presidency today? Readings will include corre-
spondence, speeches, biographies, and political analysis.

The American Revolution produced a galaxy of brilliant politicians and statesmen of extraordinary courage,
intellect, creativity, and character. They succeeded in drafting an unparalleled Constitution and establishing
enduring democratic political institutions while nevertheless failing to grapple with the wrenching issue of
slavery and the rights of women. In this course, we will explore the lives, ideas, and political leadership of these
men, most of whom belonged to the social elite of their day:Washington, Madison, Jefferson, Adams, Franklin,
and Hamilton. We will study in depth their superb writings, such as the correspondence between Madison and
Jefferson and between John Adams and his wife Abigail, and Madison's and Hamilton's Federalist essays. We
will also read recent interpretations of the founding generation by Gordon Wood, Joseph Ellis, Edmund Morgan,
Bernard Bailyn, and others.
Format: seminar. Requirements: three papers, four class presentations.

LEAD 295(F) Leadership and Management
What are the differences between effective leaders and effective managers of complex organizations, or are they
one and the same? If different, what are the key elements making each successful, and are there any critical dy-
namics or interdependencies between these elements? Finally, are there important distinctions between the fac-
tors required for success by leaders/managers in different domains, in different cultures, or of different genders?
In this course, we will wrestle with these questions by examining both successful and unsuccessful leadership
and management of complex organizations in a number of domains, potentially including business, non-profit,
higher education, government agencies, and others. Our primary means of doing so will be through case studies,
supplemented by reading Ronald Heifetz, Peter Drucker, Warren Bennis, and several noted leadership and man-
agement thinkers.
Format: seminar. Course requirements will include active class participation, several brief (1 page or less) re-
sponse papers, a short mid-term paper, and a longer final paper, which develops and analyzes a case of the stu-
dent's choice. This latter paper can be done individually or in groups of two. No prerequisites. Enrollment limit:

LEAD 395(S) Intelligence and National Security (Same as Political Science 295)
September 11 and the war in Iraq have focused attention on the U.S. intelligence community. The failure to pre-
vent the terrorist attacks led to a barrage of criticism, highlighted by the report of the 9/11 Commission. The
mistaken estimate of Iraqi WMD led to another wave of condemnation. As a result, Congress legislated sweep-
ing organizational changes to the community, and scholars began to revisit basic questions: What is the relation-
ship between intelligence and national security? How does it influence foreign policy? Is covert action consistent
with American values? And how can the United States collect intelligence without sacrificing civil liberties? This
seminar provides an overview of the theory and practice of American intelligence. It details the sources and
methods used by collectors and the relationship between intelligence agencies and policymakers. It also contains
a history of the U.S. intelligence community and evaluates the ongoing efforts to reform it. Finally, it discusses
the uneasy role of intelligence in a modern democracy. Format: seminar. Requirements: two very short papers, a
15-page research paper, and a midterm exam.

LEAD 402(F) The Roosevelt Style of Leadership
In this course we will study the lives, ideas, visions and, above all, the political and moral leadership of Theodore,
Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt. The three Roosevelts transformed the role of government in American society,
bringing about fundamental and lasting change. What were their leadership strategies and styles? Did they mobi-
lize followers or did their followers mobilize them? How did they balance political compromise with bold, prin-
cipled leadership? How did their personalities affect their visions and their goals? To what extent did they offer
ethical and moral leadership? In addition to studying histories and biographies, we will do extensive research in
primary source material.
Format: seminar. Evaluation based on participation in class discussions, oral reports, two research papers.
Prerequisites: Leadership Studies 125 or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 12 (expected: 12). Preference
is given to students in Leadership Studies and also to students with a background in American history and politi-
cal science.

LEGAL STUDIES (Div. II)
Chair, Professor LAWRENCE KAPLAN*
Advisory Committee: Professors: JACKALL***, JUST*, KAPLAN*, KASSIN***. Associate Pro-
fessors: NOLAN**, SHANKS. Assistant Professor: MARUKO-SINIAWER*,THOMAS. Visit-
ing Assistant Professor: A. HIRSCH§§.
Legal Studies is an interdisciplinary program designed to give students a background and frameworks
for understanding the law as a means of regulating human behavior and resolving disputes among individ-
uals, groups, and governments. Emanating from a liberal arts tradition, and not specifically aimed at pre-
paring students for law school, this program provides the tools needed to think and argue critically about
how laws work, how they evolved in the course of history and in different parts of the world, how they are
enforced, and how they affect our everyday lives.
The courses in this program address a wide range of subjects, including the philosophical, moral, histor-
ical, social, and political underpinnings of law; the U.S. Constitution; law enforcement and other aspects of
criminal justice; methods of scientific proof; psychological influences on evidence, trials, and decision-
making; cultural perspectives and non-western legal traditions; and the use of law to regulate environmen-
tal policy. Courses are taught by faculty in the Sciences, Social Sciences, and Humanities, whose work
centers on legal processes, and by visiting professors from various law schools.
THE CONCENTRATION
The concentration in legal studies consists of six courses, including an interdisciplinary introductory
course, four electives taken from at least two departments, and a senior seminar on a contemporary topic in
Legal Studies
­ 222 ­
the law. Electives may vary from year to year according to course offerings. In addition, the program offers
local, alumni, and professional contacts for summer and WSP internships in a wide range of government
and private law-related settings.
STUDY ABROAD
Students who choose to study abroad should consult with the Program Chair to insure that they can
complete the requirements. Studying abroad may provide exciting opportunities to learn about legal tradi-
tions and systems other than those of the United States. Students should check with the Chair to be sure that
courses taken abroad will be counted toward completion of the Program.
REQUIRED COURSES
LGST 101(S) Processes of Adjudication
How are disputes resolved within social systems? Focusing on this question, this team-taught interdisciplinary
course presents different perspectives on trials and other methods of adjudicating crimes, settling matters of pub-
lic policy, and resolving civil disputes among individuals, groups, governments, and organizations. Topics to be
addressed include: the historical and Constitutional basis for the operation of the American court system and for
juries and jury trials; methods of gathering and evaluating evidence; the role of forensic science and technology;
alternative means of adjudication as seen in the function of administrative agencies; adjudication of disputes
across international boundaries; adversarial, inquisitorial, and consensus-building approaches to dispute resolu-
tion used in past and non-western cultures.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on two exams, a 10- to 15-page paper, and class participa-
tion.
Enrollment limit: 40.
This is an interdisciplinary course to be team-taught by faculty, from a variety of departments.
Hour: 2:35-3:50 MR A. HIRSCH
LGST 230(F) Pluralism and the Law (Same as Philosophy 230, Political Science 219 and Women's
and Gender Studies 230)
(See under Philosophy for full description.)
LGST 401(S) Senior Seminar: A Matter of Interpretation
There is a crucial ongoing debate about whether the interpretation of legal texts permits a measure of objectivity.
In other words, are there right answers to most legal disputes or are judicial decisions inevitably subjective and
value-laden? The last few decades have witnessed an assault on the possibility of legal objectivity, from both
inside and outside the legal community, with the debate both influenced by and influencing the discourse in liter-
ary theory and epistemology. This course considers some of the major contributions to that debate, and probes
whether and how it can be resolved. The class will read seminal works by literary theorists (such as Stanley Fish)
and philosophers (such as Richard Rorty) in addition to legal academics and leading judges (including Ronald
Dworkin, Owen Fiss, Judge Richard Posner, and Justice Antonin Scalia).
Format: seminar. Requirements: active class participation, several short papers, and a substantially longer final
paper.
Prerequisite: Legal Studies 101 and at least two Legal Studies electives, or permission of the instructor. Enroll-
ment limit: 25 (expected: 20-25). Preference will be given, in order of seniority, to students for whom this course
completes the Legal Studies concentration.

LINGUISTICS (Div. I)
Acting Coordinator, Professor: JULIE A. CASSIDAY
Assistant Professor: SANDERS*. Visiting Assistant Professor: SANCHEZ.
Courses in linguistics enable students to explore language from a variety of perspectives: the internal
workings of language as a system of communication, the physical means by which speech is produced, the
role of language in society, the history of language groups and specific languages, and the applicability of
scientific knowledge about language to various human endeavors.
Linguistics offers neither a major nor a concentration, but its courses provide a solid grounding in formal
linguistics and complement study in several other disciplines: Anthropology, Philosophy, Computer Sci-
ence, Psychology, Cognitive Science, Sociology, English, Comparative Literature, and all the foreign lan-
guages. Anthropology majors can receive major credit for Linguistics 100. Majors in German Studies may
receive major credit for a linguistics course with the special permission of the department chair.
Knowledge of foreign languages is helpful but not required for introductory linguistics courses.
LING 100(F) Introduction to Linguistics (Same as Anthropology 107)
This course is a general introduction to the scientific study of language, particularly its theoretical debates, meth-
odology, and relationship to other disciplines. With this aim in mind, we will examine the analytic methods and
major findings of various subfields of linguistics, including phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, seman-
tics, language change, and sociolinguistics. Additional topics may include American Sign Language, the acquisi-
tion of language, and the official English language movement. By the end of the course, you should be ac-
quainted with systematic methods of studying language, be aware of the fundamental similarities and startling
diversity of human languages, and have an informed perspective on how issues of language have an impact on
our society.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: participation in discussions, weekly homework, a midterm exam, and
a final exam.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 40 (expected: 40).
Hour: 1:10-2:25 MR SANCHEZ
LING 156(F) Language and Gender (Same as Women's and Gender Studies 156)
This course introduces students to the study of language and gender. We will consider both how language vari-
eties reflect social conditions (e.g., the status of women in society) and how women and men construct gender
and gendered identities through their use of language varieties. The relevant aspects of these language varieties
may be from any level of language (phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, pragmatics and discourse struc-
ture). We will examine various approaches to the study of language and gender (deficiency model, dominance
theory, biological difference, socialization/cultural difference, and social constructivist approaches), and we will
consider societies around the world. No prior knowledge of linguistics or feminist theory is assumed, but stu-
dents will be required to attain sufficient command of linguistics and feminist theories during the semester to
enable them to conduct a small investigation and original analysis of data.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: participation in discussions, biweekly reading quizzes, midterm
exam, final exam, and a group term project.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 40 (expected: 30).
Hour: 11:20-12:35 TR SANCHEZ
LING 210(S) Articulatory and Acoustic Phonetics
Phonetics is the study of human speech sounds. This course emphasizes the International Phonetic Alphabet, a
standardized system of transcribing speech. Students learn to recognize, describe, transcribe, and produce speech
sounds from languages all over the world. This course also covers phonetic analysis of speech, including patterns
of sounds within and across languages, the acoustic properties of the speech signal, and how and why the mouth
moves the way it does when we speak.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: participation in discussions, weekly homework, occasional quizzes, a
midterm exam, and a final project.
No prerequisites. No enrollment limit (expected: 40).
Hour: 1:10-2:25 MR SANCHEZ
LING 251(S) Dialects of American English (same as American Studies 251)
This course looks at dialects of American English in depth. We will consider how dialect research is done (the
advantages and limitations of various methods). We will examine the most current dialect atlas (published in
2006), as well as older atlases, in order to see the characteristics of current dialects, to see how they have changed
in the recent past, and to speculate as to what changes are likely to take place in the future. We will largely look at
phonetics and phonology, but we will also consider lexical and grammatical characteristics of regional dialects.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: participation in discussions, midterm exam, final exam, and a group
term project.
Prerequisites: LING 100 (formerly LING 101) or LING 210 (formerly LING 111). Enrollment limit:40 (ex-
pected: 30).
Hour: 2:35-3:50 MR SANCHEZ

LING 350(S) Sociolinguistics (Same as Sociology 350)
This course examines major topics in the field of sociolinguistics, including: the relationship between linguistic
behavior and social groups; the effects of geography, age, sex/gender, social class, ethnicity, and style on lan-
guage (form) used; attitudes about language forms; bilingualism; sociolinguistics and second language acquisi-
tion; language and dialect contact; and pidgin and creole languages.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: participation in discussions, presentation of a research article to class,

The oceans cover almost three-quarters of the globe, and understanding them is of increasing impor-
tance in this era of climate change, sea-level rise, fisheries crises, and the internationalization of the high
seas. We encourage students to investigate our WaterWorld from a variety of perspectives. Maritime Stud-
ies is an interdisciplinary, cross-divisional program that examines the literature, history, policy issues, and
science of the ocean. Candidates for the concentration in Maritime Studies must complete a minimum of
seven courses: the interdisciplinary introductory course (Geosciences 104 Oceanography), four intermedi-
ate core courses (at Williams-Mystic), an elective, and the senior seminar.
Students who have completed other study-away programs that emphasize marine studies should consult
with the program chair about the possibility of completing the Maritime Studies concentration.

Mathematics 285, 313, 325, 381, Statistics 201 and practice as a tutor or teaching assistant. Winter study
courses that provide a teaching practicum are also highly recommended.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN MATHEMATICS/STATISTICS
The degree with honors in Mathematics/Statistics is awarded to the student who has demonstrated out-
standing intellectual achievement in a program of study which extends beyond the requirements of the
major. The principal considerations for recommending a student for the degree with honors will be: Mas-
tery of core material and skills, breadth and, particularly, depth of knowledge beyond the core material,
ability to pursue independent study of mathematics or statistics, originalityinmethods of investigation,and,
where appropriate, creativity in research.
An honors program normally consists of two semesters and a WSP (031) of independent research, cul-
minating in a thesis and a presentation. Under certain circumstances, the honors work can consist of coor-
dinated study involving a regular course and one semester plus a WSP (030) of independent study, culmi-
nating in a "minithesis" and a presentation. At least one semester should be in addition to the major require-
ments.
An honors program in actuarial studies requires significant achievement on four appropriate examina-
tions of the Society of Actuaries and giving a second colloquium talk. Written work is a possible compo-
nent.
Highest honors will be reserved for the rare student who has displayed exceptional ability, achievement
or originality. Such a student usually will have written a thesis, or pursued actuarial honors and written a
minithesis. An outstanding student who writes a minithesis, or pursues actuarial honors and writes a paper,
might also be considered.
Prospective honors students are urged to consult with their departmental advisor at the time of registra-
tion in the spring of the sophomore or at the beginning of the junior year to arrange a program of study that
could lead to the degree with honors. By the time of registration during spring of the junior year, the student
must have requested a faculty member to be honors advisor and must have obtained the department's ap-
proval of formal admission to the honors program. Such approval depends on both the record and the
promise of the applicant. It is conditional on continuing progress.
The recommendation for honors is usually announced at the end of the spring term. Participation in the
honors program does not guarantee a recommendation for honors. The decision is based not only on suc-
cessful completion of the honors program but also on the merit of the student's overall record in mathemat-
ics. If the student completes the program during the fall or winter study, the decision may be announced at
the beginning of the spring term, conditional on continuing merit.
ADVANCED PLACEMENT
The Mathematics and Statistics Department attempts to place each student who elects a mathematics
course in that course best suited to the student's preparation and goals. The suggested placement in an
appropriate calculus course is determined by the results of the Advanced Placement Examination (AB or
BC) if the student took one, and any additional available information. A student who receives a 3, 4, or 5 on
the BC examination is ordinarily placed in Mathematics 106. A student who receives a 4 or 5 on the AB
examination is ordinarily placed in Mathematics 105. A student who receives a 1 or 2 on the BC examina-
tion or a 2 or 3 on the AB examination is ordinarily placed in Mathematics 104. Students who have had
calculus in high school, whether or not they took the Advanced Placement Examination, are barred from
Mathematics 103 unless they obtain permission from the instructor. A student who receives a 4 or 5 on the
Statistics AP examination is ordinarily placed in Statistics 231. Students interested in statistics should con-
sult the department for placement. In any event, students registering for mathematics and statistics courses
are urged to consult with members of the department concerning appropriate courses and placement. In
general, students are encouraged to enroll in the most advanced course for which they are qualified: it is
much easier to drop back than to jump forward. The department reserves the right to refuse registration in
any course for which the student is determined to be over-prepared.
GENERAL REMARKS
Divisional Requirements
All courses may be used to satisfy this requirement.
Alternate Year Courses
Core courses Mathematics 301, 305, 312, and 315 are normally offered every year. Other 300-level
courses may be offered in alternate years. Senior seminars (400-level courses) are normally offered every
two to four years. Students should check with the department before planning far into the future.
Course Admission
Courses are normally open to all students meeting the prerequisites. Students with questions about the
level at which courses are conducted are invited to consult members of the department.

Course Descriptions
Descriptions of the courses in Statistics follow the descriptions of Mathematics courses. More detailed
information on all of the offerings in the department is available in the Informal Guide to Mathematics
Courses at Williams that can be obtained at the departmental office.
Courses Open on a Pass/Fail Basis
Students taking a mathematics or statistics course on a pass/fail basis must meet all therequirementsset
for students taking the course on a graded basis.
With the permission of the department, any course offered by the department may be taken on a pass/fail
basis. Permission will not be given to mathematics majors to meet any of the requirements of the major or
honors degree on this basis. However, with the permission of the department, courses taken in the depart-
ment beyond those requirements may be taken on a pass/fail basis.
Study Abroad
Programs like the "Budapest Semester in Mathematics" are recommended for majors who wish to focus
on mathematics away. The department, though, normally accommodates students who select other study
away programs. Majors typically take their core courses (analysis and algebra) at Williams, and sometimes
select courses away which (with prior approval) count as 300-level mathematics or statistics electives. The
department offers its core courses in both the fall and the spring to allow students to spend more easily a
semester away.
Graduate School Requirements
An increasing number of graduate and professional schools require mathematics and statistics as a pre-
requisite to admission or to attaining their degree. Students interested in graduate or professional training in
business, medicine, economics, or psychology are advised to find out the requirements in those fields early
in their college careers.
MATHEMATICS COURSES
NOTE: STATISTICS COURSE LISTINGS FOLLOW THE MATHEMATICS COURSE LIST-
INGS.
MATH 101(F) Mathematical Analysis with Descriptive Statistics
This course is intended to develop quantitative skills for non-science majors. We will cover basic algebra from an
applied point of view, including working with formulas and solving for unknowns. We will investigate a variety
of ways to model real-world problems. For example, how many handshakes away are you from the president
and how is that related to a transportation network? We will look at the mathematics of equity, including a look at
voting theories. We will cover basic finance, including loans and annuities. Finally, we will also cover descriptive
statistics, including data analysis, computing with mean/median/variance, data display and contingency tables.
Format: lecture and computer lab. Evaluation will be based primarily on homework, quizzes and/or exams, and
computer projects.
Prerequisites: placement by a Quantitative Studies Counselor. Enrollment limit: (expected: 15). This course is
part of the Critical Reasoning and Analytical Skills initiative.
Hour: 10:00-10:50 MWF O. BEAVER
MATH 102(F) Precalculus
This course prepares students for Mathematics 103, first semester calculus. The course begins with a brief review
of algebra followed by a thorough treatment of algebraic, logarithmic, and trigonometric functions from a graph-
ical, analytical and applied point of view.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on homework, quizzes, and/or exams.
Prerequisites: placement by a Quantitative Studies Counselor or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: (ex-
pected: 15).
Hour: 9:00-9:50 MWF PETRIE
MATH 103(F,S) Calculus I (Q)
Calculus permits the computation of velocities and other instantaneous rates of change by a limiting process
called differentiation. The same process also solves "max-min" problems: how to maximize profit or minimize
pollution. A second limiting process, called integration, permits the computation of areas and accumulations of
income or medicines. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus provides a useful and surprising link between the
two processes. Subtopics include trigonometry, exponential growth, and logarithms. This is an introductory
course for students who have not seen calculus before. Students who have previously taken a calculus course
may not enroll in Mathematics 103 without the permission of instructor.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on homework, quizzes, and/or exams.
Prerequisites: Mathematics 102 (or demonstrated proficiency on a diagnostic test; see Mathematics 101). No
enrollment limit (expected: 50-60).

8:30-9:45 TR Second Semester: O. BEAVER
MATH 104(F,S) Calculus II (Q)
Mastery of calculus requires understanding how integration computes areas and business profit and acquiring a
stock of techniques. Further methods solve equations involving derivatives ("differential equations") for popula-
tion growth or pollution levels. Exponential and logarithmic functions and trigonometric and inverse functions
play an important role. This course is the right starting point for students who have seen derivatives, but not

MATH 105(F,S) Multivariable Calculus (Q)
Applications of calculus in mathematics, science, economics, psychology, the social sciences, involve several
variables. This course extends calculus to several variables: vectors, partial derivatives, multiple integrals. There
is also a unit on infinite series, sometimes with applications to differential equations. This course is the right
starting point for students who have seen differentiation and integration before. Students with the equivalent of
advanced placement of AB 4, BC 3 or above should enroll in Mathematics 105.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on homework, quizzes, and/or exams.
Prerequisites: Mathematics 104 or equivalent, such as satisfactory performance on an Advanced Placement Ex-
amination. No enrollment limit (expected: 45).
Hour: 8:00-8:50 MWF, 9:00-9:50 MWF, 10:00-10:50 MWF, 11:00-11:50 MWF First Semester: LUCA, LOEPP
9:00-9:50 MWF, 10:00-10:50 MWF Second Semester: LUCA
MATH 106(F) Multivariable Calculus (Q)
Applications of calculus in mathematics, science, economics, psychology, the social sciences, involve several
variables. This course extends calculus to several variables: vectors, partial derivatives and multiple integrals.
The goal of the course is Stokes Theorem, a deep and profound generalization of the Fundamental Theorem of
Calculus. The difference between this course and Mathematics 105 is that Mathematics 105 covers infinite series
instead of Stokes Theorem. Students with the equivalent of BC 3 or higher should enroll in Mathematics 106, as
well as students who have taken the equivalent of an integral calculus and who have already been exposed to
infinite series. For further clarification as to whether or not Mathematics 105 or Mathematics 106 is appropriate,
please consult a member of the math/stat department. Mathematics 106 satisfies any Mathematics 105 prerequi-
site. Credit will not be given for both Mathematics 105 and Mathematics 106.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on homework, quizzes, and/or exams.

MATH 209(S) Differential Equations and Vector Calculus (Q)
Historically, much beautiful mathematics has arisen from attempts to explain heat flow, chemical reactions, bio-
logical processes, or magnetic fields. A few ingenious techniques solve a surprisingly large fraction of the associ-
ated ordinary and partial differential equations. The mystical Pythagorean fascination with ratios and harmonics
is vindicated and applied in Fourier series and integrals. Integrating vectorfields over surfaces applies equally to
blood flow, gravity, and differential geometry.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on problem sets, hour tests, and a final exam.
Prerequisites: Mathematics 105. No enrollment limit (expected: 31). Students may not normally get credit for
both Mathematics 209 and Mathematics/Physics 210.

(See under Physics for full description.)
MATH 211(F,S) Linear Algebra (Q)
Many social, political, economic, biological, and physical phenomena can be described, at least approximately,
by linear relations. In the study of systems of linear equations one may ask: When does a solution exist? When is
it unique? How does one find it? How can one interpret it geometrically? This course develops the theoretical
structure underlying answers to these and other questions and includes the study of matrices, vector spaces, linear
independence and bases, linear transformations, determinants and inner products. Course work is balanced be-
tween theoretical and computational, with attention to improving mathematical style and sophistication.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on homework and exams.
Prerequisites: Mathematics 105 or 209 or 210 or 251, or Statistics 201. No enrollment limit (expected: 35-70).

MATH 301(F) Real Analysis (Q)
Real analysis is the theory behind calculus. It is based on a precise understanding of the real numbers, elementary
topology, and limits. Topologically, nice sets are either closed (contain their limit points) or open (complement
closed). You also need limits to define continuity, derivatives, integrals, and to understand sequences of func-
tions.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on homework, classwork, and exams.

Hour: 9:55-11:10 TR O. BEAVER
MATH 302(S) Complex Analysis (Q)
The calculus of complex-valued functions turns out to have unexpected simplicity and power. As an example of
simplicity, every complex-differentiable function is automatically infinitely differentiable. As examples of pow-
er, the so-called "residue calculus" permits the computation of "impossible" integrals, and "conformal mapping"
reduces physical problems on very general domains to problems on the round disc. The easiest proof of the Fun-
damental Theorem of Algebra, not to mention the first proof of the Prime Number Theorem, used complex anal-
ysis.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on homework, classwork, and exams.
Prerequisites: Mathematics 301 or 305. No enrollment limit (expected: 10).
Hour: 10:00-10:50 MWF STOICIU
MATH 303(F) Analytic Number Theory (Q)
The fundamental theorem of arithmetic says that every natural number beyond 1 is a product of prime numbers
in a unique way, up to ordering. Analytic number theory is an area of number theory that employs powerful ideas
from analysis to discover beautiful structure within the set of primes. In this course, we will investigate a number
of elementary questions about arithmetic and the set of natural numbers. We will then move to the study of the
distribution of prime numbers and prove the amazing Prime Number Theory. In addition, we will consider other
classical summits of the subject including the Riemann zeta function, Riesel Numbers, Siepinski Numbers, Per-
fect Numbers, Carmichael Numbers as well as modern applications such as primality testing. We will also
introduce some powerful tools from complex analysis that are at the heart of the subject.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on performance on homework, projects, and exams.

MATH 305(S) Applied Real Analysis (Q)
Real analysis or the theory of calculus-derivatives, integrals, continuity, convergence-starts with a deeper under-
standing of real numbers and limits. Applications in the calculus of variations or "infinite-dimensional calculus"
include geodesics, harmonic functions, minimal surfaces, Hamilton's action and Lagrange's equations, optimal
economic strategies, nonEuclidean geometry, and general relativity.

MATH 312(S) Abstract Algebra (Q)
Algebra gives us the tools to solve equations. Sets such as the integers or real numbers have special properties
which make algebra work or not work according to the circumstances. In this course, we generalize algebraic
processes and the sets upon which they operate in order to better understand, theoretically, when equations can
and cannot be solved. We define and study the abstract algebraic structures called groups, rings and fields, as well
as the concepts of factor group, quotient ring, homomorphism, isomorphism, and various types of field exten-
sions.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on problem sets and exams.

An introduction to group theory with emphasis on topics having applications in the physical sciences; greater
attention is paid to examples and to the application of theorems than to the more difficult proofs. Topics include
symmetry groups, group structure (especially properties related to order), representations and characters over the
real and complex fields, space groups (chemistry), matrix groups (physics).

MATH 316(S) Protecting Information: Applications of Abstract Algebra and Quantum Physics
(Same as Physics 316) (Q)
Living in the early decades of the information age, we find ourselves depending more and more on codes that
protect messages against either noise or eavesdropping. We begin this course by studying the history of this sub-
ject, including, for example, the story of the enigma code from World War II. We then examine some of the most
important codes currently being used to protect information, including linear codes, which in addition to being
mathematically elegant are the most practical codes for error correction, and the RSA public key cryptographic
scheme, popular nowadays for internet applications. Looking ahead by a decade or more, we show how a "quan-
tum computer" could crack any RSA code in short order, and how quantum cryptographic devices will achieve
security through the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.
Evaluation will be based on homework sets and exams.

In the last twenty years computers have profoundly changed the work in numerical mathematics (in areas from
linear algebra and calculus to differential equations and probability). The main goal of this tutorial is to learn how
to use computers to do quantitative science. We will explore concepts and ideas in mathematics and science using
numerical methods and computer programming. We will use specialized software, including Mathematica and
Matlab. Computer programming skills are not required.
Format: Tutorial. Evaluation will be based on homework, classwork, and exams.

MATH 321(S) Knot Theory (Q)
Take a piece of string, tie a knot in it, and glue the ends together. The result is a knotted circle, known as a knot.
For the last 100 years, mathematicians have studied knots, asking such questions as, "Given a nasty tangled knot,
how do you tell if it can be untangled without cutting it open?" Some of the most interesting advances in knot
theory have occurred in the last ten years.
This course is an introduction to the theory of knots. Among other topics, we will cover methods of knot tabula-
tion, surfaces applied to knots, polynomials associated to knots, and relationships between knot theory and
chemistry and physics. In addition to learning the theory, we will look at open problems in the field.

properties, topography and other phenomena that cover large areas or even encompass the whole planet. Data for
analyzing the surface is obtained using diverse instruments, from Global Positioning Systems (GPS), to radar
measurements taken from the space shuttle, all the way down to surveying done on the ground. These point-set
measurements are then used by computer algorithms and mesh-building graphics software to reconstruct the
surfaces. This is a beautiful subject with a tremendous amount of active research, relating powerful ideas from
mathematics, elegant tools from computer science, and concrete data from geodetic science. This course is
designed to introduce fundamental ideas of this subject, such as curvature, polyhedral geometry, Voronoi
diagrams, Delaunay triangulations, and combinatorial topology, possibly touching on advanced topics such as
noise handling, Morse theory, and smoothing. We will work with theoretical tools as well as actual data sets using
the Cocone software. This course is intended for students interested in mathematics, physics, engineering, and
computer science.

Many biological phenomena can best be examined through fairly sophisticated mathematical models. In
particular, differential equation models have been used to explain fluctuations in food webs, the spread of
disease, consequences of certain fishing practices, immune system response to infection, spatial distribution of
species, formation of zebra stripes, and flux across cell membranes. We will introduce the mathematical
machinery needed for these models, including the theory of ordinary differential equations, phase portrait
dynamics, and partial differential equations. We will establish the biological assumptions that go into these
models and examine the consequent dynamics. Students will work in pairs covering material and explaining it to
one another, presenting worked problems, and critiquing each others presentations.

MATH 414(S) Galois Theory (Q)
The relation of high school algebra to the abstraction of Mathematics 312 is not apparent, but Galois Theory
shows the link. One goal of high school algebra is to solve (find roots of) linear equations (ax + b = 0) and
quadratic equations. By the sixteenth century, methods were found to solve third and fourth degree equations.
Here progress stopped until the early nineteenth century, when Abel and Galois showed that no such general
method for finding roots of equations of degree higher than four can exist. They needed totally new tools, which
led to the mathematics of abstract algebra. The goal of Mathematics 414 is to develop through linear algebra, the
deep connection between roots of polynomials and finite groups.

MATH 433(F) Mathematical Modeling and Control Theory (Q)
Mathematical modeling is concerned with translating a natural phenomenon into a mathematical form. In this
abstract form the underlying principles of the phenomenon can be carefully examined and real-world behavior
can be interpreted in terms of mathematical shapes. The models we investigate include feedback phenomena,
phase locked oscillators, multiple population dynamics, reaction-diffusion equations, shock waves,
morphogenesis, and the spread of pollution, forest fires, and diseases. Often the natural phenomenon has some
aspect we can control--such as how much pollution, electric charge, or chemotherapeutic agent we put into a
river, circuit, or cancer patient. We will investigate how to operate such controls in order to achieve a specific goal
or optimize some interpretation of performance. We will employ tools from the fields of differential equations
and dynamical systems. The course is intended for students in the mathematical, physical, and chemical sciences,
as well as for students who are seriously interested in the mathematical aspects of physiology, economics,
geology, biology, and environmental studies.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on performance of problem sets and exams.

STATISTICS COURSES
STAT 101(F,S) Elementary Statistics and Data Analysis (Q)
It is nearly impossible to live in the world today without being inundated with data. Even the most popular news-
papers feature statistics to catch the eye of the passerby, and sports broadcasters overwhelm the listener with
arcane statistics. How do we learn to recognize dishonest or even unintentionally distorted representations of
quantitative information? How are we to reconcile two medical studies with seemingly contradictory conclu-
sions? How many observations do we need in order to make a decision? It is the purpose of this course to devel-
op an appreciation for and an understanding of the interpretation of data. We will become familiar with the stan-
dard tools of statistical inference including the t-test, the analysis of variance, and regression, as well as explor-
atory data techniques. Applications will come from the real world that we all live in.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on performances on quizzes and exams.
Prerequisites: Mathematics 100/101/102 (or demonstrated proficiency on a diagnostic test; see Mathematics
100). Students who have had calculus, and potential Mathematics majors should consider taking Statistics 201
instead. Enrollment limit: 50 (expected: 40). Not open for major credit to junior or senior Mathematics majors.

8:00-8:50 MWF Second Semester: BOTTS
STAT 201(F,S) Statistics and Data Analysis (Q)
Statistics can be viewed as the art (science?) of turning data into information. Real world decision-making,
whether in business or science is often based on data and the perceived information it contains. Sherlock Holmes,
when prematurely asked the merits of a case by Dr. Watson, snapped back, "Data, data, data! I can't make bricks
without clay." In this course, we will study the basic methods by which statisticians attempt to extract informa-
tion from data. These will include many of the standard tools of statistical inference such as the t-test, analysis of
variance and linear regression as well as exploratory and graphical data analysis techniques.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on performance on quizzes and exams.
Prerequisites: Mathematics 105 or equivalent. Students without any calculus background should consider Statis-
tics 101 instead. Enrollment limit: 45 (expected: 45).

STAT 313T(F) Advanced Mathematical Methods in Statistical Inference (Q)
This course will introduce students to the advanced mathematical techniques used in the theory of statistical in-
ference. Topics in multivariate calculus, linear algebra, and discrete math will be used to understand important
issues in statistics such as random samples, sufficient statistics, likelihood, point estimation, hypothesis testing,
interval estimation, analysis of variance, and linear regression.
Format: Tutorial. Evaluation of the student will be based on problem sets and exams.

STAT 346(S) Regression and Forecasting (Q)
This course focuses on the building of empirical models through data in order to predict, explain, and interpret
scientific phenomena. The main focus will be on multiple regression as a technique for doing this. Through no
fault of its own, regression analysis has perhaps the most used of all data analysis methods. We will study both
the mathematics of regression analysis and its applications, including a discussion of the limits to such analyses.
The applications will range from predicting the quality of a vintage of Bordeaux wine from the weather to fore-
casting stock prices, and will come from a broad range of disciplines.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on performance on the project, homework, and exams.

STAT 440T(S) Categorical Data Analysis (Q)
Could the Challenger explosion have been prevented with proper data analysis? This tutorial focuses on methods
for analyzing categorical response data which, in contrast to continuous data, consist of observations classified
into categories and comprises binary (e.g., O-ring failure) and count data. Traditional tools of statistical data anal-
ysis such as linear regression and ANOVA are not designed to handle these types of data and pose inappropriate
assumptions such as constant variance and normality. We will develop Generalized Linear Models, designed to
address the discrete nature of the observation. Using computer software, we will consider building and fitting
such models for applications in the social sciences, biology, medicine, public health, economics and marketing.

Department strongly recommends that students elect at least one course from each group.
It is strongly recommended that prospective majors complete 103, 104, 201, 202 and 207 by the end of
the sophomore year.
Performance and Concert Requirements
Music majors are encouraged to participate in departmental ensembles throughout their careers at Wil-
liams; i.e., for eight semesters. Majors are required to participate in departmental ensembles for at least four
semesters. Under special circumstances the student may petition the music faculty to allow this require-
ment to be met in an alternative way.
Foreign Languages
Music majors are strongly urged to take courses in at least one foreign language while at Williams.
Musicianship Skills
Music majors are strongly urged to maintain, refine and improve their musicianship skills, such as sight-
singing, score reading, melodic and harmonic dictation, and keyboard proficiency, throughout their entire
Williams career.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN MUSIC
Three routes toward honors and highest honors are possible in the Music major:
a. Composition: A Composition thesis must include one major work completed during the senior year, a
portfolio of smaller works completed during the junior and senior years, and a 10- to 15-page discus-
sion of the student's work.
Music
­ 237 ­
b. Performance: A Performance thesis must include an honors recital given during the spring of the
senior year and a 15- to 20-page discussion of a selection of the works performed. The student's
general performance career will also be considered in determining honors.
c. History, Theory and Analysis, or Ethnomusicology: A written Historical, Theoretical/Analytical, or
Ethnomusicological thesis between 65 and 80 pages in length and an oral presentation based on the
thesis is required. A written thesis should offer new insights based on original research.
To be admitted to the honors program, a student must have at least a 3.3 GPA in Music courses (this
GPA must be maintained in order to receive honors), and have demonstrated ability and experience
through coursework and performance in the proposed thesis area. A 1- to 2-page application to the honors
program, written in consultation with a faculty member, must be made to the chair of Music before or
during spring registration in the junior year.
Honors candidates must enroll in Music 493(F)-W31-494(S) during their senior year. A student who is
highly qualified for honors work, but who, for compelling reasons, is unable to pursue a year-long project,
may petition the department for permission to pursue a thesis over one semester and the winter study term.
If granted, the standards for evaluating the thesis in such exceptional cases would be identical to those that
apply to year-long honors projects. Final submission of the thesis must be made to the Music Department
by April 15 of the senior year. The department's decision to award honors will be based on the quality of
the thesis.
LESSONS
Courses involving individual vocal or instrumental instruction involve extra fees which are subsidized
by the department. (See Music 251-258 and Studies in the Musical Art 325, 326, 427, 428). For further
information contact the Department of Music.
STUDY ABROAD
Music majors considering study abroad should meet with the department chair well in advance in order
to determine whether it will be possible to complete the requirements for the major. Study abroad courses
are not accepted as substitutes for the specific required major courses. However, they may qualify as elec-
tives toward the major if approved by the department.

MUS 101(F) Listening to Music: An Introduction
Intended for non-major students with little or no formal training.
When you listen to music--on the radio, on a CD, at a concert--how much do you really hear? This course has
two goals: to refine listening skills, thus increasing the student's understanding and enjoyment of music, while at
the same time providing a survey of the major composers and musical styles of the Western classical repertory to
be encountered in concert halls today. Students will be introduced to music from the Baroque, Classical, Roman-
tic, and Modern periods, including works by composers such as Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Brahms, Mahler, and
Stravinsky. Genres to be covered include the symphony, chamber music, opera, song, and choral music. Atten-
dance at selected concerts on campus required.
Evaluation will be based on two quizzes, two tests, two concept reports, and a final exam.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 40 (expected: 30).
Hour: 10:00-10:50 MWF M. HIRSCH
MUS 102(F) Fundamentals of Music (W)
This course seeks to define and describe the fundamental nature of music in Western society. Through a variety
of exercises and projects, students will develop an understanding of basic musical rudiments such as pitch, scales,
triads, rhythm, meter, and notation materials that form the foundation of Western art and popular musics. By the
end of the course, students will have begun the study of basic four-part harmony. In addition, students will
Music
­ 238 ­
explore various topics such as philosophies of music (including aesthetics), music cognition and perception,
popular musics, and acoustics, and their relationships to defining the "fundamentals" of music. Students will be
expected to complete weekly argumentative papers reacting to the various philosophical readings; as the
semester progresses, these reaction papers will increase in both length and depth, in preparation for a final project
of each student's choice. Students will receive frequent and detailed critiques (either in the form of written
comments or verbal discussions) of each writing assignment.The course has a musicianship component: students
attend a musicianship lab (sight-singing, dictation, and keyboard skills) in addition to lectures.
Format: 2 weekly lectures and a weekly lab meeting. Evaluation will be based on quizzes/exams, weekly
reaction papers, a final research project, and a final exam.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15 (expected: 15). Preference based on music reading proficiency.
Hour: 8:30-9:45 TR Lab: 8-8:50 W, 9-9:50 W BODNER
MUS 103(F) Music Theory and Musicianship I
Music 103 and 104 are designed for potential majors and for students with strong instrumental or vocal back-
grounds. Although there is no prerequisite for Music 103, students are expected to have some knowledge of musi-
cal rudiments, reading proficiency in at least one clef, and ideally have some comfort reading both bass and
treble clefs. A short diagnostic exam will be administered at the first class meeting of Music 103 to assess stu-
dents' skills and background, and determine if a student requires any additional remedial work to complement
and fortify course work during the early weeks of the semester. Students with a strong background in music
theory may take a placement exam during First Days to see whether they can pass out of one or both semesters.
Music 103 and 104 are required for the music major.
Music 103 presents the materials, structures and procedures of tonal music, with an emphasis on the harmonic
and contrapuntal practice of the baroque and classical periods (ca. 1650-1825).
Music 103 explores triadic harmony, voice leading, and counterpoint with an emphasis on the chorale style of
J.S. Bach and his predecessors. Keyboard harmony and figured bass exercises, sight singing, dictation, analysis
of repertoire, written exercises and emulation projects will develop both an intellectual and an aural understand-
ing of music of the period. Projects include the harmonization of chorale melodies, the arrangement of classical
period minuets and the composition of a dice game minuet.
Format: lecture two days a week; a conference meeting one day a week; ear training/musicianship skills lab
meeting twice a week. Evaluation will be based on weekly written work, written and keyboard quizzes, and
midyear and final projects.
Enrollment limit: 15 per section.

MUS 104(S) Music Theory and Musicianship I
Music 104 continues the practical musicianship work of Music 103, while expanding the scope of harmonic
topics to include seventh chords and chromatic harmony. Music 104 further explores the transformation of cho-
rale harmony in contrapuntal works of the eighteenth century. Projects include the composition and performance
of preludes, fugues and organ chorale preludes on baroque models.
Format: lecture two days a week; a conference meeting one day a week; ear training/keyboard skills lab meeting

MUS 115(F) Introduction to Twentieth-Century Music
Twentieth-century Euro-American art music involved a persistent exploration of the limits of musical possibility.
Encounters with this music often challenge our ears and musical minds and require us to reconsider fundamental
Music
­ 239 ­
conceptions of music itself. Throughout the course, we will investigate in what ways the basic elements of music
(e.g., harmonic organization, rhythm, timbre, instrumentation and performance conventions) were extended and
revolutionized. Topics and styles to be discussed include: atonality, expressionism, twelve-tone techniques,
neoclassicism, electronic and computer music, stochastic music, minimalism, and neoromanticism. We will also
consider the music of this century in relation to contemporary developments in the other arts and to popular
musical styles. The syllabus will include works by such composers as Debussy, Mahler, Stravinsky, Schoenberg,
Webern, Bartók, Weill, Milhaud, Shostakovich, Ives, Copland, Babbitt, Stockhausen, Messiaen, Boulez, Berio,
Cage, Górecki, Glass, Gubaidulina, and Tower.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on two tests, two short papers, and a final exam.

MUS 116(S) Music in Modernism (W)
The synthesis of the arts was a primary pursuit of modernist composers, artists, choreographers, and writers.
Seeking either to realize Wagner's "total work of art" in the theater, or to uncover the more general
correspondences celebrated by Baudelaire, modernists consistently looked beyond their own media.
Collaborations on works of "total theater" were common: Satie, Cocteau, Massine, Picasso; Brecht, Hindemith,
Weill; Stravinsky, Nijinsky, Bakst; Claudel, Honegger, Rubinstein. Modernists explored new connections
between music and color (Scriabin, Kandinsky), music and literature (Joyce, Mann), and music and dance
(Duncan, Graham). Occasionally, modernists attempted to unite the arts on their own: Schoenberg painted,
Pound composed, and Kokoschka wrote. Our focus will be on those works of music, art, dance, and literature
that explored new relationships between the arts. One goal will be to investigate whether specific equivalents
exist between techniques of modernist painting, poetics, choreography, and composition. Aware of the risks and
rewards of interdisciplinary study, we will attempt our own theories of artistic synthesis. This course is designed
to bring multiple perspectives to the study of music in modernism.
Format: discussion/lecture. Evaluation will be based on three papers (7, 10, and 14 pages in length) and on class
participation. Drafts of two of these papers will be required. Students will receive detailed comments on each
paper, allowing them to build upon those comments in subsequent writing assignments.

MUS 120(F) Beethoven
This course provides an introduction to the life and music of Ludwig van Beethoven. The composer's difficult
childhood, tragic loss of hearing, clandestine affair with the "Immortal Beloved," tempestuous relationship with
his suicidal nephew Karl--such biographical elements, together with the French Revolution and emergence of
Romanticism, will form the backdrop for our study of his titanic artistic struggles and monumental
achievements. Students will listen to a broad cross section of Beethoven's music, including piano sonatas, string
quartets, symphonies, overtures, concertos, choral works, and opera. We will explore his ties to Haydn, Mozart,
and other composers, his fierce individualism, and his impact on later generations, subjects linked to notions of

MUS 210T(S) American Pop Orientalism (W)
This tutorial will investigate the representation of Asians and Asian Americans in American popular culture
since the late nineteenth century. Our focus will be on music's role in Orientalist representation in a wide variety
of media, including Hollywood film, television, popular song, Broadway musicals, and novels. We will begin
with major texts in cultural theory (Said, Bhabha) and will attempt throughout the semester to revise and refine
their tenets. Can American Orientalism be distinguished in any fundamental way from nineteenth-century Euro-
pean imperialist thought? How does Orientalist representation calibrate when the "exotic others" being repre-
sented are themselves Americans? Our own critical thought will be sharpened through analysis and interpreta-
tion of specific works, such as Madame Butterfly, "Chinatown, My Chinatown," The King and I, Sayonara,
Flower Drum Song, Miss Saigon, Rising Sun, M. Butterfly, Aladdin, and Weezer's Pinkerton. We will end the
semester by considering the current state of Orientalism in American popular culture.

400-LEVEL COURSES
MUS 402(S) Senior Seminar in Music: Schubert and Brahms
Franz Schubert reached artistic maturity during the early years of musical Romanticism, Johannes Brahms dur-
ing the later years. The relation between the two composers illuminates critical features of this aesthetic period.
Brahms cherished Schubert's music and shared many of his passions and preoccupations: folksong, dance, na-
ture, childhood, love, memory, nostalgia, dreams, and death. Both composers were awed by Beethoven, sought a
balance between tradition and innovation in form and harmony, and explored the relation between song and
instrumental music. But there were important differences as well. Through comparative study of Schubert's and
Brahms's works, careers, and critical reception, this seminar will explore the development of musical Romantic-
ism. We will consider, among other topics, their conservative and progressive style traits; expression of central
Romantic themes; ties to Romantic literature, art, and philosophy; involvement with Viennese traditions and in-
stitutions; personal and professional relationships; and response to political, societal, and cultural developments.
Drawing upon a variety of historical, analytical, and interpretive methodologies, students will study works from
an array of genres--Lieder, piano pieces, chamber music, choral music, and orchestral music.
Prerequisites: Music 202, 207, 208, 209 and permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: all senior music majors.

NEUROSCIENCE (Div. III)
Chair, Professor BETTY ZIMMERBERG
Advisory Committee: Professors: P. SOLOMON, H. WILLIAMS, ZIMMERBERG, ZOTTOLI*. As-
sistant Professors: HUTSON*, N. SANDSTROM.
Neuroscience is a rapidly growing interdisciplinary field concerned with understanding the relationship
between brain, mind, and behavior. The interdisciplinary nature of the field is apparent when surveying
those who call themselves neuroscientists. Among these are anatomists, physiologists, chemists, psycholo-
gists, philosophers, computer scientists, linguists, and ethologists. The areas that neuroscience addresses
are equally diverse and range from physiological and molecular studies of single neurons, to investigations
of how systems of neurons produce phenomena such as vision and movement, to the study of the neural
basis of complex cognitive phenomena such as memory, language, and consciousness. Applications of
neuroscience research are rapidly growing and include the development of drugs to treat neurodegenera-
tive disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, the development of noninvasive tech-
niques for imaging the human brain such as PET scans and MRI, and the development of methods for
repair of the damaged human brain such as the use of brain explants. Combining this wide range of disci-
plines, areas of research, and application for the study of a single remarkably complex organ--the brain--
requires a unique interdisciplinary approach. The Neuroscience Program is designed to provide students
with the opportunity to explore this approach.
THE PROGRAM
The program in neuroscience consists of five courses including an introductory course, three electives,
and a senior course. In addition, students are required to take two courses, Biology 101 and Psychology
101, as part of the program.
Neuroscience (Neuroscience 201) is the basic course and provides the background for other neurosci-
ence courses. Ideally, this will be taken before the end of sophomore year. Either Biology 101 or Psycholo-
gy 101 serves as the prerequisite. Electives are designed to provide in-depth coverage including laboratory
experience in specific areas of neuroscience. At least one elective course is required in Biology (Group A)
and one in Psychology (Group B). The third elective course may also come from Group A or Group B, or
may be selected from other neuroscience related courses upon approval of the advisory committee. Topics
in Neuroscience (Neuroscience 401) is designed to provide an integrative culminating experience. Most
students will take this course in the senior year.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN NEUROSCIENCE
The degree with honors in Neuroscience provides students with the opportunity to undertake an original
research project under the supervision of one or more of the Neuroscience faculty. In addition to complet-
ing the requirements of the Neuroscience Program, candidates for an honors degree must enroll in Neuro-
science 493-W31-494 and write a thesis based on an original research project. Presentation of a thesis,
however, should not be interpreted as a guarantee of a degree with honors. Students interested in pursuing a
degree with honors should contact the Neuroscience Advisory Committee in the spring of their junior year.

NSCI 401(S) Topics in Neuroscience
Neuroscientists explore issues inherent in the study of brain and behavior. The overall objective of this seminar is
to create a culminating senior experience in which previous course work in specific areas in the Neuroscience
Program can be brought to bear in a synthetic, interdisciplinary approach to understanding complex problems.
The specific goals for students in this seminar are (1) to evaluate original research and critically examine the
experimental evidence for theoretical issues, and (2) to gain an understanding of this discipline through group
work, and oral presentations. Topics and instructional formats will vary somewhat from year to year, but in all
cases the course will emphasize an integrative approach in which students will be asked to consider topics from a
range of perspectives including molecular, cellular, systems, behavioral and clinical neuroscience. Previous top-
ics have included memory, autism, depression, alcoholism, language development, and stress.
Format: student-led discussions and presentations, three hours a week. Evaluation will be based on presentations,
participation in class discussion, and a term paper.
Prerequisites: open only to seniors in the Neuroscience program. Enrollment limit: 24 (expected: 22).
This course is required of all senior students in the Neuroscience program.
Hour: 1:10-3:50 W ZIMMERBERG
NSCI 493(F)-W31-494(S) Senior Thesis
Independent research for two semesters and a winter study under the guidance of one or more neuroscience
faculty. After reviewing the literature in a specialized field of neuroscience, students design and conduct an origi-
nal research project, the results of which are reported in a thesis. Senior thesis work is supervised by the faculty
participating in the program.
PERFORMANCE STUDIES
Advisory Faculty: Professors: BUCKY, CASSIDAY, DARROW (Co-Coordinator, Second Semes-
ter), D. EDWARDS, EPPEL, HOPPIN, OCKMAN. Associate Professors: KAGAYA (Co-Coordi-
nator, First Semester), L. JOHNSON, W. A. SHEPPARD. Assistant Professors: BEAN (Co-Coor-
dinator), BURTON, JOTTAR, MLADENOVIC. Lecturers: BROTHERS, DIGGS, JAFFE.
The Performance Studies Program provides an opportunity to inhabit an intellectual place where the
making of artistic and cultural meaning intersects with critical reflection on those processes. The program
has as its primary goal the bringing together of those students and faculty engaged in the creative arts, i.e.,
studio art, creative writing, dance, film and video, music, and theater with those departments that reflect in
part on those activities, e.g., Anthropology and Sociology, Art History, Classics, Comparative Literature,
English, History, Music, Philosophy, Psychology, Religion and Theatre. The central ideas which perfor-
mance studies confronts-action, body, frame, representation, race, ethnicity, gender, politics, history and
transcultural experience-circulate within and through the subjects and fields upon which the program
draws.
Performance Studies strongly suggests that interested students take the introductory course (Theatre
220) and one of two capstone courses (Theatre 330 or Theatre 331).
Currently, the Program's status is as a program without a concentration. However, students interested in
participating in the Performance Studies Program are encouraged to do five things: 1) take the introductory
course, which in 2006-07 is Theatre 220, Approaching Performance Studies; 2) take a capstone course,
which in 2006-07 is either Theatre 330, Aesthetics of Resistance: Contemporary Latin American Theatre
and Performance; or Theatre 331, Sound and Movement in the Afro-Latino/a Diaspora; 3) try different
artistic media, both in the curriculum and beyond; 4) move between the doing of art and performance and
thinking about that process; and 5) prepare a portfolio of their work in different media.
As a senior year project, the Performance Studies Program strongly recommends the assembling of a
senior portfolio. Preparation of the portfolio should normally begin in the second semester of the junior
year. It will be done under the supervision of a member of the advisory faculty and will be submitted in the
spring of the senior year. What we suggest is that portfolios should draw on at least four projects or produc-
tions. They should show critical self-reflection on the creative processes, a comparison of the artistic media
employed and also demonstrate performance criticism on the work of others.

THEA 220(S) Approaching Performance Studies (Same as ArtS 204 and Women's and Gender
Studies 220) (W)
Whether engaged with a `dialogical aesthetic' (Grant Kester) or intentional movement and sound in relation to
narrative, place or phenomena, we explore in this class elements from many fields: anthropology, dramatic
theory, post-structuralism, psychoanalytic theory, folklore, religion, cultural studies, literary theory, philosophy,
feminist theory, and queer theory. The forms we'll consider as the interdisciplinary meeting ground for those
studies include theatre, film, video, music, dance, visual art, performance art, community activism, celebrations,
parades, and public gatherings. As we read and watch performances, questions will be raised: What are the
parameters? Are social attributes, such as ethnicity or sexuality, staged? Are cultural activities, such as tourism,
beyond our purview or are they performed and displayed as they are lived? Are spectacles, simulations and
consumption culturally specific?
This course is the introduction course for the Performance Studies Program.
Format: seminar. Evaluation is based on one short presentation, two short papers, final performance project, class
discussion and class attendance.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected 10). Not open to first-year students
Hour: 1:10-2:25 MR BEAN and DIGGS
THEA 330(F) The Aesthetics of Resistance: Contemporary Latino/a-American Theatre and
Performance (Same as American Studies 330 and Latina/o Studies 330)*
This course explores the theories and current practices of Latin American theatre and performance; particularly
how these expressive practices evolve within and against dictatorships and neocolonial regimes. We will explore
how art and activism coincide in the production of counter-public spheres and aesthetics of resistance such as
theatre of the oppressed, public interventions, and cyber-activism. The course concludes with an examination of
site-specific performance along the US/Mexico border and the Spirit Republic of Puerto Rico.
Format: seminar. Requirements: class participation and 2 presentations, one review, one short essay (5-7 pages)
and two longer essays (7-10 pages). Students are expected to visit the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and
Politics website (http//hemi.ps.tsoa.nyu.edu).
No prerequisites. No enrollment limit.

THEA 331(S) Sound and Movement in the Diaspora: Afro-Latin Identities (Same as American
Studies 331, Latina/o Studies 331 and Women's and Gender Studies 331)*
This course focuses on the production of music and dance in the Afro-Latino Diaspora, and how Afro-Latino
identities manifest through these various forms of expressive culture. We will explore the notions of transcultura-
tion and mestizaje as theoretical tools to understand the construction of race as a representational discourse per-
formed through music and dance. We will pay particular attention to the intersections of class, race, gender and
sexuality in Cuba, Brazil, Puerto Rico, and the U.S.
Format: seminar. Requirements: class participation and presentations, two short essays (3-4 pp.) and one final
essay (10 pp.)

PHILOSOPHY (Div. II)
Chair, Professor JANA SAWICKI
Professors: GERRARD, SAWICKI, WHITE. Associate Professors: CRUZ, DUDLEY. Assistant Profes-
sors: BARRY*, MLADENOVIC. Visiting Assistant Professor: J. PEDRONI. Bolin Fellow: ALCALA.
To engage in philosophy is to ask a variety of questions about the world and our place in it. What can we
know? What should we do? What may we hope? What makes human beings human? These questions, in
various forms, and others like them are not inventions of philosophers; on the contrary, they occur to most
people simply as they live their lives. Many of us ask them as children, but later either ignore them, or
accept answers we can live with. Philosophers, however, seek to keep such questions open, and to address
them through reasoned discussion and argument, instead of accepting answers to them based on opinion or
prejudice.
The program in philosophy is designed to aid students in thinking about these issues, by acquainting
them with influential work in the field, past and present, and by training them to grapple with these issues
themselves. The program emphasizes training in clear, critical thinking and in effective writing. Philosophy
courses center around class discussions and the writing of interpretive and critical essays.
MAJOR
Philosophy is a discipline with a long and intricate history, a history that remains an integral part of the
discipline. In this way, it differs dramatically from the natural sciences: for example, although no contem-
porary physicists or biologists embrace Aristotle's physics or biology, among philosophers there continue
to be champions of Aristotle's metaphysics and of his ethics. Because of the richness and continuing im-
portance of the history of philosophy, the program is designed to give majors a historical background that
will acquaint them with a wide variety of approaches in philosophical issues, and will provide them with a
basis for evaluating and contributing to contemporary debates.
A total of nine courses is required for the major in Philosophy. Students should begin with Philosophy
101 and 102, in either order; both are required for the major. These courses provide introductions to histori-
Philosophy
­ 249 ­
cal figures and themes that continue to be influential in many contemporary discussions in the two major
areas of philosophical inquiry, i.e., practical inquiry into issues of ethics and politics, and theoretical inquiry
into issues of knowledge, belief, understanding, and reality. The final required course is the Senior Semi-
nar, Philosophy 401. Each student selects the six electives that complete the major. The exposure to figures
and topics in 101 and 102 provides students with some basis for choice, but optimal shaping of an individ-
ual curriculum requires in addition consultation with faculty members and other students.
Generally speaking, as students progress from 100- to 300-level courses, there will be decreasing
breadth and increasing depth. In addition, writing assignments become longer, and students assume in-
creasing responsibility for identifying and developing the topics of their essays. Finally, students in
300-level courses are often required to assume responsibility for making oral presentations or guiding sig-
nificant parts of class discussions.
Students considering graduate study in philosophy are strongly urged to develop reading competence in
German, French, or Greek before graduation.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN PHILOSOPHY
The degree with honors in Philosophy is awarded to the student who has demonstrated outstanding
achievement in a program of study that extends beyond the requirements of the major. The extension be-
yond major requirements may take the form either of independent work culminating in a senior essay or
thesis (the independent-study route) or of additional course work (the directed-study route). Candidates
must have GPAs of 3.6 or higher in their courses in philosophy at the end of the junior and senior years.
Juniors interested in pursuing honors should so inform the Department Chair no later than mid-April.
The independent-study route to honors requires the completion and defense of either a senior essay pro-
duced in the fall semester plus winter study period (maximum 40 pages)or a year-long senior thesis (maxi-
mum 75 pages). Plans for either essay or thesis (including a brief proposal and bibliography, worked out in
consultation with an advisor) must be submitted to the department in April of the junior year. A recommen-
dation for graduation with honors will be made on the basis of the thoroughness, independence, and origi-
nality of the student's work.
The directed-study route to honors required the completion of two courses in philosophy in addition to
the nine required for the major. Candidates taking this route must also submit to the department revised
copies of two term papers (10 pages or longer) written for philosophy courses they have taken; each stu-
dent will be assigned an adviser to help guide the process of revision. A recommendation for graduation
with honors will be made on the basis of the scope of the student's course work, the quality of the student's
participation in Philosophy 401, and the thoroughness, independence, and originality reflected in the sub-
mitted papers.
PHIL 101(F,S) Introduction to Moral and Political Philosophy (W)
Throughout the history of Western philosophy, there have been debates concerning how human beings should
live: What should we do both with our lives as wholes and in specific problematic situations? The debates have
addressed us both as individuals and as members of political communities. This course aims to aid us in respond-
ing to these debates, and in living our lives, on the basis of reasoned conclusions rather than from unrecognized
presuppositions. The course concentrates on Plato's Republic, the most influential ethical and political text within
Western philosophy, but we assess the Republic in light of elaborations and criticisms that have developed over
the past 2500 years, in works by Aristotle, Kant, and Mill.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: class discussion, frequent short papers (totaling 20-30 pages).
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 per section (expected: 19 per section). Preference given to first-year stu-
dents and sophomores.

PHIL 102(F,S) Introduction to Metaphysics and Epistemology (W)
Metaphysics and epistemology are the two core pursuits of theoretical philosophy (as opposed to practical phi-
losophy, the focus of Philosophy 101). Metaphysics is concerned with the ultimate character of reality. The meta-
physician seeks to develop knowledge (as opposed to mere opinion or belief) of all things natural, human, and
divine. She asks, for example: Are we free, or are our acts determined? Is there a God? If so, what must God be
like? Epistemology is concerned with how we determine the difference between knowledge and mere opinion.
The epistemologist thus asks: What does it mean truly to know something? How can we acquire such genuine
knowledge? Answers to these epistemological questions are essential if we are to have any confidence in the
methods and results of our metaphysical investigations. This course will emphasize the established historical
classics that provide the basis for understanding contemporary work on metaphysics and epistemological issues;
we will consider, among others, the work of Descartes, Hume, and Kant.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: class discussion, frequent short papers (totaling 20-30 pages).
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 per section (expected: 19 per section). Preference given to first-year stu-
dents and sophomores.

PHIL 103(S) Logic and Language (Q)
Logic is the study of reasoning and argument. More particularly, it concerns itself with the difference between
good and bad reasoning, between strong and weak arguments. We all examine the virtues and vices of good
arguments in both informal and formal systems. The goals of this course are to improve the critical thinking of
the students, to introduce them to sentential and predicate logic, to familiarize them with enough formal logic to
Philosophy
­ 250 ­
enable them to read some of the great works of philosophy, which use formal logic (such as Wittgenstein's Trac-
tatus), and to examine some of the connections between logic and philosophy.
Requirements: a midterm, a final, frequent homework and problems sets.

PHIL 209(F) Philosophy of Science
It is a generally held belief, in our times and culture, that science is the best source of our knowledge of the world,
and of ourselves. The aim of this course is to examine the origins, grounds, and nature of this belief. We will
analyze and discuss various accounts of scientific method, structure and justification of scientific theories, scien-
tific choice, change, and the idea that scientific knowledge is progressive. The course will begin with the "re-
ceived view" of scientific theories, methods, and knowledge, advanced by logical positivists, which assumes the
objectivity and the rationality of science. We will then discuss philosophies of science that emerged out of vari-
ous criticisms of this view-especially those of Popper, Lakatos, Kuhn and Feyerabend-and the challenges to the
assumptions of scientific objectivity and rationality their works provoked. This discussion will naturally lead us
to the relativist and social-constructivist views developed within contemporary science studies. Finally, we will
analyze the current debate about the cognitive credentials of science and the proper approach to the study of
science, which came to be known as "the science wars."
Requirements: frequent short assignments, class presentation, class participation, and a longer (5-7 pages) term

PHIL 213(S) Biomedical Ethics (W)
This course explores key concepts in bioethical theory, as well as their application to pressing moral concerns in
health care and biotechnology. Through cases, readings, and discussions, we will analyze such core notions as
death, illness and disability, and develop a framework of central principles for conceptualizing and resolving
practical ethical problems that arise in the medical context. Much of the term will focus on questions surrounding
(1) the care of the terminally ill (including, for example, the use of advance directives, withholding and with-
drawing life-sustaining treatment, and physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia), (2) the management of medi-
cal information (e.g., privacy in health care, mandatory reporting, and genetic testing), (3) the use of human sub-
jects in research, and (4) human gene transfer for purposes of therapy or enhancement. Students need not have a
background in life sciences or in philosophy, but the course is analytic and rigorous.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: active participation in class discussions, two case analyses (7-10 pp.
each), and periodic short writing assignments (2-3 pages each).

PHIL 228(F) Feminist Bioethics (Same as Women's and Gender Studies 228) (W)
In this course we'll explore the ways in which feminist approaches to moral thinking have influenced both the
methodology and the content of contemporary bioethics. The first portion of the course will address the emer-
gence of the "Ethics of Care," critically assessing its origins in feminist theory, its development within the context
of the caring professions, and its potential as a general approach to bioethical reasoning. The second portion of
the course will use feminist philosophy to inform our understanding of the ways in which gender structures the
individual's interactions with the health care system. To do this, we'll explore topics that might traditionally be
Philosophy
­ 251 ­
considered "women's issues" in health care, such as medicine and body image (e.g., cosmetic surgery, eating
disorders), reproductive and genetic technologies, and research on women and their health care needs. In addi-
tion we'll also look at feminist analyses of topics that traditionally haven't been identified as particularly gender
specific, such as resource allocation and end of life issues.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: active participation in class discussions, two mid-length papers (7-10
pp. each), and weekly short writing assignments (app. 2 pp. each).
No prerequisites, although previous coursework in Women's and Gender Studies is desirable. Enrollment limit:

PHIL 229(F) Ethics and Genetics (W)
The Human Genome Project, among other recent advancements in genetic technology, has already profoundly
affected the conduct of basic biological sciences and has the potential to revolutionize medical practice and agri-
culture. In this course we'll examine the philosophical and ethical concerns that accompany the use of genetic
information and interventions. We will begin by addressing foundational conceptual questions, the first of which
will be: what constitutes specifically genetic information and manipulation? In addition, we'll consider the for-
mulation and moral relevance of the distinctions between nature and artifice in the genetic realm, the contribution
of genetics to various notions of identity, and the relationship between moral responsibility and genetic influence
or determinism. The remainder--and bulk--of the course will take up specific ethical issues relating to genetic
information and technology. Such topics may include privacy and the disclosure of genetic information, genetic
testing and screening, preimplantation genetic diagnosis and the creation of "savior" siblings, human gene trans-
fer (a.k.a. "gene therapy"), cloning of human and nonhuman animals, patenting and intellectual rights, genetic
experimentation with humans, and the agricultural use of genetically modified organisms.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: active participation in class, periodic short writing assignments (2-3
pages each), and one long term paper (10-15 pages) on a topic of the student's choosing. Previous coursework in
biology, genetics or philosophy may be helpful but is by no means required.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected : 10-15). Preference given to Philosophy majors, Biology ma-
jors, and Pre-Med students.

PHIL 230(F) Pluralism and the Law (Same as Legal Studies 230, Political Science 219 and
Women's and Gender Studies 230)
The ideal of "the rule of law, not of men" reflects a commitment by most modern democracies to the regular and
impartial administration of public rules. Free societies are also characterized by a pluralism of reasonable but
frequently divergent views among its citizens. This course explores the tension between the rule of law ideal and
different forms of pluralism. Drawing on judicial opinions and works in philosophy and legal theory, we will
examine law from the perspectives of gender, race, class, and other standpoints. These perspectives
inform alternative, often critical, understandings of existing legal doctrines in areas ranging from private law to
the constitution. We will focus on how these competing accounts pose philosophical challenges to the social
norms and institutional structures the law endorses--by questioning the status of knowledge claims, the role of
moral principle, and the basis of political legitimacy in law. Finally, we will ask whether the law can overcome
those concerns in light of emerging theories in contemporary legal philosophy. Readings will include a few illus-
trative appellate cases but will consist largely of works by philosophers and legal scholars such as Locke, Rous-
seau, John Rawls, Michael Sandel, Duncan Kennedy, Robin West, Lucie White, Robert Cover, Martha Minow,
Roberto Unger, and Frank Michelman.

PHIL 241T(S) Philosophy of Education: Why Are You Here? (W)
Students compete ferociously for the opportunity to pay large sums of money for the privilege of attending Wil-
liams College. The value of the educational experience they receive is usually taken to be self-evident. Less ob-
vious, however, is the nature of education itself. What is education? Which purposes can and should it serve? Is
education the sort of thing that can be "received" and, if so, how?
These questions about the nature of education are essential to philosophy, and also to the history and future of
Williams College. Since the time of Plato and Aristotle philosophers have sought to determine the educational
practices most conducive to human wisdom and flourishing. American liberal arts colleges offer a distinctive
form of educational experience, and thus a distinctive response to the philosophical challenge to specify the opti-
mal means of human development.
In this tutorial students will read and discuss classic texts in the philosophy of education in close conjunction with
materials concerning the emergence and present practices of liberal arts colleges in America. Special attention
will be paid to Williams College, and students will be encouraged to reflect upon their own educational goals and
choices in light of the philosophical works that they read.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: each week one tutorial partner will write a 5- to 7-page paper on the assigned
reading, which the other partner will critique. The two partners will switch roles in alternate weeks.
Prerequisites: Philosophy 101, or Philosophy 102, or permission of the instructor. Enrollment Limit: 10 (ex-
pected: 10). Preference will be given to majors or prospective majors in philosophy. Several spaces will be re-
served for sophomores.

PHIL 271T(S) Woman as "Other" (Same as Women's and Gender Studies 271T) (W)
At mid-century, Simone de Beauvoir, perhaps the greatest feminist theorist of the twentieth century, described
woman as "living is a world where men compel her to assume the status of the Other." In other words, man is the
absolute subject, and woman takes on all of the negative qualities (bodily, mortal, irrational) that he prefers not to
see in himself. At the same time, Beauvoir asserts: "One is not born a woman, one becomes one." How, given the
fact that woman historically have been reduced to objects for men, that they have internalized the gaze of men,
can they become subjects for themselves? How can (and do?) they become self- rather than other-determined?
What are the conditions of possibility for authentic, self-determining womanhood? For authentic personhood? Is
authenticity even possible? Must the relation between self and other inevitably be one of objectification and
domination? Is reciprocity and mutuality in self- other relations possible? In our effort to deepen our
understanding of these important philosophical questions, questions that have been at the center of social and
political thought at least since Hegel introduced the dialectic of master and slave, we will engage in close
readings of influential works by Beauvoir, Luce Irigary and Judith Butler.
Format: tutorial; students will work in pairs. Requirements: each student will write and present orally a five-page
essay every other week. Students not presenting essays will prepare oral critiques of their partners' essays.

PHIL 317(S) The Philosophy of Hilary Putnam
Hilary Putnam is considered by many (including the professor of this course) to be the world's foremost living
philosopher. Putnam is famous for both changing his mind and for the breadth of his interests. He was one of the
earliest proponents of the view that human beings are importantly analogous to computers, and then later, one of
the chief critics of that view. Putnam's works range from the philosophy of logic and physics to the philosophy of
education and history. He has written on philosophers from Aristotle and Kant to Levinas and Dewey. He has
examined both the consistency of mathematics and the consistency of religion. In this course we will study the
full range of Putnam's work.

PHIL 334(S) Philosophy of Biology (Same as History of Science 334)
In the comparatively short period of only two centuries, biology became one of the most interesting and both
intellectually and socially influential sciences. Philosophical interest in its concepts, scientific methodology, and
reliability of its results is now probably greater than it ever was before. In order to understand philosophical
significance of contemporary biology, we will focus on the theory of evolution, and discuss the following
questions and problems: What are the main claims of the theory of evolution, and how are we to interpret them?
For example, what is an "adaptationist explanation" and under which conditions are such explanations
satisfactory? What is `fitness,' and how should the concept be employed to help us provide good evolutionary
explanations? What is natural selection acting upon--a species, an organism, or organism's genes? And how are
we to define `species,' faced with different definitions used in different biological sciences? Darwin, and other
evolutionists after him, firmly reject teleological explanations in biology--yet to explain the emergence and
stability of particular traits in organisms and species we must say what purpose do these traits serve, which seems
like a teleological explanation after all. How are we to resolve this apparent tension in the heart of the
evolutionary theory?--Finally, in the last segment of the course, we will examine the influence biology had on
other disciplines, by studying the methods, assumptions and some specific claims of sociobiology and
evolutionary psychology.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: class participation, three 5-pages long papers, and a longer (7-10 pgs.)

PHIL 388T(S) Consciousness (W)
The nature of consciousness remains a fundamental mystery of the universe. Our internal, felt experience--what
chocolate tastes like to oneself, what it is like to see the color red, or, more broadly, what it is like to have a first
person, waking perspective at all--resists explanation in any terms other than the conscious experience itself in
spite of centuries of intense effort by philosophers and, more recently, by scientists. As a result, some prominent
Philosophy
­ 254 ­
researchers propose that the existence of consciousness requires a revision of basic physics, while others (seem-
ingly desperately) deny that consciousness exists at all. Those positions remain extreme, but the challenge that
consciousness poses is dramatic. It is at the same time the most intimately known fact of our humanity and sci-
ence's most elusive puzzle.
In this tutorial we will read the contemporary literature on consciousness. We will concentrate both on making
precise the philosophical problem(s) of consciousness and on understanding the role of the relevant neuroscien-
tific and cognitive research. Tutorial partners will have an opportunity to spend the end of the semester working
on a special topic of their choosing including, for instance, consciousness and freewill, consciousness and artifi-
cial intelligence, disorders of consciousness, or the scientific reduction of mind to brain. The syllabus can be
found at:
http://www.williams.edu/philosophy/fourth_layer/faculty_pages/jcruz/courses/consciousness.html
Format: tutorial. Requirements: Participants will present substantial written work in the tutorial every other
week, and will be responsible for commenting on their tutorial partner's work on off weeks. Expect several short

PHIL 390T(F) Truth (W)
Is a true account one that corresponds to things the way they are? Or is it one that fits optimally with other ac-
counts we accept? Or is it one that successfully guides us in our actions within the world? Positive answers to
these questions point, respectively, towards correspondence, coherence, and pragmatist theories of truth, all of
which continue to have their champions. Within the broader context of Euro-American philosophy through the
twentieth century and up to the present, they are joined by phenomenological, postmodernist, semantic, defla-
tionary, prosentential, and pluralistic approaches to the problem of truth (all of which are interesting and impor-
tant, although more difficult than the first three to get at by means of a single question). In this tutorial, we will
investigate this terrain. The first ten tutorial meetings of the semester will consider defenses of and objections to
each of these approaches. In the final two meetings, tutorial partners will take turns presenting the positions they
deem best. Format: tutorial. Requirements: students meet with the instructor in pairs for roughly an hour each
week; students will write essays every other week (6 in all), and comment on their partners' papers in alternate
weeks. Emphasis will be placed on developing skills in reading, interpretation, and oral argument, as well as
critical reasoning and writing. Prerequisites: Philosophy 101 or 102 or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit:

PHIL 393(F) Hegel: Freedom and History
Hegel pointed out that although freedom is one of our highest values, it is "open to the greatest misconceptions."
This remains true today: although appeals to freedom are used to justify governments, institutions, policies, and
practices (and to sell cars, soft drinks, and rock-n-roll), those making and responding to such appeals rarely the-
matize freedom explicitly, much less adequately. This has the ironic (and perhaps dangerous) consequence of
making our culture one in which people follow appeals to freedom unfreely, without knowing what freedom is or
why it is worth pursuing.
This course will begin with the Philosophy of Right, in which Hegel critiques the most powerful "misconcep-
tions" of freedom (those of liberalism and Kant), and develops a new conception that grounds his own social and
political philosophy. We will then read the Philosophy of History, in which Hegel interprets history as the tempo-
ral process whereby humans come to understand their freedom and actualize it in the world.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: Two short papers, one longer paper, regular and active participation.

PHIL 401(F) Senior Seminar: Philosophical Naturalism (W)
Philosophical naturalism is the thesis that the entirety of the universe is composed of natural things or processes,
and philosophers including Aristotle, Hume, Hegel, Nietzsche, Foucault, Mackie, and Fodor subscribe, in some
sense, to it. This elusive commitment has been variously interpreted to mean that everything in the universe is
physical or material, or that everything is amenable to scientific investigation, or that nothing is supernatural, or
that nothing is known a priori, or that everything is natural in some broader sense of that word. Thus, the thesis is
sometimes metaphysical, sometimes epistemological, and sometimes methodological. Indeed, depending on its
guise, philosophical naturalism has sometimes seemed a bland and uncontroversial truism, while in others it has
seemed a daring, provocative, and, to some, manifestly false view. In this seminar, we will aim to come to grips
with philosophical naturalism. Our first project will be to understand different kinds of naturalism, and our sec-
ond will be to assess whether there is any reason to believe of any of those kinds that it is true. We will attend

The instructional Physical Education Program at Williams is an integral part of the student's total educa-
tional experience. As a part of the liberal arts concept, the program develops the mind-body relationship,
which is dependent upon the proper integration of physical and intellectual capacities. The main objective
of the physical education program is to develop in each student an appreciation of physical fitness and
wellness, and to expose them to a variety of activities that are suitable for lifetime participation.
Four credits of physical education represent one of the requirements for the College degree. There are
five physical education units during the year. In the fall semester, there are two six-week physical education
quarters. Winter Study is another unit, and there are two physical education quarters in the spring semester.
Four sections meet two times per week in seventy-five minute periods and two sections meet three times
per week in fifty-minute periods.
The following courses are offered at various times during the year. A schedule listing all courses offered
is issued to every student before each quarter and Winter Study. Classes may vary according to availability
of instructors and interest of students.

What is light? How does a transistor work? What is a black hole? Why are metals shiny? What is wave/
particle duality? There are people for whom questions like these are of more than passing interest; some of
them become Physics or Astrophysics majors. A physics student experiments with the phenomena by
which the physical world is known and explores the mathematical techniques and theories that make sense

of it. A Physics or Astrophysics major serves as preparation for further work in physics, astrophysics, ap-
plied physics, other sciences, engineering, medical research, science teaching and writing, and other ca-
reers involving insight into the fundamental principles of nature.
ASTROPHYSICS MAJOR
The Physics Department, in cooperation with the Astronomy Department, offers a major in astrophysics
consisting of (at least): 6 or 7 courses in Physics, 3 or 4 in Astronomy, and 1 in Mathematics. The core
sequence of the Astrophysics major is the same as the Physics major described below (except that Physics
302, although strongly recommended, is not required). Students intending to pursue graduate study in as-
trophysics will need to take upper-level physics electives beyond the basic requirements for the major.
Honors work in Astrophysics may be in either physics or astronomy. Students majoring in Astrophysics
are expected to consult early and often with faculty from both departments in determining their course
selections. The detailed description of the Astrophysics major is given under "Astronomy," along with a
description of the Astronomy major also offered by that department (see page 90).
PHYSICS MAJOR
Introductory courses
Students considering a major in physics should take both physics and mathematics as first-year students.
A student normally begins with either Physics 131 or Physics 141:
1) Physics 131 Particles and Waves. This is designed as a first course in physics. It is suitable for stu-
dents who either have not had physics before or have had some physics but are not comfortable solving
"word problems" that require calculus.
2) Physics 141 Particles and Waves--Enriched. Students in this course should have solid backgrounds
in science and calculus, either from high school or college, including at least a year of high school physics.
The Department of Mathematics will place students in the appropriate introductory calculus course. The
physics major sequence courses all make use of calculus at increasingly sophisticated levels. Therefore,
students considering a Physics major should continue their mathematical preparation without interruption
through the introductory calculus sequence (Mathematics 103, 104, and 105 or 106). Students are encour-
aged to take Physics 210 as early as possible. Physics 210 is cross listed as Mathematics 210 for the benefit
of those students who wish to have the course listed with a MATH prefix.
Advanced Placement
Students with unusually strong backgrounds in calculus and physics may place out of Physics 141 and
either: 1) begin with the special seminar course Physics 151 in the fall (typically followed by Physics 210
in the spring), or 2) begin with Physics 142 in the spring (possibly along with Physics 210). Students may
take either 151 or 142 but not both. On rare occasions a student with an exceptional background will be
offered the option of enrolling in Physics 201.
Placement is based on AP scores, consultation with the department, and results of a placement exam
administered during First Days. The exam can also be taken later in the year by arrangement with the de-
partment chair. The exam covers classical mechanics, basic wave phenomena, and includes some use of
calculus techniques.
Requirements for the Major
A total of ten courses in physics and mathematics are required to complete the Physics major. Students who
place out of both Physics 141 and Physics 142 and begin their studies in Physics 201 are required to take a
total of nine courses.
Required Physics Sequence Courses
Physics 141 Particles and Waves--Enriched
or Physics 131 Particles and Waves
Physics 142 Foundations of Modern Physics
or Physics 151 Seminar in Modern Physics
Physics 201 Electricity and Magnetism
Physics 202 Waves and Optics
Physics 210 Mathematical Methods for Scientists
Physics 301 Quantum Physics
Physics 302 Statistical Physics
Required Mathematics Course
Mathematics 105 Multivariable Calculus or Mathematics 106 Multivariable Calculus
Students entering with Advanced Placement in mathematics may obtain credit toward the major for the
equivalent Mathematics 105 or 106 taken elsewhere.
At least two more physics or other approved courses must be taken, bringing the total number of courses
for the major to ten.
Options
1) Mathematics 104 may be counted if taken at Williams
2) Mathematics 209 may substitute for Physics 210.
Physics
­ 257 ­
3) Astronomy 111 may count in place of Physics 141 if a student places out of 141 (see "advanced
placement" above).
4) An additional Astronomy or Astrophysics course above the introductory level that is acceptable for
the astrophysics major may be counted.
5) Two approved Division III courses above the introductory level may be substituted for one Physics
course. Approval is on an individual basis at the discretion of the department chair.
6) Honors work is in addition to completion of the basic major so Physics 493 and 494 do not count
towards the ten courses in the major.
Preparation for Advanced Study
Students who may wish to do graduate work in physics, astrophysics, or engineering should elect
courses in both physics and mathematics beyond the minimum major requirements. The first-year gradu-
ate school curriculum in physics usually includes courses in quantum mechanics, electromagnetic theory,
and classical mechanics that presuppose intermediate level study of these subjects as an undergraduate.
Therefore, students planning graduate work in physics should elect all of the following courses:
Physics 402T Applications of Quantum Mechanics
Physics 405T Electromagnetic Theory
Physics 411T Classical Mechanics
Advising
Both majors and non-majors are encouraged to consult with the department chair or course instructors
about course selections or other matters.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN PHYSICS
The degree with honors in Physics will be awarded on the basis of a senior thesis presenting the results
of a substantial experimental or theoretical investigation carried out under the direction of a faculty mem-
ber in the department. There is no rigid grade point average required for admission to the program or for the
awarding of the degree with honors, but it is normally expected that honors students will maintain at least a
B average in physics and mathematics. Students will normally apply for admission to the program early in
the spring of their junior year and during senior year these students will normally elect Physics 493, W31,
and 494 in addition to the usual requirements for the major. At the end of winter study, the department will
decide whether the student will be admitted to honors candidacy. Both a written thesis and a colloquium
presentation of the results are required. The degree with honors will be awarded to those who meet these
requirements with distinction. The degree with highest honors will be awarded to those who fulfill them
with unusually high distinction.
Honors candidates will also be required to participate in departmental colloquium talks.
STUDY ABROAD
The physics community is international in scope and a career in physics (or related field) can provide
many opportunities for travel and contact with individuals from outside the United States. The physics
major at Williams is a carefully structured four-year program designed to prepare students who are so in-
clined for graduate study at leading research institutions. While it is possible to complete the major require-
ments in three years, such a major will not usually not lead to further study in the field. With careful early
planning on the part of a student, and close consultation with the department chair, it is possible to complete
a strong major and still study abroad provided the foreign institution can provide courses which reasonably
substitute or supplement those in the Williams major program.
OPTIONS FOR NON-MAJORS
Many students want to take a self-contained and rigorous full-year survey of physics. For such students,
the most appropriate sequence will be either Physics 131 or Physics 141 followed by Physics 132, depend-
ing on the student's background in science and mathematics (see Introductory Courses above). Either of
these sequences satisfies the physics requirement for medical school.
The department also offers one semester courses designed for non-majors. This year there are two such
offerings: Physics 100 and Physics 109.
PHYS 100 The Search for Rhythm and Pattern in the Universe (Not offered 2006-2007; to be
offered 2007-2008) (Q)

PHYS 109(F) Sound, Light, and Perception (Q)
Light and sound allow us to perceive the world around us, from appreciating music and art to learning the details
of atomic structure. Because of their importance in human experience, light and sound have long been the subject
of scientific inquiry. How are sound and light related? How do physiology and neural processing allow us to hear
and see the world around us? What are the origins of color and musical pitch? This course introduces the science
and technology of light and sound to students not majoring in physics. We will start with the origins of sound and
light as wave phenomena, and go on to topics including color, the optics of vision, the meaning of musical pitch
and tone, and the physical basis of hearing. We will also discuss some recent technological applications of light,
such as lasers and optical communications. The class will meet for two 75-minute periods each week for a vari-
able mixture of lecture, discussion, and hands-on, interactive experiments.
Format: lecture/lab/discussion. Each student will attend the Thursday lecture plus one conference section weekly.
Evaluation will be based on class participation, problem sets, in-class exams, oral presentations, and a final exam,

No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 40 (expected: 40).
Hour: 9:55-11:10 R Conferences: 9:55-11:10 T, 2:35-3:50 T S. BOLTON and AALBERTS
PHYS 131(F) Particles and Waves (Q)
We focus first on the Newtonian mechanics of point particles: the relationship between velocity, acceleration, and
position; the puzzle of circular motion; forces; Newton's laws; energy and momentum; and gravitation. The
physics of extended objects and of fluids also will be discussed briefly. We finally turn to the basic properties of
waves, such as interference and polarization, with emphasis on light waves. This course is intended for students
who have not studied physics before or who have had some physics, but are not comfortable solving "word
problems" that require calculus. Students who scored 4 or 5 on the AP Physics B exam or on the AP Physics C
(mechanics) exam, or 6 or 7 on the IB Physics HL exam may not take this course. These students and others with
strong backgrounds in the sciences are encouraged to consider taking Physics 141 instead. Physics 131 can lead
to either Physics 132 (for students wanting a one-year survey of physics) or Physics 142 (for students consider-
ing a physics or astrophysics major).
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours every other week. Evaluation will be based on
weekly problem sets, weekly quizzes, hour tests, labs, and a final exam, all of which have a substantial quantita-
tive component.
Prerequisites: Mathematics 103. No enrollment limit (expected: 60).
Hour: 11:00-11:50 MWF Lab: 1-4 M,T,W STRAIT
PHYS 132(S) Electromagnetism and the Physics of Matter (Q)
This course is intended as the second half of a one-year survey of physics. In the first half of the semester we will
focus on electromagnetic phenomena. We will introduce the concept of electric and magnetic fields, and study in
detail the way in which electrical circuits and circuit elements work. The deep connection between electric and
magnetic phenomena is highlighted in a discussion of Faraday's Law of Induction. In the second half of the
semester, we introduce several of the most central topics in twentieth-century physics. We will discuss Einstein's
theory of special relativity as well as aspects of quantum theory. We will end with a treatment of nuclear physics,
radioactivity, and uses of radiation.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours every other week. Evaluation will be based on
weekly problem sets, labs, hour tests, and a final exam, all of which have a substantial quantitative component.
Prerequisites: Physics 131 or 141 or permission of instructor, and Mathematics 103. No enrollment limit (ex-
pected: 60).
Hour: 11:00-11:50 MWF Lab: 1-4 M,T,W MAJUMDER
PHYS 141(F) Particles and Waves--Enriched (Q)
This course covers the same topics as Physics 131, but with a higher level of mathematical sophistication and
more emphasis on waves. It is intended for students with solid backgrounds in the sciences, either from high
school or college, who feel comfortable solving "word problems" that require calculus. Physics 141 can lead to
either Physics 132 (for students wanting a one-year survey of physics) or Physics 142 (for students considering a
physics or astrophysics major).
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours every other week/conference, one hour every other
week. Evaluation will be based on weekly problem sets, quizzes and hour tests, and labs, all of which have a
substantial quantitative component.
Prerequisites: high school physics and Mathematics 103 (or equivalent placement). No enrollment limit (ex-
pected: 50).
Hour: 11:00-11:50 MWF Lab: 1-4 M,T MAJUMDER
PHYS 142(S) Foundations of Modern Physics (Q)
The twentieth century was an extremely productive and exciting time for physics. Special relativity has extended
physics into the realm of high speeds and high energies. Quantum mechanics has successfully described phe-
nomena at small energies and small distance scales. Our understanding of atoms, molecules, and solids has de-
veloped from a few revolutionary ideas into a sophisticated framework which today supports technologies that
were unimagined in 1900. This course will introduce many important developments in physics, including special
relativity, the Bohr model of the atom, Schrodinger's wave mechanics in one dimension, the chemical bond,
energy bands in solids, and nuclear physics.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours every other week/conference, one hour every other
week. Evaluation will be based on weekly quizzes, labs, two hour tests, and a final exam, all of which have a
substantial quantitative component.
Prerequisites: Physics 141 and Mathematics 103, or equivalent; students may not take both Physics 142 and
Physics 151. Physics 131 may substitute for Physics 141 with the permission of instructor. No enrollment limit
(expected:30).
Hour: 11:00-11:50 MWF Lab: 1-4 T,W WHITAKER
PHYS 151(F) Seminar in Modern Physics (Q)
Why does a hot coal glow red rather than blue or green or some other color? Remarkably, this simple question
could not be answered before the year 1900, because the answer depends on a radical assumption introduced in
that year by Max Planck. His work on thermal radiation marked the beginning of a revolutionary era in the histo-
ry of physics that culminated in a new framework for our understanding of the physical world. Relativity, quan-
tum mechanics, and statistical physics are the pillars of the modern framework, and constitute the core of this
course. As we study this material, we will also be exploring the process of research in physics, partly by doing
some experiments of our own. We will discuss the interaction between experiment and theory, as well as the roles
of simplicity, elegance, and unity in the search for explanations. This is a small seminar designed for first-year
Physics

students who have placed out of Physics 141.
Format: lecture/discussion, three hours per week; laboratory, every other week. Evaluation will be based on class
participation, labs, weekly problem sets, an oral presentation, two hour-exams and a final exam, all of which
have a substantial quantitative component.
Prerequisites: placement by the department (see advanced placement above). Students may take either Physics
142 or Physics 151 but not both. Enrollment limit: 18 (expected: 18).
Hour: 11:00-12:15 WF Lab: 1-4 W AALBERTS
PHYS 201(F) Electricity and Magnetism (Q)
In this course, we study electromagnetic phenomena and their mathematical description. Topics include electro-
magnetic induction, alternating circuits, and the electromagnetic properties of matter. We also introduce Max-
well's equations, which express in remarkably succinct form the essence of the theory.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based weekly quizzes,
problem sets, labs, two hour tests, and a final exam, all of which have a substantial quantitative component.
Prerequisites: Physics 142, Mathematics 105 or 106. No enrollment limit (expected:25).
Hour: 10:00-10:50 MWF Lab: 1-4 M,T WHITAKER
PHYS 202(S) Waves and Optics (Q)
Waves and oscillations characterize many different physical systems, including vibrating strings, springs, water
waves, sound waves, electromagnetic waves, and gravitational waves. Quantum mechanics even describes par-
ticles with wave functions. Despite these diverse settings waves exhibit several common characteristics, so that
the understanding of a few simple systems can provide insight into a wide array of phenomena. In this course we
begin with the study of oscillations of simple systems with only a few degrees of freedom. We then move on to
study transverse and longitudinal waves in continuous media in order to gain a general description of wave beha-
vior. The rest of the course focuses on electromagnetic waves and in particular on optical examples of wave
phenomena. In addition to well known optical effects such as interference and diffraction, we will study a num-
ber of modern applications of optics such as short pulse lasers and optical communications. Throughout the
course mathematical methods useful for higher-level physics will be introduced.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on problem
sets, labs, two one-hour tests, and a final exam, all of which have a substantial quantitative component.
Prerequisite: Physics 201. Co-requisite: Physics/Mathematics 210 or permission of instructor. No enrollment
limit (expected: 20).
Hour: 10:00-10:50 MWF Lab: 1-4 T,W STRAIT
PHYS 210(S) Mathematical Methods for Scientists (Same as Mathematics 210) (Q)
This course covers a variety of mathematical methods used in the sciences, focusing particularly on the solution
of ordinary and partial differential equations. In addition to calling attention to certain special equations that arise
frequently in the study of waves and diffusion, we develop general techniques such as looking for series solutions
and, in the case of nonlinear equations, using phase portraits and linearizing around fixed points. We study some
simple numerical techniques for solving differential equations. A series of optional sessions in Mathematica will
be offered for students who are not already familiar with this computational tool.
Format: lecture, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on weekly problem sets, two in-class exams and
a final exam, all of which have a substantial quantitative component.
Prerequisites: Mathematics 105 or 106 and familiarity with Newtonian mechanics at the level of Physics 131.No
enrollment limit (expected: 20).
Hour: 9:55-11:10 TR WOOTTERS
PHYS 301(F) Quantum Physics (Q)
This course serves as a one-semester introduction to the history, formalism, and phenomenology of quantum
mechanics. We begin with a discussion of the historical origins of the quantum theory, and the Schroedinger
wave equation. The concepts of matter waves and wave-packets are introduced. Solutions to one-dimensional
problems will be treated prior to introducing the system which serves as a hallmark of the success of quantum
theory, the three-dimensional hydrogen atom. In the second half of the course, we will develop the important
connection between the underlying mathematical formalism and the physical predictions of the quantum theory.
We then go on to apply this knowledge to several important problems within the realm of atomic and nuclear
physics.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on weekly
problem sets, labs, a midterm exam, and final exam, all of which have a substantial quantitative component.
Prerequisites: Physics 202 and Physics 210. No enrollment limit (expected:15).
Hour: 9:00-9:50 MWF Lab: 1-4 T,W K. JONES
PHYS 302(S) Statistical Physics (Q)
The natural world is built with many small components interacting in a simple but coordinated way. With a sta-
tistical view, we may make sense of the cooperative phenomena which emerge. For example, we can associate
macroscopic thermodynamic properties with ensembles of microscopic states. With calculations and simple nu-
merical exercises we shall probe a wide variety of physical phenomena: magnetism, gasses, heat engines, ther-
mal radiation, electrons in solids, polymers, random walks in fluids or in the stock market, and genomic informa-
tion.
Format: lecture/discussion, three hours per week; computer laboratory, two hours per week. Evaluation will be
based on weekly problem sets, tests, labs, and a small project, all of which have a substantial quantitative compo-
nent.
Prerequisites: Physics 142, Physics 210. No enrollment limit (expected: 15).

PHYS 316(S) Protecting Information: Applications of Abstract Algebra and Quantum Physics
(Same as Mathematics 316) (Q)
Living in the early decades of the information age, we find ourselves depending more and more on codes
that protect messages against either noise or eavesdropping. We begin this course by studying the history of
this subject, including, for example, the story of the enigma code from World War II. We then examine
some of the most important codes currently being used to protect information, including linear codes,
which in addition to being mathematically elegant are the most practical codes for error correction, and the
RSA public key cryptographic scheme, popular nowadays for internet applications. Looking ahead by a
decade or more, we show how a "quantum computer" could crack any RSA code in short order, and how
quantum cryptographic devices will achieve security through the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.
Evaluation will be based on homework sets and exams.
Prerequisites: Physics 210 or Mathematics 211 (possibly concurrent) or permission of the instructors. (Stu-
dents not satisfying the course prerequisites but who have completed Mathematics 209 or Mathematics 251
are particularly encouraged to ask to be admitted.)

PHYS 402T(S) Applications of Quantum Mechanics (Q)
This course will explore a number of important topics in quantum mechanics such as perturbation theory
and the semiclassical interaction of atoms and radiation. Research or review articles from the physics litera-
ture will be assigned to supplement standard texts and to help motivate discussion. Applications and exam-
ples will be taken mostly from atomic physics with some discussion of precision measurements and funda-
mental symmetries.
The class as a whole will meet once a week for 50 minutes to discuss questions on the reading. Each student
will also be assigned to a tutorial meeting with the instructor and one or two other students, at which the
students will take turns presenting solutions to assigned problems. Written solutions to selected problems
will be due a few days later.

PHYS 411T(F) Classical Mechanics (Q)
The course will investigate advanced topics in classical mechanics including phase space plots, non-linear oscil-
lators, numerical solutions, approximation methods, the calculus of variations, the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian
reformulations of mechanics, rotating frames of reference (with emphasis on the implications for physics on the
Earth) and scattering cross sections. The carry over of ideas developed in the context of classical mechanics into
other areas of physics will be explored. The class as a whole will meet once per week for an introductory lecture/
discussion. A second tutorial meeting between the instructor and a pair of students will be scheduled later in the
week. Students will take turns working and discussing problems at the chalkboard. Written solutions will be due
later in the week.

The Political Economy major is designed to give students a grasp of the ways in which political and
economic forces interact in the shaping of public policy. The major includes substantial study of the central
analytical approaches in both political science and economics and seeks to surmount the sometimes artifi-
cial barriers of specialization that may characterize either discipline taken by itself. In the junior and senior
years a conscious merging of the approaches in the two fields is undertaken in the three required Political
Economy courses. (These courses are designed by, and usually are taught jointly by, political scientists and
economists.) Political Economy 301 examines major writings in political economy and analyzes economic
liberalism and critiques of economic liberalism in the context of current policy issues. Political Economy
401 examines interactions of international and domestic forces in contemporary issues. Political Economy
402 asks students to research and make proposals in policy areas of current importance. Background for
these senior courses is acquired through courses in international economics, public finance, and domestic
and international/comparative politics and policy.
Students in Political Economy 402 visit Washington, D.C. Sunday night through Wednesday of the first
week of spring vacation to conduct interviews relating to their Political Economy 402 group projects. This
is a course requirement.

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN POLITICAL ECONOMY
Due to the special demands of this interdisciplinary major, the only route to honors in Political Economy
is the thesis. Seniors may pursue the honors thesis course (Political Economy 493-W31) during the fall
semester and winter study period. The third course contributing to such an honors program would normal-
ly be an elective in Political Science or Economics taken during the junior year. This course, which may be
one of the required electives, must be closely related, indeed must prepare the ground for the honors thesis.
Juniors in the Political Economy major with at least a 3.5 GPA in the program may apply for the honors
thesis program by means of a written proposal submitted to the chair before spring registration. Written
guidelines for such proposals are available in the chair's office or on the program website. The proposal
should have been discussed with at least two faculty members, and at least one faculty advisor from each
discipline should be solicited by the student prior to submission of the proposal.
Final decisions about admission to the honors program will be made in early summer, when spring
grades become available.
To achieve the degree with honors in Political Economy, the thesis must be completed by the end of
winter study period and be judged of honors quality by a committee consisting of the two advisors and a
third reader. A thesis judged to be of particular distinction will qualify its author for the degree with highest
honors.
STUDY ABROAD
Despite the fact that Political Economy requires more courses than the typical major, plenty of Political
Economy majors go abroad. Since the most popular time to take POEC 301 is the fall of the junior year, if
you're thinking of spending only one semester abroad, Spring is the better choice. But lots of students go
away for the Fall or the whole year. Political Economy majors have often been overrepresented in Williams
at Oxford. If you do go abroad in the fall, you may take POEC 301 in your sophomore or senior years. The
former is preferable (POEC 301 is not too hard for sophs) but the latter is more common, mainly because
many people don't decide to become POEC majors in time. You'll probably want to get some major cred-
its when abroad. The easiest to get are upper-level electives in political science and economics. Most pro-
grams for US students in Europe have a political science course on the EU, which is a good fit. We recom-
mend against taking econometrics abroad.
COURSE NUMBERING SYSTEM
The numbering system for courses offered and required in Political Economy is identical to the system
outlined on page 45.
POEC 301(F) Economic Liberalism and Its Critics (Same as Economics 299 and Political Science
333)
Economic liberalism holds that, if left alone by government, people will make mutually beneficial transactions
with one another, leaving society better off. Its critics point to what they believe this position ignores or what it
wrongly assumes, and hence, how it would make bad policy. This course explores the relationship between poli-
tics and economics by surveying influential works of political economy. Its first part examines major thinkers in
relation to the historical development of capitalism in Western Europe and the United States: the classical liberal-
ism of Adam Smith, Karl Marx's revolutionary socialism, and the reformist ideas of John Stuart Mill, R. H.
Tawney, and John Maynard Keynes. The second part considers more recent writings that revise and critique
liberalism from a variety of perspectives. The historical focus of the course permits you to appreciate the ongoing
dialogue between classical and contemporary views of political economy, while classroom discussion involves
frequent reference to current public policy issues.
Format: discussion/lecture. Requirements: eight 2-page papers and a final exam.
Prerequisites: one course in Economics and either Political Science 201 or203 or AP credit in American Politics
(or permission of instructor). Enrollment limit: 35 (expected: 32). Preference given to Political Economy majors
and sophomores intending a Political Economy major.
Required in the Political Economy major but open to non-majors.
Hour: 1:10-2:25 MR MAHON and MEARDON
POEC 397(F), 398(S) Independent Study
Open to juniors or seniors majoring in Political Economy, with approval ofafaculty supervisor and the chair.
POEC 401(F) Contemporary Problems in Political Economy
This course examines contemporary problems in political economy, integrating international, comparative and
US public policy. The course begins with discussions of key issue areas in political economy such as public
finance, economic development and international trade, intentionally incorporating both Economics and Political
Political Economy, Political Science
­ 263 ­
Science approaches to their study. In each issue area, the focus moves from theory to empirical analysis and then
to case studies. The course also incorporates a thematic component based on policy issues of current concern,
and concludes with student group projects and presentations on a contemporary policy issue of student choice
analyzed domestically and internationally.
Format: lecture, discussion, seminar. Requirements: five short papers, group paper and project, class participa-
tion.
Prerequisites: Economics 110 and 120; Political Science 201 or 203 and 202 or 204, or equivalent; upper-level
electives in International and Comparative Political Economy (see list above). Enrollment limit: 20 (expected:
10-20). Preference given to Political Economy majors. Required in the Political Economy major but open to
non-majors.
Hour: 11:00-12:15 MWF MEARDON and PAUL
POEC 402(S) Political Economy of Public Policy Issues
The core of this course consists of analyses by student study groups of current issues of public policy. The student
groups investigate the interacting political and economic aspects of an issue, do extensive reading, conduct inter-
views in Washington (during spring recess) with public and private officials, write a major report on their find-
ings and recommendations, and defend it orally in a public session.
Students visit Washington, D.C. Sunday night through Wednesday of the first week of spring vacation to conduct
interviews relating to their group projects. This is a course requirement.
Format: seminar with student presentations.
Prerequisites: Economics 253 or 255; satisfaction of the U.S. Political Economy and Public Policy course re-
quirement (see list of major requirements above).
Required in the major and open only to Political Economy majors.

Politics is most fundamentally about forging and maintaining community, about how we manage to
craft a common destiny guided by shared values. Communities need a way to reconcile conflicts of interest
among their members and to determine their group interest; they need to allocate power and to determine
its just uses. Power may be used wisely or foolishly, rightly or cruelly, but it is always there; it cannot be
wished away. Political science attends to the ways that social power is grasped, maintained, challenged, or
justified. The contests over power and the values that it should be used to further give politics its drama and
pathos. The effort to understand politics aims not only to describe and explain, but also to improve political
life.
The Political Science major is structured to allow students either to participate in the established ways of
studying politics or to develop their own foci. To this end, the department offers two routes to completing
the major, each requiring nine courses. We invite students either to organize their major through the sub-
fields that structure the discipline of political science (American politics, international relations, political
theory, and comparative politics), or to develop individual concentrations reflecting their particular inter-
ests, regardless of subfields.
MAJOR
SUBFIELD CONCENTRATION ROUTE: Upon declaring a major, students choose one subfield:
American politics, international relations, political theory, or comparative politics. The subfield concentra-
tion draws at least four (4) of the nine courses from one subfield including the appropriate core course from
201-204, two electives of the student's choice at the 200 or 300 level and the senior seminar (or an individ-
ual project) in the student's subfield. Students selecting political theory as their subfield concentration must
take Political Science 231 or Political Science 232 as one of their four subfield courses, in addition to taking
Political Science 203 and prior to taking Political Science 430. (A degree with honors in Political Science
requires enrollment in the year-long senior thesis seminar, which does not count toward the nine (9) major
requirements.) With permission of the department chair, students may take a senior seminar in a different
subfield, providing they take a third elective in the subfield of concentration. In addition, students must take
courses in two subfields outside the subfield of concentration to satisfy the breadth requirement (all courses
at the 100 level and all methods courses also count toward the breadth requirement). The faculty advisor
and the department chair must approve the student plan.
INDIVIDUAL CONCENTRATION ROUTE: Alternatively, students may devise a concentration of their
own. In this event, the student prepares a curricular plan in consultation with a faculty advisor, explaining
the nature of the concentration and the courses the student will take. The individual concentration also
requires nine (9) courses, with at least five (5) thematically linked courses constituting the concentration.
Political Science
­ 264 ­
Of these five courses, four are electives at the 200 or 300 level, including one from 201-204, and one is a
senior seminar or individual project. In addition, students pursuing an individual concentration must take at
least two other courses that illustrate breadth in political science. To complete the requirement, the student
has his or her choice of any two other courses within the Political Science Department. The faculty advisor
and the department chair must approve the student plan.
ADVISEMENT
When a student chooses to major in Political Science (usually at the end of the sophomore year), he or
she may register with any Political Science faculty member at the designated time and places. The register-
ing faculty member will ask for preferences for a permanent faculty advisor and will assist undecided stu-
dents in finding an advisor. In all cases, students will be paired by the end of the sophomore year with an
advisor who will continue with them through graduation.
COURSE NUMBERING
The course numbering used by the Political Science Department reflects the format and specialization of
a course The 100-level courses are designed to address political topics from multiple subfield perspectives.
The 200-level courses are divided between our core courses and our electives. The core courses, numbered
from 201-204, serve as introductions both to the substance of the politics and the subfields organizing the
study of politics. The introductory subfield course must be completed before the senior year. The 200-level
elective courses delve into political processes, problems and philosophies. 100-level and 200-level courses
have no prerequisites. 300-level courses are more specialized and require prerequisites. 400-level courses
are senior seminars offered for students in the major; senior seminars also are open to juniors and to non-
majors if space permits.
WINTER STUDY PROJECT
The department welcomes relevant WSP 99 proposals that can make important contributions to the stu-
dent's understanding of public affairs and politics. Majors, seniors, and students without previous WSP 99
experience have preference.
THE JUNIOR YEAR ABROAD
A major in Political Science can be readily and usefully combined with study in a foreign country. No
more than one course taken per semester abroad in a program approved by the College may be counted
toward the requirements for a degree in Political Science.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE
The Political Science Department grants honors to candidates who, (1) complete the Senior Seminar, (2)
receive at least a grade of 3.50 on a Senior Thesis (493-W31-494), and (3) have a minimum GPA of 3.5 in
Political Science.
To become a candidate for honors the student must (1) apply in the second semester of the junior year,
(2) submit a research proposal acceptable to the department's honors committee and for which an ap-
propriate advisor is available, and (3) have a minimum GPA of 3.5 in Political Science for the first six
semesters. (Political Science 493-W31-494 DO NOT count toward the total of nine required of all majors.)
ADVANCED STUDY IN AMERICAN POLITICS
The Department of Political Science provides the opportunity for an unusually gifted student to engage
in an entire year's advanced research in American politics under singularly favorable conditions. Sup-
ported by income derived from an endowment fund, the student, designated the Sentinels of the Republic
Scholar (after the name of the fund), receives a substantial research stipend to cover costs associated with
the proposed project.
This unique research course (Political Science 481-W33-482) is designed to encourage the pursuit of
excellence among the most talented Williams students of Political Science. Admission to it is awarded to
the most distinguished candidate on the basis of demonstrated capacity for outstanding work and of the
project's promise for creative contributions to the understanding of American politics, political institutions
and thought.
PSCI 100(F) Asia and the World (Same as Asian Studies 201 and International Studies 101)*
Asia looms large in contemporary world politics: Japan is gradually assuming an expanded regional national
security role; The People's Republic of China is emerging as a multifaceted Great Power; India is challenged by
rising ethno-nationalism. This course will explore both the historical background and current dynamics of politi-
cal and economic issues in these three countries, drawing on themes of imperialism, nationalism, and globaliza-
tion. It is an introductory class and, therefore, no prior coursework in political science or Asian studies is neces-
sary.

PSCI 120(S) America and the World After September 11
The terrorist attacks of September 11 and the war in Afghanistan raised fundamental questions about the past and
future course of American foreign policy. While virtually no one defended the terrorist attacks, many academics
argued that the root causes of September 11th were to be found in the flaws of the American approach to the
world. In this view, America is an arrogant, unilateralist country that ignores the views and perspectives of the
rest of the world community, relies far too much on its overwhelming military power, and often acts against its
Political Science

ideals and values by supporting repressive and unpopular regimes. This course has three primary objectives.
First, we will assess important critiques of contemporary American foreign policy from both the left and right of
the political spectrum. Second, we will examine the historical and intellectual background of both supporters and
critics of American foreign policy in the post Vietnam War era. Third, in the aftermath of September 11 we will
attempt to answer the most important question of all for any analysis of American foreign policy: What is to be
done? While current issues of American foreign policy will be addressed in this class, potential students should
note that its primary focus is not on the technical/military elements of combating terrorism.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: assignments will include weekly response papers, two 5- to 7-page

PSCI 201(F,S) Power, Politics, and Democracy in America
Begun as an experiment over 200 years ago, the United States has grown into a polity that is simultaneously
praised and condemned, critiqued and mythologized, modeled by others and remodeled itself. This course intro-
duces students to the dynamics and tensions that have animated the American political order and that have nur-
tured these conflicting assessments. Topics include the founding of the American system and the primary docu-
ments (the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the Federalist Papers), the primary institutions of
national government then and now (Congress, the Presidency, and the Supreme Court) and the politics of policy-
making in the United States. We study structures, processes, key events, and primary actors that have shaped
American political development. In investigating these topics, we explore questions such as these: How is power
allocated? What produces political change? Is there is a trade-off between democratic accountability and effec-
tive governance? How are tensions between liberty and equality resolved? Do the institutions produce good poli-
cies, and how do we define what is good?

PSCI 202(F,S) World Politics: An Introduction to International Relations
International politics differs from domestic politics in the absence of centralized, legitimate institutions. Anarchy
characterizes the world of sovereign states--there is no world government, nor agreement that one is desirable or
even possible. This lack of a common authority means that any dispute among countries is up to the countries
themselves to settle, by negotiating, appealing to shared norms, or using force. For this reason, while internation-
al relations involves many of the same topics that consume domestic politics--ethnic antagonisms, spending on
aid, war, national identity, inequality, weapons manufacture, finance, loans, pollution, migration--it shares few
of the same processes for dealing with them. This course covers problems central to international relations. It
considers the importance that this radical decentralization has for achieving values we hold, and examines pro-
cesses that might undermine or support the anarchical system in which we live.
Format: lecture. Requirements: midterm, a final exam, reading response papers, and class participation.

PSCI 203(F,S) Introduction to Political Theory
Political theory treats the fundamental political question of how we ought to live together. Theorists through the
ages have grappled with this problem, variously emphasizing an aspect of this question that was especially press-
ing during their own time, such as extent and limits of state authority over individuals, or the nature of justice, or
legitimate authority, or the true implications of democratic equality. The study of political theory is an intellectual
and textual exercise. But what is its role in the contemporary study and practice of politics? Why and how should
we, today, read historical texts of political theory? What sort of knowledge does political theory yield? What do
political theorists hope to accomplish through theoretical inquiry into political concepts and formations? This
course introduces the study of political theory by surveying some of its most significant controversies. Drawing
on both contemporary and classical sources, we will examine the tasks of political theory in relation to such
themes as justice, power, authority, obligation, freedom, action, and violence. Some of the authors we may read
include Plato, Aristotle, Machiavelli, Hobbes, Rousseau, Hegel, Marx, Arendt, Adorno, Rawls, and Foucault.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: two or three papers, final exam.

PSCI 204(F) Introduction to Comparative Politics
People around the world are all like Americans--or at least they all want to be like Americans, right? Fat chance!
People in different countries not only have different resources, but also different experiences, institutions, and
values. The very foundations of political life--ideas about belonging, the fair division of social roles, about fami-
ly and religion, authority, law-- are deeply bound up with culture and history. Comparative politics seeks to
account for the fantastic variety of political life around the globe. Why were there so many dictators in Latin
America? Does oil or diamond wealth inexorably lead to corruption or dictatorship? Why is Canada so darned
peaceful? How come some revolutionary governments end up stable and powerful (the US, Cuba) whereas oth-
ers go berzerk and fall apart (France, Cambodia)? This class grounds students in the fundamental conceptual
categories used in comparative political analysis, including nationalism, the state, political culture, institutional-
ism, religion and politics, constitutionalism, and political economy.
Format: discussion/lecture. Requirements: two papers and a final exam.
No prerequisites.Enrollment limit: 35 per section (expected: 20 per section). This is an introductory course, open

PSCI 205(S) Leaders in Contemporary Conservative Thought (Same as Leadership Studies 205)

Conservative thinkers claim to be leading an intellectual transformation away from the tired nostrums of liberal-
ism. They see themselves as original, dynamic, serious. This course will read leading conservative political
thinkers with a view to identifying their central tenets, both negative and positive. What is it that they oppose and
what is it that they support? What, if anything, defines contemporary conservative thinking? Is it acoherent body
of thought, a doctrine, or a collection of disparate and conflicting thinkers? What is the relationship of thinkers
who emphasize the market, order, and traditional values?

PSCI 207(F) Political Elections
Elections in American politics are dynamic events in which many different groups struggle to gain control of
political institutions at the local, state, and federal levels. During the campaigns, candidates and their supporters
move across the land, appearing on television and radio, and through the printed press. Simultaneously, various
organizations and interest groups attempt to gain influence with the candidates and with public opinion by raising
money, making endorsements, running political appeals in the various media, and supplying activists to work for
the candidates they favor. This course explores the factors that shape the outcome of political elections in Ameri-
ca. Among the factors we will consider are the state of the economy, international events, the role of political
parties at the state and national levels, the current partisan balance, ideology, media, special interests, money,
candidates, the "hot" issues of the moment and long enduring issues, campaign debates, and campaign polling
and public opinion. We will consider in detail the 2006 national mid-term elections both for Federal office (Presi-
dent, Senate and House) and for state offices (governors, state legislators).

presidency, for example) shape political decision-making within Congress? How is Congress organized and how
Political Science

PSCI 216(F) Constitutional Law I: Structures of Power
Constitutional Law I focuses on the legal and political regime established by the U.S. Constitution. We concen-
trate on two themes at the core of American constitutionalism: (1) the respective powers of, and interaction
among, the federal government's three branches ("separation of powers"); and (2) the intersections and bound-
aries of federal and state authority ("federalism"). Specific topics include the Supreme Court's power to overturn
actions by political agents; Congress's authority to make laws governing matters not mentioned in the Constitu-
tion; Congress's power to strip the courts of authority to decide certain issues; states' power to resist the decrees
of federal courts; the president's emergency powers; and war-making authority of both the president and Con-
gress. Most of the reading consists of Supreme Court opinions, but some reading and much discussion will ad-
dress historical context. Recurring issues include the extent to which the Court does and should heed the framers'
intent; the extent to which the Court does and should take into account public opinion and other political consid-
erations; and the significance of John Marshall's famous but somewhat cryptic admonition: "we must never for-
get that it is a constitution we are expounding."

PSCI 217(S) Constitutional Law II: Rights
Constitutional Law II explores constraints imposed on governmental power by a system of civil rights. Areas
examined include equal protection, due process, freedom of speech and religion. Within these and other broad
doctrines, countless specific controversies arise. Those we address include abortion, same-sex marriage, affirma-
tive action, flag-burning, and the death penalty. Much of the reading consists of Supreme Court cases, but we will
also pay close attention to the broader context surrounding these cases. A recurring question is the relevance of
the Court's undemocratic nature. Should the Court see itself as a tribune of the powerless, which must restrain the
political branches or, alternatively, should it generally defer to the people's elected representatives? A closely
related question involves the extent to which the Court should confine the rights it protects to those specifically
listed in the Constitution. Finally, to what extent do and should judges consult their moral or even political views,
as opposed to undertaking a more objective, apolitical or distinctly "judicial" analysis, in reaching decisions?

PSCI 223(S) International Law
International law embodies the rules that govern the society of states. It spells out who can be a state and how to
become one, what states can do, what they cannot do, and who can punish transgressions; it also determines the
status of other actors, like international organizations, heads of state, refugees, transnational religious institutions
and multinational corporations. International law is like domestic law, with one difference: the same group that
makes the law enforces it. In other respects it is the same: it protects the status quo, including the distribution of
power among its members; it spells out legitimate and illegitimate ways of resolving conflicts of interest; it is
biased toward the powerful; it tells its members how to act to coordinate their interests and minimize direct con-
flict; some of it is laughable and purely aspirational, some of it necessary for survival. And like domestic law, it is
enforced only some of the time, and then against the weak more than the strong. Yet law is still where we look
first for justice. This course will examine the historical bases of contemporary international law, its development
since World War II in the context of the Holocaust and decolonization, and current dilemmas in its practice.

that end, we begin with an overview of the recent history of globalization, setting the stage for the rest of the
course by answering the important question "How did we get here?" Then we progress to the empirical core of
the course, examining global trade, global finance and development. Along the way we focus on key issues of
theoretical and current political interest, including free trade and its myriad effects, the World Trade Organization,
global money politics, debt relief and financial crisis. We conclude the course with a close look at the potentially
dangerous imbalances of the global political economy.

PSCI 230(S) American Political Thought
Although it is often believed that American political philosophy is wholly liberal, deep currents in American
political thought are antagonistic to traditional liberal understandings. Even the Declaration itself--often taken to
be the greatest pronouncement of liberal principles--speaks to values and concepts that do not sit easily along-
side liberalism. Indeed, American political thought might be read as a perpetual debate about how best to order
antagonistic values and concepts: nature and convention, liberty and equality, liberalism and democracy, individ-
ualism and community, universalism and patriotism. This course focuses on these tensions, taking up American
political thought from before the Founding to the present. We will examine the political thought of statesmen
(such as Jefferson, Hamilton, Madison, Lincoln and Woodrow Wilson), of "outsider" leaders (like Frederick
Douglass and Elizabeth Cady Stanton), and of intellectual leaders (like Mark Twain), moving to contemporary
intellectuals and political thinkers, seeing how these figures have wrestled with and fostered the tensions within
American political thought.

The core activity of this seminar is the careful reading and sustained discussion of selected works by Plato and

theoretical point of view, selections from the Hebrew Bible and New Testament. Among the questions that we
will address: What is justice? How can it be known and pursued? How is political power generated and exer-
cised? What are the social and ethical prerequisites--and consequences--of democracy? Must the freedom or
fulfillment of some people require the subordination of others? Does freedom require leading (or avoiding) a
political life? What does it mean to be "philosophical" or to think "theoretically" about politics? Although we
will attempt to engage the works on their own terms, we will also ask how the vast differences between the
ancient world and our own undercut or enhance the texts' ability to illuminate the dilemmas of political life for
us.

mocracy, equality, and freedom to questions about the relation between the modern state and capitalism, the
emergence of the individual, and various challenges to traditional and religious authority. We will examine how
women, non-Europeans, and the poor figure in these texts, even (or, perhaps,especially) when they do not explic-
itly appear. Through our course of study, we will reflect upon what makes these texts powerful and enduring

The People's Republic of China presents us with two grand political narratives: socialism and democracy. In the
Maoist era, a distinctive understanding of socialism, which claimed to be a more genuine democracy, brought
hope and, ultimately, tragedy to hundreds of millions of people. In the post-Mao era, Chinese politics has been
driven by the need to redefine socialism in the wake of the world-historic calamities of the Great Leap Forward
and the Cultural Revolution and, more recently, the end of the Cold War. The state cannot simply give up the
socialist myth because without it the rationale for Communist Party hegemony evaporates. But China's rulers
cannot avoid political reform, both ideological and institutional, because to do so heightens the legitimacy crisis
born of Maoist failures. Within this context has emerged the contemporary Chinese democracy movement
which, in all of its complexity, looks to both socialist discourse and Western practice to create a new politics that
checks tyrannical abuses of state power and engenders a civil society. What is Chinese democracy now? What
are its prospects and what is its relationship to the ideas of socialism?

theirs. This course examines the politics and policies of contemporary Japan. We survey the core politi-
cal institutions of the postwar era, examine patterns of political interaction, and investigate current
policy debates. The 1990s were marked by numerous political changes at various levels in Japan, includ-
ing the introduction of a new electoral system, a shift from one-party rule to coalition government rule,
bureaucratic breakdown, and extreme volatility in economic policy outcomes. This course investigates
the significance of these changes and identifies enduring patterns. No prior knowledge of the broader
theoretical literature is assumed or expected, however.

PSCI 254(F) Democracy in Comparative Perspective
This course deals with aspects of democracy and democratization, beginning with the meaning of democracy.
Almost every significant political movement in the world purports to be democratic, but the popularity of de-
mocracy says little about what it is and is not. Thus, the first objective of the course is to weigh competing defini-
tions. In particular, democracy increasingly is being viewed in procedural terms: democratic societies make deci-
sions in particular kinds of ways, regardless of the substance of decisions. While this view has deep roots in
democratic theory and practice, it has competed historically with more substantive definitions of democracy,
which emphasize outcomes and, particularly, progress towards equality of outcomes. This course will examine
this debate and consider the reasons why procedural definitions currently are ascendant. Then the course consid-
ers what it means to consider democracy to be universal. What does it mean to ditch the "preconditions" that
formerly were considered to be necessary prior to the making of democratic government and to conceive of
democracy as a global force? Does that mean that democracy is available to all societies or does that mean that
the expansion of capital globally is being called "democracy?" To get at the stakes in this question, the course will
consider in depth the impact of the "third wave" of democratization on Latin America and Africa. What pro-
cesses are being designated as "democratic," why do they coincide with high levels of socio-economic inequali-
ty, and what is the impulse behind democratization?

PSCI 255(S) Democracy and Social Conflict in Developing Countries (W)
Can democracy survive in developing countries? Can development occur under democratic auspices? Tradition-
ally, comparative political scientists believed that introducing competitive politics into a poor society would sim-
ply heighten social conflict, which would prevent development from occurring and in turn undermine democra-
cy. While we are much more optimistic today that democracy can take root in poor societies, it is still not clear if
development can occur under democratic conditions. This course will begin with a review of the debates on this
question and then focus on numerous case studies of democratic experiences in the Third World, including na-
tions where democracy clearly failed and was overthrown. Our purpose is to understand whether and how these
negative consequences of democracy can be avoided.

PSCI 260T(S) Realism in Politics (W)
Realism in politics is both an approach to international relations and a political sensibility. As a sensibility, it
values limits, questions good intentions, and worries about grand ambitions. It takes the basic contours of human
behavior as given and beyond the control of actors to alter, perhaps giving rise to a kind of passivity in response.
The realist sensibility tends to doubt the efficacy of humanaction, to believe that attempts to improve the terms of
human interaction not only are doomed to fail but also are likely to make things worse. Realists are not necessari-
ly conservative--a few are radical--but they have learned much from conservatives. By temperament, they are
not confident of the capacities of human agencies.
Realism is also a distinct approach to the conduct and study of international relations. Realists have basic ten-
ets--states are primary actors and operate to increase their relative power in a world in which anarchy puts a
premium on self-help--that guide their thinking about international relations, but realism in international rela-
tions also highlights the underlying politics of realists. We will consider the realist emphasis on power, the status
of morality, the relationship between power and morality, what critics of realists have to say about the realist
treatment of these issues, and how realism in international relations connects with realism as a political sensibil-
ity.

PSCI 262(S) America and the Cold War
This course examines the rise and fall of the Cold War, focusing on four central issues. First, why did America
and the Soviet Union become bitter rivals shortly after the defeat of Nazi Germany? Second, was one side pri-
marily responsible for the length and intensity of the Cold War in Europe? Third, how did the Cold War in Eu-
Political Science
­ 271 ­
rope lead to events in other areas of the world, such as Cuba and Vietnam? Finally, could the Cold War have been
ended long before the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989? Political scientists and historians continue to argue
vigorously about the answers to all these questions. We examine both traditional and revisionist explanations of
the Cold War, as well as the new findings that have emerged from the partial opening of Soviet and Eastern
European archives. The final section of the course examines how scholarly interpretations of the Cold War con-
tinue to influence how policymakers approach contemporary issues in American foreign policy.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: one medium length paper, an in-class midterm and final exam, and a

PSCI 265(F) The International Politics of East Asia*
This course examines the political, economic, and cultural determinants of conflict and cooperation in East Asia.
Throughout the semester, we will examine three distinct but inter-related aspects of international relations in East
Asia: Security, economy, and culture by using some core concepts and theoretical arguments widely accepted in
the study of international relations. We will engage some of the central questions and issues in the current debate
on East Asia. Do East Asian countries seek for security and prosperity in a way fundamentally different from the
Western system? Is there a single best way to maintain regional order and cooperation across regions? Will a
strong China inevitably claim its traditional place under the Sun? Will Japan continue to live as a nation with
enormous economic power but no military means? What is the choice for South Korea between security alliance
with the United States and national reconciliation with the North? Will North Korea survive? What should be
done to dissuade the totalitarian regime in North Korea from acquiring nuclear capabilities and lead it to different
paths toward national survival? By the end of the semester, you will gain both a general perspective and substan-
tive knowledge on East Asia.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: midterm exam, team debate, take-home final exam, class participa-

PSCI 268(F) U.S. and the Two Koreas*
As the staging-ground for the collision between the great powers, the Korean peninsula has been a pivotal geo-
political area in modern history. Since the creation of a diplomatic relationship with the Korean kingdom in 1882,
the United States has been long and deeply involved in the historical changes that influenced the fate of Korea as
a country. With the end of the Cold War and the new threat of international terrorism, the US involvement in the
foreign policy decisions of the Korean peninsula is far more critical today than in the past. The main goal of this
course is to introduce students to the complexities of US relations with both North and South Korea. This will
involve surveying the historical background, and examining the key issues and challenges the countries face
today. Is the US responsible for the division of Korea and the delayed democratization in South Korea? Can the
US-South Korean military alliance survive another fifty years? Despite military threats from the North, why
have South Koreans become increasingly critical of US policy? Is "regime change" the best way for the US to
resolve the North Korean nuclear crisis and make the country safer from terrorism? Using the perspectives of the
US and the two Koreas, this course explores these topics to gauge the undercurrents that affect US-Korean rela-
tions.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: leading a class discussion, five short papers, class participation, final
take-home exam.

PSCI 269(S) International Movements and Human Rights
This course examines the development of international human rights from a historical perspective. Beginning
with the transatlantic movement to abolish slavery in the 18th century, we will explore several central questions
and enduring debates concerning the spread of human rights over the last three centuries. Are human rights uni-
versal? How important are individual actors and ideals in altering conceptions of human rights? Can international
human rights ever be reconciled with the principle of state sovereignty? What conditions lead to the contraction
or expansion of international human rights? Why have grave abuses of human rights around the world persisted
despite the rise of international institutions and NGO's in the 20th century? What lessons from the history of the
international movement for greater human rights remain relevant for scholars and activists today?

PSCI 277(S) Political Islam*
The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, focused world attention on political Islam. Political movements de-
fined in terms of Islam have been an important and growing force in the politics of the Middle East and beyond
for several decades, however. Islamic politics takes many forms beyond al -Qaeda: the Iranian revolution, the
domestic violence after canceled elections in Algeria, the violence as well as civil society in Egypt, the electoral
successes in Jordan, Lebanon and Yemen, the violent struggles against Israel in Lebanon and Palestine, the politi-
cization of Muslim immigrant communities in Europe and America, the social arguments over women adopting
the veil and Islamic education, theoretical debates about the compatibility of Islam with democracy, the rise of
new media forms, and much, much more. This course explores many of the difficult questions surrounding the
rise of Islamic politics in a wide range of political contexts. What is political Islam? Why, how, and to what extent
has it succeeded? What are its goals? Is it inherently violent, anti -Western, or hostile to modernity, as many
claim, or is it potentially progressive, democratic, and moderate? How have different states dealt with the chal-
lenge--and does their repression explain the turn to violence? What is the meaning of jihad? How have other
Islamists responded to the violent terrorism of al -Qaeda? Can Islam and the West peacefully co -exist, or is the
war on terror leading towards an inexorable clash of civilizations?

PSCI 310(F) Political Psychology (Same as Psychology 345)
Political psychology studies the central foundation of politics. Most theories of politics and political regimes be-
gin with a claim about the inherent qualities of being human. For example, many political philosophers begin
their political programs with foundational claims about "human nature." These claims are then used to support
their vision of politics. Claims about progress presume that human nature will be improved with the right politi-
cal program. Another example, the enlightenment held that rationality would be strengthened by progress, and
thereby make democracy more viable. Those who defend authoritarian regimes of all sorts often do so by pro-
claiming that the general public is incapable of self-rule and must accept rule by their betters. Many of these
arguments turn on how rational people are when they engage in political decision-making and in their capacity
and willingness to pursue justice for all. We explore what psychology tells us about people as political citizens
and leaders. Political psychology explores how people understand and act in and on the world around them, and
more specifically, when people attend to politics and how people make political judgments. The course pays
special attention to the powerful, but surprising, multiple roles that emotions play in all aspects of politics.

1965, and one prime illustration of the debate over a policy consensus in the context of fragmentation represented
by federalism, separation of powers, and racial and ethnic diversity in the polity. The course selects from a range
of contemporary policy areas for comparison, including abortion rights, environmental protection, educational
equity, immigration, regulation of business, and public support for the arts.

September 11 brought a new appreciation of the importance of culture, identity, religion, and ideas in world poli-
tics. The rise of political Islam and the American-led war on terror sharply focused the attention of International
Relations on these long-neglected issues. This course takes a critical look at culture and identity in world politics,
using avariety of methods and cases to explore their real significance. Is the "war on terror" really about religion?
Are violent ethnic conflicts and genocides really about identity? Do identity politics make conflicts more difficult
to resolve? Is anti-Americanism becoming a new form of global identity politics which challenges American
hegemony? Or is globalization creating a common, market-centered global identity? Does mass media promote
identity conflicts or help to overcome cultural differences? As a CRAAS course, the seminar will explicitly focus
on the methods of critical social science inquiry, and on the process of research design.

Two converging realities create a political and intellectual problem: an evolving recognition of the vitality of
private sector supported community organization work; and the challenge that such organizations may have to
assume a larger role due to reductions in public agency support and declining participation among the poor and
racial minorities. In the United States these agencies--essentially NGOs--play important roles in communities
and movements, often modeling the very programs adopted by the government. Some, like the Highlander Cen-
ter, have near-mythical status in our memories about what it means to struggle for social change; others, includ-
ing HARYOU, were critical in structuring thought about anti-poverty strategies. In recent years some like Teach
for America have plunged into the thick of the effort to keep public education a viable option. This tutorial ex-
amines the role of non-profits and social justice work in the United States focusing on the non-profit as a type,
governance and staffing, fund-raising and persecution. The tutorial examines research and writing on the non-
profit in U.S. social justice advocacy as well as focuses on specific cases.

Critical theory contends that the role of the theorist is to critique and expose. It charges that scientific and philo-

inequities. This course explores the origins, development, and impact of the ideas of the major critical theorists,
those of the Frankfurt School, with particular emphasis on the writings of Max Horkheimer, Theodor W. Ador-
no, Herbert Marcuse, and Walter Benjamin. We will begin with background readings from Kant, Hegel, and
Marx to trace the philosophical touchstones for the idea of critical theory and then proceed to address the various
ways in which the Frankfurt School theorists attempt to integrate various aspects of the thought of Nietzsche,
Weber, and Freud into the project of formulating a critical theory of society. We will consider a range of topics,
Political Science

including the nature of critical theory, political sociology and the critique of liberalism, mass culture and the fate
of art, psychoanalysis, pessimism and despair, the philosophy of history, and the politics of liberation. We will

in social and political thought.

The futures of Mexico and the United States are now bound up more closely than ever. Yet Mexico enters this
future with a very different past and a distinctive political system. The first half of this course is historical, con-
centrating on the slow emergence of the Mexican national state and a national consciousness. Along the way we
delve into Mexican art, cuisine, religious expression, music, literature, and film. The second half considers the
fitful and uneven emergence of a new political order in Mexico, beginning with an examination of why the long-
dominant PRI regime has fallen apart. It then looks at new developments in several areas: migration and U.S.
immigration policy; the border; the role of the state; and the Chiapas rebellion and indigenous autonomy. We end
the course by returning to some of the issues of the first half, asking what it means to be both Mexican and
"modern," the economic results of NAFTA, what it feels like to live in "Amexica," and what kind of politics we
might expect to arise there.

PSCI 347(S) Korea's Democratization (W)*
Various themes purport to explain democratization and its effects. This seminar uses the politics of the Korean
Peninsula as a testing-ground for these contending theories. Before the 1997 Asian financial crisis, South Korea
was widely regarded as among the leaders of the so-called "third wave of democracy." It attained a rare but
exemplary success, as it achieved both spectacular economic growth and political liberalization. Yet recently
there have been an increasing number of intellectual and political debates both inside and outside the country on
whether the country can cope with the consequences of further political and economic "maturation." As we tack
back and forth between democratization theories and the Korean experience, we will pursue the following topics:
national identity, the unabated tension between ethnic conceptualization and civic order, civil society before and
after the anti-authoritarian movement, the rise and fall of the minjung ideology, developmental state vs. crony
capitalism, women and male-oriented politics, nationalist, anti-American, and pro-North Korean youth in Korea,

PSCI 410(S) Seminar in American Politics
The focal point of this research seminar will be on the state of American democracy early in its third century of
existence. Two frameworks provide a basis for judging the state of American politics: first, we begin with a
comparison of politics at the founding of the Republic with the state of politics in our own time. This allows us to
say whether it is the same, or different, and if different, whether for better or worse. Second, each seminar partici-
pant will engage in research on a particular aspect of American politics. Among the topics that will be considered
are: the competing conceptions of democracy; the appropriate roles of the various institutions of politics (the
Political Science
­ 275 ­
press, political parties, local, state, and national politics); and, the social and economic systems and their diverse
effects. Combined, these two elements will enable the members of the seminar to engage in a discussion of how
well the American political system is doing.

PSCI 420T(F) Law and Rights in International Politics
The subject of law and rights in international politics raises fundamental questions about the nature of the interna-

rights independent of the government. It also raises dramatic and salient questions about how these concepts get
used to increase or wrest power--how, for example, a claim to human rights might affect a regime, or why ad-
mitting a policy of torture seems difficult when its consequences are so minimal. It has room for philosophy and
for politics. We will start examining these questions by drawing on classic international relations theory, and then
complicate this theory as we move through the semester.

PSCI 420(S) Senior Seminar in International Relations: American Hegemony and the Future of the
International System (W)
Since the time of Thucydides, world politics has often been a story of several great powers competing for power,
wealth, and security. The collapse and dissolution of the Soviet Union, however, left the United States in a posi-
tion of dominance that has no parallel in history. This course examines how international relations theorists and
American policymakers have grappled with the dilemmas and opportunities of global hegemony since 1989,
with a particular focus on the challenges that have emerged in the aftermath of September 11. Will other powers,
such as China or a united Europe, inevitably challenge American dominance? Should America actively seek to
promote its ideas and values throughout the world? Does a hegemon have unique and special responsibilities for
advancing international justice? What kind of grand strategy should the United States pursue, both now and in
the future? Why does so much of the world seem to resent American hegemony?

PSCI 430(S) What Should Political Theory Be Now?
Why be theoretical? Toward what end and with what means? In this course we will consider how--and wheth-
er--people can usefully theorize about political life in this era. In pursuit of these questions, we will examine
some exemplary works in recent and contemporary theory. Our discussions will pay attention to the ways of
thinking and writing that these works embody, asking whether these are ways we should pursue ourselves. But
this is not a course on "method," and our readings will enable us to confront some of the most controversial
arguments and pressing substantive problems in contemporary political and social thought. We will take up such
topics as democracy and globalization, the sources and workings of political evil, the nature of political power,
justice and the distribution of resources, and problems of race, class, gender, and sexuality in contemporary
American life. Readings will be drawn from such authors as Agamben, Arendt, Butler, Cavell, Cohen, Connolly,

Political Theory Subfield
Hour: 1:10-3:50 T M. REINHARDT
PSCI 481(F)-W33-482(S) Advanced Study in American Politics
A year of independent study under the direction of the Political Science faculty, to be awarded to the most distin-
guished candidate based upon competitive admissions. The candidate, designated the Sentinels of the Republic
Scholar, receives a research stipend to cover costs associated with the proposed project. The Sentinels Scholar
may submit her/his essay for consideration for honors in Political Science.
Admission is awarded on the basis of demonstrated capacity for distinguished work and on the proposal's prom-
ise for creative contributions to the understanding of topics on the federal system of government. Anyone with a
prospective proposal should contact the department chair for guidance.
PSCI 493(F)-W31-494(S) Senior Thesis
The senior major, having applied for and been accepted into the honors program during the second semester of
the junior year, will devote the senior year to researching and writing a substantial and original work of scholar-
ship, under the supervision of a faculty mentor to be assigned by the department. The final work will be sub-
mitted for evaluation by a committee made up of the faculty supervisor and two additional readers to be chosen
by the department, in consultation with the supervisor. Thesis writers will not only work with their advisors but
will participate in a weekly honors seminar supervised by a faculty member in political science. The seminar
(which is one component of the 493-W31-494 designation and not a separate course) will provide a focused
forum for the exchange of ideas among the honors students, who will regularly circulate sections of their theses-
in-progress for peer review and critique. The faculty seminar leader's primary role is one of coordination and
guidance.

MAJOR
For the degree in Psychology, students must complete a minimum of nine courses as outlined
below:
1) Psychology 101 Introductory Psychology
2) Psychology 201 Experimentation and Statistics
3) Three 200-level courses, with at least one from each of the following groups.
Group A Psychology 212 Neuroscience
Psychology 221 Cognitive Psychology*
Psychology 222 Cognitive Science*
Group B Psychology 232 Developmental Psychology
Psychology 242 Social Psychology
Psychology 252 Psychological Disorders
Psychology 272 Psychology of Education
*Either Psychology 221 or 222, but not both, can count towards the three required 200-level
courses.
Psychology

4) Three 300-level courses from at least two of the areas listed below:
Area 1: Behavioral Neuroscience (courses with middle digit 1)
Area 2: Cognitive Psychology (courses with middle digit 2)
Area 3: Developmental Psychology (courses with middle digit 3)
Area 4: Social Psychology (courses with middle digit 4)
Area 5: Clinical Psychology (courses with middle digit 5)
Area 7: Educational Psychology (courses with middle digit 7)
At least one of these courses must be from among those carrying the format designation Empirical
Lab Course.
5) Psychology 401 Perspectives on Psychological Issues
Students who place out of Psychology 101 are still required to take nine courses to complete the major.
The department recommends that students take Psychology 201 in their sophomore year. The depart-
ment requires that 201 be completed by the end of the junior year.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN PSYCHOLOGY
Students who are candidates for honors need take only two 300-level courses from two different areas,
but they must enroll in Psychology 493-W31-494 and write a thesis based on original empirical work.
Presentation of a thesis, however, should not be interpreted as a guarantee of a degree with honors. Guide-
lines for pursuing the degree with honors are available from the department.
STUDY ABROAD
With some advance planning, studying abroad (especially for one semester) can easily be worked into
the psychology major. To facilitate this, we recommend that students:
1) meet with the Department Chair as soon as they decide that they are interested in studying abroad
2) take Psychology 201 (Experimentation and Statistics) in the sophomore year
3) think ahead to the 300-level courses they are interested in taking so that they can fulfill the 200-level
prerequisites before they go away or, if possible, while they are away. In our experience, study abroad
programs in the following places are most likely to offer psychology courses: England, Ireland, Scot-
land, Spain, Australia, New Zealand, Hawaii, and Scandinavia. Students should procure the descrip-
tions of the psychology courses they are considering taking and bring them to their meeting with the
Chair.
There are some costs to studying away, particularly for the year. This limits students' opportunities to
choose the particular 300-level courses they would like to take and they must sometimes settle for those
that are open, those which happen to be offered, or those for which they have the prerequisites, once they
return in their senior year. Many students who are keen on psychology begin doing research with profes-
sors during their junior year, and for some this leads to an honors thesis in the senior year, summer research,
etc. If you are going away for the entire year and do not make such connections with a professor ahead of
time (i.e., before you go), you may lose out on some of these opportunities to deepen your involvement in
the major on campus. On the other hand, studying abroad can be an invaluable learning experience, so you
need to think carefully, in consultation with your advisor and/or the Department Chair, about the costs and
benefits of it. Very occasionally, a student who just begins taking psychology courses late in the sophomore
year and wishes to go abroad for the year finds that he/she is not able to do both, or is restricted in the
choice of study-abroad programs.

PSYC 271(S) Processes of Teaching and Learning
There is a great deal of impassioned debate over American education today. What accounts for learning? What
role do teachers and students play in learning processes? How and what may be assessed in learning experi-
ences? In this course we will examine research and theories on learning and teaching in order to critically reflect
on the complexities, challenges and possibilities in today's schools. We will review different perspectives on
teaching-learning processes with particular emphasis on an active-learning approach. We will draw on case stud-
ies from elementary, middle and secondary school in several domains such as early literacy, science and mathe-
matics, and will examine issues of cultural diversity in educational settings and compare teaching and learning
experiences across contexts and cultures. Students will develop their own research paper in a specific domain of
interest as a way to creatively apply and relate the issues discussed in class.

tion. This course studies the dynamic relationship between hormones and behavior. We will review the mecha-
nisms by which hormones act in the nervous system. We will also investigate the complex interactions between
hormones and behavior. Specific topics to be examined include: sexual differentiation; reproductive and parental
behaviors; stress; aggression; and learning and memory. Students will critically review data from both human
and animal studies. All students will design and conduct an empirical research project.

PSYC 322(F) Concepts: Mind, Brain, and Culture
Every time we see something as a kind of thing, every time that we decide that an object is a cup rather than a
glass, when we recognize a picture of a familiar face as a picture of ourselves, or even when we understand
speech, we are employing categories. Most categorization decisions are automatic and unconscious, and there-
fore have the illusion of simplicity. The complexity of these decisions, however, becomes apparent when we
attempt to build machines to do what humans perform so effortlessly. What are the systems in place that allow us
this extraordinary ability to segment the world? Are they universal? How does conceptual knowledge differ
across cultural groups? How do concepts affect our perception? How do the categories of experts differ from the
categories of novices? Do children have the same kind of conceptual knowledge as adults? How are categories
represented in the brain? In this course, we explore various empirical findings from cognitive psychology, cogni-
tive neuroscience, and anthropology that address these questions.
Format: Empirical Lab Course. Requirements: short papers, class presentation, and research paper.
Prerequisites: Psychology 221 or 222 or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 15). Preference

PSYC 325(S) Psychology of Language
Language plays a central role in our lives and is the primary manner in which we communicate our experiences
and views of the world with one another. In this course, we ask several fundamental questions about the psychol-
ogy of language: Are all languages essentially the same or different? What is the relationship between language
and thought? How are concepts represented by language? Why do children learn languages so effortlessly? To
what extent is language a special cognitive system? What are the biological foundations of language? We will
address these questions by critically reviewing classic and contemporary literature concerning language compre-
hension and production, with emphasis given to experimental techniques researchers have used to study lan-
guage. All students will design and conduct an empirical research project.
Format: Empirical Lab Course. Requirements: a series of weekly1- to 2-page response papers, participation in
class discussion, written and oral reports of empirical research.
Prerequisites: Psychology 221 and 201 (or 222 and 201) or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 19 (ex-

PSYC 326(F) Decision-Making
Why does our ability to reason sometimes fail us? Why do we occasionally make choices that are bad for us? We
address these questions by surveying experimental approaches to understanding reasoning and decision-making
processes in human behavior, and by solving and analyzing problems that psychologists have used to investigate
these processes. Class discussion focuses on cognitive theories of rational and irrational thinking as well as be-
havioral theories of suboptimal choices. Topics include impulsiveness and self-control, the subjective values of
short-term versus long-term rewards, addictions and bad habits, probability judgments, gambling, and moral rea-
soning. All students will design and conduct an empirical research project.

PSYC 332(S) Cognitive Development
In this course we consider how mental abilities, such as language, memory, thinking and imagination develop
during the childhood years. We begin by asking how infants, who do not have language, make sense of their
world and how language, once acquired, changes the way children understand their world. We study how chil-
dren remember events, both every day and traumatic, and how memory relates to narratives about the self. We
examine the development of thinking, reasoning, and imagination (e.g. pretend play, imaginary companions) and
their intersection with related topics, such as children's ability to distinguish between fantasy and reality.
Throughout these discussions, we consider the impact of biology (e.g. changes in the brain) and culture on cogni-
tion, as well as the similarities and differences in the cognitive abilities of normally-developing children and chil-
dren with developmental problems (e.g., autism). All students will design and conduct an empirical research
project.
Format: Empirical Lab Course. Requirements: hour exam, thought papers, and a written/oral report of final re-
search project.

PSYC 340(S) Ideologies, Values, Beliefs
The September 11th attacks, the war on terror, and the polarization of the electorate have stimulated a resurgence
of interest in the psychological bases and functions of ideologies. In this course we will examine conservative
and liberal, reactionary and progressive ideologies from a social psychological perspective. How do ordinary
people become political extremists? Why do people sometimes vote against their own material self-interest?
How do ideologies bias our interpretations of events? Why do some social problems attract a great deal of atten-
tion while other, arguably more important problems are ignored? How do implicit ideologies influence everyday
judgment? We will draw on theoretical perspectives and methodologies from social psychology to address these
and many other relevant questions. Students will conduct an empirical research project.

PSYC 355(F) Psychotherapy: Theory and Research (W)
Psychotherapy is a young, barely 75-year old psychological endeavor which attempts to promote change and
healing through social interaction. Does talking with a psychotherapist really help people to change--emotional-
ly, cognitively, and/or behaviorally--and how exactly does it help people achieve relief from psychological dis-
orders and problems? In this course, we will study some of the key approaches to psychotherapy by examining
the theories and scientific research that surround them, and considering theory and research in juxtaposition. This
will be accomplished by a close reading and critical analysis of primary source theoretical papers, videotapes and
transcripts of therapy sessions, case studies, and contemporary empirical research studies on psychotherapy out-
comes and change processes. Students will learn how to evaluate the efficacy claims of both standard and new
therapies and how to evaluate claims about the mechanisms by which those therapies work. Current controver-
sies in psychotherapy and psychotherapy research will be used to address these goals.
Format: seminar. Requirements: active class participation, four 5-page position papers and two oral class presen-
tations based on these, final term paper in the form of a grant proposal outlining an important question for psy-
chotherapy research, reviewing the extant literature, and proposing a study to address these questions.
Prerequisites: Psychology 201 and Psychology 252. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference to psycholo-

PSYC 358(S) Mood and Personality
Over the lifespan there are stable differences between individuals in mood-such as differences in how irritable,
optimistic or anxious a person feels on average. We will investigate the origins, hypothesized functions, and con-
sequences of the major moods, consider how mood tendencies inform personality, and explore what is known
about both conscious and unconscious influences on mood. Readings will include theoretical articles, empirical
reports, and several detailed case studies. Both pathological and normal mood will be considered. Attention will
be given to contemporary evolutionary, biogenetic, cognitive, behavioral and psychodynamic theory and re-
search, with particular emphasis on integrative models that incorporate all of those perspectives. All students will
design and conduct an empirical research project.
Format: Empirical Lab Course. Requirements: class participation, brief weekly assignments including one or

teaching placement in a local school, and participate in both peer and individual supervision. In addition, we will
read a range of texts that examine different approaches to teaching, as well as theory and research on the process
of education. What is the best way to teach? How do various theories of children and pedagogy translate into
everyday practices with students? Students will be encouraged to reflect and modify their own teaching practices
as a result of what we read as well as their supervision. Questions we will discuss include: What is the relation-
ship between educational goals and curriculum development? What is the relation between substance (knowl-
edge, skills, content) and the interpersonal dynamic inherent in a classroom setting? How do we assess teaching
practices, and the students' learning? What does it take to be an educated person?
Format: seminar. Requirements: This course involves a field placement, weekly readings, as well as seminar
discussion, supervision, 2 5-page papers and a 20-page final paper.
Prerequisites: Psychology 232 or Psychology 272 or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected:
15). Preference given to Psychology majors and those who plan to become teachers.
Hour: 1:10-3:50 W ENGEL
PSYC 397(F), 398(S) Independent Study
Open to upperclass students with permission of the instructor and department. Students interested in doing an
independent study should make prior arrangements with the appropriate professor. The student and professor
then complete the independent study proposal form available at the Registrar's Office and submit it to the depart-
ment chair for approval prior to the end of the drop/add period.
PSYC 401(F) Perspectives on Psychological Issues
This course considers controversial psychological topics of both historical and current import from diverse psy-
chological perspectives. The course is centered around student-led discussions within sections and in debates
between sections. The topics considered for 2006 are self-deception, the nature of intelligence, and intimate rela-
tionships.
Format: seminar. Requirements: participation in class discussions and debates and three short position papers.
No enrollment limit (expected: 15 per section). This course is required of all senior Psychology majors.

MAJOR
The major in Religion is designed to perform two related functions: to expose the student to the methods
and issues involved in the study of religion as a universal phenomenon of psychological, sociological, and
cultural/historical dimensions; and to confront students with the beliefs, practices, and values of specific
religions through a study of particular religious traditions. It is a program that affords each student an op-
portunity to fashion his/her own sequence of study within a prescribed basic pattern constructed to ensure
both coherence and variety. It consists of at least nine semester courses as follows:
Required sequence courses
Religion 101 Introduction to Religion
Two seminars (courses numbered 280, 301-309)
Religion 402 Issues in the Study of Religion
Elective courses
Five additional courses in Religion are to be selected in such a way that at least one course is taken in
both the Western and non-Western traditions. Students will construct their sequence in consultation with
departmental advisors and subject to their approval. In order to achieve a deep coverage of a particular
religious tradition or set of related problems in the study of religion, students are urged to select three elec-
tives that together have some kind of coherence, be it cultural, historical, or topical. Related courses from
other departments or programs may be included among the three courses, and the point of coherence can
be the subject of research papers in the senior seminar.
Students are advised to elect additional courses in related fields (e.g., psychology, sociology, anthropolo-
gy, art, history, philosophy) in order to gain a clearer understanding of the social and cultural contexts in
which religions appear.
For those who wish to go beyond the formally-listed courses into a more intensive study of a particular
religious tradition, methodological trend, or religious phenomenon (e.g., ritual, symbol-formation, mysti-
Religion
­ 283 ­
cism, theology, etc.), there is the opportunity to undertake independent study or, with the approval of the
department, to pursue a thesis project.
The value of the major in Religion derives from its fostering of a critical appreciation of the complex
role religion plays in every society, even those that consider themselves non-religious. The major makes
one sensitive to the role religion plays in shaping the terms of cultural discourse, of social attitudes and
behavior, and of moral reflection. But it also discloses the ways in which religion and its social effects
represent the experience of individual persons and communities. In doing these things, the major further
provides one with interdisciplinary analytical tools and cross-cultural experience and opens up new ave-
nues for dealing with both the history of a society and culture and the relationships between different soci-
eties and cultures. What one learns as a Religion major is therefore remarkably applicable to a wide range
of other fields of study or professions.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN RELIGION
The degree with honors in Religion requires the above-mentioned nine courses and the preparation of a
thesis of 75+ pages with a grade of B+ or better. A thesis may combine revised work done in other courses
with new material prepared while enrolled either in Religion 493-W31 or Religion W31-494. Up to two-
thirds of the work in the thesis may be such revised work, but at least one-third must represent new work.
The thesis must constitute a coherent whole either by its organizing theme or by a focus on a particular
religious tradition. Candidates will also be expected to present the results of their thesis orally in a public
presentation. Students who wish to be candidates for honors in Religion will submit proposals and at least
one paper that may be included in the thesis to the department in the spring of their junior year. Students
must normally have at least a 3.5 GPA in Religion to be considered for the honors program.
The chair will serve as advisor to non-majors.
STUDY ABROAD
The Williams College Religion Department encourages potential majors to study abroad in order to en-
hance their education and gain international perspectives on religious studies. There are many excellent
study abroad opportunities offering students a variety of possible experiences: among them cultural im-
mersion, field work, intensive language learning, independent study, participation in another educational
system. Many of our majors study in the Williams College Oxford Program, but our majors also regularly
pursue a semester or year-long study in other programs.
REL 101(F,S) Introduction to Religion
As an examination of the structure and dynamics of certain aspects of religious thought, action, and sensibility--
employing psychological, sociological, anthropological, and philosophical modes of inquiry--the course offers
a general exposure to basic methodological issues in the study of religion, and includes consideration of several
cross-cultural types of religious expression in non-literate and literate societies.

REL 203(S) Judaism: Innovation and Tradition (Same as Jewish Studies 101)
What is the relationship between modern notions of Jewish identity, thought and practice and the Hebrew Bible?
How does the modern Reform movement link itself to the laws of the rabbinic sages? Are there consistent values
and ideals that mark Jewish moral thought throughout its history? What elements of the Jewish tradition have
enabled its elasticity and historic persistence? By providing an introduction to the traditions of Jewish thought
and practice through the ages, this course will take up these questions. Though the course's method of progres-
sion will be primarily chronological, commencing with myths of Israel's beginnings and culminating with con-
temporary debates over Jewish identity, we will additionally emphasize the strong ties between methods of Jew-
ish thought and practices and the surrounding cultural environments in which they developed. We will approach
the tradition not only with historical concerns, but with literary and philosophical aims as well. We will analyze
the interpretive strategies, theological presuppositions, and political aims that accompany the tradition both in its
continuities and its ruptures. Finally, we will consider the extent to which we can speak of Judaism under the
category of religion, considering as well the other categories that have been proposed for Judaism, Jews and
Jewishness, such as nation, people, race and ethnicity, and the motivations behind such designations. Texts will
include the Hebrew Bible, Holz (ed), Back to the Sources; Halbertal, People of the Book; Mendelssohn, Jerusa-
lem; Hertzberg (ed), The Zionist Idea; Levi, Survival in Auschwitz as well as excerpts and articles available in a
course packet.

REL 204(F) Redeeming a Broken World: Messianism in Modernity (Same as Jewish Studies 204)
(W)
The sociologist Zygmunt Bauman has described modernity as the period of the world's disenchantment, when
God absconded and religion was either rationalized or reduced to the category of superstition. Ironically, this very
disenchantment might help to explain the persistence of the concept of the messianic in even the most secular
branches of modern European thought. One of Judaism's most powerful and elastic concepts, the notion of the
messiah saw a variety of radically different interpretations between the 17th and 20th centuries. This course will
consider the range of modern interpretations of the messiah, taking as its concrete starting point the Sabbatian
Heresy of the 17th century and concluding with Derrida's philosophical development of the concept of the mes-
sianic as pure interruption. The course's aim is to use messianism as a focal point around which to consider the
dynamic relationship between philosophy and Judaism in modernity. This course will expose the mutual in-
fluences of these two forces, illustrating both how Enlightenment conceptions of progress helped to create the
notion of "messianism" understood as an abstract idea, and how the modern/post-modern philosophical concep-
tion of the "messianic" as a force that interrupts time is dependent upon historical studies of the messianic dimen-
sion of traditional Judaism. The readings for each class will not generally exceed 40 pages but will require close
attention. Authors to be read include GWF Hegel, Immanuel Kant, Hermann Cohen, Franz Rosenzweig, Ger-
shom Scholem, Walter Benjamin, and Jacques Derrida.
Format: seminar. Requirements will include regular participation, weekly writing assignments of 2-3 pages, and

REL 205(S) Ancient Wisdom Literature (Same as Classics 205, Comparative Literature 217 and
Jewish Studies 205)
The Biblical books of Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Job are often grouped together under the Hebrew category of
hokhmah, `wisdom.' Although these books are very different in content, they can all be interpreted as medita-
tions on ethical and practical philosophy. In this way, they represent the Hebrew Bible's canonical embrace of a
widespread Near Eastern literary phenomenon. From the instructional literature of Egypt and Mesopotamia to
Greek didactic poetry and fables, ancient Mediterranean cultures offer a wide range of texts that engage the is-
sues of personal behavior, leadership, and justice. Starting with the central wisdom books of the Hebrew Bible
and moving through relevant material from the Apocrypha, New Testament, and the Egyptian and Babylonian
traditions, this course will examine the literature of wisdom throughout the ancient world with an eye toward
understanding its various social, political, and philosophical contexts. We will then consider the Greek wisdom
tradition in such texts as Hesiod's Works and Days, Aesop's fables, and fragments from the pre-Socratic philoso-
phers. Finally, we will explore the influence of these ancient sources on later expressions of wisdom in medieval
European literature, as well as more recent examples such as Benjamin Franklin'sPoor Richard's Almanack. All
readings are in translation.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, short written assignments, and two

REL 207(F) From Adam to Noah: Literary Imagination and the Primeval History in Genesis
(Same as Classics 207, Comparative Literature 250 and Jewish Studies 207)
How long did Adam and Eve live in the Garden of Eden? What was the mark of Cain? Why did Enoch not die?
Who was Noah's wife? How did Giants survive the Flood? These are only a few of the fascinating questions that
ancient readers and interpreters of the Book of Genesis asked and attempted to answer. The first ten chapters of
Genesis present a tantalizingly brief narrative account of the earliest history of humankind. The text moves swift-
ly from the Creation to the Flood and its immediate aftermath, but this masterful economy of style leaves many
details unexplained. This course will explore the rich and varied literary traditions associated with the primeval
history in the Genesis. Through a close reading of ancient noncanonical sources such as the Book of Enoch,
Jubilees, and the Life of Adam and Eve, as well as Jewish traditions represented in Josephus, Philo, and Rabbinic
literature and other accounts presented in early Christian and Gnostic texts, we will investigate the ways in which
the elliptical style of Genesis generated a massive body of ancient folklore, creative exegesis, and explicit literary
re-imagining of the early history of humankind. We will then turn to several continuations of these variant tradi-
tions in medieval and early modern literature, with particular attention to the extensive material on the figures of
Cain and Noah. All readings are in translation.
Format: discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation and several writing assignments.

How did Christianity develop in the first few hundred years? What factors in its historical and cultural contexts
influenced the ways in which it developed? The class is designed to introduce you to the history of early
Christianity between 30-600 C.E. While this class addresses the basic flow of events and major figures in
early-Christian history, it will also require you to develop a critical framework for the study of history in general.
In addition, you will gain significant experience in the critical analysis of primary source materials. Special
attention will be paid to the incredible diversity of early-Christian thought and practice. The course is organized
chronologically, geographically, and thematically. We shall consider how these categories make a difference for
the study of early Christianity.

We will begin by examining the background to the Reformation, showing how the Reformation along with its
precursors indirectly helped to usher in a modern world that placed greater emphasis on the value of selfhood and
moral autonomy, encouraged the emergence of the Enlightenment and scientific rationality, and helped to lead to
the cultural and political realignment of nation-states. We will conclude by assessing the attempts of eighteenth
and nineteenth century philosophers and theologians to salvage a moral if no longer normative place for Chris-
tianity at the table of modernity, a process that continues to grow ever more ambivalent.

NORTH AMERICAN RELIGIONS
REL 225(F) Religions of North America (Same as American Studies 225)
Scholars have written much about the history of religion in North America, but the effort has been fraught with
many oversights. Recent scholarship has begun to take account of the fact that most religions in North America
either did not emerge from European sources, or have existed long before the arrival of Europeans. Indeed, many
religions have grown out of the American soil during the past several centuries-what some would call the product
of religious "cross-fertilization," and what others would deem as religious and cultural thievery, i.e. colonialism.
This course follows a modified historical trajectory, one that strives to allow the voices of forgotten "others" to
speak, bringing questions of colonialism, identity, and the importance of religious community to the forefront.

This course explores contemporary North America religion from a historical, sociological, and philosophical
perspective. We will examine the historical and contemporary experiences of America's ever-expanding
religious diversity, prominently featuring the voices of those traditionally excluded from older, Protestant-in-
formed accounts of American religion. The focus of the course will be the exploration of the ever-expanding
variety of new religions in North America, challenging students to engage the numerous cultural, philosophical,
and methodological issues involved with the study of marginal religions. New religions often highlight cultural
anxieties, e.g. loss of identity in contemporary secular societies, responses to new technologies, changing gender
Religion
­ 286 ­
roles, globalization, etc. The study of new religions becomes, then, a closer, reflexive examination of contempo-
rary American culture and its underlying tensions. For example, the Raëlian Movement claims to have cloned
the first human. Wicca, on the other hand, offers critiques of environmental depredation and traditional gender
roles. In sum, we will explore the historical roots of the current boom in new religions, detail contemporary is-
sues, and outline the possible forms new and emerging religions may assume in the coming years. This course
will also have a website dedicated to the exploration of new religions, providing links to interesting sites, basic
resources, and student essays/projects.
Lecture/discussion. Students will be evaluated on the basis of their writing and presentation projects, three 5- to
7- page essays, along with their thoughtful discussion of the key issues raised in the course.

THE ISLAMIC TRADITION
REL 230(S) Reading Reading: An Introduction to the Qur'an and Islam (Same as Comparative
Literature 260) (W)*
One of the two most consequential texts in human history, the Qur'an is more conscious of itself as text and the
work of interpretation that is part of the life of a text. Because it is God's most important sign (and also because it
is relatively short) millions have memorized it and the art of Qur'anic recitation is one of the supreme Islamic
performing arts. Nevertheless it is primarily as a text that the Qur'an exists in itself and in the minds of Muslims.
The text of the Qur'an will thus be the focus of this course, reading it extensively, intensively and repeatedly
throughout the semester. We will attend to the structure and variety of styles and topics in the text and to the
Qur'an's understanding of itself in relation to other forms of literary expression. We will place the form and
content in the context of seventh century c.e. Arab society and attend to the life of the Prophet (PBUH) that
provides one crucial framework to the text. Through the lens oftafsir, Qur'anic commentary, we will also use the
text to give an initial survey of some of the main theological, philosophical, mystical and legal developments in
the Islamic tradition. Finally we will explore some of the aspects of the place of the text in the life of Muslims,
including the development of calligraphy and recitation.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: three essays (6-8 pages) based on class materials (at least one will
have a revision process). Students able to read the Arabic text may substitute work in a collateral reading group
of the Qur'an in Arabic for one of the essays.

REL 231(F) The Origins of Islam: God, Empire and Apocalypse (Same as History 209)*
The rise of Islam in the seventh-century C.E. is usually seen, by both Muslim and non-Muslim historians, as a
total break with the past. This course will challenge that assumption by placing the rise of Islam in the context of
the history of late antiquity (c. 300-700 C.E.). The first half of the course will examine the impact of Judeo-Chris-
tian monotheism in the ancient world, the rise of confessional empires, articulation of new ideas about holiness
and its relation to sexuality and the transformations undergone by Judaism, Christianity, Zoroastrianism and
Manichaeism. We shall examine the conversation of these traditions with classical paganism and philosophy, the
internal struggle within traditions to define rules of interpretation, the impact of ascetic, iconoclastic and apoca-
lyptic ideas and, finally, polemics among the traditions. Special attention will be given to borderlands (Armenia,
Syria, and Arabia), where the problems of regionalism and religious diversity were prominent. We will then
examine the career of Muhammad (PBUH) in the context of Arabia, the spread of the Islamic empire into Chris-
tian and Iranian worlds, the impact of apocalyptic expectations, the fixation of religious decision-making within
the tradition and the question of conversion and religious diversity within the commonwealth of Islam. The
course will end with the flourishing of the Abbasid empire in the ninth century. This course will make use of the
Antioch 2000 exhibit at the Worcester Art Museum.

an introduction to the Caucasus, the Central Asian Republics, Xinjiang and Mongolia and the interests of their
neighbors, including now the United States in those areas. This will be a lecture course that will introduce the
salient themes and issues that are necessary for understanding these areas. The course will inevitably be deeply
comparative focusing on themes of "the clash of civilizations," the construction of national identities, notions of
ethnicity and the treatment of ethnic minorities, resurgent religious movements, and the relation of state and civil
society. This course will also function as an introduction to doing social scientific research on these areas and

Often depicted in novels and movies as Shangrila, a mythical and ideal country, Tibet has had the dubious
privilege of being a focus of Western orientalism. In recent years, this fascination has given rise to a
veritable craze, which has affected particularly the entertainment culture. One cannot but wonder about
the motives and sources of this mythology. But, rather than focus narcissistically on "our"
representations, this course mostly looks at "them," examining more particularly the cultural and
historical aspects of Tibetan civilization. We first consider the early history of Tibet, the introduction of
Buddhism in this country, the relations between Buddhism and the indigenous religion, and some of the
stages in the development of Tibetan Buddhism. In this way we see how Buddhism in Tibet, like in other
Buddhist countries, is integrated in an overall religious system that comprises much more than the
doctrines and practices often essentialized as "Buddhism." We also examine the historical developments
that led to the development of the institutions (such as the Dalai-Lama) unique to Tibet and consider the
more recent tragic events and what they augur for the future of the Tibet. Throughout the course we
examine the unusually central role that the complex interreaction that religion and politics has had in
Tibetan history. In this way, we get a footing in the Tibetan world and the final part of the course, the
assessment of Western representations of Tibet, becomes not just an exercise in self-reflection but also a
gate to a better understanding of a remarkable civilization.

REL 280(S) The Turn to Religion in Post-Modern Thought (Same as Jewish Studies 280 and
Philosophy 282) (W)
As thinkers of the 20th century came to question the Enlightenment ideal of human self-sovereignty, both for its
intellectual and political consequences, many turned back to religious imagery and concepts in pursuit of alter-
Religion
­ 288 ­
nate modes of conceptualizing the human being. This course will examine some such endeavors in the fields of
philosophy, psychoanalysis and literature. While none of the texts we examine will be explicitly theological, all
will, in some form or another, make use of theological notions such as revelation, redemption, or sacrifice. In
examining these texts we will be asking some fundamental questions: What meaning do religious concepts have
when emptied of dogmatic content? How effective are these concepts when employed in the service of cultural
critique? How might such efforts reflect back on the theorizing and practice of religions in contemporary society?
We will, furthermore, analyze the very category of the post-modern by considering its relationship to the Enlight-
enment, debating whether this relationship is one of continuity, rupture or both, and dissecting the critique that
post-modern philosophy's concern for religion is a sign of its nostalgic or reactionary nature. Readings will in-
clude Immanuel Kant's Religion within the Limits of Reason alone, Friedrich Nietzsche's Twilight of the Idols,
Jacques Lacan's Feminine Sexuality, as well as essays by Luce Irigaray, Georges Bataille, Emmanuel Levinas,
Jean-François Lyotard and Jacques Derrida.
Format: discussion. Requirements will include regular participation and four writing assignments: three shorter
papers of 3-5 pages on a question assigned by the instructor and a longer essay of 12-15 pages on an approved
topic of the student's choice.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit 19 (expected 19). Preference given to Religion and Philosophy majors and
Jewish Studies concentrators.

REL 288(S) The Embodied Mind: A Cross-Cultural Exploration (Same as Philosophy 288)
This course examines some of the central questions concerning the nature of the mind: the nature of intentional-
ity, the role of emotions, the relation with the body, the nature of subjectivity, the role of reflexivity, etc. In con-
fronting these questions, we do not proceed purely theoretically but consider the contributions of various ob-
servation-based traditions, from Buddhist psychology and meditative practices to phenomenology to neurosci-
ences. We begin by examining some of the central concepts of Buddhist psychology, its treatment of the mind as
an selfless stream of consciousness, its examination of the variety of mental factors and its accounts of the rela-
tion between cognition and affects. We also introduce the practice of meditation as a way to observe the mind and
raise questions concerning the place of its study in the mind-sciences. We pursue this reflection by examining the
views of James, Husserl, Sartre and Merleau-Ponty, particularly as they concern the methods for the study of the
mind and the relation between intentionality, reflexivity and the body. In this way, we develop a rich array of
analytical tools and observational practices to further our understanding of the mind. But we also question the
value of these tools, which are based on first person approaches, by relating them to the third person studies of
neurobiologists such as Damasio. We come to appreciate the importance of considering the biology on which
mental processes are based and the light that this approach throws on the central questions of the course. We
conclude by considering the relation between first and third person studies of the mind, focusing on Varella's
concept of the embodied mind as a fruitful bridge between these different traditions.
Requirements: practice of meditation, a class presentation and a research paper (15 pages).

REL 304(F) From Hermeneutics to Post-Coloniality (Same as Comparative Literature 344)*
This course explores some of the theoretical trajectories available in "our" pluri-cultural and (post)modern world
by focusing on the relation between truth and interpretation, particularly in a pluri-cultural context. We start with
Gadamer's hermeneutics, which stresses the importance of being aware of one's cultural background and
prejudices, an important prerequisite for understanding cultural differences. Hermeneutics has also, however,
several blind spots, which we examine through the critiques of Derrida, Foucault and Said. With Derrida we
learn the critical tools and the rigor necessary to question some of the central notions such as identity and
difference which are often taken for granted. With Foucault we question the relation between truth and power in
interpretation, and thematize the complexities of power. With Said's Orientalism, a seminal description of the
ways in which the West has (mis)represented the "East," we examine the nature of (mis)interpretation of other
cultures and the role that ethnocentrism has played in the formation of modernity. We also consider some of the
more compelling critiques of Said's work such as Bhabha's warning against the essentialization of difference and
Religion
­ 289 ­
Spivak's argument against the often too easy appropriation of cultural differences. We conclude by considering
two concrete situations in India and Egypt which illustrate the relevance of the post-colonial critique and its main
proponents, Said, Spivak and Bhabha (otherwise known as the "Holy Trinity"). Reading list: H.G. Gadamer,
Truth and Method. F. Saussure, Course in General Linguistics. J. Derrida, Of Grammatology. P. Rabinow,

REL 305T(S) Haunted: Ghosts in the Study of Religion (W)
Haunting offers a powerful way to speak about forces that affect us profoundly while remaining invisible or
elusive. "What is it that holds sway over us like an unconditional prescription?.The distance between us and that
which commands our moves-or their opposite, our immobility-approaches us: it is a distance that closes in on
you at times, it announces a proximity closer than any intimacy or familiarity you have ever known" (Avital
Ronell, Dictations: On Haunted Writing [1986] xvi-xvii). The figure of the ghost has been developed by those
seeking to grapple with the ongoing effects of modern slavery, colonialism, state-sponsored terrorism, the
holocaust, and personal trauma and loss. Building upon the insights about memory, history, and identity that
haunting has been used to address, this course will challenge students to explore the study of religion by way of
its "seething absences." We shall ask how the study of religion has endeavored to address loss, trauma, and its
persistent effects, what "holds sway" over various approaches to the study of religion, as well as how "religion"
constitutes its own ghostly presence, haunting other domains.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: meeting in pairs, each student will either write and present a paper or respond to
their partner's paper. Each student will write and present two 3- to 4-page papers, five 5- to 7-page papers, and
offer five oral critiques of their partner's paper. Students will revise two papers.

This course is a critical introduction to content, theory, and methodology in the ethnography of religion. We will
examine selected ethnographies that focus on a variety of religious settings, and discuss the practical, method-
ological, and ethical issues related to the ethnography of religion. Four broad questions will dominate our discus-
sions: 1) What is ethnography, and how can it be used to describe religion cross-culturally? 2) What are the
strengths and limitations of ethnography as an approach to the study of religion, and can ethnographic studies of
religion offer something that historical, sociological and/or fictional approaches cannot? 3) What are the theoreti-
cal, practical, and stylistic tools needed to fashion compelling ethnographies that get to the heart of what it means
to be human in different social and religious settings? 4) What are the ethical and political implications of repre-
senting religion in fieldwork studies? We will consider works by the following authors: William James, Clifford
Geertz, Zora Neale Hurston, Maya Deren, Janice Boddy, Renato Rosaldo, James Spickard, Marla Frederick, and
Elizabeth Bowen. We will also view excerpts of films during the semester with options for full viewing at addi-
tional meetings.

FRENCH
MAJOR--French Language and Literature
The French major seeks to provide training in literary and cultural analysis and linguistic expression
through the study of selected texts from the French-speaking world. Emphasis is placed on the changes in
form and subject matter from the early modern period to the contemporary era.
The major consists of nine courses above the 105 level with optimally one course each from the follow-
ing areas:
1) Poetry and Poetics
2) Prose Narrative and Fiction
3) Theatre and Dramatic Literature
4) Thematics, Special Topics, Survey Courses
Students must also take a 400-level capstone seminar which may count toward any of the four re-
quired areas.
As RFLR 104 is a special course that replaces 105 and 106 for those students starting French at the 103
level, 104 will count towards the major as a substitute for RLFR 106.
Students entering the major program at the 109/110-level may, with the permission of the Department,
choose as part of their major program, one course in Art History, History, Philosophy, Comparative Litera-
ture or other subjects that relate to and broaden their study of French. Students entering the major program
at the 200-level may, in some cases and with the permission of the Department, include two such courses in
their major program.
Working with the major advisor, the student will formulate a curricular plan that will ensure balance and
coherence in courses taken. Such balance and coherence will be based on the above areas of literary and
cultural investigation. Prospective majors should discuss their program with the major advisor by the end
of their sophomore year. This is especially imperative for students who are planning to spend a part or all of
their junior year in France.
Inasmuch as all courses in French assume the active participation of each student in discussions con-
ducted in the foreign language, regular attendance at class meetings is expected.
MAJOR--French Studies
The major in French Studies is an interdisciplinary program that provides students with the opportunity
to acquire skills and knowledge embracing the cultural, historical, social, and political heritage of France
and the Francophone world. The program allows for an individualized course of study involving work in
several departments and the opportunity to study abroad.
Students electing the French Studies major should register with the French Studies faculty advisor dur-
ing their sophomore year. At that time they should submit a feasibility plan that articulates their projected
program.
The French Studies major consists of ten courses satisfying the following requirements:
1) at least two courses in French language and/or literature above the French 103 level;
2) a senior seminar;
3) Electives: The remaining courses needed to complete the major must be drawn from at least three
different departments and relate primarily to an aspect of the culture, history, society, and politics of France
and the Francophone world. These courses will be selected in consultation with members of the Depart-
ment of Romance Languages. Appropriate electives might include:
History 331 The French and Haitian Revolutions
Religion 301 Psychology of Religion
All courses in French literature and language above the 103 level.
In addition, students should take at least two non-language courses that are taught in French.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN FRENCH
Honors candidates are required to have maintained a GPA of 3.5 in the major to qualify for submitting a
thesis proposal.
By May 15th of their junior year, candidates will have found a thesis advisor, and given the Department
a three- to five-page proposal and a preliminary bibliography. (In some cases, and upon consultation with
the Department, candidates will have the option to choose a second reader in addition to their primary
advisor; for example, when the thesis is interdisciplinary enough in nature that it requires the expertise of an
additional reader).
Romance Languages
­ 291 ­
This proposal will be discussed by the Department; by June 1st, the candidate will be informed whether
he/she can proceed with the thesis, and if so, what changes need to be made to the focus and scope of the
project. The summer before the senior year will be spent compiling a more detailed bibliography and read-
ing.
Upon their return to Williams, candidates will devote to their theses two semesters of independent study
(beyond the nine courses required for the major) and the winter study period of their senior year
(493-W31-494). The thesis will be written in French and will usually not be shorter than fifty pages. By the
end of the Fall semester, students will normally have a clear outline of the project, have done substantial
research, and produced the draft of at least the first half of the project. During January this draft will be
suitably rewritten and edited with a view to a final version, while the candidates will also begin work on
remaining chapters.
Candidates will submit what they have written to the department on the last day of Winter Study.
On the Tuesday of the first week of the spring semester candidates will make a presentation of the proj-
ect at a departmental colloquium in French. The thesis will be promptly discussed and evaluated to deter-
mine whether or not the student should continue in the honors program. The second semester of indepen-
dent thesis work will be spent writing more chapters, as well as revising, rewriting, and polishing the proj-
ect where necessary. The completed thesis in its final form will be due on April 25th. At the end of the
Spring term, the student will present and defend the final project before members of the Department and
others by invitation. The grade will be awarded once members of the Department have consulted after the
defense.
THE CERTIFICATE IN FRENCH
The Certificate in French Language and Cultures consists of a sequence of seven courses for which the
student must earn a cumulative grade average of B or higher. In addition, the student must take a proficien-
cy test and achieve a score of "Advanced." The test will be administered by the department once a year
during the month of April to all students desirous of obtaining the Certificate. Those interested should ex-
press their intent to the chair of the department by March 1 or earlier.
For students with no prior French background, the course sequence will consist of French 101-102,
French 103 and 104, and three courses in French above the 104 level, with at least one of these courses
at the 200-level or higher taken at Williams. If the student starts out the sequence at French 103, in addition
to the three courses in French beyond the 104 level (including a 200-level course or higher), two electives
may be taken in other departments. One elective should be in French or Francophone cultural history (art,
literature, drama, music) and the other in French or Francophone intellectual, political or social history.
See French Studies Major description above for list of possible electives in other departments.
PLACEMENT
A placement test in French is administered at Williams at the opening of the fall semester. Incoming
first-year students who register for any French course above the 101-102 level must take this test, regard-
less of their previous preparation.
STUDY ABROAD
French majors are strongly advised to complete part of the requirements for the major by studying
abroad either during the academic year or the summer. Most American study-in-France programs require
applicants to have completed a fifth-semester, college-level French course (French 105, for example) be-
fore they go abroad. A special affiliation with the Hamilton Junior Year in France program enables Wil-
liams students (who have completed 105) to participate in a comprehensive academic and cultural experi-
ence in a French-speaking environment. Credit for up to four courses towards the major can be granted at
the discretion of the Department: normally 2 major credit for one semester and up to 4 major credits for a
full year or two semesters. The final assignment of credit will be authorized in consultation with the stu-
dent's major advisor once the student has returned to Williams. Such credits can only be determined by
review of course format, course materials, and evidence of satisfactory academic performance. Students
interested in studying abroad need to consult with faculty members in French by the second semester of
their first year. Early planning is essential. Because the academic quality of certain programs of study in
France may well be beneath the pedagogical standards normally associated with a Williams education,
students will receive major credit for only those programs recommended by the Department. Please con-
sult a faculty member to find out which programs are acceptable. Normally, the Department does not ad-
minister proficiency exams (for study abroad) to any student who has not completed a French course at
Williams.

RLFR 105(F) Advanced French I: Linguistic and Cultural Intrigue in the Francophone World
What mysterious set of connections brings together a young Québecoise graduate student, an 18th-century
French manuscript by the author of Dangerous Liaisons, a chameleon-like Parisian bent on tracking the young
student, a sinister French police inspector, and a suave Caribbean book collector with roots in two continents?
Where is the kaleidoscope of cultural signs leading us: the Zydeco culture of Louisiana and New Orleans,
enigmatic Creole proverbs such as "The green beans are not salted" and "Okra is not eaten with one finger," the
dizzying shift of international locales, and the autumnal radiance of Paris? We set out with Claire Plouffe and her
young, somewhat sinister admirer, Jean-Louis Royer, through a deepening international mystery set in a
Francophone environment and embracing the rich variety of cultural and linguistic experience that has helped
shape the role of France in the world. Against this backdrop, the course seeks to build on the writing, reading, and
aural comprehension skills in French developed at the elementary and intermediate levels (especially those of
French 103). It will consist of a continued review of fundamental grammar structures, but will emphasize the
application and assimilation of those structures in activities of composition, oral presentation, and discussion.
Conducted in French. Format: Lecture/discussion. Requirements: class participation, attendance, short papers,
and five hour-long exams.
Prerequisites: French 101-102, 103, or examination placement. Enrollment limit: 20 (expected: 20). Preference
given to students needing the course for foreign study admission and those continuing from French 103.
Hour: 11:20-12:35 TR NORTON
RLFR 106(S) Advanced French II: Linguistic and Cultural Intrigue in the Francophone World
The plot thickens as Claire Plouffe's quest takes her and Jean-Louis Royer to the lush tropical climes of
Fort-de-France in Martinique, to the relaxed multi-cultural setting of Sénégal and French West Africa, on to the
homey comforts of Geneva and Switzerland, the rustic, lavender-laden ambience of Provence and the South of
France, and finally, the vertiginous return to Quebec and the unraveling and resolution of the enigma. Now, the
range of cultural signs is even more disparate, from the disquieting confrontations with colonialism and racial
injustice, the aspirations of négritude, the animist spirituality of African culture, the linguistic and political
independence of the Suisse Romande, and the ancient sense of linguistic and cultural autonomy that has helped
shape Provence's distinctiveness within the unity that is France. As the mystery reaches its dénouement, the
Romance Languages
­ 293 ­
unraveling leads to a series of revelations that shed light on the tales of murder, treachery, betrayal, and purported
forgery that have served as the backdrop to Claire's long quest for the mysterious manuscript. This course
continues the basic structure, goals and methodology developed in French 105. It assumes active familiarity with
the French present, compound past, imperfect, and subjunctive tenses, as well as with most of the basic irregular
verbs. Its focus continues to highlight writing, reading, and aural comprehension skills in the context of
multi-cultural interpretation and grammar review. Conducted in French.
Format: Lecture/discussion. Requirements: class participation, attendance, short papers, and five hour-long ex-
ams.
Prerequisites: French 101-102, 103, 105 or examination placement. Enrollment limit: 20 (expected: 20).

LITERATURE COURSES
RLFR 109(F) Introduction to French Literature: Laughter and Despair
Through an organized web of obsessions, this course will introduce students to some seminal moments of
French literature and culture. In the face of human misery and futility, the writers selected respond in a multiplic-
ity of ways, ranging from despair to laughter. The course will gravitate around dialectically opposed though not
exclusive notions such as seriousness and frivolity (frivolous seriousness, serious frivolity), depth and superfi-
ciality, being and appearance, the Court and the City. By establishing connections between the various genres and
periods, the course will show how the reading of one text infects and enhances our understanding of another.
Readings will include: Villon, Du Bellay, Ronsard, Pascal, Molière, Perrault, Constant, Flaubert, and Ionesco.
Conducted in French.
Requirements: class participation, several short papers, an oral presentation, and an hour exam.
Prerequisites: French 104 or 105 or by placement test or by permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 20 (ex-

RLFR 111(F) Introduction to Francophone Studies*
This course is a basic introduction to Francophone studies with special focus on Sub-Saharan African and Carib-
bean literature and cinema. It explores how literature and cinema contribute to the understanding of the main
historical, political, social and cultural issues relevant to both geographical areas. The course examines the differ-
ent landmarks in the evolution of Francophone literature by starting with a contextualization of its birth in the
1920's, and then covering stages including the African students' activist publications in Paris in the early 1930's
and how this led to the advent of the highly debated Negritude movement. It then moves on to the 1950's and
examines how literature, especially the novel, was used as a means for colonial protest, and finally it studies
post-independence writings and looks at how they reflect the African people's deep sense of disenchantment and
frustration due to the fact that the new era failed to meet their expectations of a better life. The course also high-
lights the relationship between Africa and the Caribbean as expressed through literature and cinema, based on the
historical, cultural and religious legacy that binds them. Topics covered include colonial encounters, the Negri-
tude movement, reviving African myths and legends, between tradition and modernity, the African woman's
condition, the identity quest, current political and social issues. Literary works studied include novels such as
L'enfant noir (Camara Laye), Une vie de boy (Ferdinand Oyono), Sous l'orage (Seydou Badian), Une si longue
lettre (Mariama Bâ), La carte d'identité (Jean-Marie Adiaffi), Bleu-Blanc-Rouge (Alain Mabanckou), Moi, Titu-
ba sorcière... Noire de Salem (Maryse Condé); plays such as Monsieur Thôgô Gnini (Bernard Dadié) and La
tragédie du Roi Christophe; and poems such as "Femme noire" and "Congo" (Léopold Sédar Senghor). Films

RLFR 112(S) Advanced Oral Practice
This course is meant to develop active oral-aural skills: increase oral fluency through interactive discussions
dealing with culture, politics and other issues of current interest; improve the ease with which one understands all
types of standard speech including taped material, readings, radio and television broadcasts and movies. The
course focuses on the study of special features that distinguish spoken language from written form, such as the
use of specific words and expressions, difference in degrees of formality, repetitions, etc. Course materials in-
clude recordings from French radio station "Radio France International," French TV channel "TV 5," films and
videos. Class activities include conversation, listening to recordings and reporting on them, transcribing them
and pointing out aspects that are specific to spoken language. Students will also have to conduct interviews in
French (outside class), make recordings and transcriptions to be presented in class. No textbook is required. Class
attendance and participation are a must.

RLFR 214(S) Paris on Fire: Incendiary Voices from the City of Light (1830-2005)
During the 1830s, Balzac described Paris as a "surprising assemblage of movements, machines, and ideas, a city
of one hundred thousand novels, the head of the world," but also characterized the French capital as a "land of
contrasts," a "monstrous wonder," a "moral sewer." Similarly, writers from Hugo to Zola have simultaneously
celebrated Parisian elegance and condemned the appalling misery of Paris's urban poor. Since 1889, Paris has
been fêted as the "City of Light" for its Enlightenment legacy, its Eiffel Tower modernity, and its luminous urban
energy, captured in countless paintings, photographs, and film. However, Paris is also the historical site of
revolution, resistance, and riots. From revolutionary revolt (1830, 1848, 1871), to wartime resistance (1870,
1914-18, 1940-44), to reformist and race riots (1968 and 2005), Paris has repetitively sparked with incendiary
passion and political protest. As fires raged during the recent riots in 2005, many heard the echo of Hitler's
ominous 1944 question, "Is Paris burning?" and asked: why was Paris burning again at the dawn of the
twenty-first century? To answer this question, we will examine the social, political, and literary landscape of
Paris during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, from urbanization and modernization, to occupation and
liberation, to immigration and globalization. Readings to include poetry, short stories, and novels by Hugo,
Balzac, Baudelaire, Maupassant, Verne, Zola, Apollinaire, Colette, Duras, Perec, Rochefort, and Charef. Films to
include works by Clair, Truffaut, Godard, Minnelli, Clément, Lelouch, Luhrmann, Kassovitz, Besson, and
Jeunet. Conducted in French.

RLFR 310(S) Sexuality and Seduction in Nineteenth and Twentieth-Century France (Same as
Women's and Gender Studies 310)
In 1857, both Flaubert's Madame Bovary and Baudelaire's Les Fleurs du mal were put on trial for sexual inde-
cency and "crimes against public morality." In 1868, Le Figaro attacked Zola's novel Thérèse Raquin as "putrid
literature" for its depiction of adultery, murder, and scandalous sexuality in nineteenth-century Paris. A century
later, Gide, Colette, and Duras continued to shock French readers with their extraordinary novels on male and
female homosexuality, inter-generational lovers, and bi-racial relationships. In this course, we will examine a
wide range of issues on eroticism and sexuality in nineteenth- and twentieth-century French literature, including
marriage and adultery, seduction and desire, love and betrayal, prostitution and fetishism, gay and lesbian identi-
ty, cross-dressing and gender representation, exoticism and colonial (s)exploitation. Readings to include novels,
shorts stories, and poems by Chateaubriand, Constant, Duras, Balzac, Flaubert, Baudelaire, Zola, Maupassant,
Barbey d'Aurevilly, Gide, Proust, Colette, Duras, and Guibert. Conducted in French.
Format: seminar. Requirements: active class participation, two short papers, an oral presentation, and a final pa-

RLFR 311(F) Francophone Cinema
This course immerses students into Francophone African and Caribbean cinema. The issues explored include
colonial and postcolonial mentalities, social realism, tradition and modernity, women's roles, African immigra-
tion to Europe, popular culture and the diaspora. The course examines the evolution of African cinema from its
beginning in the 1950's to the present. We will observe how this medium moved from being used as a tool for
colonial conquest, as a means for satisfying some exotic needs of the West, to adevice for ethnographic research,
what Jean Rouch refers to as "ethnofiction". Then, refusing to be subjected to the only perspective of the Other,
African filmmakers from the 1960's struggled to conquer the art by imposing their own perspective, by claiming
Romance Languages
­ 295 ­
the right for Africans to be seen through their own eyes. The course also studies the relationship between Africa
and the Caribbean as expressed for example through the topic of the initiatory journey, an allegory of the quest
for identity and for the past. Films studied include Bassek Ba Kobhio's Le grand Blanc de Lambarene, Kramo-
Lanciné Fadika's Djeli, conte d'aujourd'hui, Mweze Ngangura's Pièces d'identité, Ousmane Sembene's Xala
and Moolaadé, Anne-Laure Folly's Femmes aux yeux ouverts, Moufida Tlatli's Les silences du Palais, Adama
Drabo's Ta Dona, Dani Kouyaté's Kéita! L'héritage du griot, Souleymane Cissé's Yeelen, Merzak Allouache's

RLFR 314(F) Between the Two World Wars
The period from 1913 to 1939 was an adventurous time for the French novel. In this course, we will study novels
by Gide, Proust, Colette, Camus, Martin du Gard, Mauriac, Malraux, and Sartre. Although there is great diversi-
ty among these authors, they were all reacting to the aftermath of the First World War and the breakdown of
traditional French culture. Through the popular character of the rebellious adolescent, they experimented with
revolt against the stifling social order of Church and family. The real challenge of the period, however, concerned
not a break with the past or discoveries of new levels of consciousness and freedom, but rather the mature accep-
tance of responsibility for the future and the articulation of fresh spiritual and political visions. Conducted in
French. Requirements: several short papers and oral class presentations. Prerequisites: any French literature
course or permission of the instructor.

RLFR 408(S) Senior Seminar. Fantastic Spaces and Imaginary Places: Literary Texts and Images
in Medieval and Early Modern French Literature (Same as Comparative Literature 358)
When Aristotle speaks of Homer's powers of language, he describes the Poet's skill as a function of energy and
eye, the capacity to represent everything as moving and living and thus to be graphic, to make the audience
actually see things through words. Medieval and Renaissance French writers based their literary projects on these
ancient theories of visualization and presentation. The result was a period of intense literary creativity that
encompasses a kaleidoscope of issues converging both on poetics and painting as well as on concepts of
architectural and landscape design. This capacity to imagine is at the heart of writing about travel, exploration,
discovery, spatial and natural description, phantasmagoric quests, poetic ecstasy, and the contemplation of mind.
The primary vehicle through which we will examine these issues is the literary text: namely, Jean de Meung's
Roman de la Rose and the allegory of love, Guillaume Du Bellay's Antiquités de Rome and Regrets, François
Rabelais's grotesque epic of the giants, Gargantua and Pantagruel, Pierre de Ronsard's sonnet cycles on love
and nature (Les Amours), and Michel de Montaigne's Essais and the spatialization of mind. We will examine
how these overarching literary issues intersect with parallel developments in the visual arts (Burgundy of the
15th century, The School of Fontainebleau, Clouet), ecclesiastical and domestic architecture, including the
development of the château, landscape design and its allegorical configurations, and the discovery of the New
World. Conducted in French.
Format: seminar. Requirements: class participation, three five-page papers, a midterm examination, and an oral
presentation.
Prerequisites: French 109, 110, 111, or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 15 (expected: 10). Preference

SPANISH
The Spanish major consists of nine courses above the 103-104 level. These nine courses include 301,
any 200 level or above (excluding RLSP 205 and RLSP 303), and 403. One 200-level course must be
completed at Williams. Other courses, taken at overseas programs, may be used to satisfy the requirements
of the major, with approval of the department. The Spanish faculty strongly suggests that students take 201
and 200 at some point in their studies, and especially recommends that they do so before rather than after
studying abroad.
The major seeks to provide training in literary analysis and linguistic expression, as well as an appreci-
ation of Hispanic civilization, through the study of the major writers of the Spanish-speaking world.
Students majoring in Spanish may replace one of their Spanish electives with a course in Comparative
Literature, with one course in Latin-American Studies that is 200-level or higher, or with a course in Lin-
guistics.
Inasmuch as all courses in Spanish assume the active participation of each student in discussions con-
ducted in the foreign language, regular attendance at class meetings is expected.
Courses numbered in the 100s are language courses, with 105 and 106 combining grammar and litera-
ture. RLSP 200 and RLSP 201 focus on civilization and culture, while other 200-level classes serve as
gateway courses for literary study, in ascending order of difficulty; they are thus suitable for first-years and
sophomores. Courses in the 300s require both serious grounding in the study of literature and an advanced
command of the language. The 400-level course offered annually is the senior seminar, serving as "cap-
stone course" to the Spanish major.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN SPANISH
Candidates for a senior thesis must have maintained a 3.5 GPA in the major by the time of proposal
submission. Two alternative routes are available to those who wish to apply for the degree with honors.
The first of these involves the writing of a senior thesis. Honors candidates are required to have main-
tained a GPA of 3.5 in the major to qualify for submitting a thesis proposal.
By May 15th of their junior year, candidates will have found a thesis advisor, and given the Department
a three- to five-page proposal and a preliminary bibliography. (In some cases, and upon consultation with
the Department, candidates will have the option to choose a second reader in addition to their primary
advisor; for example, when the thesis is interdisciplinary enough in nature that it requires the expertise of an
additional reader).
This proposal will be discussed by the Department; by June 1st, the candidate will be informed whether
he/she can proceed with the thesis, and if so, what changes need to be made to the focus and scope of the
project. The summer before the senior year will be spent compiling a more detailed bibliography and read-
ing.
Upon their return to Williams, candidates will devote to their theses two semesters of independent study
(beyond the nine courses required for the major) and the winter study period of their senior year
Romance Languages
­ 297 ­
(493-W31-494). The thesis will be written in Spanish and will usually not be shorter than fifty pages. By
the end of the Fall semester, students will normally have a clear outline of the project, have done substantial
research, and produced the draft of at least the first half of the project. During January this draft will be
suitably rewritten and edited with a view to a final version, while the candidates will also begin work on
remaining chapters.
Candidates will submit what they have written to the department on the last day of Winter Study.
On the Tuesday of the first week of the spring semester candidates will make a presentation of the proj-
ect at a departmental colloquium in Spanish . The thesis will be promptly discussed and evaluated to deter-
mine whether or not the student should continue in the honors program. The second semester of indepen-
dent thesis work will be spent writing more chapters, as well as revising, rewriting, and polishing the proj-
ect where necessary. The completed thesis in its final form will be due on April 25th. At the end of the
Spring term, the student will present and defend the final project before members of the Department and
others by invitation. The grade will be awarded once members of the Department have consulted after the
defense.
The second route is a group of three clearly related courses (offered by the Department of Romance
Languages or by other departments, such as History, Art, Philosophy, English, etc.), only one of which
may be counted in the nine courses comprising the major. One of the courses will be an Independent Study
(plus senior year WSP 030) in the spring of the senior year, at the end of which the student will write an
essay that synthesizes the content of the three related courses. Students may apply for this route by Novem-
ber 2 of the senior year.
In the case of both routes to the degree with honors, the department's recommendation for graduation
with honors will be based on the originality and thoroughness of the finished project.
THE CERTIFICATE IN SPANISH
The Certificate in Spanish Language and Culture consists of a sequence of seven courses for which the
student must earn a cumulative grade average of B or higher. In addition, the student must take a proficien-
cy test and achieve a score of "Advanced." The test will be administered by the department once a year
during the month of April to all students desirous of obtaining the Certificate. Those so interested should
express their intent to the chair of the department by March 1 or earlier.
For students with no prior Spanish background, the course sequence will consist of Spanish 101-102,
Spanish 103 and 104, and three courses in Spanish above the 104 level, with at least one of these courses at
the 200-level or higher taken at Williams. If the student starts out the sequence at Spanish 103, in addition
to the three courses in Spanish beyond the 104 level (including a 200-level course or higher), two electives
may be taken in other departments. One elective should be in Spanish or Latin-American cultural history
(art, literature, drama, music) and the other in Spanish or Latin-American intellectual, political, or social
history. Spanish 200, 201, or 208 can be counted for the elective requirement.
Electives may be considered from a variety of departments and programs. However, students should
consult with the chair of Romance Languages before making any enrollment decisions.
PLACEMENT
A placement test in Spanish is administered at Williams at the opening of the fall semester. Incoming
first-year students who wish to register for any Spanish courses above the 101 level must take this test.
STUDY ABROAD
Spanish majors, as well as non-majors interested in further exposure to the language and the culture, are
strongly encouraged to include study in Spain or Latin America as part of their program at Williams.
Through its special ties with the Hamilton College Academic Year in Spain, the department offers a com-
prehensive linguistic and cultural experience in a Spanish-speaking environment, for periods either of a
semester or a year. Credit for up to four courses can be granted at the discretion of the Department for study
overseas. Students interested in study abroad should consult with a member of the department at their earli-
est convenience.

RLSP 201(F) (formerly 111) The Cultures of Spain
Linguistically, culturally, and historically, the Iberian peninsula bears the traces of the past civilizations that once
inhabited the land. Iberians, Celts, Phoenicians, Greeks, Carthaginians, Romans, Visigoths, Arabs, and Jews
have all been instrumental in shaping the modern nation and the contributions of these groups are the starting
point in any understanding of Spain's rich cultural heritage and traditions. Cultural diversity in contemporary
Spain reflects at once the distinct autonomous regions which constitute the socio-political fabric of the country,
such as Catalonia and the Basque Country, and also patterns of migration both within and beyond the European
Union. In this course we will examine and consider Spain past and present. We will study periods of tolerance
and cultural brilliance, such as the co-existence of Arabs and Jews in Medieval Cordoba, as well as censorship
and repression, brought about by the institution of the Inquisition, for example, or during the Franco Regime.
Materials will include representative works from literature, art, architecture, music, and film. Secondary texts
providing essential socio-political and historical context will be supplied. Conducted in Spanish.
Requirements: active participation in class discussions, an oral presentation, several short writing assignments, a
midterm and a final. Prerequisites: Spanish 105, permission of instructor, or results of the Williams College

RLSP 220(S) Women in Twentieth-Century Spain (Same as Women's and Gender Studies 222)
From the early twentieth century to the present day, the radical changes in the lives of Spanish women have
clearly reflected the tug of war between progress and tradition in recent Spanish history.The dramatic upheavals
in Spanish politics have marked and transformed the lives of women to such a great extent that one can often
gauge the political and social climate of any given historical moment by considering how the role of women was
defined by the law, the Catholic church, education, and other social and political institutions. Using literary and
historical texts as well as films and graphic materials, this course will look at the transformations in the public and
private lives of Spanish women during the following periods: the turn of the century, the Second Republic, the
Spanish Civil War, the Franco years, and the transition to democracy.
Format: seminar. Requirements: RLSP 105 or above, or results of the Williams College Placement Exam, or
permission of instructor.
Prerequisites: Spanish 201, permission of the instructor, or acceptable results of the Williams College Placement

RLSP 230T(F) Violent States, Violent Subjects: Nation-Building and Atrocity in 19th Century
Latin America (Same as Comparative Literature 230T) (W)*
Although the massive, mechanized wars of the 20th century often overshadow earlier conflicts, the 19th century
was also a period of widespread bloodshed in Latin America. Even after the carnage of the Independence Wars
came to an end, the new republics continued some of the most violent pursuits of the colonial period: indigenous
peoples were conquered, their lands settled by whites or used for grazing cattle, and blacks (often despite the
official abolition of slavery) continued to suffer exclusion and physical violence. It was a century of civil wars
(Mexico, Argentina, Peru, Uruguay, Colombia, Venezuela) and of two bitter international wars, the Paraguayan
War (1864-1870) and the Pacific War (1879-1883), each of which would have a lasting impact on the countries
involved. In this tutorial we will explore the literary links between some of the violent conflicts listed above and
the foundation of national identities in Latin America, reading texts that probe the social and ethical implications
of State-sponsored violence. Issues to be explored include militarism and the development of nationalism;
genocide and the national community; torture, truth and testimony; and the nature of civilization. We will read
two key precursors (selections from Ercilla's epic "La Araucana" and Aphra Behn's "Oroonoko") and a variety
of 19th century texts that may include works by Juan Francisco Manzano, Esteban Echeverría, Ricardo Palma,
Eduarda Mansilla, Dorotea Duprat de Lassere and Lucio V. Mansilla. In addition, we will read a few
contemporary texts, written in the aftermath of the most recent dictatorships in the Southern Cone and elsewhere,
that actively reflect on the long history of State-sponsored violence in Latin America (Piglia, Eltit, Roa Bastos).
Format: tutorial. Students will decide whether they prefer to take the course in Spanish (for spanish/comparative
literature credit) or in English (for comparative literature credit). Students will work in pairs throughout the
semester, each group meeting with the instructor once a week. Each week one of the students will present a 4- to
5-page paper on the assigned reading and the other will critique the paper orally.
Prerequisites: Spanish 200 or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Preference given to
Spanish and Comparative Literature majors.

we will examine both the fact of dictatorship itself and the diverse representation thereof in Spanish-American
fiction. Novels by Garcia Marquez, Carpentier, Fuentes, Poniatowska, and Tomas Eloy Martinez will be closely
studied. Students will also read Absalom! Absalom! by Faulkner, whose influence on Latin-American authors'
techniques of representation has been decisive and profound. Conducted in Spanish.

Associate: KUSTOVA.
LANGUAGE STUDY
The department provides language instruction to enable the student to acquire all four linguistic skills:
understanding, speaking, reading, and writing. Russian 101-W88-102 covers the basics of Russian gram-
mar. Russian 103 and 104 offer additional instruction in grammar and provide extensive practice in reading
and conversation. Russian 201 and 202 aim to develop facility in speaking, writing, and reading.
STUDY ABROAD
The department strongly encourages students desiring to attain fluency in Russian to spend a semester
or year studying in Russia or one of the former Soviet republics. Students generally apply to one of several
approved foreign study programs. Russian 104 or the equivalent and junior standing are normally prereq-
uisite for study abroad.
LITERATURE AND CULTURE IN TRANSLATION
The department regularly offers courses on Russian literature and culture in English for those students
who have little or no knowledge of Russian, but who wish to become acquainted with the major achieve-
ments in Russian literary and cultural history.
THE CERTIFICATE IN RUSSIAN
To enhance a student's educational and professional profiles, the Certificate in Russian offers a useful
tool for using the language in a wide variety of disciplines. The sequence of language and culture courses is
designed to supplement a student's major at Williams by enabling the student to expand his or her knowl-
edge in a related field.
Students who enter Williams with previous training in Russian may substitute more advanced courses
for the 100- and 200-level courses; they can also be exempted from up to two of the required courses.
Thus, in order to earn a certificate a student must take no fewer than five courses (including three language
courses) after enrolling at Williams.
Students must receive a minimum grade of B in each course taken in the sequence. In addition, they
must receive a score of at least 85% on a standardized language proficiency test administered by the de-
partment.

THE MAJOR
The Russian major offers students an interdisciplinary approach to the intellectual and cultural history of
Russia and the former Soviet republics. Students complete the major by combining courses in Russian
language and literature with courses in history, political science, music, economics, and art.
For students who start Russian at Williams, the major requires a minimum of ten courses: Russian
101-102, 103, 104, 201, 202, and 402; one elective in Russian above 202; and two electives from either
Russian courses above 202 or appropriate offerings of other departments.
For students who have acquired intermediate or greater proficiency in the language before coming to
Williams, the minimum requirement is nine courses: Russian 402; one elective in Russian above 203; and
seven other courses selected from Russian courses above 102 and appropriate offerings in other depart-
ments.
Students selecting the major must normally complete Russian 202 or the equivalent by the end of the
junior year. Majors will normally be expected to take the 400-level seminar offered in their senior year,
even if they have previously taken another version.
Examples of appropriate courses in other departments are:
History 140 Fin-de Siecle Russia: Cultural Splendor, Imperial Decay
History 240 Muscovy and the Russian Empire
History 241 The Rise of the Soviet Union
History 440 Reform, Revolution, Terror: Russia, 1900-1939
Russian majors may receive major credit for as many as four courses taken during study abroad.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN RUSSIAN
At the beginning of the second semester of the senior year, students may nominate themselves to candi-
dacy for the degree with honors. By the end of the junior year at the latest, however, they will have estab-
lished in consultation with the department their qualifications for embarking on the project, the pattern of
study to be followed, and the standards of performance.
Students earn a degree with honors by submitting a senior thesis (493-W31-494) of honors quality.

RUSS 307(F) Music and Nineteenth-Century Russian Literature
Albeit distinct art forms, music and literature have enjoyed a very fruitful relationship in a number of artistic
traditions, and this was particularly true in the rich and varied cultural life of nineteenth-century Russia.
Musicians, composers, or even specific compositions, sometimes became the subject of literary masterpieces.
Other times it was a celebrated work of literature that inspired incidental music, romances, and operas. In this
course we will examine the broad and fascinating relationship between literature and music in short works by
Odoevsky, Pushkin, Turgenev, Tolstoy, Kuprin, and Chekhov. We will study the role that music played in belles
lettres as thematic element, cultural commentary, and structuring principle. All primary texts will be read in the
original, but some secondary readings will be in English. Class will be conducted entirely in Russian.
Format: seminar. Requirements: active class participation, regular reading, listening, and viewing assignments,
frequent short writing assignments, and a final presentation.

tension resulting from the collaborative nature of dramatic performance, as well as attempts to resolve this ten-
sion on the Russian stage. Readings will include a variety of plays, contemporary theories of drama and the the-
ater, criticism, and reviews. In addition to reading the classics of the Russian dramatic repertoire (Griboedov,
Pushkin, Gogol, Ostrovskii, Chekhov, etc.), we will also explore the role of drama and performance within Rus-
sian culture. All course readings will be in the original, and the seminar will be conducted entirely in Russian.

Science and Technology Studies (SCST) is an interdisciplinary program concerned with science and
technology and their relationship to society. In addition to being concerned with the historical development
and a philosophical understanding of the ideas and institutions of science and technology; Science and
Technology Studies also examines their ethical, economic, social, and political implications.
The role that science and technology have played in shaping modern industrial societies is generally
acknowledged, but few members of those societies, including scientists and engineers, possess any under-
standing of how that process has occurred or much knowledge of the complex technical and social interac-
tions that direct change in either science or society. The Science and Technology Studies Program is in-
tended to help create a coherent course of study for students interested in these questions by providing a
broad range of perspectives. At present, courses are offered which examine the history or philosophy of
science and technology, the sociology and psychology of science, the economics of research and develop-
ment and technological change, science and public policy, technology assessment, technology and the en-
vironment, scientometrics, and ethical-value issues.
To complete the requirements of the program, students must complete six courses. The introductory
course and senior seminar are required and three elective courses are chosen from the list of designated
electives. Students may choose to concentrate their electives in a single area such as technology, American
studies, philosophy, history of science, economics, environment, current science, or current technology,but
are encouraged to take at least one elective in history, history of science, or philosophy. The sixth course
necessary to complete the program is one semester of laboratory or field science in additiontotheCollege's
three-course science requirement. Other science courses of particular interest include Chemistry 110 and
Biology 134.
The program is administered by a chair and an advisory committee of faculty who teach in the program.
Students who wish to enroll normally register with the chair by the fall of their junior year.

SCST 401(F) Senior Seminar: Critical Perspectives on Science and Technology
A research-oriented course designed to give students direct experience in evaluating and assessing scientific and
technological issues. Students initially study particular techniques and methodologies by employing a case study
approach. They then apply these methods to a major research project. Students may choose topics from fields
such as biotechnology, computers, biomedical engineering, energy, and other resource development. Students
will apply their background of historical, philosophical, and technological perspectives in carrying out their
study.

WILLIAMS PROGRAM IN TEACHING
Director, SUSAN ENGEL
The program in teaching is designed to enable Williams Undergraduates to study the ideas, questions,
and practices involved in good teaching at all levels. The program seeks to promote and facilitate an ex-
change of ideas about teachers, learners and schools, within and beyond the Williams campus. The pro-
gram offers a range of opportunities including courses on education, intensive supervised student teaching,
workshops, advising, lecture series, and ongoing peer groups for those who teach. Students may participate
in a variety of ways, ranging from taking one course to a sustained in-depth study of teaching and learning
geared to those who want to become teachers, or educational psychologists. We seek to connect students
with one another, to bring in expert teachers to provide mentoring, and to create links across the curriculum
so that students can see the vital connections between what they study (French, Algebra or Biology for
instance) and the process of teaching those topics to elementary and high school students. The program is
open to any student interested in education and offers opportunities for all levels of interest, including those
who want to find out about certification and graduate study. Students seeking certification through an ar-
rangement with the Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts (MCLA) should consult with Susan Engel be-
fore the end of their sophomore year.
The following provides a sample outline of the sequence of courses and experiences that an interested
student might take
z
Psychology 101 Intro to Psych (required for further psychology courses);
z
Psychology 232 Developmental Psychology and/or
z
Psychology 242 Social Psychology;
z

z
At least one Winter Study in an intensive teaching practicum. The major programs are in Berk-
shire County (under PSYC) or in New York City (under SPEC), although other opportunities
may be listed elsewhere in the Winter Study section of the course catalogue.
No specific major is required to participate in the program--although some lend themselves easily to
certification, such as Mathematics, English, Biology, American history, or French, almost all of our majors
can provide the basis of teacher certification. Alternately, students can major in Psychology, take a con-
centration of courses in a different field, and then pursue that content area more intensively in graduate
work.

As a reflection of the theatre's historical relationship to literature and the arts, stage production is studied
in the context of the literary and artistic movements which have informed theatrical endeavor. The major in
Theatre emphasizes the collaborative nature of the discipline by drawing upon courses offered by faculty
of the Language, Literature, Music, and Art Departments. Although students will be equipped to proceed
to graduate and professional schools in theatre, the major is primarily directed toward those interested in
studying the theatre as an artistic phenomenon and as an interpretive tool. Because a deep understanding of
theatre requires training and experience with the synthesis on stage, the major includes curricular study of
production and performance, as well as continued participation in departmental stage production.
Williamstheatre, the production arm of the Department of Theatre, operates under the supervision of the
departmental faculty. Major departmental productions as well as laboratory and experimental productions
of all kinds are mounted on the new stages of the '62 Center for Theatre and Dance. Participation in acting
or technical work is open to all members of the Williams College community. Students majoring in
Theatre will be asked to consult regularly with departmental advisors in devising the sequence of courses
and production participation that will constitute their major.
MAJOR
The major in Theatre requires six specific courses, plus three electives as specified below. The specific
courses are:
Theatre 103 Acting I
Theatre 102 Theatre Technologies
Theatre 201 Theatrical Design: Process and Collaboration
One course focusing on Critical Studies/Dramatic Literature taught from within the department and to
be taken in first two years (prospective majors should consult with department chair for a list of ap-
propriate courses)
Prospective theatre majors should attempt to complete the above four courses, in no particular order, by the
end of sophomore year.
The remaining two specific courses are:
Theatre 301 Junior Seminar
Theatre 401/402 Independent Senior Practicum
Students must also take three electives from the department's other offerings, and at least one of these elec-
tives must be drawn from each of the two categories "Theatre Scholarship" and "Theatre Practice."
Theatre Practice: courses where students learn the basic artistic skills of theatre practice through creative
endeavor. (Examples: Acting, Scenic Design, Lighting Design, Costume Design, Directing.)
Theatre Scholarship: courses where students employ critical skills through research and reflection focused
on the traditional canon or on selected more recently defined subject areas. (Examples: Approaching Per-
formance Studies, Contemporary Play and Performance Analysis, Theatre History, Classical Drama,
Modern Drama, Shakespeare, African American Drama, Performance and the Law).
Courses which mix modes of inquiry between the above categories may be counted in either; in any case,
majors should consult with the department chair to assure an adequate distribution of electives.
The department strongly recommends that students elect additional collateral courses in dramatic litera-
ture taught by the English, Classics, and modern language departments, and courses in opera taught by the
Music Department. Students with an interest in theatre design should particularly elect Art Studio courses
in drawing.
Production requirement for the major: All majors in Theatre are required to participate in a minimum of
eight department productions in addition to the laboratory requirement for Theatre 102. Participation in at
least three of the eight must be in technical production, and one must be in stage management. Assignment
to productions is normally made in consultation with the department chair.
Theatre majors are strongly urged to include dance and fencing in fulfilling their Physical Education
requirements.

taken in other Departments. Students should also list and describe relevant independent studies and
production credits.
2. The second part of the portfolio will include a selection of materials developed for these courses and
productions listed in Part 1. The selection should include at least three papers or samples of other
written work, and might also include design projects, director's notebooks, studio art projects, actor's
journals or other forms of documentation of the candidate's work. For students who have taken a
semester away, it is particularly important that they provide the Department with a detailed picture of
their activities while studying off-campus. Course descriptions and syllabi should be submitted in
addition to a list of courses taken and activities performed.
3. The third part of the portfolio is an annotated bibliography of dramatic texts which the student has
read, drawn from a list supplied by the Department. Annotations should be based upon a particular
angle of engagement with the text, that reflects the area or areas that the student has chosen to empha-
size in their theatrical training. For instance, one might choose to write from the point of view of an
actor, a designer, a director, a playwright, or a dramaturg.
4. The portfolio should conclude with a retrospective essay that reflects on the materials that are being
submitted. Students should look for connections between the various aspects of their work, state any
theoretical positions that they have come to embrace, assess their strengths and weaknesses, and dis-
cuss their educational goals for their work with the Department during their Senior year.
The portfolio will be examined alongside the student's record and his or her project description; a deter-
mination will then be made as to admission into the Honors program. Students intending to apply for Hon-
ors should meet with the Department Chair by the end of the fall semester of their junior year. Once a
student is admitted to the Honors program, the department Chair will assign an Honors Project Advisor,
who will work with the student to specify a timeline and work program for the completion of the Honors
Project. At a minimum, this will entail enrollment in Theatre 493 or 494, plus W32, plus one other course
offered either within the department or elsewhere that the candidate and thesis advisor designate as contrib-
uting specifically to the overall goals of the honors work. This honors elective may not fulfill any other
portion of the Theatre Major, or any other major the student may be pursuing. All honors candidates will
present their completed projects to the Department Honors Committee for evaluation. Honors candidates
are exempt from the senior project in theatre (THEA 401/402).
STUDY ABROAD
The Theatre Department attempts to work individually with majors and prospective majors who desire
to study abroad. In general, with careful planning it is usually quite easy for students to complete the major
in Theatre if they study abroad in the spring of their junior year. For those wishing to study abroad in the fall
of junior year, a more complicated situation may arise, but one that can often be successfully managed
through close consultation with the department chair. Students are encouraged to consult with the chair
early in their Williams careers if they anticipate a combination of Theatre major and study abroad.
THEA 102(F) Introduction to Theatre Technology
As an overview of performance spaces, play technologies, and production, the course will examine how and
where plays are performed, produced, and designed. Students will attend lectures, participate in labs in drafting

THEA 201(S) Theatrical Design: Process of Collaboration
This course examines the designer's process and collaborative role in the creation of theatre through a combina-
tion of lecture, discussion, and individual/group projects. Text and music will be analyzed in ways that help clari-
fy how a designer develops a point of view while solving the practical needs of production. All aspects of
Theatre
­ 307 ­
design--scenery, lighting, costume, and sound--will be explored with particular emphasis on how these ele-
ments synthesize and contribute to the larger intellectual, emotional, and physical context of the stage. Basic
presentation skills and technique will be taught as crucial elements of design development.
Evaluation will be based upon committed class participation and thoughtful, timely completion of all assign-
ments and projects.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 10.
Hour: 1:10-3:50 MR LIEBERMAN
THEA 204(S) Acting II
Building on the foundation of Theatre 103, students will develop performance skills in the realist tradition, pri-
marily through intense scene work. Readings will include selections by Stanislavsky, Meisner, Adler, or similar
theorists. Improvisation may be used to explore simplicity, clarity of expression, listening, and specificity in the
actor's task. Focus on the imagination and creation of character will be emphasized through the scene work. The
dramatic literature employed will range from early realist/naturalist classics to contemporary playwriting. Stu-
dents will reflect critically on their progress through written and oral critiques. Scene work will require extensive
preparation outside of class.
Prerequisites: Theatre 103 and sophomore standing. Enrollment limit: 14.

THEA 211(F) Topics in African-American Performance: The Civil Rights and Black Arts
Movement On and Off the Stage (Same as Africana Studies 211 and American Studies 211)*
1960s are often said to be the most political moment in African American history because of the emergence of
two sociopolitical movements simultaneously. The black theatre of and about the period reflects the two
movements that shaped it-the mostly Southern, rural-based Civil Rights Movement, and the mostly Northern,
urban-centered Black Arts Movement. Beginning in 1955, we will look at public performance in the black
community by revisiting the funeral of Emmett Till and the black church as represented in The Amen Corner by
James Baldwin. We will then move to the first play to be directed, written and acted by African Americans on
Broadway, Lorraine Hansberry's A Raisin in the Sun (1959). From Hansberry, we will look at other Broadway
work by Baldwin (Blues for Mr. Charlie, 1964) and Ossie Davis (Purlie Victorious, 1961), both based in the civil
rights movement. We will then move south geographicallyto consider the integrated theatre company that toured
Mississippi during the Voter Rights Campaign of 1964, the Free Southern Theater. The FST itself moved from a
theatre of the Civil Rights Movement to a theatre of the Black Arts Movement. We will then transition to the
work of the Black Arts playwrights LeRoi Jones/Imamu Amiri Baraka, Ed Bullins, Ron Milner, Sonia Sanchez,
Adrienne Kennedy, Alice Childress, Douglas Turner Ward and Joseph A. Walker. These Black Arts
playwrights/activits were all generating plays written in the black idiom and were then produced at new,
black-run theatres such as the New Lafayette in Harlem and the Negro Ensemble Company, as well as
commercial and non-profit theatres on and off-Broadway in New York and Los Angeles, and on college
campuses.
Format: seminar. Evaluation based on two group scene projects, one 10-20 pp. final paper on an assigned topic,
class participation and class attendance.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected 15). Preference, in order, given to sophomores, Theatre majors,
and Africana Studies concentrators.
Hour: 1:10-2:25 TF BEAN
THEA 214(F) Writing for the Theatre (Same as English 214)
A course designed for those interested in writing and creating for the theatre. The course will include a study of
playwriting in various styles and genres, a series of set exercises involving adaptation and the use of dialogue, as
well as individual projects. We will read and we will write, beginning with small exercises and working toward a
longer project. Students will be expected to share in each other's work on a weekly basis.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on attendance, completion of class assignments, and class
participation.

The medium of theatre is both ancient and, paradoxically, perhaps our most fluid and immediate. What do our
plays say about our world today? Join a working playwright in reading the new plays she finds most vital and
exciting, including the work of Caryl Churchill, Suzan-Lori Parks, Tom Stoppard, and Paula Vogel, as well as

THEA 220(S) Approaching Performance Studies (Same as ArtS 204 and Women's and Gender
Studies 220) (W)
Whether engaged with a `dialogical aesthetic' (Grant Kester) or intentional movement and sound in relation to
narrative, place or phenomena, we explore in this class elements from many fields: anthropology, dramatic
theory, post-structuralism, psychoanalytic theory, folklore, religion, cultural studies, literary theory, philosophy,
feminist theory, and queer theory. The forms we'll consider as the interdisciplinary meeting ground for those
studies include theatre, film, video, music, dance, visual art, performance art, community activism, celebrations,
parades, and public gatherings. As we read and watch performances, questions will be raised: What are the
parameters? Are social attributes, such as ethnicity or sexuality, staged? Are cultural activities, such as tourism,
beyond our purview or are they performed and displayed as they are lived? Are spectacles, simulations and
consumption culturally specific?
This course is the introduction course for the Performance Studies Program.
Format: seminar. Evaluation is based on one short presentation, two short papers, final performance project, class
discussion and class attendance.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected 10). Not open to first-year students

THEA 228(F) Theatrical Self-Production
In today's theater world, self-production can be a vital, engaging, and necessary method of creating and
producing theatrical works. This course examines theatrical self-production and the ways in which artists exploit
this model in pursuit of their individual and collective ambitions. Through a careful examination of successes and
failures in contemporary theatrical collectives, this class will form its own unique structure for developing and
producing a range of new, innovative, and thematically linked artistic work. Operating within carefully chosen
constraints, students will share equally the administrative, artistic, and production roles in the public presentation
of their works. Thus, a major emphasis of the course will be on experiential education, which provides an
invaluable opportunity to encounter firsthand the highly complex relationship between artistry and production.
An important component of the class will be ongoing symposium with practitioners from the profession, as well
as the Department of Theater, that will focus on a range of specifically targeted skill sets necessary for students to
realize their goals. Systematic group presentations of the creative development process will provide opportunities
for guidance, critique, and sustained mentorship.
Format: seminar. Evaluation: Students will complete a comprehensive self-evaluation as a final project. Grading
will be based on committed class participation, contribution to the collective work of the class, group and
individual presentations, and self-evaluation. Students from a broad range of curricular disciplines are welcome.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limited: 20 (expected:15). First-year students may be accepted with approval of
instructor. Upon overenrollemt, the instructors will seek to balance the course by level of prior theatrical
experience.

THEA 301(F) Junior Seminar: Theory and Practice
This course provides advanced examination of theatre modes and theories, explored through reading and
analysis of dramatic works, representing eras from Aristotle to the present. We will begin the semester with an
in-depth analysis of the South African play TSHEPANG, by Lara Foote-Newton, which will be presented at the
'62 Center in early Fall. The class will examine how the form and structure of the production evolves from the
idea of the play, and conversely, how the content has influenced the dramatic elements seen on stage. The class
will study the implications of Aristotle's theory of catharsis--the purgation of emotions through their
representation on stage. We will look at how that theory of theatre has been applied through the centuries. Each
week, one student will be responsible for presenting a paper to the seminar based on the area being studied that
week. Papers are to be distributed to all members of the seminar at least two days before presentation, so that
informed discussion can take place in class.
Each member of the seminar will mount an event at the end of the semester, representing an aspect of the work
we'll be studying.
Format: seminar. Requirements: Several presentations to the group. The papers presented will be graded and a
final presentation.

THEA 322(F) Performance Criticism (Same as Comparative Literature 322) (W)
There are two goals for this course: to have students see performance and write critically about it. Throughout the
course we will always be concerned with (1) the definition and practices of performance, (2) the ways of writing
critically about those practices, and (3) the conflicts between criticism and performance. The "definitions and
practices" of performance vary as widely as the "ways of writing critically," and we will be exposed to numerous
critical approaches to writing about performance. Live (CenterSeries, Williamstheatre productions, Dance
Program offerings) and recorded (film) performance will be considered the objects of study.
Format: seminar. Evaluation based on five pieces of critical writing on performance, oral analyses of colleagues'
work, class participation and class attendance.

Project. Majors will work with the department chair and the theatre faculty during junior year to determine the
goals and scope of the project, and, when a project is approved, the chair will assign a Project Advisor, who will
then be instructor for the independent study course. Senior projects may be artistic or scholarly in design and
execution, and should grow from students' experience within the curricular and extra-curricular work in the de-
partment. They may build on previous academic achievements, or venture into new territory, but should be con-
ceived as a capstone experience within the theatre major. Students may propose collaborative senior projects in
groups of two or more. If such projects are approved, students in such a group will either be assigned one or
multiple Project Advisors to oversee the work. In any case, each senior will be responsible for fulfilling a unique
and specific set of requirements for the course as set by the advisor at the start of the semester. Students accepted
into the Honors Program in Theatre are exempt from the Senior Project requirement.

Women's and Gender Studies can be defined as the study of how gender is constructed, how it is in-
flected by differences of race, ethnicity, sexuality, class, and so on, how gender affects the experiences and
Women's and Gender Studies
­ 311 ­
situations of men and women, and how assumptions about gender influence the construction of knowledge
and experience. Scholarship in Women's and Gender Studies has brought neglected material into estab-
lished fields and raised important methodological questions that cross disciplinary boundaries and chal-
lenge established intellectual frameworks. The program in Women's and Gender Studies thus includes
courses from a wide variety of disciplines that focus in a coherent way on gender issues, as well as core
courses that acquaint students with the interdisciplinarity of the field.
THE MAJOR
The Women's and Gender Studies major encourages exposure to the interdisciplinary character of femi-
nist scholarship. In addition, majors are required to gain some knowledge of methods within a field or
discipline (3 courses in one of the categories listed below), to appreciate the importance of diversity (racial,
sexual, class, ethnic, national, etc.) in scholarship on gender, to gain exposure to feminist theory, and to
pursue work at an advanced level (3 courses at the 300-level).
In order to ensure that students reflect about the paths that they choose through the major, each major
will be assigned to an advisor in the spring of the sophomore year. With the advisor, the student will estab-
lish a revisable course of study for the following two years. Students interested in declaring a major should
contact the chair of the Program (Kent, x2549).
[ ] Courses not offered in 2006-2007 are listed in brackets.
Required Courses
The major consists of at least 9 courses. The following are required:
Women's and Gender Studies 101 Introduction to Women's and Gender Studies
Women's and Gender Studies 402 Junior/Senior Seminar in Women's and Gender Studies (The seminar
explores topics in Women's and Gender Studies, and varies from year to year. Majors may take more than
one seminar, space permitting.)

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN WOMEN'S AND GENDER STUDIES
Honors in Women's and Gender Studies may be granted to majors after an approved candidate com-
pletes an honors project, delivers a public presentation of the work, and is awarded honors by the Women's
and Gender Studies Committee.
The honors project may be fall semester (plus winter study) or a year-long project. It may consist of a
conventional research thesis of 40-70 pages or of other modes of presentation (e.g., art, music, poetry, the-
ater, fiction). Proposals for non-thesis projects should include evidence of experience and competence in
the chosen mode.
A student may become a candidate for honors in Women's and Gender Studies after the following crite-
ria are met:
1). in April of the junior year, submission and Women's and Gender Studies Committee approval of a 4-
to 6-page project proposal, in which the ideas, aim, general methodology, and preliminary bibliogra-
phy for the project are outlined and a faculty advisor is named; prior to submission of this proposal,
students must consult with a reference librarian.
2). at the end of the junior year, cumulative grade point average of 3.5 from courses taken in the major;
3). in the first week of classes of the senior year, submission and approval by the faculty advisor and
second reader of a 5- to 10-page "Plan of Action" (an overview of what has already been completed
and a schedule of what needs to be accomplished to finish the project). Where appropriate, students
pursuing honors will continue to consult with the second reader over the course of the semester(s).
All honors work, including the public presentation, will be evaluated by the Women's and Gender Stud-
ies Committee. It will decide on the awarding of honors; the advisor will award the grade(s)
STUDY ABROAD
The Williams College Women's and Gender Studies Program encourages potential majors to study
abroad in order to enhance their education and gain international perspectives on gender and women's
issues and feminism. There are many excellent study abroad opportunities offering students a variety of

This course is designed to enable advanced Women's and Gender Studies students to engage in vital research on
interdisciplinary topics. Family and the myriad of issues often associated with it continue to be a central site for
debates within feminism, women's and gender studies. In this seminar we will explore some of the most conten-
tious and dynamic areas of contestation, such as arguments for and against marriage; claims for the connection
between reproduction, mothering, and woman's oppression; the gendered division of labor; feminist revisions
and rejections of the family; theories of how gender, racial identity, and sexuality are produced within the family;
the possibility of feminist parenting; the question of the relation of the family to the state; the idea of family as a
site for a transnational feminist politics. Emphasis will also be placed on exploring the historical and cultural
diversity of social arrangements that are gathered into (and often rendered invisible by) dominant definitions of
family. Course materials will draw from a variety of sources, and may include psychoanalysis, memoirs, novels
and poems, social history, parenting guides, sociological data, architecture, legal rulings on marriage and family,
collections of family photographs, political and economic theory.
Format: seminar. Requirements: weekly journal entries, several class presentations, and one substantial research
paper (15-20 pages).
Prerequisite: Women's and Gender Studies 101 and two electives (one of which may be taken during the spring
term in which the seminar is held). Non-majors who meet the prerequisites are welcome to enroll. Enrollment
limit: 15. (expected: 10).

CRITICAL REASONING AND
ANALYTICAL SKILLS (CRAAS) COURSES
Coordinator, Lecturer KAREN L. SHEPARD
To one degree or another, every class at Williams goes beyond its subject--be it mathematics, Machia-
velli, or modernism--to teach intellectual skills that have wide application in other fields as well as outside
of the academy: scientific reckoning, expository writing, rhetorical analysis, oral presentation, and so on.
Courses offered under the CRAAS initiative foreground such analytical skills. While each CRAAS
class covers a different topic, all are aimed particularly at developing the processes necessary for excel-
lence in a range of fields: techniques for analyzing ideas, data, texts or artworks; approaches to interpreting,
synthesizing, and developing arguments; strategies for presenting ideas and results.
CRAAS classes typically emphasize the practices of meta-analysis--self-criticism, editing, and revi-
sion--with the goal of constant improvement. Many classes feature peer tutoring, small group work, and
intensive one-on-one engagement with the professor. Students should leave a CRAAS course with a sub-
stantially heightened ability to approach problems, analyze texts, and craft arguments in whatever disci-
pline they may go on to explore.
A few CRAAS courses are restricted to advanced students, but the majority are open to all, and some are
specifically targeted for first year students. Most have strictly limited enrollment. Because these classes
cultivate the general strategies of effective scholarship, students are encouraged to consider taking a
CRAAS course early in their academic careers.

PEOPLES AND CULTURES COURSES
The peoples and cultures requirement is intended to help students to begin to understand the cultural
diversity of American society and the world at large, so that, as citizens of an increasingly interconnected
world, they may become better able to respond sensitively and intelligently to peoples of varied social
backgrounds and cultural frameworks. Courses which fulfill this requirement are thus designed to familiar-
ize students with some dimension of American cultural diversity or that of the non-Western world. Each
student must complete one graded semester course primarily concerned with: (a) the peoples and cultures
of North America that trace their origins to Africa, Asia, Latin America, Oceania, or the Caribbean; Native-
American peoples and cultures; or (b) the peoples and cultures of Africa, Asia, Latin America, Oceania, or
the Caribbean. Although this course, which may be counted toward the divisional distribution requirement,
may be completed any semester before graduation, students are urged to complete the course by the end of
the sophomore year.

QUANTITATIVE/FORMAL REASONING COURSES
Williams students should be adept at reasoning mathematically and abstractly. The ability to apply a
formal method to reach conclusions, to use numbers comfortably, and to employ the research tools neces-
sary to analyze data lessen barriers to carrying out professional and economic roles. Prior to their senior
year, all students must satisfactorily complete a Quantitative/Formal Reasoning (QFR) course--those
marked with a "(Q)." Students requiring extra assistance (as assessed during First Days) are normally
placed into Mathematics 100/101/102, which is to be taken before fulfilling the QFR requirement.
The hallmarks of a QFR course are the representation of facts in a language of mathematical symbols
and the use of formal rules to obtain a determinate answer. Primary evaluation in these courses is based on
multistep mathematical, statistical, or logical inference (as opposed to descriptive answers).
Courses that may be used to meet the requirement in 2006-2007:

RELATED COURSE LISTINGS
There are a number of significant areas of studies in which Williams offers many relevant courses, yet
no formal program. To alert students to the opportunity for integrating courses from diverse disciplines into
a focus area and to encourage them to do so, the courses in this section are organized as lists of topic-related
courses. For their full descriptions, see the respective departmental sections.
Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual Studies
Gay, lesbian, and bisexual studies focuses on the social construction of sexuality, past and present. Al-
though, at present, Williams does not have a formal concentration in gay, lesbian, and bisexual studies, the
College offers a number of courses which examine how social, cultural, and political institutions shape
sexualities, as well as the responses and resistances thereto, through a variety of texts and contexts. The
following courses include significant components on gay, lesbian, and bisexual studies (at least two weeks
out of the semester).

WRITING-INTENSIVE COURSES
Courses designated as "writing intensive"--those marked with a "(W)"--stress the process of learning
to write effectively. Such courses include a substantial amount of writing (a minimum of 20 pages), usually
divided into several discrete assignments. Instructors pay close attention to matters of style and argumenta-
tion. Enrollments are limited to 19.
All Williams College students are required to take two writing-intensive courses: one by the end of the
sophomore year and one by the end of the junior year. Students will benefit most from writing-intensive
courses by taking them early in their college careers and are therefore strongly encouraged to complete the
requirement by the end of the sophomore year.
Courses that may be used to meet the requirement in 2006-2007:

WILLIAMS OFF-CAMPUS PROGRAMS
WILLIAMS-EXETER PROGRAMME AT OXFORD UNIVERSITY
Directors, Professor GUY M. HEDREEN
and Professor ELIZABETH P. MCGOWAN
THE PROGRAMME
Williams College offers a year-long programme of studies at Oxford University in co-operation with
Exeter College (founded in 1314), one of the constituent colleges of the University. Williams students will
be enrolled as Visiting Students at Exeter and as such will be undergraduate members of the University,
eligible for access to virtually all of its facilities, libraries, and resources. As Visiting Students in Oxford,
students admitted to the Programme will be fully integrated into the intellectual and social life of one of the
world's great universities.
Although students in the Programme will be members of Exeter College, entitled to make full use of
Exeter facilities (including the College Library), dine regularly in Hall, and join all College clubs and orga-
nisations on the same terms as other undergraduates at Exeter, students will reside in Ephraim Williams
House, a compound of four buildings owned by Williams College, roughly 1.4 miles north of the city
centre. Three students from Exeter College will normally reside in Ephraim Williams House each year,
responsible for helping to integrate Williams students into the life of the College and the University. A
resident director (and member of the Williams Faculty) administers Ephraim Williams House, oversees the
academic programme, and serves as both the primary academic and personal advisor to Williams students
in Oxford.
Students enrolled in the Oxford Programme must enroll for the full academic year, which consists of
three academic terms, each of which includes eight full weeks of instruction: MICHAELMAS TERM
(early October to early December), HILARY TERM (mid-January to mid-March), and TRINITY TERM
(late April to late June). Students are expected to be in residence to write their first tutorial papers before the
eight weeks of instruction begins and to remain in residence during the week after the term ends in order to
sit their final examinations. Between the three terms there are two intervening four-five week vacations,
during which students may be expected to continue reading as preparation for their upcoming tutorials.
THE TUTORIAL SYSTEM
Undergraduate instruction at Oxford University is largely carried out through individual or small-group
tutorials, in which students meet weekly with their tutor to present and discuss an essay they have written,
based on an extensive amount of reading undertaken from an assigned reading list they will receive at the
beginning of each term. In addition to the weekly tutorial, students are from time to time encouraged to
attend a pertinent course of lectures offered by the University that corresponds to the material being ad-
dressed in their tutorials.
Each student will plan a course of study for the three terms of the academic year in consultation with the
director of the Programme. In his or her capacity as the Tutor for Visiting Students at Exeter College, the
director, working closely with Exeter's subject tutors, will arrange the teaching for the students, monitor
student progress, be in regular contact with the student's tutors, supervise the examinations that students
will sit at the end of each academic term, and report on each student's academic progress to the Senior
Tutor at Exeter College. There are no "add/drop" periods at Oxford; once a student has made a commit-
ment to a particular tutorial course, and the director has then secured a tutor to teach that course, students
cannot back out.
Over the course of the three terms, students are required to enroll in a minimum of FOUR full tutorial
courses (each consisting of eight individual tutorial meetings and requiring the preparation of eight essays)
and ONE half tutorial course (consisting of four individual tutorial meetings and the preparation of four
essays). Some students choose to substitute a fifth full tutorial course for the half tutorial course and a few
will decide to enroll in two full tutorial courses each term. The average course load undertaken by most
students in residence in Oxford during the past has been five full tutorial courses or their equivalent.
GRADES AND CREDIT
Grades for each tutorial course reflect the grade assigned to all eight (or four) tutorial sessions, including
their related essays, considered together, as well as the grade for the final examination on work accom-
plished in the individual tutorials and supplementary readings. Final examinations last three hours in the case
of full tutorial courses and two hours in the case of half tutorial courses and are always sat in the ninth week
of term, following the eight weeks of instruction each term. The final grade recorded on the Williams tran-
script is calculated by counting the grade for the tutorial meetings and essays as two-thirds of the grade and
Williams-Exeter Programme at Oxford
­ 330 ­
the final examination as one-third of the overall grade. For some tutorial courses (especially in writing and
the studio arts), tutors may offer the student the option of a final paper or project in lieu of an examination.
Upon satisfactory completion of the requirements for the Williams-Exeter Programme at Oxford Uni-
versity, students receive academic credit for a regular Williams academic year, the four tutorial courses
replacing the regular eight semester courses the student would normally take at Williams, the half tutorial
course replacing the Winter Study Course. Grades eventually become a part of their Williams transcript
and will be included in the computation of their Grade Point Average.
Tutorial courses in Oxford may be used toward fulfilling the divisional distribution requirement; a stu-
dent may earn a maximum of three distribution requirements, with no more than one from each division,
for the year. All tutorial courses at Oxford meet the Williams College "Writing Intensive" designation,
except for those in the studio arts, mathematics, and the sciences.
Tutorial courses in Oxford may also be used to meet major requirements. Some departments at Williams
will grant a two-course credit towards the major for each full tutorial course taken at Oxford, and one
course towards the major for each half tutorial course taken at Oxford. Most departments, however, will
grant a one-course credit towards the major for each relevant tutorial course taken at Oxford (whether a full
or a half). Students are encouraged to check with their department chair(s) to confirm official department
policy.
THE COURSE OF STUDY
Students are encouraged to pursue a course of study during their three terms at Oxford that best reflects
the strength of the University's offerings. In addition to the opportunity to pursue British and Common-
wealth Studies, Williams students in Oxford will be able to pursue tutorials in fields in which Oxford is
particularly noted (English Literature, Modern History, Philosophy, Politics, Classics, Theology, etc.). Ex-
eter College also has a Fellow in English Language and Literature (with interests ranging from the Renais-
sance--including Shakespeare--to the early nineteenth century) committed to teaching Williams students,
and students are thus encouraged to consider undertaking at least one tutorial course in these fields as part
of their course of study.
What follows is a list of tutorial courses normally available to students studying with the Williams-Exet-
er Programme at Oxford. The tutorials listed below (WIOX 311-384) represent a selection of some of the
standard "papers" (courses) that comprise the Oxford degrees in various subjects and that are taught in
tutorial format. Normally, but not always, tutors can be secured who can teach these subjects to Williams
students, although demand, leave patterns, and other constraints, sometimes mean that not all of these sub-
jects can be staffed in all terms.
Some tutorial courses are accompanied by lectures. In such cases the term in which the lectures are
delivered is listed, as is the term in which students should take the tutorials (MT-Michaelmas Term; HT-

the close reading of literary texts and a general familiarity with the literature of the period. The following are
examples of some of the Special Authors who are currently, or have been, or will be studied for the Special
Authors course of the Oxford University syllabus. It is important to note that other authors can usually be stud-
ied, depending on the availability of tutors:

above), and with the provision of teaching and lectures--although in practice there may often be some overlap
across periods. Prerequisite: some background in the close reading of literary texts and a general familiarity with

WIOX 390 Specially Arranged Subjects
Specially arranged tutorial courses in some subject areas other than those covered by the WIOX 311-384 courses
might also be possible. A WIOX 390 is not simply what would be called an "independent study" course at Wil-
liams. Rather, a WIOX 390 is normally a "paper" (course) that is regularly offered at Oxford as either a required
or optional part of the degree in various subjects. For a list of all the "papers" that make up the degree require-
ments in various disciplines, students should consult the University of Oxford Examination Regulations, a recent
copy of which can be found in the Dean's Office. Important guidelines for how to make sense of this complex
and weighty tome (the equivalent of the Williams College Bulletin) are available from the Dean's Office and also
from the director. It is easier to find tutors for a WIOX 390 in some fields (Classics, English, History, Philosophy,
Theology, etc.) than in others (Psychology, the natural sciences, etc) and students should realize that it is not
always possible for the Programme to accommodate their requests.
A sample list of Specially Arranged Subjects (WIOX 390) staffed during the past three years is offered below.
This list is not comprehensive. Furthermore, students who wish to undertake a WIOX 390 course are encour-
aged to consult the Examination Regulations rather than simply repeat what other students in the past have done.

NON-CREDIT FOREIGN LANGUAGE STUDY
In addition to their regular tutorial courses, students may begin or continue the study of a wide range of

STUDENT LIFE
By virtue of the fact that, while in Oxford, they are officially Visiting Students at the University--and
full members of Exeter College--Williams students are offered every opportunity to become fully inte-
grated into student life in Oxford. Both Exeter College and Oxford University are home to an exceptional
variety of sports clubs, debating societies, interest groups, cultural organizations, and social activities, virtu-
ally all of which are available to Visiting Student members of the University. Students are encouraged to
participate fully in the social life of Exeter College--to dine in Hall as often as they wish, to frequent the
College bar, to use the College's athletic facilities, and to become members of the various College clubs
and organizations. Furthermore, Williams students also have access to the University's athletic events, con-
certs, theatrical productions, museums, and libraries. All Williams students in Oxford are provided with
membership in the Oxford Union, which, in addition to its debating activities and club rooms, possesses
dining facilities and the largest lending library in the University.
At the Ephraim Williams House, all Williams students are housed in capacious double rooms and enjoy
full access to the House's library, common rooms, laundry facilities, computer lab, and a large dining room,
in which a weekly catered meal is served during the eight weeks of term. There are also a number of small
kitchens in the House which students may use. All rooms are fully wired for high-speed internet access and
are fully equipped with furnishings, bed linens, and a telephone. The grounds include a courtyard where
basketball can be played, sheltered bike racks, barbecue facilities, and gardens. A number of student jobs
are available during the academic year for students who wish to earn a little spending money by helping to
maintain the facilities and organize Programme activities. Ephraim Williams House is a short bike or bus
ride (or a twenty-minute walk) from Exeter College and the center of town, and is within easy walking
distance of the University parks and the local shops, restaurants and banks of Summertown. The Pro-
gramme will partially subsidize student bus passes or bicycle purchase or rental to facilitate travel around
Oxford.
Before the academic year begins--at the end of September and in early October--ten days of orienta-
tion activities are scheduled. Students are expected to be in residence for all of these many activities, some
of which take place in Ephraim Williams House, others at Exeter College. At this time students will be-
come acquainted with the workings of the Programme, of Exeter College, and of the University, and will
be familiarized with the rules and regulations they are expected to abide by during their residence in Ox-
ford.
Throughout the academic year, provision will be made for trips to a number of sites of historical, cultur-
al, or political interest. In the past these have included the Cotswolds, Stratford, Stonehenge, Bath, Wells,
Warwick Castle, Blenheim Palace, and various sites of interest in London. Students will also be given the
opportunity to attend a number of theatrical productions and other cultural events. Oxford's proximity to
London gives students ready access to that city's multiple attractions and many resources. The Oxford-
London train service is frequent and the journey takes just over an hour. The buses to London run even
more regularly (and are cheaper), and the one-way journey takes about ninety minutes.
During the summer before students arrive in Oxford, they will receive a copy of the latest edition of
Ephs Among the Dreaming Spires, which will further explain the perks, policies, and procedures of the
Programme, the rules and regulations they are expected to follow, and tips for how best to enjoy a fulfilling
year in and around Oxford.
ILLNESS AND INSURANCE
Students must ensure they are covered either by the Williams College health insurance policy or by
some other comprehensive health insurance plan (generally a family health insurance policy). While in
Britain, students will be covered by the National Health Service (NHS) for routine visits at the Group Med-
ical Practice used by Exeter College and for emergency hospital treatment. Prescription drugs are available
through the NHS for a nominal fee. There are limited outpatient psychological counseling services avail-
able through the NHS and the Programme, although, as Visiting Students at the University, Williams stu-
dents are entitled to make use of the University Counseling Centre. Any extensive or long-term counseling,
however, would need to be covered by the student's personal health insurance policy. Finally, students are
not likely to be covered under the NHS for medical services received in foreign countries, especially those
countries that do not enjoy membership of the European Union.
FEES
The tuition and room fees paid by students on the Williams-Exeter Programme at Oxford are the same
as those for a year spent in residence at Williams. Students are responsible for some of their own meals and
for all of their personal expenses. They are also responsible for the cost of their air travel to and from Brit-
ain, although they may select to take the group flight to London arranged by the Programme at competitive
rates. They are provided with three meals a day for the first four or five days in Oxford and with a weekly
catered meal in Ephraim Williams House during the eight weeks of term. They may also eat breakfast,
lunch, and/or dinner on any day of the week at Exeter. Students will not be charged the full Williams board
fee during their year in Oxford, but they will pay a proportion of the board fee to help cover these costs. For
planning purposes, students and their parents should expect the cost of a year on the Programme to be
Williams-Exeter Programme at Oxford, Williams-Mystic Maritime Studies Program
­ 337 ­
roughly the same as a year at Williams. Financial aid eligibility will be figured on the usual basis of tuition,
fees, room, board, and personal and book expenses, as if the student were at Williams for the year. Similar-
ly, the normal self-help contribution would be expected. Since the academic year ends later at Oxford than
at Williams, the summer earning expectations for students for the following year will be reduced by one
half and the difference will be made up by additional Williams aid.
APPLICATION
Admission to the Programme is on a competitive but flexible basis. Students must apply to the Dean's
Office by the prescribed deadline (normally early in February) and, prior to applying, should consult with
the chair of their major department. Any questions students might have about curricular offerings at Ox-
ford can also be raised with the director of the Programme in Oxford. In addition to completing the formal
application form, students can expect to be interviewed at Williams and will subsequently need to com-
plete an application for Visiting Student status at Oxford University. All admissions to the Programme are
subject to approval by Exeter College. Students can expect to be notified of acceptance before Spring
Break. It is normally expected that they will have completed the College's distribution requirement by the
end of their sophomore year. In making its decisions, the Admissions Committee of the Williams-Exeter
Programme at Oxford University takes student GPA into account, expects all applicants to have demon-
strated capacity for rigorous independent work and extensive essay writing, and looks favorably on those
students whose intellectual maturity, curiosity and enthusiasm would best prepare them for a demanding
course of study in Oxford. All applicants must identify two Williams faculty members who are willing to
provide references. Because of the emphasis at Oxford on weekly written work for each tutorial course, at
least one of those faculty members should be able to offer an assessment of the applicant's writing ability.
WILLIAMS-MYSTIC MARITIME STUDIES PROGRAM
Director, JAMES T. CARLTON
Faculty:JAMES T. CARLTON (Williams College), LISA GILBERT (Williams College), GLENN S.
GORDINIER (University of Connecticut), CATHERINE ROBINSON HALL (Mystic Seaport),
DANIEL BRAYTON (Middlebury College).
The Williams College-Mystic Seaport Maritime Studies Program offers students a unique opportunity
to explore the ocean, to travel the Atlantic, Pacific, and Gulf coasts, and to undertake original research of
their own design in the humanities and sciences. A term at Williams-Mystic satisfies both a semester's
credit and one winter study requirement, as well as intensive writing course credit. Four Williams courses
are offered as an integrated, multidisciplinary curriculum in the semester-long program at Mystic Seaport,
in Mystic, Connecticut: Maritime History, Literature of the Sea, Marine Policy, and either Marine Ecology
or Oceanography (see the Maritime Studies section in this catalog). Travel includes an offshore voyage on
the open ocean sailing aboard a tall ship, a seminar along the Pacific Coast, and a Mississippi Delta field
seminar, all of which are cross-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary exercises. Students live in historic, coop-
erative, coed houses at Mystic Seaport, the world's largest maritime museum, and have full access to
world-class maritime collections, a maritime library, well- equipped laboratory, and diverse coastal habitats
(where field research can be undertaken in a wide variety of environments, ranging from tidepools and salt
marshes to sandy beaches and estuaries). Students also participate in maritime skills under professional
instruction, with choices such as celestial navigation, music of the sea, boat building, or small boat han-
dling and sailing. Williams-Mystic seeks candidates who are willing to try new things and work in a com-
pelling academic environment. No sailing experience necessary, and all majors welcome. A typical semes-
ter at Williams-Mystic is represented by 12 to 14 different majors spanning the sciences and humanities.
Sophomores, juniors, and seniors may attend. Participation in Williams-Mystic can also be used in partial
fulfillment of the Maritime Studies Concentration at Williams. Interested students should contact email
admissions@williamsmystic.org, call (860-572-5359), visit the website (www.williams.edu/williamsmys-
tic), or obtain a Williams-Mystic catalog from the Dean's office. Applications are on the web and at the
Dean's office.

WNY 303(F) Slow Motion Riot: The Social Life of the Metropolis*
An exploration of the social life of New York, the distinctive, yet paradigmatic modern city. The course examines
the emergence of New York City as an international center of business, finance, and culture, and as the main
gateway to America for an ever-changing array of newcomers from all over the world. Special attention to the
city's ethnic and racial tensions; the experiences of its new immigrants; its cleavages between wealth and pover-
ty, celebrity and obscurity; its vibrant neighborhoods; and its always contested use of space. Readings include

WNY 305(F) Craft and Consciousness
A sociological examination of how craft shapes consciousness. How and in what ways do work experiences
shape habits of mind, sensibilities, moral rules-in-use, ways of seeing and knowing, images of our society, and
world views? How do men and women in different occupations and professions establish criteria of validity and
reliability to assess their work experiences? How do they develop and internalize rules for discernment that en-
able them to sort through multiple and always conflicting versions and representations of social reality? How do
they make moral judgments on complex business, political, and social issues? How and with what results do
common work experiences shape close-knit occupational communities in a great metropolis? The course will
pay particular attention to the functionally interconnected but experientially disparate occupational worlds of
New York City.The course will host men and women from a wide range of occupations and professions from
police detectives to policy analysts, journalists, filmmakers, artists, educators, attorneys, corporate executives,
and scientists to discuss their work and work worlds with students. Several Williams alumni and alumnae will
participate in the course.
Format: discussion seminar. Requirements: full participation in the seminar, term paper.
Satisfies one semester of the Division II requirement.

WNY 307(F) Arts and the City
New York City, as the center of artistic production and consumption in the United States, provides unmatched
opportunities for interrogating the place of the arts in modern society. Have technology, the market, and politics
eroded the transcendent quality of the arts? The marketplace is the arena for the production and distribution of
popular art. But have high art forms also been turned into commodities by market forces? How have arts activi-
ties strayed from their origins by crossing disciplinary boundaries? What is the role of the technologies of the last
fifty years in supplanting, altering, or fusing with artistic creation? New York is a unique laboratory in which to
test the fundamental dichotomies embodied in the city's artistic life: elitist/democratic, traditional/avant-garde,
high art/popular art, aesthetic/political, globalized/local, film/live theatre. This course grapples with such issues in
a pragmatic rather than theoretical manner. In order to confront the ideas in assigned readings, students will at-
tend performances of theatre, opera, and dance; attend concerts; and visit museums and other cultural institutions
as models for discussion and analysis. Practicing artists and entrepreneurs in the arts will meet the class in order
to provoke discussion of their activities and perspectives.
Format: discussion seminar. Requirements: full and lively participation in the seminar and its cultural activities,
final oral report.
Satisfies one semester of the Division I requirement.

WNY 302(S) Cinema and the City
This multidisciplinary video production course brings together cinema, geography, and architectural and urban
studies, taking New York City as a case study. What cultural narratives are told about the city, and how does
cinema use the city in the service of the stories it tells? The course will explore treatments of the city in their
historical context, focusing on three periods. The first section will focus on discourses of alienation and corrup-
tion as they played out in the New York noirs of the 1940's and 1950's. In the second section of the course we
will look at the ways that these same mean streets were rendered in relation to the social and political geography
of the1960's and 1970's. The third section of the course will consider how stories are told in the increasingly
privatized, highly policed, electronically surveyed, and telemediated urban space of the post-Guiliani and
post-9/11 era. Production assignments will ask students to respond to issues raised by the screenings and read-
ings, and to use the built environment towards making their own moving images. Screenings will include from
The Naked City, Asphalt Jungle, Chelsea Girls, Panic in Needle Park, The Wiz, Symbiopsychotaxiplasm, Panic
Room, The 25th Hour, and many others. The course will also make use of the Tribeca Film Festival's NYNY
series. Lab sessions will offer instructions in narrative filmmaking technique and in the technologies of shooting
and editing.
Format: discussion seminar. Requirements: three short papers, three videos.
Satisfies one semester of the Division I requirement
L. JOHNSON
WNY 304(S) Revolutions: Contemporary Art in the City
Utilizing the multiple meanings of "revolutions" as its conceptual structure (the term allows for a number of
interpretive definitions--historical cycles, cultural paradigm shifts, agents of change, notions of resistance and
subversion), this course will explore the manifold ways one can view and understand contemporary art, taking
advantage of the concentration of artists and art institutions that New York offers. The history of the city over the
last half-century as the definitively American (and debatably international) fulcrum of the art world provides
inimitable possibilities for field experience. How is contemporary art formed and shaped in this context? What
has changed about creative production within a "post-everything" worldview where so many boundaries have
been dissolved, and conversely, what has been retained? How has the specific history of New York been central
to cultural shifts in the art world? Ultimately, we will focus on the symbiotic relationship between the artist/art-
work itself and all the other aspects of the art world--critics, curators, and dealers, art schools, and, of course,
collectors and the market.
Format:discussion seminar. Most classes will be held in museum exhibitions, gallery shows and, primarily, art-
ists' studios. Requirements: Active participation in class discussion will be expected. Some historical and con-
temporary reading will be required. And students will be asked to visit and respond to specific exhibitions/events
outside of class time. Class discussions will take place in the form of on-line conversations, a weekly, topical
blog. In addition, students will produce a final term paper for the course (other project proposals can be consid-
ered, if the structure maintains a focused, rigorous argument).
Satisfies one semester of the Division I requirement.
MOMIN
WNY 306(S) Street Smarts: Learning to Read the City
An on-the-ground introduction to the great American metropolis the physical city as it has evolved over the past
three centuries. Libraries are overflowing with accounts of New York's history, architecture, and neighborhoods,
but the city is best learned on the streets. In walks throughout New York we will learn how to read the cityscape
visiting such major monuments as Rockefeller Center, Central Park, and Grand Central Terminal, and such dis-
parate neighborhoods as Times Square and SoHo, the Lower East Side, and Jackson Heights. We will study
skyscrapers and Broadway theaters, tenements, and planned suburbs. We will examine the various forces that
created these places and caused them to evolve over time. We will discuss the impact of modern monuments,
historic preservation, speculative development, and public and private plans and consider their various intended
and unintended consequences.
Format: discussion seminar. The course will be conducted entirely on the city's streets. Requirements: each stu-
dent will be responsible for assigned readings, a journal with entries on each walk, a mid-term presentation on an
assigned topic, and a final paper on the same topic. Students will be graded on their attendance, journals, mid-
term presentation, and final paper.
Satisfies one semester of the Division I requirement.

WINTER STUDY PROGRAM
REMINDERS ABOUT WSP REGISTRATION
All students who will be on campus during the 2006-2007 academic year must register for WSP. Registration
will take place in the early part of fall semester. If you are registered for a senior thesis in the fall which must be
continued through Winter Study by departmental rules, you will be registered for your Winter Study Project
automatically. In every other case, you must complete registration. First-year students are required to participate
in a Winter Study that will take place on campus; they are not allowed to do 99's.
Even if you plan to take a 99, or the instructor of your first choice accepts you during the registration period,
there are many things that can happen between registration and the beginning of Winter Study to upset your first
choice, so you must list five choices. You should try to make one of your choices a project with a larger enroll-
ment, not that it will guarantee you a project, but it will increase your chances.
If you think your time may be restricted in any way (ski meets, interviews, etc.), clear these restrictions with
the instructor before signing up for his/her project.
Remember, for cross-listed projects, you should sign up for the subject you want to appear on your record.
For many beginning language courses, you are required to take the WSP Sustaining Program in addition to
your regular project. You will be automatically enrolled in this Sustaining Program,so no one should list this as a
choice.
The grade of honors is reserved for outstanding or exceptional work. Individual instructors may specify mini-
mum standards for the grade, but normally, fewer than one out of ten students will qualify. A grade of pass means
the student has performed satisfactorily. A grade of perfunctory pass signifies that a student's work has been
significantly lacking but is just adequate to deserve a pass.
If you have any questions about a project, see the instructor before you register.
Finally, all work for WSP must be completed and submitted to the instructor no later than Friday, January
26th. Only the Dean can grant an extension beyond this date.
WINTER STUDY 99'S
Sophomores, juniors and seniors are eligible to propose "99's," independent projects arranged with faculty
sponsors, conducted in lieu of regular Winter Study courses. Perhaps you have encountered an interesting idea in
one of your courses which you would like to study in more depth, or you may have an interest not covered in the
regular curriculum. In recent years students have undertaken in-depth studies of particular literary works, in-
terned in government offices, assisted in foreign and domestic medical clinics, conducted field work in econom-
ics in developing countries, and given performances illustrating the history of American dance. Although some
99's involve travel away from campus, there are many opportunities to pursue intellectual or artistic goals here in
Williamstown.
99 forms are available online:
http://www.williams.edu/Registrar/winterstudy/99direct.html
The deadline for submitting the proposals to faculty sponsors is Thursday, 28 September.
AFRICANA STUDIES
AFR 25 Border Crossing, Capital Punishment, and Penal Politics in Texas
This winter session course takes place in Austin and in "border" communities in Texas. It examines the policing
of immigration, racial containment/segregation, domestic and political crimes, and capital punishment in one of
the most influential states in national politics. After on-campus study sessions beginning in early December, stu-
dents will travel to Texas in January for 7-10 days to meet with diverse constituencies, academics, community
educators and activists focusing on Mexican/Mexican-American/Chicano and African American experiences
with penal and police cultures.
Students will write brief e-papers for prep sessions, maintain journals while in Texas, and have the option to
collectively create a web installation of visual culture and oral histories. University of Texas-Austin faculty will
also assist in this winter session course.
Permission of instructor required. Enrollment limit: 8 (expected: 5.) Not open to first-year students.
Cost to student: $1200.

AMERICAN STUDIES
AMST 15 Contemporary American Songwriting (Same as Music 17)
This course will focus on learning how to write and perform songs in a contemporary style. Topics addressed
will include song structure, how to create a lyric that communicates, vocal and instrument presentation, perform-
ing techniques, publicity for events, and today's music industry. This class will culminate in a public performance
of material written during the course.
To successfully pass this course, students are required to create, edit, perform and possibly record two original
songs. These songs must be conceived during the course period (in other words, previously written material is
not usable.) Students will be guided to create both music and lyrics. They may also be required to participate in a
co-write session. One of these songs will be presented during the final performance, preferably by the student.
Attendance at classes, feedback sessions, and all officially scheduled events is mandatory and crucial. Also, a
short writing assignment will be passed in on the last day of class.

ANSO 11 Berkshire Farm Center Internship
A field placement at Berkshire Farm Center and Services for Youth in Canaan, New York. Berkshire Farm Cen-
ter is a residential treatment facility for troubled, at-risk adolescent boys who have been remanded to the Farm by
the Family Court. These youths come primarily from lower socio-economic strata, are very ethnically diverse,
and hail from both urban and rural areas throughout New York State. The problems that they bring to Berkshire
Farm are multiple. These include: the psychological scars of dysfunctional families, including those of physical,
emotional, and sexual abuse; chemical dependency; juvenile delinquency; inability to function in school settings;
and various other issues. Residential treatment is a multi-modal approach that includes anger-replacement train-
ing, social skills training, and behavioral modification.
Williams students will commute to Berkshire Farm and work under supervision in one of the following areas:
school, cottage life, chemical dependency unit, research, recreation, performing arts, or in individual tutoring.
Requirements: students will keep a journal reflecting on their experiences, and a weekly seminar with the
instructor will draw on service learning experience. Students will also be required to submit a final 10-page paper
at the end of the course.
Prerequisites: YOU MUST HAVE A TELEPHONE INTERVIEW WITH THE INSTRUCTOR who can be

The incidence of reported child abuse and neglect has reached epidemic proportions and shows no signs of de-
creasing. Preventive and prophylactic social programs, court intervention, and legislative mandates have not suc-
cessfully addressed this crisis. This course allows students to observe the Massachusetts Department of Social
Services attorney in courtroom proceedings related to the care and protection of children. Students will have ac-
cess to Department records for purposes of analysis and will also work with social workers who will provide a
clinical perspective on the legal cases under study. The class will meet regularly to discuss court proceedings, as-
signed readings, and the students' interactions with local human services agencies. Access to an automobile is
desirable but not required; some transportation will be provided as part of the course.
Requirements: full participation, a journal, and a 10-page paper to be submitted at the end of the course.
Enrollment limit: 15. Please note: all queries about this course must be directed to the instructor, Judge Locke

cent Van Gogh, Camille Claudel, Frida Kahlo, and Jackson Pollock. We will focus on the construction, in these
films, of a notion of artistic genius, paying particular attention to the role played by gender. Our discussions will
be based on the films themselves as well as comparative material-biographical and art historical readings on the
various artists.
Evaluation will be based on class participation, written responses to films, and a 10-page paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 12.

ARTH 13 Love, Longing, and Land: Nation and Identity in Hindi Cinema
How has the medium of film allowed Indian filmmakers to explore and construct post-independence notions of
Indian identity? Through an examination of a series of films, such asMother India; Amar, Akbar, Anthony; Bom-
bay; Salaam Bombay!; and Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, we will consider the conventions and genres of "Bol-
lywood" films and how filmmakers have worked with or against these conventions. In imagining India, how do
these films represent and negotiate not only issues of class, gender, and religion, but also India's vast and diverse
rural landscapes and modern cityscapes? What visual and narrative strategies have these filmmakers employed?
We will also explore how certain films might appeal both to audiences within India and to the growing commu-
nities of South Asians around the world. Students will write four 3- to 5-page papers.

stand the ways they employ drawing and writing together to create humor. We will discuss how the notion of
what's funny has changed over time, and how cartoons reflect and illuminate social trends and concerns.
In addition, students will make their own cartoons. They will explore various strategies to jumpstart the comic
imagination in the search for ideas. They will work towards developing a personal comic drawing and writing
style. Various media, from pen and ink, to drawing on the computer, will be explored. Although this course will
mainly focus on the New Yorker style magazine cartoon, it is open to students who are interested in other kinds
of cartoons.
Evaluation will be based on completed class projects and homework.
Beginners as well as more experienced artists are welcome. Enrollment limit: 12.
Cost to student: $100.
Meeting time: TBA.

ARTS 12 Fort Building!
Where do we dwell? Have you ever slept in a snow cave or an indoor fort? In this studio workshop course we
will work together to build individual dwellings large enough to accommodate sleeping and eating. Students will
have the option of building in the studio or choose sites specific to their work such as a snow-covered grass plot
or dorm room. For background we will look to ancient dwellings, portable tents, and cave structures. We will
then discuss the origins of installation in contemporary art such as Schwitter's Merzbau, Jonathan Borofsky,
Judy Pfaff, Sarah Sze, Anish Kapoor, Ernesto Neto, Jessica Stockholder, Frank Gehry, Thomas Hirshhom and
Will Aslop. The course will culminate with a dwelling festival and documentation. Come with energy to build,
clothing appropriate to your site and a sketchbook.
Requirements: reading, attendance, participation in class and final fort festival.
Prerequisites: Come ready to build! Enrollment limit: 10.
Cost to student: approximately $75 for materials kit and $10 for reading packet.
Meeting time: mornings. Expect to spend at least 20 hours a week on the course.

ARTS 13 Documentary Video Production (Same as English 13)
(See under English for full description.)
ARTS 14 Secret Diaries and Parallel Homework: Video Production
This course will combine visual analysis, personal essay, performance, and video production. What is left out on
my class papers with written text? How does my eloquence simplify what I needed to say? Why did I not get an
A (and why did I get an A)? The University is a miniature city of a certain age group where they begin to shape
their frameworks to view the world and to be involved in one. However, the learned criticism is generally only
allowed within the boundaries of the subject issued by the class, and the form of the presentation is often limited
to alphabetical and numeral text that has its inherent logical structure. When do I begin to criticize this very struc-
ture? With what other tools can I write a parallel storyline to our usual analysis? Out of various available tools,
this course will concentrate on video as another language tool to rewrite what we have written, re-say what we
have said, and re-view what have viewed: re-formulate scholarly lives.
Class time will be divided into film viewing, student presentations, and discussion. The students are expected to
choose one paper written for other classes at Williams and then make an alternative or parallel story using video
or other media after discussing with the instructor.
Evaluation will be based on attendance, participation and on the basis of the created work and its evolution. Ev-
erybody must attend the final presentation. Much of the individual work will be created independently. Class
time will be divided among viewing referential works, student presentation, and discussions. We will overview
the works by Diderot's Rameau's Nephew an d Correspondence between Antonin Artaud and an literary critic
Jacques Rivière; Kittler's Gramophone, Film, and Typewriter; Marguerite Duras's War; Paul Virilio's War and
Cinema; Jean Painlevé's science documentary; Kim ki-duk's Binjip (a.k.a. 3-Iron); Joe Gibbon's Living in the
World; Lars von Trier's Five Obstructions; Roberto Bolano's By Night in Chile.
Prerequisites: Students must have enthusiasm for storytelling. Video experience helpful. Recommended for Jun-
iors and Seniors. Enrollment limit: 8.
Cost to student: $50.
Meeting time: afternoons.

ARTS 15 Large-Format Photography
The course is designed to introduce students to studio/view cameras, to processing the sheet-film negatives made
in them and to making contact and projection prints. Studio exercises will include careful analysis of camera
movements to teach their use and a consideration of lighting techniques; dark room exercises will include the tray
development of sheet film, determination of effective film speed and control of contrast through development
time.
The subject matter of the photographs produced in the course will not be prescribed; it is limited only by the
participants' imagination and the weather in January. Working with subjects of their own choosing, students will
be instructed in the principles of traditional photographic image making by producing large-format negatives and
translating them into effective black-and-white prints in 4x5 and 8x10 formats.
Each student will be expected to make exhibition-quality prints, which may be enlargements or contact prints
from 4x5 negatives, or contract prints from 8x10 negatives. The prints will be exhibited in a group show at the
end of Winter Study.
Evaluation will be based on commitment to the course, participation in discussion sessions and the quality of the
prints. Class will meet as a group for a minimum of six hours a week for lectures, demonstrations in the dark
room and studio and crits. In addition to this time, students will be expected to spend at least 20 hours a week in
the darkroom working individually, under the supervision of the course instructor and the photography techni-
cian. There are no prerequisites for the course, although some experience with a camera and dark room work
would be an advantage. Enrollment limit: 10.
Cost to student: $150 lab fee to cover the cost of film, paper and chemicals.
Meeting time: TBA.

ARTS 18 A House in a Box
This is a home design course. Each student will design a house to be built within a 6-meter cube (20 feet). There
will be several exercises in which the students will present solutions restricted to the 6 meter limits as well as
solutions which could use limited outward expansions for balconies, bay windows or actual second floor room
enlargements.
The students will design the entire living space, including all furniture (volume, size, functionality). The main
design purpose is to get away from the limitations of floor plan/two-dimensional-projection approach to design.
The conception of the living spaces will focus on multi-level occupancy, highly ergonomic built-in furniture and
differences of ceiling heights. Special emphasis will be given to tri-dimensional layer-occupancy design, as it is
done in airplane restrooms (and customarily in product design, as can be seen inside the CPU cabinet of a per-
sonal computer).
Due to the familiarity of the themes involved (living in enclosed spaces, personal spatial needs, human behavior)
and to specific exercises, the students will develop their own data sheets with information on human dimensions,
furniture sizes, hand reaching curves, shelving heights.

ARTS 25 Art, Culture, and Spanish in Oaxaca, Mexico (Same as Spanish 25)
The city of Oaxaca is a unique place where age-old dialects, traditional art practices and religious customs coexist
side by side with contemporary life. Living and studying in Oaxaca, Mexico will provide students with the op-
portunity to experience the richness of culture that Oaxaca has to offer. This course is designed as an exploration
of Mexican culture and is centered on the teaching and enhancement of Spanish, as well as, daily practical studio
components in the making of art. Specifically, it will be organized with morning Spanish classes, afternoon art
studio classes, (focusing on drawing, sculpture and collage), as well as frequent excursions to view museums,
artist's studios, archaeological sites, galleries and cinema. The hope is, that immersion into a culture so vastly
different from our own can have a profound and lasting effect on one's perspective with regards to life, culture
and art. Students will live with a Mexican family in Oaxaca, providing a greater opportunity to practice Spanish
and gain a deeper understanding of Mexican life.
Prerequisites : at least one introductory course in Spanish and ArtS 100 or permission of instructor. Enrollment
limit : 12. Not open to first-year students.
Cost to student: approximately $2,056.
Itinerary: Meet in Williamstown prior to Winter Study to provide information and prepare students about what to
expect and what to bring. Spend Winter study period in Oaxaca, creating art, enhancing Spanish abilities and
exploring and discussing Mexican culture.

LANGUAGE FELLOWS
CHIN 10 On Foreign Language Learning (same as Linguistics 10)
This course is designed to provide a basic understanding of second language development by exploring some
key concepts in theories of second language acquisition, including competence vs. performance, intake vs. out-
put, interlanguage, and learner variables. Such understanding will enable students to reflect upon their own learn-
ing strategies in order to effectively attain proficiency in a second language. Although issues to be covered in this
course are selected with second language learning in mind, all of the issues are equally relevant to second lan-
guage teaching. Accordingly, this course should be of interest to those who wish to gain knowledge in second
language acquisition in general, those who wish to improve their learning skills in a particular language, and
those who are considering a career in teaching foreign languages.
Evaluation will be based on active class participation, successful completion of mini-presentations, and an indi-
vidual project.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 12.
Cost to student: one Xerox packet.

CHIN 11 Old Shanghai, New Shanghai
Once referred to as "Paris of the East," Shanghai has been considered as the industrial, commercial, and financial
center of contemporary China. For historians, Shanghai marked the beginning of Chinese modernity and urban
culture. More recently, Dana Janklowics-Mann and Amir Mann's award-winning documentary revealed Shang-
hai to be a "ghetto"/ "paradise" for Jews fleeing Nazi persecutions in the 1930s. But for the local people, there
have always been two Shanghai: the old and the new. In this class we will study the city and people of Shanghai
from various angles. We will look at the city's history, local culture, local dialect, and the everyday life of ordi-
nary people living in it, including their aspirations and discontent, as well as foreigners' life experiences in the
city. We will compare a "real" Shanghai and an "imagined" one, and examine the ideas of "modernity" and
"local identity" through explorations in historical studies, essays, novels, and films about the city. This class re-
quires no knowledge of Chinese; the language of instruction will be English.
Evaluation will be based on class preparation and participation, a presentation, and a final project based on the
topics covered in class. We will meet as a group an average of six hours per week, with allowances made for
one-on-one sessions to develop final projects. Students will be expected to do readings before class and to come
to a few film showings outside the regular class hours.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 12.
Cost to student: approximately $75 for books.
Meeting time: Monday, Wednesday, Friday from 10-noon.
YU
CHIN 12 Traditional Yang-style Taiji
This course provides an introduction to the history, theory, practice, and application of traditional Yang-style Taiji
(Tai Chi). Students will undergo intensive training in this beautiful form as well as learn its place in Chinese
history, culture, and medicine. Daily practice outside of class using step-by-step video instruction will be required
in order to complete the learning process within the month. We will discuss the origins of Taiji more than 2000
years ago during the Chun Qiu Period and make some contrasts and comparisons between that time in China and
America today. The principles of Yin and Yang and how they apply to the practice of Taiji will also be addressed.
Students will learn the twelve major energy channels and how energy moves through them. Charts will be pro-
vided with the English and Chinese names of each of the 108 forms in traditional Yang-style Taiji. Required
readings will include The Father's Suggestions For The Child (Yen Shi Jia Shun).
Evaluation will be based on attendance and active participation, a practical test on the Taiji form, and two short
papers.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit:12.
Cost to student: $50 for videotapes and Xerox packet.
Meeting time: three two-hour sessions per week afternoons from 2-4.

CHIN 13 Theory and Practice of Chinese Cooking
Much more than in the U.S., in China people are always talking about food; as the Chinese saying has it, min yi
shi wei tian `the people consider eating as heaven'. This hands-on course will foster an appreciation of the histor-
ical and cultural background of Chinese cooking, as well as the development of practical skills in preparing a
variety of dishes. Chinese cuisine is inherently healthful because of its reliance on vegetables, vegetable oils,
steaming, stir-frying, and fat-free condiments. To the extent possible, we will use locally available ingredients
(organic if possible) to cook authentic Chinese food, primarily Chinese home cooking. Since climate has had a
huge impact on availability of ingredients, the course includes an introduction to the four primary regions, or
schools, of Chinese cooking--Northern, Eastern, Western, and Southern. While we will cook most dishes to-
gether, every student will have the opportunity to make at least one dish independently.
Evaluation will be based on class participation, a final project involving the creation and cooking of original
recipes, and a 10-page paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 8. In case of overenrollment, Chinese and Asian Studies majors will receive
preference, then seniors and juniors, then others.
Cost to student: approximately $75 for Xerox packet and materials.
Meeting time: two three-hour sessions per week afternoons from 1-3:50.

ASTRONOMY
ASTR 25 American Planetariums, Public Outreach, and Astronomy Education
The installation of the new Zeiss optomechanical planetarium projector in our Old Hopkins Observatory in 2005,
and the installation of a smaller digital planetarium system, is leading to greatly enhanced capability for instruc-
tion and public outreach. During January 2007, we will visit several of the major planetariums in the United
States and consider the equipment capabilities of optomechanical and digital projectors as well as the educational
level of the content as presented for students and for the general public. We will meet with the directors of all
facilities. In Massachusetts, we will visit the planetariums at home and in Boston. In Seattle, we will benefit from
the joint American Astronomical Society/American Association of Physics Teachers meeting of January 7-11
while also visiting the Pacific Science Center. In Los Angeles, we will be among the first to visit the newly re-
opened Griffith Observatory and Planetarium after its 5-year rebuild and the installation of its new Zeiss projec-
tor. In New York, we will visit the Rose Center for Earth and Space in its architectural wonder of a glass enclo-
sure surrounding its Hayden Sphere that contains its Zeiss IX. We will compare with our own Zeiss Skymaster
ZKP3/B projector on the Williams campus.

BIOL 11 Curing Health Care (Same as Economics 28)
For the past several years increases in U.S. health care costs have significantly outpaced both inflation and per-
sonal income growth. In 2006, the U.S. government will spend nearly a trillion dollars on health care--one-
seventh of the overall budget. Experts predict that federal health care expenditures will need to double over the
next decade to cope with the unprecedented demand on health care created by the graying "baby boomer" gener-
ation. Major American employers such as GM are cutting their employee's health care benefits in order to be-
come profitable. On a per capita basis, a major reduction in funds available for health care seems inevitable. The
reduction of health care costs will create difficult questions. For example, Are all Americans entitled to the same
expenditures?; Should drug company profits be regulated?
This course will give students the opportunity to look at health care from various points of view, including eco-
nomic, medical, social, ethical, and legal perspectives. We will consider recent legislation that brings the state of
Massachusetts to the forefront of the debate on universal health care coverage. Students will be asked to propose
the best strategies for financing health care and to predict the positive and negative impacts of those strategies.
Students will have several opportunities to interview experts and to express their own views.
Evaluation will be based on classroom participation, performance in semi-formal team debates, and a 10-page
position paper due at the end of the term.
No prerequisites. Enrollment open to all but limited to 24.
Cost to student: none.
Meeting time: 10-noon, Monday, Wednesday, Friday.

BIOL 12 Of Lice and Men: Insects, Disease, and History
Insect-borne diseases have been extremely important throughout human history. In this class we will explore the
biology of a number of important pathogens and their arthropod vectors, and discuss their effects on humanity
from prehistory to the present. We will study the biological factors that make these diseases so problematic, dis-
cuss historical and current approaches for controlling them, and explore the potential of the new field of genom-
ics for understanding and combating them. Additional topics for discussion will include: the importance of eco-
nomics, land use, and climate change to insect-born diseases. Some disease systems that will be studied are:
Malaria--the mosquito-vectored disease that kills over a million children and infants per year in African alone;
Plague--vectored from rats by fleas, responsible for the Black Death of the 14th Century that killed up to a third
of the human population worldwide; Typhus Fever--louse-borne disease that in many wars caused more death
than the battles did; Leishmaniasis--the cutaneous form, vectored by sand fleas, is currently a problem for sol-
diers in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Students will gain experience with several techniques used in the diagnosis and study of insect-borne diseases, as
well as observe specimens of disease vectors and pathogens.
The final meeting of the class will be a symposium in which students will present on a topic of their choice
related to insect-borne disease.
Evaluation will be based on attendance, participation, a 10-page paper, and the final presentation.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15.
Cost to student: approximately $25 for books.

BIOL 21 Science Beyond Williams
Are you interested in hands-on experience in a science-related field beyond the Purple Valley? Are you curious to
explore science in a university or medical school research lab, a government agency, or a not-for-profit organiza-
tion? This course is designed to help students take part in scientific work or research going on outside of Wil-
Winter Study Program
­ 349 ­
liams in order to provide them with a broader sense of what it is like to work in a professional scientific setting.
Students will work with a Williams professor to locate a mentor at a work site in the United States in the student's
area of interest. Once a student has arranged for a mentored hands-on experience for three weeks of Winter
Study, he or she will prepare for the internship by reading literature related to the project, and discuss the readings
with a professor here at Williams in November/December. Once on site, students must remain in contact with
their Williams faculty sponsor by having a weekly phone conference.
Transportation to and from work site will be covered as well as housing. Temporary, three-week housing may be
difficult to arrange at various locations, so choosing a work site close to home may be necessary to minimize
housing costs.
Evaluation will be based on a 10-page paper and a presentation to a relevant department or program on the goals
and accomplishments of the three-week project.
Strong interest, enthusiasm and willingness to plan and prepare for the internship are required for this course.
Interested students are encouraged to email Professor Raymond (wraymond@williams.edu) well in advance of
WSP registration.
Prerequisite: two semesters of relevant course work in science and/or mathematics. Enrollment limit: 10.
Cost to student: varies, depending upon costs of travel to work site and housing.

CHEM 11 Science for Kids (Same as Special 11)
Are you interested in teaching? Do you enjoy working with kids? Do you like to experiment with new things?
Here is a chance for you to do all three! The aim of this Winter Study Project is to design a series of hands-on
science workshops for elementary school children and their parents. Working in teams of 2-4, students spend the
first two and a half weeks of Winter Study planning the workshops. This involves deciding on a focus for each
workshop (based on the interests of the students involved) followed by choosing and designing experiments and
presentations that will be suitable for fourth-grade children. On the third weekend of Winter Study (January 20,
21) we bring elementary school kids with their parents to Williams to participate in the workshops.
You get a chance to see what goes into planning classroom demonstrations as well as a sense of what it's like to
actually give a presentation. You find that kids at this age are great fun to work with because they are interested in
just about everything and their enthusiasm is infectious. You also give the kids and their parents a chance to actu-
ally do some fun hands-on science experiments that they may not have seen before, and you are able to explain
simple scientific concepts to them in a manner that won't be intimidating. It is a rewarding experience for all in-
volved.
Evaluation is based on participation in planning and running the workshops. Each group is expected to prepare a
handout with descriptions of the experiments for the kids, parents, and teachers.
No prerequisites: You need not be a science major; all that is needed is enthusiasm. Enrollment limit: 25.
Cost to student: none.
Meeting time: mornings. Classes meet three times a week for approximately three hours each session. The work-
shop is run on the third weekend of Winter Study (January 20, 21) and attendance from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. is man-
datory that weekend. There are also one or two brief meetings held in the fall term for preliminary planning.
BINGEMANN and RICHARDSON
CHEM 12 Epidemiology: What Is an Epidemic? How Are They Investigated and Solved?
The biological world is ever changing, and human populations are subject to the variability of biological, chemi-
cal, and physical agents. It has been said that the job description of a virus/bacterium is to "infect, multiply, and
move on to another host." The word epidemiology comes from the Greek, essentially meaning "the logic of that
which is upon the people." Although physicians at the time of Hippocrates were pre-occupied by outbreaks of
infectious diseases, in the 20th Century, epidemiology has moved on to embrace the study of epidemics of chron-
ic disease, nutritional conditions, occupational exposures and their outcomes, etc. The object of this study is pre-
vention of conditions that potentially can affect large numbers and classes of people. With the addition of modern
statistical concepts, epidemiology has made important contributions as to how hypotheses about health and dis-
ease are evaluated. In a highly interactive environment, and relaying on small group analysis and class presenta-
tion, students review the history of epidemiology through actual epidemic investigations in the field, as well as
classic papers in the health literature. Students learn how epidemics are investigated and how to begin to evaluate
the quality and reliability of studies in the health literature. Throughout, we concentrate on the logic of the epi-
demic investigation and the preventive policies/actions that flow from that analysis, and not on obscure facts or
highly specialized knowledge.
Evaluation is based on the written epidemic analyses and class presentations, and a short written critique of an

CHEM 13 Principles and Techniques of Cooking (Same as Special 13)
In this course we consider the practice and pursuit of food and its preparation. Students study the hands-on as-
pects of specific techniques, as well as explore a variety of more specialized ingredients central to various world
cuisines. Classes involve discussion of specific techniques and ingredients, followed by the preparation of full
menus designed to illustrate variations on those themes. We consider the specific elements of a recipe, from in-
gredients to techniques, why each is included and how each works. For instance, a menu might focus on different
types of pastas, and would include a discussion on why different pastas are paired with specific sauces based on
shapes and textures, how specific dishes have evolved, and how similar culinary concepts are represented in the
cuisines of other cultures. The course may include visits to/by local purveyors and producers such as grocers,
butchers, affineurs, and bakers. In addition, the course culminates in a day-long trip to New York's Chinatown
and other neighborhoods to explore Asian markets and specialized food purveyors. Finally, we introduce you to
the world of food writing, with a number of short works that consider very different aspects of food and cooking:
the emotive power of familiar foods, the chemical transformations that occur within a cooking process, the sym-
bolism associated with certain foods, and the cultural history of specific dishes. Readings may include authors
such as Brillat-Savarin, Colwin, Fisher, Kennedy, McGee, and Simeti. Students are expected to be generally
comfortable working in a kitchen, though prior extensive experience is not expected. The only requirements are
an open mind, an adventurous palate, and a true interest in learning something about food, its preparation, and the
different ways in which it is viewed. Students are expected to provide their own chef's knife, apron, cutting
board, and dishtowel; they should be willing to get messy, work hard, and eat well!
Attendance at all classes for the entire class period is absolutely mandatory, and evaluation is based on perfor-
mance in the kitchen, as well as on a final written assignment; this may be a 10-page research paper on the history
of a particular ingredient, on the role of food in a specific culture, or a thoughtful analysis of a memorable meal or
other food-related experience.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit 22. Preference is given to sophomores, juniors and those students who clearly
indicate their interest in hardcopy form to Professor Park.
Cost to student: $275-$300, which will cover all supplies (you will get to eat all the meals you prepare) as well
help defer the cost of the field trip(s).
Meeting time: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, 8:30 a.m.-1:30 p.m., in the Fort Hoosac kitchen (on campus).

CHEM 14 Alternative Photographic Processes
The most widely known process in photography is the one based on silver halide chemistry. However, alternative
processes such as the Cyano, Ambro and Platino types which use iron, chromium or platinum compounds as
sensitizing agents, are known, but these have not been commercialized. In addition to producing images with
unique artistic appeal, each of these processes provides ample opportunities to learn about interesting chemical
reactions and physical phenomena. This course introduces some of the alternative photographic processes and
shows students how to apply them to make their own prints using chemicals that they prepare themselves. Some
aspects of the silver halide process will also be covered. To satisfy the curious, the course attempts to explain the
underlying mechanisms of each process covered at the molecular level using a largely qualitative approach, sup-
ported with demonstrations and experiments. The first 45 minutes or so of a typical meeting in this course is used
to introduce and discuss a topic pertaining to the historic background or the chemical principles of a given pro-
cess. The remaining time of the meeting is used for hands on experience in preparing solutions and making
prints. Evaluation is based on attendance, class participation, and the artistic and technical quality of the prints
made by students. The prints will be exhibited on the last day of the course.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 10. Preference is given to sophomores and juniors.
Cost to student: $90 for supplies and printed material.
Meeting time: mornings, three times a week (Monday, Wednesday, Thursday from 10-noon). One or two meet-
ings will be held at a museum.

CHEM 15 "You Are Not Listening!"--Exploring Interpersonal Conflict (Same as Leadership
Studies 15 and Special 15)
The aim of this course is to equip you with communication and leadership skills to navigate interpersonal con-
flicts in a productive manner, whether you find yourself in an uncomfortable situation in professional settings or
in relationships with family members or friends. We discuss models of conflict resolution and examine the struc-
tures of these commonly difficult conversations using examples from our own experiences. Through role-plays,
we practice communication skills important to productive dialogue, learn how to listen for and interpret the sig-
Winter Study Program
­ 351 ­
nificance of what is said and not said. We also explore how our own immediate reactions may get in the way of
achieving what we really want. By analyzing the underlying reasons for disputes from different perspectives, we
look to create outcomes that serve our interests and address the needs of our adversaries. We experiment with
stepping into active leadership in conflicts for the sake of creating the types of relationships we want to have.
Though the focus is on interpersonal conflict, the mediation skills taught in this class are an asset in many negoti-
ation settings, including the future workplace. The class format is largely group discussions and activities such as
role-plays in which you will practice conflict resolution and mediation techniques.
Evaluation is based on preparation and participation in class discussions and activities, homework exercises, in-
cluding the keeping of a conflict journal, and a final 10-page paper. Attendance of all classes is expected.
No prerequisites. Students should be genuinely interested in learning how to create personal growth from con-
flicts. The topics of the class and the nature of experiential exercises and follow-up discussions call for some level
of self-disclosure and sharing of personal experiences of conflict. Every participant will be asked to keep the
content and details of shared personal experiences confidential. Enrollment limit: 18.
Cost to student: approximately $40 for books and photocopying.
Meeting time: Tuesday and Thursday, 10 a.m.-1 p.m.

CLASSICS
CLAS 11 Horace in English (Same as Comparative Literature 11 and English 27)
Although the totality of his life's work amounts to one short volume of verse, the Latin poet Horace (65-8 B. C.
E.) is regularly counted among the world's greatest poets. And yet Horace, though repeatedly translated into
English, is far less familiar to most readers than is his close friend, the poet Vergil--and far less accessible. For
while the plot and structure of an epic like the Aeneid remain largely unscathed when the poem is translated, so
much of Horace's uniqueness lies in the inventive ways in which he uses language that much--even most--of
his wit, power, and complexity often disappears in translation.
In this class, which is designed for students with little or no background in Latin, we'll try to scale this barrier by
complementing our reading of Horace's poems in translation (indeed, in numerous translations) with frequent
reference to the Latin originals. Even readers who do not know Latin can learn a great deal about Horace by
looking at his choice and placement of words, by understanding something of the resonance of key words and
phrases, by reading his verse in its original meters, and--not least--by trying to compose one's own translations
and imitations. Although our focus will be on Horace's great lyric collection, Odes 1-3, his counterpart to Vergil's
Aeneid, we'll also read widely in his early and late lyric collections, Epodes and Odes 4, and in his Satires and
Epistles (including the famous Ars Poetica). As part of our effort to meet Horace on his own terms (and turf!),
we'll spend some time locating him against both his Greek poetic forbears and the historical backdrop of Augus-
tan Rome. Among versions of Horace we'll read will be translations and imitations by Sidney, Jonson, Milton,
Dryden, Swift, Pope, Wordsworth, Tennyson, Pound, Pinsky, Heamus, and David Ferry.
Evaluation will be based on participation and attendance, preparation of several short response papers and a lon-
ger oral report, and a final paper of at least ten pages. Although this final project may be a critical or analytical
study, it may also consist of a series of the student's own annotated translations, versions, or imitations.
The course will be open to students from all classes, without prerequisite. Enrollment limit: 12.
Cost to student: approximately $80 (for books and course packet).
Meeting time: three 2 1/2 hour meetings per week, probably 1-3:30 p.m, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.

cluding historical phonology and morphology, alphabets and other writing systems, dictionaries, dialectal stud-
ies, slang and jargon, personal names, geographic names, word puzzles, and more. We will also consider the role
of literary, social, and political forces in shaping the development of languages and even individual lexical items.

COMP 12 Living by Words: Surviving and Thriving in the Art and Sport of Rhetoric (Same as
English 29, INTR 12 and Special 22)
Whether dealing in the realms of public life, commerce, or academe, the speaker who can clearly and cogently
define or defend a policy, product, or theoretical position is usually the most successful.
Depending on the venue and the aim of the speaker, the words might be artful and poetic, cajoling and competi-
tive, formally read from the page or seemingly delivered impromptu. This course will briefly examine some of
the classic styles of discourse ranging from Ancient Greece to Madison Avenue. Students will make visits to a
variety of venues that employ a special style of professional discourse( TV and radio stations, Albany and Boston
State Houses) and learn a range of methods and techniques for practicing the basics of effective spoken commu-
nication. The practical intent of the course is for participants to develop confident, cogent, and dynamic presenta-
tion styles, to reinforce tight organizational focus and relaxed, natural delivery, and to develop creative ap-
proaches to speaking in front of a group. The course will guide participants through the presentation process
from conception, outlining, and devising the message, to development of visual aids, message delivery, and han-
dling question and answer sessions. Methods employed will include vigorous pursuit of improvisational theater
techniques and vocal training. Participants will deliver brief presentations at each session, and receive intensive
personal coaching and a videotaped record of their personal progress.
The final project will be a presentation delivered at a public forum.
Evaluation will be based on active participation in the class, a written evaluation of a public presentation the
student has attended, and successful completion of mini-presentations during Winter Study and the final presen-
tation at the end of term.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 12.

CSCI 12 Game Design Studio
What makes a game fun? How are new games designed? How do games affect society?
Games are cultural artifacts like films, paintings, and songs. They are also mathematical machines with implica-
tions in areas as diverse as biology, economics, warfare, dating, and traffic planning. In this course we will ex-
plore the art and formal theory of professional game development through readings, in-class discussions, regular
game analysis assignments, and a major project.
For the project, you will work in a self-selected group to create and polish anew game (using both craft materials
and computers) following the principles discussed in class. Additional course work will include playing a large
number of board, computer, card, and role-playing games for appreciation and analysis. These will include titles
like Scrabble, Tetris, Settlers of Catan, Mario Kart, DDR, Go, The Sims, and Guitar Hero.
Game development is cross-disciplinary and non-computer science majors are encouraged to enroll. No pre-
vious computer or gaming experience is required.
Requirements: regular short analysis of assigned games. Work on game studio project both in and outside of
class.

a subset of the C programming language. The majority of class time will be spent in the laboratory. Students will
be expected to complete appropriate structured exercises to develop basic skills in robot construction and pro-
gramming. By the conclusion of the course, each team will be required to construct a robot designed to perform a
pre-determined task such as obstacle avoidance, maze navigation, etc. Each team's project goals will be selected
with both the interests and prior backgrounds of the team members in mind.
Each team will be required to give a brief presentation describing their final project (including a demonstration of
their robot's performance) and to submit a written report summarizing the design process.

ECONOMICS
ECON 11 The Economics of Privacy
Are we being watched? Americans are famously protective of their right to privacy, yet it is estimated that 85%
of us can be uniquely identified using only our date of birth, zip code and gender--information that we routinely
make available to the public. The degree to which information technology has lowered the cost of data mining
would appear to have substantial benefits, such as improved disease diagnosis and the prevention of terrorism, as
well as the potential to do great harm (think Big Brother). In this course, we will explore these trade-offs, the
design of public policies to protect privacy and the basic statistical techniques used in data mining. Students will
be evaluated based on participation in class discussion and a research project in which students will use data-min-
ing techniques to analyze a problem of their choice, write up the results and present their findings to the class at
the end of the term.
Requirements: class participation, 10-page paper, and class presentation.

ECON 12 Malaria
The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that malaria, a parasitic disease transmitted by mosquitoes,
causes over 300 million episodes of "acute illness" and more than one million deaths annually. Most of the deaths
occur in poor countries of the tropics, and about 90 percent occur in sub-Saharan Africa. Infants and children
account for most of the mortality from malaria; the disease is thought to account for one of every five child deaths
in the world.
This course will look at malaria as a disease and analyze its biological origins, its short-run health and economic
impacts, and its long run consequences for economic growth. We will look at the economics of prevention, con-
trol, and treatment measures--including pesticide spraying, bednets, vaccine and drug development, etc. We will
talk about the interplay between intellectual property rights systems (e.g., patents) and the development of drugs
and vaccines.
Most class meetings will consist of lectures and discussion. A number of guest speakers will also be invited,
including public health and medical experts, as well as economists.
Evaluation will be based on a 10- to 15-page paper addressing some issue related to malaria, along with class
attendance, participation, and overall effort. A brief presentation of the paper near the end of Winter Study will be
required.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15. Preference will be given to those students with some prior interest or

ECON 13 Mapping Gotham's History (Same as History 17)
Mapmaking allows a vivid rendering of economic history, if one has a worthy subject, the right technology, am-
ple data, and a good guide. Students in this course will explore the history of New York City by learning to
generate maps illustrating the development of its population, neighborhoods, industries, political constituencies,
and commercial and infrastructure links to its hinterlands. The technology and data to be used are those of Geo-
graphical Information Systems (GIS) and Global Positioning Systems (GPS). The guide, in addition to the
instructor, will be Edwin G. Burrows and Mike Wallace's Gotham: A History of New York City to 1898 (Oxford,
1999).
Classes in the first two weeks will combine interactive lab training in GIS and GPS, featuring examples from
eighteenth and nineteenth-century New York, with discussion of Gotham. Lab work and reading will continue in
groups and individually outside of class. The class sessions of the final week and a half will consist of a field trip,
project composition, and student presentations. Students will make their way either individually or in small
groups to New York City and convene at an evening reception at the Williams Club. The next day they will
traverse at least five miles of the City on foot, record observations on the vestiges of its economic history, and
track all of their travels with GPS receivers.
Requirements: Upon their return to Williams students will make use of historical GIS, their GPS readings, and
personal observations to write and present a 10-page paper on their travels though the City's history.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 10. If overenrolled, there will be an attempt to balance majors.
Meeting times: January 3-17, January 22-25: M, W, Th 10-noon. January 18 (Williams Club, NYC): 6-8 p.m.

ECON 14 Accounting
The project will examine the theoretical and practical aspects of financial accounting. Although the beginning of
the course will explore the mechanics of the information gathering and dissemination process, the course will be
oriented mainly towards users, rather than preparers, of accounting information. The project will include discus-
sion of the principles involved in accounting for current assets, plant assets, leases, intangible assets, current lia-
bilities, stockholders' equity, the income statement and the statement of cash flows. Students will be expected to
interpret and analyze actual financial statements. The nature of, and career opportunities in, the field of account-
ing will also be discussed. The project is a "mini course." It will present a substantial body of material and will
require a considerable commitment of time by the student, including regular attendance and participation in dis-
cussion and homework cases and problems.
The course grade will be determined on the basis of several quizzes and a written group report presenting an
analysis of a company's annual report.

Elementary description and analysis of the stock market. Emphasis will be on the roles of the market in our econ-
omy, including evaluation of business firms and the success of particular capital investments, allocating savings
to different types of investment, and providing liquid and marketable financial investments for individual savers.
The course will focus on the description of mechanics of trading on various exchanges and other markets, stock
market indexes or "averages" (Dow-Jones, S&P, 500, etc.), how to read the financial news, historical rates of re-
turn on stocks and portfolios, role of mutual funds, beta coefficients, and "random walk" theory. The course will
also involve a brief introduction to financial reports of firms and analysis of financial ratios.

ECON 16 Real Estate and the Dream of Prosperity
In the United States, the dream of achieving prosperity generally contains home ownership as a central feature. In
advertising, the popular press and in film, home ownership is presented as the defining characteristic of the
American Dream. In this course we will explore---through film and economics-- the role that home ownership
and real estate markets play in defining the economic aspirations and identities of individuals in the United States
and elsewhere. We will view and discuss six films that present the pathetic, comic and tragic aspects of pursuing
this dream. Each film will be discussed, and students will consider and write about the symbolic and economic
significance of home ownership.
Evaluation will be based on participation in class discussions and on 2-page critical essays submitted after view-
ing each film, (a total of 12 pages of writing).

ECON 17 Business Economics
The goal of this course is to explain how the economy works and how it interacts with financial markets. To ac-
complish this, the class will carry out a real-time forecast of the U.S. economy and explore its implications for the
bond and stock markets. The course will build upon principles of both macro and microeconomics. It will pro-
vide an introduction to the work done by business economists and the techniques they use. An economic data-
base, chart-generating software and a statistical analysis program will be available to each student on the Jessup
computers.
The first week will focus on becoming familiar with the database, looking for relationships between key eco-
nomic variables, and studying movements in interest rates over the period 1960-2005. Early in the first week, the
class will be divided into teams of 2 or 3 students with each team choosing a particular aspect of the economy to
forecast.
During the second and third weeks, the class will prepare forecasts of the key components of gross domestic
product and will study other key issues. In the past students have chosen to focus on such areas as: Globalization,
the Outlook for Oil Prices, the impact of China, and the consumer savings rate. We will also have several invited
guests from the Wall Street investment world speaking on various aspects of the stock market. The fourth week
will feature a formal presentation of the economic forecast with invited guests from the Williams College faculty
among others.
The class will meet 3-4 times per week in the morning. During the first week there will be two afternoons of
workshops lasting approximately 30 minutes with hands on instruction for each team.
Each student should expect to spend a reasonable amount of time on homework, to participate in short presenta-
tions of their analyses as the work progresses as well as in the formal presentation during the last week. There
will also be a 3-page paper summarizing the result of the forecast project or the special topic chosen by each
team.
To put the forecasting exercise in context, there will be class discussions of business cycles, credit cycles, long
waves in inflation and interest rates and past stock-market bubbles.
Prerequisites: Economics 110 or another semester course in Economics is strongly recommended. Enrollment
limit: 15.
Cost to student: about $25 for text and other materials.
Meeting time: mornings with afternoon labs. Because essential concepts and tools are covered during the first
week, all students are expected to attend the first class.

ECON 18 The Nation in Indian Cinema
Though the Indian film industry is the world's most prolific, American audiences have little exposure to it. This
course provides an introduction, focusing on Hindi cinema, and showing how its themes have evolved in re-
sponse to broader changes in Indian society. In particular, we will examine ways in which Hindi films reflect the
threats perceived by the nation, and the resolutions attempted. We will also compare Hindi cinema's norms and
conventions to those used in Hollywood cinema.
Students will write a 2-page response to each film. Reading will consist of film analysis and also background
reading on Indian social history.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 10. Students who have taken a course on South Asia will be given preference.
Cost to student: $25 for readings.
Meeting time: afternoons, twice a week to watch the films (a total of seven) and twice a week for discussion.

ECON 19 Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA)
This course examines tax policy towards low-income families in the United States, and has the following three
objectives: 1) For students to understand the shift of redistributive policy in the United States from income sup-
port through the transfer system (Aid to Families with Dependent Children/Temporary Assistance for Needy
Families) towards support of working individuals through the tax system (primarily the Earned Income Tax
Credit (EITC)); 2) For students to understand the challenges that low income individuals have "making ends
meet" and to understand the role that the EITC has played in increasing the standard of living of the working
poor; and 3) To enable students to understand the tax code well enough to prepare simple income tax returns,
including those for filers claiming the EITC. Students will be trained by the IRS to prepare income tax returns for
low-income individuals and families. At the end of the term, students will use their newly acquired expertise to
help individuals and families in Berkshire County prepare and file their returns.
Students must complete IRS VITA training; staff one session of tax preparation assistance during the final week
of winter term; and write a 10-page analytical and reflective essay.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 14.
Cost to student: $100 for texts and coursepack.
Meeting time: mornings, with the possibility of occasional afternoon meetings to accommodate guest speakers.

ECON 25 The Millenium Development Goals and Africa: A Case Study of South Africa
In 2000 all United Nation member states committed to the Millennium Development Goals--a set of well-de-
fined objectives aimed at reducing poverty, improving health and education, achieving gender equality and pro-
moting environmental sustainability--particularly for the poorest in developing countries. Progress in Africa,
however, has lagged--in the face of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, policy failures and faltering support from indus-
trialized countries. South Africa's Finance Minister Trevor Manuel has warned that at the current pace, it may
take another century to meet the goals-well past the targeted date less than a decade away.
South Africa's progress is mixed--with remarkable achievements in certain areas, and poor progress in others.
Nevertheless, policy-makers in South Africa have laid out an aggressive strategy aiming to meet the objectives.
Following the country's first democratic elections in 1994, the government's economic policies have turned
around an economy that was in crisis. Development strategy has reduced poverty, but slowly, and enormous
backlogs in social delivery of housing, health care and education still exist. South Africa remains one of the most
unequal countries in the world, grappling with the costs and benefits of globalization as the government em-
braces free trade and financial liberalization, yet attempts to implement policies aimed at reducing poverty and
improving social equity.
This course will investigate South Africa's progress towards the Millennium Development Goals, examining
successes and failures in the areas of health, education, housing, social protection, gender equality and the envi-
ronment. Through meetings with Parliamentarians and bureaucrats, businesspeople and social activists, teachers
and students, labor leaders and health care workers, the participants in this course will learn about the challenges,
successes and failures of South Africa's social development strategy. The unifying theme of this course explores
the constraints and opportunities policy-makers face as they aim to achieve the most fundamental development
goals. The course will analyze how apartheid's legacy has framed the problem--and how national and global
strategies interact to support and sometimes stymie the achievement of these goals. Using social and economic
data, first-hand observation and meetings with key stakeholders, students will acquire skills in evaluating the
effectiveness of the government's approach to socio-economic development.
The course will be co-taught by Professor Michael Samson and Mr. Kenneth Mac Quene, Executive Director of
the Economic Policy Research Institute.
Evaluation will be based on class participation and a 10-page paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20. Not open to first-year students.
Cost to student: approximately $3,485--includes airfare, accommodation, meals, and other expenses.

ECON 27 Henry George, Eliminating Poverty
Henry George, an American economist (1839-1897) published Progress and Poverty in 1879. In this he ob-
serves that with increasing wealth there is increasing poverty and he offers a solution to this problem. We will
study Progress and Poverty to understand his theory and his remedy and to understand the possibility of its ap-
plication today.
George's remedy is to tax land to the exclusion of all other taxes. Today the Georgist movement uses this idea to
encourage cities to modify the property tax, which, in most places, taxes land and buildings at the same rate, to
reduce the tax on buildings and to increase the tax on land to produce the same yield. We will study the effect of
shifting the property tax from buildings to land in the twenty Pennsylvania cities that have adopted this idea.
Winter Study Program

One of the great problems of the world today is that in many countries, a small minority of the people, own most
of the land. We will study the possible use of George's ideas to ameliorate this problem.
Evaluation will be based on attendance and the completion of a 10-page paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20.
Cost to student: $5 for a copy of Progress and Property.

ECON 51 Tax Policy in Emerging Markets
Governments in developing and transition economies need to raise tax revenue to finance critical public goods,
address other market failures and equity issues, and to avoid problems with debt and inflation. Even under ideal
conditions, figuring out how to raise taxes in a way that balances efficiency, equity, and administrative feasibility
is a hard problem. But taxation is especially challenging in emerging markets, because of the great difficulty
involved in taxing much of the economic activity there, serious problems with tax evasion and administration,
and the various imperfections in the economic environment in which taxes are collected. Taxes typically con-
sume between a fifth and a third of the proceeds of economic activity in these nations, and they profoundly affect
the incentives to undertake all varieties of economic activity. So in terms of economic growth and welfare, the
stakes involved in improving tax policy are potentially quite large. This class will build on knowledge developed
in basic public economics (Economics 503 or 205) or tax policy (Economics 351) courses to provide a more
in-depth investigation of the special problems involved in tax policy in developing and transition economies, and
possible approaches to addressing these problems. Examples of specific topics that might receive particular em-
phasis include tax evasion, tax administration, corruption, consideration of how the particular conditions in de-
veloping and transition economies may affect the optimal structure of the tax system, options for fundamental tax
reform, case studies of the experience with tax reforms in various developing and transition economies, interna-
tional aspects of taxation, and tax competition among regions and nations.
Students will be evaluated based on a 10-page research paper, some shorter written assignments, and an oral
presentation.
Prerequisites: one public economics or tax policy course (Economics 503, 205 or 351), and one empirical meth-
ods course (Economics 253, 255, 510, 511, or Statistics 346). Enrollment limit: 19. This course is intended for
CDE students and is open to undergraduates only with permission of instructor.
Cost to student: approximately $25 for reading packets.

ECON 52 Computable General Equilibrium Model
A common tool for applied policy work is the Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model. These models
are used extensively by various NGO's when deciding aid and policy recommendations. Advanced undergradu-
ates or masters students can attain a basic understanding of these models in a relatively short time frame. The
great advantage of these models is that they capture the general equilibrium feedback effects of policy proposals
on various sectors of the economy. This is of great importance to applied work, as this allows the identification of
the winners and losers from potential policies. The class will begin with a general overview of CGE models,
followed by a detailed construction of a simple model for the US. During the latter part of the course, students
will create a CGE model for a country of their choice (preferably their home country). This exercise will provide
them with a basic model to use to examine the possible effects of various changes in national policy. Interested
students could continue this project as a potential thesis topic.
Evaluation: Students will be evaluated using problem sets and their country-specific model.
Prerequisites: Economics 251 or instructor consent. Enrollment limit: 20. Course intended for CDE fellows, un-
dergraduate enrollment limited and only with instructor permission.

ENGL 11 The Arcades Project
Regarded by the Frankfurt School philosopher Walter Benjamin as his masterpiece, The Arcades Project is one
of the most elusive, allusive, challenging, and endlessly productive philosophical/historical works of the twen-
tieth century. Taking as its aim (even as one of our questions will be whether this work could ever be reduced to
"aims" or "ends") nothing less than an historical materialist account of the nineteenth century, Benjamin's book
attempts to bring to philosophical writing the methodologies of collage and montage. Among his objects of inter-
est: the arcades of Paris, panoramas, world exhibitions, the flâneur, photography, phantasmagoria, collecting,
boredom, and on and on and on. Out of this cultural detritus, the book performs something like a dream analysis
of the nineteenth century, regarding capitalism, for example, with all its rationalization of human wants as "a
reactivation of mythical forces." Benjamin worked on The Arcades Project over a period of thirteen years, and it
remained unfinished and unpublished at the time of his death in 1940. Clocking in at just over a thousand pages
and comprised by fragments, aphorisms, and quotations, the book calls out for new modes of thinking and read-
ing, modes we'll attempt to evolve together during the class as we investigate Benjamin's own investigations of
modernity.
Format: seminar. Requirements: short writing assignments as well as a longer final essay of c. 10 pages; lead one
discussion or do an in-class presentation.

ENGL 12 Looking at Contemporary Documentary Photography (Same as ArtH 12 and Special 27)
This course explores the evolution of modern documentary photography. We will start with Robert Frank's The
Americans, and examine how Frank's singular vision deeply shaped the next generation of photographers work-
ing the American streets and landscape. Diane Arbus, Bruce Davidson, Lee Freidlander, William Klein, Danny
Lyon, Gary Winogrand are some of the photographers whose work we will get to know well. Discussions will
include the new wave of independent and Magnum photojournalists (Phillip Jones Griffiths, Josef Koudleka,
Susan Meiselas, Gilles Peress, James Nachtwey, Alex Webb, and Tyler Hicks) and the wars from Vietnam to
Bosnia to Iraq they cover as well as the personal visions they explore. Insight into the diverse currents of docu-
mentary photography will be covered through the work of Bill Burke, Larry Clark, Larry Fink, Nan Goldin,
Emmet Gowin, Sally Mann, Mary Ellen Mark, Nicholas Nixon , Richard Misrach, Joel Sternfeld, Birney Imes,
Regan Louie, Edward Burtynsky, Laura Letinsky and Simon Norfolk.
Slide presentations will occupy half of the first meetings and give way to discussion of issues in documentary
photography. Students will be encouraged to work on individual projects of their own choice. Each student will
be required to make a brief presentation to the class ona documentary topic of their choice. A final paper expand-
ing on this documentary topic will be due at the end of the course.
Students will be evaluated on their classroom presentation, general participation and their written work. A field
trip to New York will let us see first hand works from the collections at the Museum of Modern Art, Whitney
Museum of American Art and the International Center of Photography.

ENGL 13 Documentary Video Production (Same as ArtS 13)
This course teaches the basics of documentary filmmaking through an experiential approach. Each student will
learn the fundamentals of video production and editing by making a 3- to 6-minute documentary about some
aspect of the local or college community. The short documentaries will be compiled into a magazine format
show that will be broadcast on Willinet, the Williamstown Community Access Television Station.
The class will meet at the Willinet studio on Spring Street. The first week of Winter Study will be class heavy
(approximately 4 hours daily) and will cover the basic technology and examples of short and long form docu-
mentary. Students will also use class time to create a 30-second Public Service Announcement to practice filming
and editing. The rest of the course will consist primarily of independent work on the documentaries and then
pulling the final Access program together, with only occasional meetings of the full class as needed.
Projects will be evaluated on successful communication of your idea.

ENGL 14 Transcending Jazz (Same as Music 14)
With bebop, jazz attained a startling level of accomplishment in harmonic and rhythmic sophistication and in
technical virtuosity. Yet even as bebop emerged as the epitome of jazz modernity, many musicians--including
central bebop icons--were already developing hybrid forms. Some began to move jazz toward popular dance
music, from rumba and bossa nova to rhythm and blues. Others introduced stronger elements of blues and gospel
into jazz. Another group, drawing upon classical music, wrote complex scores for larger ensembles, often in-
cluding instruments not traditionally used in jazz. The most adventurous of these innovators were those who
attempted to reach beyond music altogether, using jazz as a medium for exploring and expressing spiritual truths.
This course will consider the latter group, concentrating on Sun Ra, Charles Mingus, Albert Ayler, John Col-
trane, Pharoah Sanders, and the Art Ensemble of Chicago. Texts for the course will include interviews, liner
notes, reviews, writings by the musicians (including liner notes and poems), performance videos, and of course,
recordings.
Each student will write a 15-page paper on one of these artists.
The course is designed for students with a serious interest in Jazz Studies, Africana Studies, American Studies, or
Religious Studies. Enrollment limit: 15.
Cost to student: about $100.

ENGL 15 The Hours and Mrs. Dalloway
The Hours, a 1998 novel by Michael Cunningham and a 2003 film directed by Stephen Daldry (starring Meryl
Streep, Nicole Kidman, and Julianne Moore), weaves together scenes of Virginia Woolf writing her ground-
breaking modern novel, Mrs. Dalloway, a fifties housewife who is reading the novel, seeing herself in Mrs. Dal-
loway, and a woman who relives the novel in a highly contemporary way while planning a party for a friend
dying of AIDS in 2001. After discussing the film of The Hours, we will spend a week exploring Virginia
Woolf's life, reading selections from her letters, diaries, memoirs, and biographies, discussing her artistic innova-
tion, the radical social experiments of the Bloomsbury group, Woolf's mental illness, and suicide. In the second
week we will examine Mrs. Dalloway along with the 1999 film adaptation (directed by Marleen Gorris, starring
Vanessa Redgrave), discussing social and artistic experimentation and convention, and the ways in which
Woolf's high modernist form is adapted to the cinema. In the final week, we will return to The Hours, analyzing
Cunningham's novel (along with the film) as an innovative work of art which is at once an insightful tribute to
and a thoughtful interpretation of Woolf's life and work.
Students are expected to attend all the classes and the scheduled screenings of the films, to complete the reading,
to take an active and informed role in class discussion, and to write a series of short essays.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15.
Cost: $60 for books.

ENGL 17 The Work of Flannery O'Connor
It is hard not to laugh when reading Flannery O'Connor. Her stories and short novels are filled with mirth and it is
plain fun to read them. That is the central aim of the course: to read and delight in her fiction and to discuss its
merits together in seminar. As all good comedy is, her stories deal with serious matter: the depth of human pas-
sion, the hidden recesses of the human heart, fighting with God, finding our true compass, the surprises that turn
us around. Our seminars together will no doubt touch on most of these matters. We will read much of her work:
all of her short novels, many of her stories, and some of her letters.
Participation is essential to a seminar and is the basis for a third of the student's grade; the remaining two thirds
will be based on a final paper of 10-15 pages.

ENGL 18 "Oscar Wilde"
Oscar Wilde is one of the most celebrated and important writers of the Aestheticist movement of the late 19th
century, and without question the funniest. Because of the notorious calamity of his trial and imprisonment for
sodomy, he is also a pivotal figure in the modern social history of sexuality. In this course we will survey the
principal literary works of Wilde, including several plays (e.g., The Importance of Being Earnest, Lady Winder-
mere's Fan), his novel The Picture of Dorian Gray, and some of his aphorisms and dialogues on aesthetics. We
will study at some length the Wilde trials themselves, as well as their bitter fruit, the autobiographical dramatic
monologue De Profundis and "The Ballad of Reading Gaol." Additional readings will be drawn from critical
and biographical accounts of Wilde.

contemporary photography of Thomas Struth and Andreas Gursky--in order to explore what such works can
tell us about their historical contexts and what larger questions they open about the meaning and status of the
visual image as such. We will read these images in relation to the aesthetic/philosophical writing of Hegel, Lacan,
Derrida and Louis Marin, as well as the contextualizing work of writers such as Vasari, Burckhardt, Martin
Kemp, Svetlana Alpers, Norman Bryson and Stephen Melville.
Requirements: 10-page final paper.

ENGL 20 Henry James: The Golden Bowl
In this course we will closely analyze Henry James' The Golden Bowl, which all consider to be his last, and
many his greatest, novel. This long, demanding and capacious book dramatizes many of James' most powerful
preoccupations. Centered on a wealthy American collector living in England at the turn of the twentieth century,
the novel examines the personal and cultural costs of an American obsession with amassing relics of a collapsing
European empire, as well as the effects of wealth and refined sensibility on tangled love relations. The novel's
ethical and perceptual subtlety is conveyed in an ingeniously complex style that requires close concentration.
Requirements: faithful attendance, active participation and 10 pages of writing.

coming together of the comic and serious strands in such plays as Rosencrantz and Gildenstern are Dead,Jump-
ers, Travesties, On the Razzle, The Real Thing, and Arcadia. If time permits we will also read and talk about
some of the short plays such as The Real Inspector Hound and Artist Descending a Staircase.

will be on the widespread economic and ecological effects of mismanaging surface water supplies; on the way
U.S. clean water legislation has addressed pollution issues, including a remarkable reliance on engaged, active
citizens; how changing conditions may require new solutions; and how other countries are addressing (or failing

ENVI 25 Sustainable Resource Management
In this age of rampant consumption and global warming, the challenges of developing sustainable living practic-
es are becoming ever more acute. Many countries throughout the globe seek to redress their inability to provide
adequate food, clean water, and energy by experimenting with new models of self-sufficiency. Some of the most
exciting work in this field is in the Caribbean, where island nations have long been dependent on other econo-
mies for basic survival. Based at the Cape Eleuthera Institute, a leading ecological design facility in the Bahamas,
this class introduces students to the cutting edge of sustainable practices and public policy.
The Bahamas is an ideal place to study the problems of resource management--the country imports all of its fuel
oil, over 95% percent of its food, and 2 million gallons of fresh water daily. Like many Caribbean islands, the
Bahamas faces challenges in growing food that range from nutrient supply (deficient calcium carbonate soils),
seasonal disturbance (hurricanes, droughts), and a declining interest in agriculture among youth. To be successful
in shifting some food supply to within the national borders, the Bahamas must look at nutrient harvesting and
sharing, technology integration and education to marry food production with other areas of technological interest
and income potential. Farming is one of the most powerful ways to create responsible stewardship of the land.
The Cape Eleuthera Institute (CEI) serves as a demonstration project for sustainable agriculture, aquaculture,
waste-water treatment, renewable energy, ecological architecture, alternative fuels with a goal of technology
transfer and community development. The facilities at CEI are constructed from local materials and powered by
solar energy, the water is collected rainfall, the wastewater is treated on-site through a series of filtering gardens,
and the vehicles (including boats) use waste vegetable oil.
Students will participate in an intensive 17-day sustainable agriculture and design course team-taught by CEI
staff and visiting faculty who are experts in particular areas (including Sarah Gardner). Learning will include
classroom time as well as hands-on work in the field (CEI has a large experimental farm), and group problem-
based design projects. By combining knowledge of local ecosystems, soils, hydrology, new technology and tech-
niques, and public policy initiatives, students will work toward the goal of creating new models for resource
management that are linked to local culture and conditions.
Course requirements include participating in the program at CEI, working on a design team group project in
Eleuthera, writing a 10-page paper that applies the concepts learned in the program to the team project, and par-
ticipating in preparing and delivering a public presentation about the winter study experience at Williams. During
a follow-up session at Williams, students will discuss means of applying the knowledge and experience they
have gained in the Bahamas to the challenges of developing sustainable systems in other local contexts. The
students will share their experiences by giving an Environmental Studies Log Lunch talk and slide show on
February 9, 2007.
Enrollment limit: 10. Preference to Environmental Studies concentrators. Not open to first-year students.
Dates: Jan. 3-Jan. 26. (Bahamas: Jan. 4-Jan. 22). Class meetings at Williams on Jan. 3 and Jan. 24.

GEOS 12 Landscape Photography (Same as Environmental Studies 12)
This class will broaden students' appreciation for the appearance and history of the landscape and teach the skills
of making a successful photograph.
Williamstown, situated in a valley between the Green and Taconic Mountains and bisected by the Green and
Hoosic Rivers, is a place of great natural beauty. The local landscape is a subject that inspires both professional
and amateur photographers alike. While Williamstown will be the subject of most of our work, we will use it to
learn principles of universal application. Students will discover the importance of light in making a photograph.
They will also learn camera skills and the mechanics of photography to make slides, which will be reviewed at
biweekly class meetings.
In addition to photographing and critiquing slides, the class will visit collections at the Clark Art Institute and
Winter Study Program

WCMA to see original work and examine and discuss books on reserve at Sawyer Library. An overview of the
history of landscape photography will be provided with an emphasis on American workers such as Carlton Wat-
kins, William Henry Jackson, Edward Weston, Ansel Adams, and Alvin Langdon Cobern. We will also demon-
strate examples of different cameras such as medium format, view cameras, and panorama cameras.
Students will produce a body of successful photographs/slides, which will be presented in a class web page.
Evaluation will be based on attendance, the student's photography and their presentation.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15. Priority given to first and second-year students.
Students will need a 35mm camera.
Cost to student: approximately $60 for film and materials.

geologic processes (volcanism, glaciations, etc.). Readings will include a paperback text (Plates and Parks) as
well as short publications of the U.S. Geological Survey and of various natural history associations. The second
part of the month will involve independent study of topics chosen by the students in preparation for half-hour oral
presentations during the last week. The oral reports will be comprehensive, well illustrated explanations of the
geology of a particular national park or monument of the student's choice, using maps, slides, and reference
materials available within the department and on the internet. A detailed outline and an accompanying bibliogra-
phy will be submitted at the time of the oral presentation.
Evaluation based on attendance and participation and on the quality of the final report.

GERM 11 Anarchism: Old and New Beginnings (Same as Special 17)
The tendencies now known collectively as "globalism" first emerged in Europe and the United States early in the
19th century. And the first opposition to them was not slow in coming: beginning in 1840 with Proudhon's
"What is Property," a body of theoretical and programmatic texts arose to popularize anarchism as a radical alter-
native to both established governments and new political movements like communism and social democracy. In
the last quarter of the century, anarchist ideas took practical form in sabotage, insurrection and assassination.
Among several prominent victims of the last was an American president, William McKinley, in 1901. This unor-
ganized strategy of spectacular individual acts, called "propaganda of the deed," failed completely; and anar-
chism generally went dormant during the twentieth century, which was dominated by conflicts among dictatorial
communism, fascism, corporate capitalism, and bourgeois democracy. But anarchist ideas have regained wide-
spread interest in the last fifteen years, as globalist, statist and social authoritarian trends become more and more
pressing in economic, intellectual, cultural and personal life as well as in government.
The course will have a non--but-not-necessarily--anti-anarchist format: In the first two weeks we'll read some
of the founding documents of theoretical anarchism by Proudhon, Bakunin and Kropotkin and study late 19th-
century anarchist activism in Europe and the United States. In the third week we'll look at the revival of anar-
chism in the present, focusing on efforts to develop more effective modes of action than "propaganda of the
deed." Students will pursue individual projects on various theoretical and practical aspects of old and new anar-
chism, on which they will report to the class in the fourth week and in a final 10-page paper or the equivalent.
Evaluation will be based on class participation and final projects.

GERM 24 Ringstrasse Vienna
New York has Broadway, Paris has the Champs-Elysées, and Vienna has the Ringstrasse--streets that somehow
define the very city by virtue of their history and their power. The Ringstrasse and the major buildings that face it
were all built together in the late 19th century during the short-lived political prominence of bourgeois liberalism.
As Carl Schorske details in his seminal Fin de Siecle Vienna, each of the buildings celebrates a different aspect of
the values for which the bourgeoisie wanted to congratulate itself: The neo-Classic Parliament alludes to Greek
democracy, the neo-Renaissance University harks back to the heyday of secular learning, the neo-Gothic City
Hall evokes the day of a municipal independence that Vienna, as the capital of a multi-ethnic empire, never actu-
ally experienced. It is perhaps the neo-Baroque Burgtheater that is most true to the city's traditional identity:
steeped in drama and illusion, inextricably tied to its Catholic and imperial past. But Vienna has always had a
self-critical, self-ironic edge as well, which surfaces in its rich literary and psychoanalytic tradition. This course
will explore both sides of this apparent contradiction.
The course will start in Williamstown; we'll spend the first week of Winter Study learning the history of the
Ringstrasse and studying the Arthur Schnitzler's play Reigen (and the scandal surrounding it), and excerpts from
Freud's Traumdeutung and his Studien in Hysterie. All of these texts are scathing exposés of the usually re-
pressed core of the rigid Viennese social structure around 1900. We will spend the middle two weeks of Winter
Study in Vienna (January 7-21), where we will use the Ringstrasse as our anchor point in an exploration of the
city's identity. Beginning with a tour of the Museum of the City of Vienna, the class will hit the high points of the
Ringstrasse, from the imperial Hofburg to the Secession building, the temple of turn-of-the-century art nouveau.
We will then dig more deeply into the Viennese mentality, through encounters with literary and psychological
sites and materials. We will attend a performance at the Burgtheater, visit Freud's house in the 9th district, and
hear readings by contemporary authors in the Alte Schmiede, a site for cutting edge literary activity. Finally, we'll
delve into the multicultural corners of Austria's identity that are initially obscured by the monumentalism of the
Ringstrasse, from the traditional Naschmarkt, extending from the Ring toward the outer districts, with its food
and clothing booths full to the brim with Eastern European, Middle-Eastern, and Asian specialties, to the literary
work of recent migrants from areas that were formerly subordinate parts of the Habsburg Empire, but are now
nations in their own right: Poland, Rumania, and Bulgaria. Upon our return from Vienna, we'll spend the last
week of Winter Study digesting what we've experienced. In this week, pairs of students will make presentations
on one aspect of the trip, using materials they've gathered and compiled in Vienna.
Requirements: one 3- to 5-page preparatory paper before the trip, a journal during the trip, and a 3- to 5-page
collaborative paper/presentation following the trip.
Prerequisites: German 104 or equivalent proficiency. Enrollment limit: 8. Not open to first-year students.

HIST 10 African American History and American Film
This course will address some of the major themes in African American History through film. We will focus on
how certain films addressed such issues as African American enslavement, labor, urbanization, political activ-
ism, and everyday social life. Viewing the work of filmmakers from Oscar Micheaux to Spike Lee, the course
will pay particular attention to how the political and social context of certain decades influenced films made by,
for, and about African Americans.

HIST 11 Generations and Turnings in Film (Same as Leadership Studies 11)
This course uses a series of films, combined with basic and supplementary readings, to help understand five
generations of Americans and the relatively recent history they have gone through. The generations are the GIs,
or "Greatest" generation (born 1905-24), the Silent generation (1925-42), the Boom generation (1943-61), Gen-
eration X (or the "Thirteenth" generation) (1962-81), and the Millennial Generation (1981-?), to which today's
college students belong. The films show how different generations coped with similar situations, including
young adulthood, college, the military, as returning veterans, and as parents.
Meanwhile, the course examines the key features of the four kinds of eras, or "turnings," which William Strauss
and Neil Howe argue make up basic 80-year eras in American history. These include the Crisis of the depression
and Second World War (1929-45); the "American High," or consensus era, of 1946-64; the Awakening of
1965-84; and the Unraveling, roughly 1985 to the present. We seem now to be moving into a new Crisis, or
Fourth Turning, which will redefine American institutions and the United States' place in the world.
The basic text for the course will be William Strauss and Neil Howe,The Fourth Turning (New York, 1996), 336
pages, which must be read before the first course meeting. While very readable, it will introduce you to the ter-
minology and basic approach that we will be investigating. In addition, we will read several short articles.
Films will be the heart of the course material. We will meet in class twice a week (once the first week) for three
hours in the morning, some of which will be taken up by watching films. You are also responsible, however, for
watching two additional films per week, shown on the afternoons before class meetings. One or two of these
films may last as long as 3 hours. We shall schedule showings of these films, although it you want to obtain tapes
or DVDs you may watch them at your convenience.
The final paper, approximately 15 pages, will track some political or personal issue across several generations
with the help of appropriate readings of films. Students should begin thinking about their paper topic while read-
ing The Fourth Turning.
This class raises a wide range of political, social, and philosophical issues. Different viewpoints make the class a
success. Students should come prepared to express themselves.
Requirements: class participation, and a 15-page paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 25.
Cost to student: $30-50 for books and Xeroxes.
Meeting time: mornings, twice a week for three hours.

HIST 13 Seeing `Red': Exploring Cao Xueqin's Dream of the Red Chamber
Cao Xueqin's novel Dream of the Red Chamber (Honglou meng) is widely acknowledged as one of China's
greatest works of fiction. Set in an aristocratic household of the mid-Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), it is the story of
the unconventional Jia Baoyu, a boy born with a magical jade in his mouth who shuns the masculine world of
public life and study for the company of his female relatives. As such, the novel provides an inversion of late
imperial moral orthodoxies and gender roles.
Dream of the Red Chamber is an extraordinarily rich text that has been valued for its wordplay, poetic expres-
sion, depictions of Chinese medicine, and insights into garden design as well as for its plot and characters. This
course will serve as an introduction to the novel. We will focus on its observations of daily life in an extended
upper-class family, its depictions of sentiment, gender, and sexuality, and its Buddhist themes of karma and trans-
cendence. All readings will be in English translation.
Requirements: class participation, short response papers, and a final paper or project.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20.
Cost to student: approximately $60 for books
Meeting time: afternoons, Tuesday and Thursday for three hours.

Autobiography of Malcolm X, Silent Spring, The Second Sex, Apocalypse Now, Jane Fonda, Martin Luther King,
Jr., SDS (Students for a Democratic Society), the Berkeley Teach-In, Vietnam Veterans Against the War--all
these will help us understand the relevance of the campus protests of yesteryear to those of today. Attention will
also be paid to the relationship between campus activism and electorial politics. Final project may include orga-
nizing a teach-in, holding a town meeting, inviting speakers to campus, working on local election campaigns, or
traveling to protest activities elsewhere.
Requirements: class participation and a 10-page final paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20.

sive, the assassinations of Martin Luther King, Jr. and Robert Kennedy, and the unrest at the National Democratic
Convention in Chicago. In addition to these political events, we will also look at the year through explorations of
television, movies, print media, and popular music.
Evaluation will be based on a research project to be conducted in conjunction with the instructor and a librarian.

HIST 16 Genealogy
In this course, students will become familiar with the basic methodology of genealogical research and use this
information to create a family history. Students will conduct research using primary and secondary sources, in-
cluding vital records (birth, marriage and death certificates), federal and state census records, immigration re-
cords, military service and pension records, naturalization records, probate and court records, newspapers, city
directories, published genealogies, and internet sources. Students will index vital records in Pownal, Bennington
County, Vermont, to learn what information is included in the records and become familiar with computerized
databases. This is a community service for all future genealogists and is required. The course will be held at the
National Archives and Records Administration Center on Conte Drive in Pittsfield to gather Federal Records
and then include field trips to local libraries and town clerks's offices. Students will complete a family history
using both secondary and primary sources. They will become familiar with the process of historical research, in-
cluding formulating theories, finding evidence through various media (including oral interviews, records,
ephemera, and published sources), and drawing conclusions based on that research.
Requirements: Students will complete a family history from 2007 to 1850 minimum (equivalent to a 10-page
paper).
No prerequisites. Students should have some basic family knowledge, such as names and locations, including
counties of ancestors on April 1st in 1930. Enrollment limit: 15.

HIST 18 City of Steeples: Charting the North Adams Renaissance
North Adams was once a thriving, multiethnic center of textile and electronics production. Since Sprague Elec-
tric moved away in the 1980s, the city has been striving to reinvent itself as a center of arts, culture, and small-
scale technology. Although North Adams has undergone a renaissance in recent years, anchored at Mass MoCA,
it remains one of the most impoverished communities in Massachusetts. Has the economic recovery benefited
only a portion of the city? What would it take to forge a community renaissance that would uplift all of North
Adams--in particular, generating new work that provides livable income and health care?
This Winter Study course combines historical research on the North Adams economy (first 2 weeks) with field
work on the process of reshaping its economy (second 2 weeks). The instructor, a North Adams resident, was
formerly the city's public historian. Each student will keep an email journal and produce a 10-page report on an
aspect of North Adams economic and cultural regeneration. Full participation mandatory.

in U.S. Popular Music Video (Same as Women's and Gender Studies 11)
Since MTV's inaugural broadcast in 1982, the music video format has irrevocably altered the ways in which
audiences experience, interpret, and consume popular music in the United States. Despite its continued success,
the music video genre has long been the subject of critiques from across the political spectrum due to its frequent-
ly problematic representations of women, people of color, and/or queer individuals. Departing from a brief his-

LEGAL STUDIES
LGST 13 The Law and the Literature of the Environment: The Environment on Trial (Same as
Environmental Studies 13)
Taught from the perspective of an experienced trial attorney, this course will examine the role environmental law
plays in the United States today in light of how that role has developed during the nearly forty years since the
modern era of environmental law began. As a preface, we will consider the significantly more limited influence
of environmental law in our national affairs before 1970 and some of the historical and political reasons for that
situation, in particular how the law's early application in the first half of the 20th century almost exclusively to
conservation and the preservation of natural resources somehow took on in the second half a markedly different
approach, one emphasizing pollution control and all but ignoring resource conservation.
This course will begin by tracing the development of an American consciousness towards the environment
through an examination of our law and our literature. The term "law" includes state and federal judicial decisions
and legislation, particularly during the presidency of Theodore Roosevelt and during the decades which followed
the year 1970 when much of the legal basis for the American environmental protection movement was estab-
lished. The term "literature" includes not just the written word but also painting, sculpture, and music. We will
examine the historical and legal choices we as Americans have made which have put our environment on trial.
What has occurred in our development as a people that explains this quintessentially American phenomenon?
Our journey begins with the Puritans of New England and the planters of Virginia and their predecessors in the
New World and then moves swiftly to the beginning of the modern era in environmental law.
In light of this historical situation students will examine state and federal legislative and judicial attempts to ad-
dress environmental problems and then try to reach informed, rational conclusions as to whether those attempts
were successful. What were the political, social and economic issues involved and, ultimately, how did their con-
Winter Study Program
­ 369 ­
text affect the legal solution imposed. Cases decided at the appellate level will be introduced and examined
through their trial court memoranda opinions in order to observe how the legal system actually works and how
frequently the reasoning behind the trial judge's decision changes as the case works its way through the appellate
process.
This course will be presented from a litigator's point of view, that is to say, both the practical and the theoretical,
emphasizing what is possible to achieve in the litigator's real world as informed by what the academician would
present from the security of the classroom.
Evaluation will be based on attendance and classroom participation. Students will prepare three short papers, 3 to
4 pages each, which will present one or more sides of an issue and form the basis for classroom discussion. They
will be asked to defend or reject the conclusions reached or approaches taken by our courts and legislatures and
by our literature, as broadly defined, on environmental issues.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 16. This course is appropriate for students eager to explore the material pre-
sented and prepared to argue assigned positions on important legal, literary and historical issues.
Cost to student: approximately $60 for books and materials.
Meeting time: mornings., three two-hour sessions a week.

With respect to the first component, the course will more or less replicate the pattern of first year law school class
work. Students will be expected to closely read, summarize, analyze and present their analysis of various classic
legal opinions in areas such as torts, property law, contracts, criminal law, and constitutional law. We will consid-
er and discuss the role of judicial precedents, including instances in which precedents are binding, when they are
not binding, and how courts are able to distinguish precedents rather than simply disregarding them. The struc-
ture of the state and federal courts, the differences between trial level courts and appellate courts, and the ways in
which cases that are initiated in state courts can wind up before a federal court will be discussed. We will discuss
the issues of how in certain cases federal courts are required to apply state law rather than federal common law,
and also how in multi-state matters courts chose the law that they will apply to the facts before them. We also will
consider how courts deal with statutory law, including the relationship between statutory law and the common
law, and the difficult issues of statutory interpretation with which courts are faced every day. We will discuss the
concept of so-called "judicial activism" in constitutional law decisions, and determine whether there is really a
distinction between an "activist judge" and any other judge that is called upon to apply to the words of the U.S
Constitution to a particular case. Students will learn how to "brief" a case for class presentation, and will be
expected to participate fully in class discussion and analysis of these matters.
With respect to the second component, the course will introduce the nature of different law practices, including
the sole or small firm practitioner, the public prosecutor and defender, the "in-house" or corporate counsel, and
the large firm practitioner. Special emphasis will be accorded to practitioners who rarely or never appear in court.
Preparation by students will consist of written materials focusing on different kinds of law practices. If feasible,
we will take tours of various types and sizes of law firms, and will receive a talk by an attorney in the firm de-
scribing the day-to-day life of a working attorney in that firm. Guest lecturers and at least one field trip to the
courthouse will provide further insights into what it means to practice law.
Evaluation of the student will be based on both class participation and the submission of at least one 10-page
analytical paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20. Preference given to students completing the Legal studies Program, then,
in order, juniors, seniors, sophomores, freshman.
Cost to student: photocopying 100-300 pages.

LGST 15 The Work of the Supreme Court: A Simulation (Same as Political Science 15)
The aim of this course is to provide a sense of the personal, theoretical, and institutional characteristics of judicial
decision making at the highest level. At the beginning of the course, all students will be furnished with a set of the
briefs for an actual pending Supreme Court case. Four students (two per side) will be assigned to make oral
arguments to the "Court," which will be composed of eight students, each playing the role of a sitting justice, and
the instructor, who will act as chief justice for purposes of coordination. After hearing arguments, the "Court"
will confer and prepare majority and other opinions and announce them in "open court" at the conclusion of the
term.
Evaluation will be based on the overall credibility in assigned role; effective argument, questions, performance in
conference, drafting, etc. and a 3- to 5-page "reflective" essay in which students will be expected to identify and
comment on some aspect of the work of the Court.

MATHEMATICS and STATISTICS
MATH 10 Designing and Modeling Geometric Shapes (Same as ArtS 10)
The Renaissance was a time which saw no polarity between the sciences and the arts. This is most notably seen
in the works of Leonardo da Vinci, ranging from paintings, sculptures, inventions and scientific study. Leonardo
was an unparalleled genius at bringing together artistic vision and scientific design. This course will attempt, in a
small way, to restore the world view of those days.
Both artists and mathematicians must see things in a deeper way and with more clarity. In bringing these two
worlds together, this course will study beautiful and complicated shapes which appear in current mathematical
research. The ideas revolve around topology (4-dimensional polyhedra), geometry (flexibility and rigidity) and
string theory (spaces of particle collisions). We try to envision and model these shapes using any visual medium
available, such as metalwork, sculptures, paintings, illustrations and even computer graphics. Our goal is to rep-
resent the complex information about these shapes in a visual, tangible model which is accessible to a large audi-
ence. In other words, we play the role of da Vinci, yearning to bring these shapes to life.
Experience in any kind of mathematics is neither expected nor desired. However, a strong visual imagination is
needed. The overall evaluation is based primarily on attendance, exhibition of art projects and an exam.
Prerequisites: experience in art studio is preferred. Enrollment limit: 10.
Cost to student: $50 for a lab fee
Meeting time: mornings.

MATH 11 Proofs from THE BOOK
This course centers around the book Proofs from THE BOOK by Aigner and Ziegler, which collects together 30
elegant mathematical proofs. The title is from an idea of the late mathematician Paul Erdos, that God has in his
hands a book which contains the most beautiful proofs of all mathematical truths, and it is the job of mathemati-
cians to find these proofs.
Course participants will each present one of the book proofs, and write a 10-page paper which gives a historical

MATH 12 Contemporary Movie Criticism
Are there some movies that you love? Are there any movies that you despise? If so, can you make it clear why
you feel so strongly about a film? In this course, students will watch the films of contemporary directors that have
a very distinctive style--styles which they will either love or hate. The students will then study how various
critics have reacted to these directors, and then write their own responses. Directors that will be focused on in-
clude David Gordon Green, Larry Clark, Terry Zwigoff, Kore-eda Hirokazu, and P.T. Anderson. Students will
be required to turn in and present several critical essays throughout the term.
Requirements: a 2-page critical essay due every other class meeting.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15.
Cost to student: none.
Meeting time: mornings, Monday-Friday, with two meetings at least two hours to show movies.

danced professionally for 5 years in New York City and in Europe. Jennifer Muller was a soloist in the dance
company of José Limón before she started her own company in 1974. She has added her own style of movement
to the Limón technique, creating an expansive, free-flowingdance that is wonderful to do and to watch. The class
will be multi-leveled and open to both men and women alike. Previous dance experience preferred. Students will
have the opportunity to choreograph a short piece either as a soloist or in small groups. We will finish the course
with a short lecture-demonstration illustrating what we have learned.

MATH 14 Points of Intersection: Where Algebra and Geometry Meet
An algebraic curve is the set of points satisfying the equation f(x,y) = 0 where f(x,y) is a given polynomial in two
variables. One can ask questions about the relationship between the algebraic properties of the polynomial f(x,y)
and the geometric properties of the algebraic curve defined by f(x,y). For example, suppose we have two alge-
braic curves, one defined by the polynomial f(x,y) and the other by g(x,y). If we know the degree of both f and g,
what can we say about the points of intersection of the two algebraic curves defined by f and g? In this course, we
will study algebraic curves of degree at most three. These topics are a critical part of Algebraic Geometry, a
central part of mathematics for at least the last 200 years.In particular, many of the best mathematicians in the last
few centuries have studied curves of degree three. We will cover the basic machinery for studying algebraic
curves, including points of intersection and homogeneous coordinates.
Evaluation will be based on daily homework, participation in class, and a final project. Students should expect to
spend about 20 hours per week (not including class time) on the course.
Prerequisites: Mathematics 105 or Mathematics 106 or permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 20.
Cost to student: approximately $75 for books
Meeting time: mornings, six hours per week

MATH 15 Godel, Escher, Bach
The main purpose of this course is to read and discuss Godel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid by Doug-
las R. Hofstadter, a groundbreaking book linking mathematical logic, art and music. We will discover and ex-
plore the connections between the mathematics of K. Godel, the drawings of M.C. Escher and the music of J.S.
Bach. We will investigate notions such as meaning and form, pattern, recurrence and self-reference. Special
attention will be devoted to Godel's Incompleteness Principle (which highlights the difference between truth and
proof) and to some of its philosophical implications.
Evaluation will be based on class participation and a 10-page final project.

down through generations, shared in small groups, and transferred between cultures as trade routes emerged. The
social history of knitting in America is a rich reflection of our history of culture. We will examine the social histo-
ry of knitting through a sequence of readings, lectures, and discussions, and explore knitting technique through a
series of projects. Reading list includes: No Idle Hands: The History of American Knitting, by Anne L. MacDo-
nald, related articles provided by the instructor, and Reader's Digest Knitter's Handbook, by Montse Stanley. We
will engage a series of project samples designed to introduce and improve skills of beginning knitters, starting
with simple washcloths, a knitted cap, and culminating in a final project of a felted mittens. Students will also be
required to select and research some aspect of knitting and write a 10-page research paper. Topics will need pre-
approval of the instructor.
Evaluation will be based on participation, projects and a final 10-page research paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15. Enrollment is restricted to beginning knitters and preference will be given
to first-year students.

MUS 25 Singing on the Tiber: Performance and History in Rome (Same as Classics 25)
This course has a unique structure. The Williams Concert and Chamber Choirs (comprising approximately 55
students) will develop a concert program through the fall semester of music of Roman provenance, with particu-
lar attention to the rich and significant repertoire of late medieval and Renaissance vocal music. At the beginning
of Winter Study the students will return to campus for two weeks during which time the musical program will be
rehearsed before departure to Rome. All students will have the OPTION of traveling to Rome.
MUS 25 (section 01--for students traveling to Rome)
On January 20, the choirs will travel to Rome where, over the course of ten days, they will give performances
(both formal concerts and liturgical contributions) in sites of relevance to the music (e.g., music by Palestrina will
be sung in concerts and/or religious services in the churches of St. John Lateran and St. Maria Maggiore as well
as the at the Vatican--all sites where he composed and directed). They will also attend concert and opera per-
formances in the city.
Each student will write a 5-page paper focused on a particular site and either its archeological history or its musi-
cal history.
MUS 25 (section 02--for students opting not to travel to Rome)
Each student will write a 10-page paper focused on a particular site and either its archeological history or its
musical history.
(both sections)
The pre-departure preparation will encompass, in addition to daily choir rehearsals, a series of introductory lec-
tures and conferences focused on the history and culture of Rome from ancient times to the early Baroque era.
Lectures will be team-taught by Professors Bloxam and Hoppin, and will provide a brief introduction to the
development of the city, its principal historical monuments, and the changing role of music in Rome's culture
from ancient times to c.1600. Students will also elect a concentration in conjunction with the lectures, either
pursuing the study of Rome's archaeology and literature with Professor Hoppin, or focusing on a more in-depth
investigation of the city's musical history oriented around the repertoire to be performed on tour.
Music Component (Bloxam)
We will briefly consider the nature and function of music in ancient Rome, including its notation, instruments,
and ritual and social purposes, and then examine the development of Gregorian chant in connection with the rise
and spread of Christianity. Most attention will be given to the most illustrious phase of Rome's musical history,
from the late 15th century through the early 17th century. We will trace the development of sacred and secular
music in the context of the Papal Chapel and other churches in the city through music by such composers as
Josquin, Palestrina, and Monteverdi. Special attention will be paid to the composers whose music will be pre-
sented during the tour, including close analysis of selected works from the choir's tour repertoire.
History/Archeology Component (Hoppin)
We will briefly survey the growth of Rome from a small city-state, founded by Romulus in 753 BCE on the bank
of the Tiber, to a dense metropolis which ran an empire both in the late Republic and especially under emperors
like Augustus and Hadrian, whose building programs transformed the city. We will also consider the role of
spectacle in the life of the ancient city, from census-taking and gladiatorial games to some of the ritual practices
which influenced early Christian practices (e.g. celebrations of a temple's "birthday" and ritual processions to
musical accompaniment). In addition to modern readings on the history and archaeology of Rome, we will con-
sider selected passages from ancient literature which bring to life the sights, sounds and smells of the city in
several different periods.
Prerequisites: audition and/or membership in Williams Concert or Chamber Choir, Fall 2006. Enrollment limit:

PHILOSOPHY
PHIL 11 Aikido and Ethics
Aikido is a Japanese martial tradition that combines the samurai arts of sword and grappling with the philosophi-
cal desire to manifest harmony in the face of conflict. As such, it addresses situations of conflict that manifest
themselves physically, but also offers insight into how to prevent or redirect the energies--social, political, or
psychological--that might otherwise become conflict in one or another aspect of our lives. By integrating physi-
cal and intellectual components, the course seeks to forge in each student a more coherent perspective on the dif-
ficult questions, broadly formulated as "How should I live?", that the study of Ethics puts before us.
The physical training will improve each student's strength, balance, posture, and flexibility. Everyone will also
learn how to throw their friends across the room. About 25% of training time will be devoted to sword and staff
techniques. Intellectually, students will take turns leading class discussions on issues grouped into 4 major top-
ics--Life, Power, War, and Money. While this is not intended to be an "Ethics of Aikido" course, the ethics dis-
cussions will be consistently and constructively flavored by our Aikido training.
Students need to understand that this course entails almost 15 hours of "class" time each week (2 hours of train-
ing each morning and 3 Ethics classes). Assuming the course is fully subscribed, the Ethics classes will divide
into 2 sections of 10 students. Two of the three Ethics classes each week will be held in the early evenings, and
one session each week will be over lunch. Additional relevant experiences, such as meditation practice, misogi,
and Samurai films, will be made available as scheduling permits.
Students will be evaluated on the quality of their participation in both physical and intellectual course compo-
nents, a class presentation, and a final 10-page paper or project which entails a significant investigation of a topic
emerging from the course experience.
Students interested in the course should visit http://www.aikidokids.com/philosophy11.htm before registration
begins.
Prerequisites: same physician's approval on file as the school requires to participate on sports teams. Students do
not have to be especially athletic, and in Aikido women train as equals with men. Enrollment limit : 20.
Cost to student : $100 for uniform and wooden training weapons.
Meeting time: mornings and evenings.

PHIL 12 Ethics Bowl: Case-based Reasoning in Ethics
Ethics Bowl is a nationwide intercollegiate competition in which teams comprising three to five undergraduate
students cooperatively develop, present, and respond to analyses of a set of fifteen morally complex case scena-
rios. In the national program, all teams receive the cases in advance of the competition, but they are not provided
with the question about each case which they'll be asked to address during the tournament. Thus, teams must
work through all facets of the scenarios in order to be prepared for whatever the moderator and judges may ask.
The competition proceeds, tournament style, as a series of matches in which two teams square off in debating a
question concerning the moral features of a given case. However, it is a debate with a difference: because teams
do not know in advance what will be asked, they are not obliged to take a position opposing that of their competi-
tors. They may disagree or concur, but must provide an assessment of their opponents' arguments and justifica-
tion for their own conclusions. The emphasis in presentations is on substantive argumentation, not on rhetoric or
presentation style, and the positions presented typically represent a consensus among all the team members who
have contributed to the preparations and analysis.
This winter study course will be modeled on the Intercollegiate Ethics Bowl format. It will begin with a brief
introduction to reasoning in practical (as opposed to theoretical) ethics and case analysis. Thereafter, students will
begin working through this year's Ethics Bowl cases, some taken from the regional Ethics Bowl competition
held in the Fall and some from the upcoming national competition. The scenarios present ethical problems in one
of a number of personal, professional, or public policy domains (e.g., medical, legal, journalistic, and environ-
mental ethics; issues of academic integrity, personal relationships, etc.) Students in the course will collaborate in
analyzing all of the cases in-depth, but will take primary responsibility for at least one and up to five cases. The
discussion sessions will be intensive, but very much student-driven, with the instructor acting as a coach rather
than as a teacher.
The course will include at least one or two public "scrimmages" which may include teams from area schools
(e.g., Dartmouth, Union). The course is open both to members and to nonmembers of the Williams College
Ethics Bowl team. Please email the instructor (jpedroni@williams.edu) for sample cases from previous competi-
tions.
Requirements: final paper (7-10 pp) based on an Ethics Bowl case of the student's choice.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15 (expected 5-10), priority to current Ethics Bowl team members and to
juniors and seniors (any major).
Cost to student: none.
Meeting time: afternoons.

PHYSICS
PHYS 10 Light and Holography
This course will examine the art and science of holography. It will introduce modern optics at a level appropriate
for a non-science major, giving the necessary theoretical background in lectures and discussion. Demonstrations
will be presented and students will make several kinds of holograms in the lab. Thanks to a grant from the Na-
tional Science Foundation, we have 7 well-equipped holography darkrooms available for student use. At the be-
ginning of WSP, the class will meet for lecture and discussion three mornings a week and for lab 2 afternoons a
week. Later classes will be mainly laboratory.
Students will be evaluated on the basis of regular attendance, completion of 4 laboratory exercises, and a holog-
raphy laboratory project or a 10-page paper. Attendance at all classes and labs is required for a passing grade.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 30. Preference will be given to students with no previous college course in
physics more advanced than Physics 100.
Cost to student: About $50 for holographic film, chemicals, and photocopies.

PHYS 12 Meet the Right Side of Your Brain: Drawing as a Learnable Skill
Representational drawing is not merely a gift of birth or a magical ability, but a learnable skill. If you ever wanted
to draw, but doubted you had the ability or believed you could not learn, then this course is for you. This intensive
course utilizes discoveries in brain research to teach representational drawing. By using simple techniques and
extensive exercises you will discover and develop the perceptual shift from your symbol based left hemisphere to
your visually based right hemisphere. This cognitive shift enables you to accurately see and realistically represent
the physical world. You will learn to draw a convincing portrait, self-portrait, and still life. This course is de-
signed to develop your powers of observation and enhance your innate creative problem solving abilities, which
are applicable in any field. Students need no previous artistic experience, just the willingness and desire to learn a
new skill. Students will be expected to attend and participate in all sessions. They will also be required to keep a
sketchbook recording their progress and complete a final project.
Evaluation will be based on participation, effort, and development. The class will meet two times per week with
substantial additional independent student work. There will be an exhibition of coursework on the final day of
Winter Study.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15, with preference given to juniors and seniors.
Cost to student: cost of text and (approximately) $15 for drawing materials.
Meeting time: mornings.

PHYS 15 Livres des Artists--The Artist Book
In this multidisciplinary class, students will explore and explode the boundaries that traditionally define the an-
cient art of bookmaking. They will step outside of traditional assumptions and preconceived ideas as the class
explores a mode of expression that is creative, graphic, sculptural and very personal. The first half of the course
will explore bookmaking and binding techniques including: paper decoration, printmaking (including mono-
print, stamping, photocopy transfers and transfer drawings), book structures (such as the many variations on the
accordion, tunnel, carousel and inventive), collage and creative writing in order to develop a plan for the creation
of an individual artist's book, a multi-media expression of self that will be designed and executed in the last half
of the class.
Students will be evaluated on class participation and a final project which will be displayed at the end of Winter
Study. Attendance is mandatory.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 12.
Cost to student: $100 plus another $50/75 dependent on the types of supplies/paper/books that students end up
making.
Meeting time: During the first two weeks, students will meet three or four days in a studio/workshop like setting.
The second two weeks will be more open, allowing the student to develop and create their own artist book, with
two required studio days each week and optional extra technique days. Field trips to Chapin Library, the Clark
Art Institute, and the Smith College Museum of Art will be required and scheduled according to class needs, po-
tentially outside of the official meeting times.

POLITICAL SCIENCE
PSCI 10 Political Campaign Ads--Noise, Trash, or Democracy in Action?
American political campaigns have many elements, fund-raising, rallies, lawn signs, and much more. The focus
of this winter study course is on campaign television ads. Some have, it is often claimed, determined the outcome
of elections. Lyndon Johnson's famous 1964 campaign ad of young child plucking flower petals, shown only
once, or the Bush campaign's Willie Horton ad in 1988, are two such examples. The course will examine cam-
paign ads, and the research on how, why, and when they work. One of the charges often leveled against democra-
cy is that the people are easily seduced by clever and devious leaders, the power of rhetoric and images to mis-
lead (among those who have made this argument are Plato and Hobbes). What does it mean to delude or mis-
lead? What does a "good" campaign ad accomplish? Do campaign ads delude or do they educate, or both? Each
student will write a paper analyzing a campaign ad (or the ads used in a campaign) of their choosing.
Evaluation will be based on a 10- to 15-page paper, class attendance and participation.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20.
Selection Criteria: Political Science Majors and then thereafter first come first served.
Costs to students: texts for course (under $100).
Meeting time: four times a week, 10-noon,, Monday-Thursday).
MARCUS
PSCI 11 Grassroots Activism for Social Change
This course will examine the design and implementation of multi-faceted public policy campaigns that employ
strategies ranging from informal advocacy and public education to direct action and litigation, using two success-
ful New York City housing campaigns as the starting point for discussion. Housing Works is a NYC community-
based organization formed in 1990 as an advocacy response to the lack of housing and services for homeless
New Yorkers living with HIV and AIDS. Formed as a membership organization of homeless persons, persons
with HIV/AIDS, advocates and social service professionals, the group has grown to become the largest provider
of housing and related services for homeless persons with HIV/AIDS in the United States, employing class ac-
tion litigation, legislative work, innovative service provision, demonstrations and civil disobedience to achieve
rapid expansion of targeted local, state and national resources. The Housing First! Affordable Housing Cam-
paign is a unique, broad-based coalition that includes virtually all the major organizations involved in housing
development, finance and advocacy in New York City, as well as businesses, labor unions, community groups,
and religious leaders and institutions. The campaign was launched in 2001, in the context of a mayoral election,
to call for increased public investment in affordable housing. Housing First! and its allies kept affordable housing
at the top of the public agenda during one of the most challenging periods in the City's history, with remarkable
success, including a recently released 10-year, $7.5 commitment to create and preserve 165,000 units of housing.
These examples offer an opportunity to study the bases of legitimate action for social change, including partner-
ship with affected persons, coalition building and management, direct experience with social service systems,
and honest evaluations of the individual and systemic causes of social problems. Students will be asked to work
together in teams to develop detailed written advocacy strategies to address identified social issues.
Evaluation: Students will be divided into teams, and will be evaluated on class participation, and on final in-class
presentation on advocacy campaign developed by each team.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit 15.
Meeting time: mornings.

PSCI 12 Democracy or Plutocracy
Just before the final vote at the constitutional convention, Ben Franklin, shed a tear, as he said that although the
Constitution had faults, it should be approved because there is a need for a government that hopefully will be a
blessing "if it is well administered." This course will explore the history of the administration of the three main
branches of government and how they related to this hope of Franklin and the other Founding Fathers as they
expressed it in the Constitution. Topics will include current events that include such questions as: Whether it was
expected that a president could ignore parts of federal laws (e.g., the ban on torturing prisoners, reporting FBI
activities to Congress and requiring court approval for telephone surveillance) in the name of national security?
Whether it was envisioned that Congress would fail to act as a check and balance on the president when a party
was in control of both branches? Whether the Founders thought the Supreme Court would interpret the Constitu-
tion as a living legal document to find unwritten rights?
Evaluation will be based on class participation in discussions and a 10-page paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit 15. Preference given to Political Science and History majors interested in
Constitutional government and law.
Cost to student: none.

PSCI 13 The Art of War (Same as Asian Studies 13)
This course will examine the meaning and uses of the classical Chinese text, The Art of War, by Sun Tzu. Stu-
dents will consider Sun Tzu's insights both in the context of ancient Chinese philosophy and in terms of their
contemporary relevance. The first half of the course will concentrate on placing Sun Tzu in historical and philo-
sophical context; the second half will examine how The Art of War has been used in a variety of modern fields.
Evaluation will include mandatory class attendance and participation, and a 10-page paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15. Seniors and juniors will have priority.
Cost to student: price of books.

CRANE
PSCI 14 Assessing the Impact of Local Policy on Underage Drinking: The Role of Server Training
This course is designed to research and assess selected local-level public policies implemented to reduce under-
age drinking, with a particular emphasis on server training. The class will conduct a survey to identify local juris-
dictions that have mandated or encouraged server training and/or other innovative strategies. Students will deter-
mine whether the policies are mandated or voluntary, how the authority conducts evaluation, and what those
evaluations have shown; and they will explore other possible evaluation methods. They will also research wheth-
er there are alternative practices that might mitigate the role of alcohol among youth (e.g. to keep open the option
that best practices may be outside the legal realm). The class will then develop a strategy to select policies to
focus on, assess the policies' effectiveness, and research how the local jurisdictions decided whether to mandate
those strategies. Where jurisdictions have mandated strategies, students will research how those mandates were
enacted, including obstacles to passage and how those obstacles were dealt with. This will involve interviewing
public officials who established the mandates, those responsible for executing the policy, and perhaps servers
involved in the practical work of selling and monitoring the exchange of alcohol.
Students will write a final report. It might be a result of the series of individual reports students will have prepared
or a common report prepared by the whole class working as a group. Depending on what the research has un-
earthed, the report might include recommendations to local towns (specifically Williamstown and Adams, the
two towns that are the focus of the CMCA project and that set policy through Boards of Selectmen) on steps they
might take to establish such public policies.
Required activities: Attend class sessions to be scheduled, develop jointly a plan for establishing and completing
assigned tasks associated with identifying and collecting information on server training and/or other strategies,
and completing the written report.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15.
Cost to student: $25 for reading packet.
Meeting time: 10-12:30 Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and as can be arranged for specific research travel.

PSCI 21 Fieldwork in Public and Private Non-Profits
This course is an internship experience in which students work full-time in a governmental or nongovernmental
(including voluntary, activist, and grassroots) organization. Students may find internships in government and
nonprofit organizations in which their work involves significant involvement with public issues. Examples in-
clude: town government offices; state or federal administrative offices such as environmental agencies or hous-
ing authorities; interest groups that lobby government such as the ACLU or Natural Resources Defense Council;
nonprofit organizations such as think tanks or service providers such as Habitat for Humanity; and grassroots,
activist or community development organizations such as Greenpeace or neighborhood associations. The
instructor will work with each student to arrange an internship; such arrangements must be made in advance of
the Winter Term. Students should first make their own contacts with an institution or agency. The instructor and
and members of the Political Science department and Environmental Studies program are available to help stu-
dents find placements, if necessary. Each student's internship mentor shall send a confirmation letter to the
instructor verifying the internship and describing the nature of the work to be performed by the intern. Students
will read a few short articles distributed at the beginning of Winter Term and must agree to keep a journal, main-
tain weekly contact with the instructor, and write a final paper summarizing and reflecting upon the experience.
A group meeting of all students will occur after winter study to discuss the experiences.
Requirements: internship work; satisfactory evaluation from the institutional sponsor; 10-page final paper; par-
ticipation in final meeting.
At the time of registration, interested students should send a resume and letter of interest to Paula Consolini.

PSCI 25 Politics of the Korean Peninsula (Same as Asian Studies 25)
Interested in learning first-hand about South Korea, an economic powerhouse and a young, vibrant democracy in
Asia? Want to know whether Koreans are anti-American or pro-American? Wish to travel both North and South
Korea and feel the tension across the Demilitarized Zone? Then join us on this course that will introduce you to
the political dynamics surrounding the Korean peninsula, both in theory and practice.
We will first spend the first week to survey the political history of Korea and the complexities of U.S. relations
with both North and South Korea for the last 50 years. Then we will spend the second week in Seoul, Korea,
where we will be engaged in a number of activities to help us acquire insights on Korean politics and inter-Ko-
rean relations.
Tentatively scheduled agendas include: Meetings with US military officials in the Combined Forces Command
(CFC) and officials at the US Embassy; lectures and a round-table with Korean college students at the Interna-
tional Studies Division, Yonsei University; 4-day group tour to the Kumkang Mountain in North Korea; visits to
the National Assembly and other historical sites; interviews with North Korea human rights activists, including
defectors from North Korea. While staying in Seoul, students will also use some afternoons and evenings for

PSYCHOLOGY
PSYC 10 Mental Illness in Film
This course examines the depiction of mental illness and the therapeutic process on the silver screen. How do
films influence our perceptions of normality and abnormality? How do they shape our beliefs about the causes of
mental illness, as well as our expectations about the content and process of treatment? Films have the potential to
serve a variety of functions, ranging from a form of advocacy for the mentally ill to a mechanism for furthering
stigma and intolerance. In this course, we will sample a variety of powerful films (both contemporary and clas-
sic) representing multiple perspectives on mental illness. During the first half of the course we will view films as
a group, explore their explicit and implicit messages about mental illness, and contrast their media portrayal with
official diagnostic criteria, empirical studies, and first person accounts. In the second half of the course, students
will focus their attention on a clinical disorder of personal interest. As a final project, students will identify a film
that pertains to their disorder of interest and compare the cinematic depiction with more "real-world" clinical
manifestations as described in the current research literature.
Final project will include a 10-page paper and a presentation of film clip(s) from the chosen movie along with a
critique to the larger group during the final week of winter study.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15.
Cost to student: none.
Meeting time: Tuesday and Thursday, 10 a.m.-1 p.m.

PSYC 11 Rat Olympics
Behaviorism is a school of psychological thought founded on the idea that the expression of a particular behavior
is the consequence of stimulus-response experiences. For example, the behaviorist might argue that people en-
gage in particular behaviors because doing so has been associated with reinforcement in the past. Over the course
of Winter Study, we will read classic writings from the founders of Behaviorism (e.g., John Watson, B.F. Skin-
ner) and we will consider ways in which these principles apply to our everyday lives. Students will use behavior-
ist principles to modify human behavior. We will also use these principles to train rats to perform amazing feats.
The course will culminate in a "Rat Olympics" in which the success of the conditioning efforts will be assessed
in head-to-head competition of conditioned animals.
Students will be evaluated on a written report of their experiences conditioning a change in human behavior as
well as a written report of the conditioning methods used in training their rat Olympians. The Olympics will be
held on the final day of Winter Study.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15. Preference given to sophomores and juniors.
Cost to student: none.
Meeting time: 10-noon Monday, Wednesday, Friday. Extensive time will be spent outside of class working on
the assigned projects (conditioning changes in human behavior and conditioning rats).
N. SANDSTROM
PSYC 12 Personality Trait Theory through Biography
This course provides a brief introduction to the five factor theory of personality. The five factor theory proposes
that five broad traits (the so-called "Big Five" personality traits) can explain much of the observed differences in
personality. In the first week we will scrutinize the theory and explore the Big Five traits as they are defined by
personality questionnaires. For the remainder of the course we will consider how well the Big Five traits describe
a range of personality depictions in biographies and autobiographies, including depictions nominated by class
members. The course is particularly appropriate for nonmajors.
Requirements/evaluation: weekly excerpts from biographies and the personality literature; a final 10-page writ-
ten report on one or more of the five major traits as depicted in a biography of the student's choice; and active
class participation.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15.
Cost to students: approximately $20 for reading packet.

PSYC 13 Constructed Languages in Fantasy, Science Fiction, and Culture (Same as Linguistics 13)
In their desire to communicate, experiment, entertain, and imagine, people throughout history have created their
own languages. From Tolkien's "secret vice" and his made-up languages of Arda, to Atlantean, Esperanto, or
Loxian in Enya's most recent album, chances are that you have already experienced the wonder of constructed
Winter Study Program
­ 381 ­
languages. Have you ever wanted to create your own language? Or wondered what was behind the design of
Elvish or Klingon? In this course, we will look at examples of constructed languages from many sources includ-
ing international communication efforts, literature, philosophy, science fiction, fantasy, and music. We will also
discuss the purposes for which these languages were designed and their psychological implications. Much of the
course, however, will be a hands-on attempt at creating your own language from the ground up using a wide
variety of natural and constructed languages for inspiration.
Requirements/evaluation: class participation, a short presentation on an existing constructed language of your
choice, and a written description and oral presentation of your own created language.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20.
Cost to student: approximately $50 for course materials.
Meeting time: afternoons, two-hour class sessions three times a week.

PSYC 14 Cognition in Autism Spectrum Disorders (Same as Cognitive Science 14)
A widely publicized 1999 study by public health authorities indicated that California was experiencing drastic
increases in the number of autism cases, with the number of cases rising 273% percent in a little over a decade.
Other reports of an autism epidemic have since flooded the popular media. Currently, there is a heated controver-
sy in the field about whether these reported increases are a result of a true autism epidemic or whether they reflect
changes in diagnosis. In either case, these numbers have turned the research spotlight onto this developmental
disorder. With the surge in scientists turning their attention toward autism, a number of interesting differences in
cognition have been reported. In this class, we will discuss recent findings in autism spectrum disorders with
special emphasis on cognition in autism. Topics include: face-blindness in autism, sensory processing, and social
cognition.
Requirements: 10-page paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15. Preference given to seniors and juniors.
Cost to student: $50 for readings.
Meeting time: mornings.

Correction in Pittsfield will be included. Handouts will be utilized, as will sections of the Massachusetts General
Laws, and films covering such topics as gangs and show-of-force.
Evaluation will be based on class participation and a 10-page research paper. Attendance in class will be taken
into account.

PSYC 16 Bruce Springsteen (Same as Music 19)
`The Boss.' `The New Dylan.' `Steinbeck in Leather.' `American Troubadour.' `Working-class hero.' These are
some of the labels that have been attached to Bruce Springsteen over the course of his career. These labels, and
the iconic images and symbols that accompany them, barely hint at the depth and diversity of the music, and the
significance, of Springsteen. This course will explore that depth and diversity, with a particular focus on examin-
ing the social psychological significance of this work. Among the issues we will examine are class, race, sexual-
ity, marriage and family, violence, religion, politics, prejudice, and the great state of New Jersey.
Evaluation will be based on class participation and presentations, and a 10-page final paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20.
Cost to student: $75-$100 (for books, CD's, and DVD's).
Meeting time: mornings. We will have a mix of two-hour classes two to three times a week, complemented by

RELIGION
REL 11 Self Revelations: Religious Identity and the Reading and Writing of Memoir and Fiction
This course will consider the way in which the narrative form shapes the interaction between self-formation and
religious identity. We will read first-person accounts that deal with the struggle and reconciliation between indi-
vidual autonomy and the demands of various structures of religious life both in their individual and social dimen-
sions. More specifically we will consider the way in which the themes of faith and doubt, submission and rebel-
lion, and order and chaos are negotiated in these narratives. We will engage these issues ourselves not by writing
academic responses to the readings but by writing narrative responses. In regard to both the writings we read and
those we produce, we will be concerned for the way in which confession can function both to reveal and conceal,
Winter Study Program

thus taking into account the possibility that the appearance of truth-telling may in fact enable mechanisms of
deception. Authors read will include St. Augustine, JM Coetzee, Annie Dillard, Isaac Bashevis Singer, Philip
Roth, Salman Rushdie, Maxine Hong Kingston and others.
Evaluation will be based on short writing exercises and a final 10-page creative essay.
No prerequisites. Enrollment will be limited to 12 students. Preference given to Religion majors.
Cost to student: no more than $120.

and cultivates a sense of well-being and balance. The course builds a foundation for an effective and rewarding
personal practice by integrating textual studies and personal practice. Analysis and comparison of classic yoga
texts from India, as well as selected films, provide a historical, cultural, and philosophical background for yoga.
As well as discussion of key yogic concepts, class meetings explore philosophical themes from the Indian tradi-
tion. Required Texts: Patanjali's Yoga Sutras, The Bhagavad Gita, Yoga the Iyengar Way, and related articles.
Evaluation is based importantly on attendance and participation in all classes and sessions, a personal practice
journal demonstrating particular intentions for practice and appropriate poses and sequencing to support those
intentions, and fifteen pages of writing including textual analysis as well as personal reflections on the nature of
yoga.
No prerequisites. Apply by email with a brief explanation of your interest in the class (selection based on this
application). Enrollment limit: 16.
Cost to student: approximately $50 for three books and yoga mat.
Meeting time: late mornings, three two-hour sessions/week.

REL 13 Augustine's Confessions: `Becoming a Question to Oneself'
Augustine of Hippo (354-430CE) has been called "the founder of subjectivity," as well as the "evil genius of
Europe." His spiritual autobiography, the Confessions, is both an intensely personal account of his search for
meaning, and one of the most widely influential texts in the history of Western thought. In this course, we will
develop a close reading of the Confessions from start to finish. Our approach to the work as a whole will be
guided by Augustine's own account of the self as standing before God. What does Augustine mean, for example,
when he refers to the self, in a formulation invoked by Martin Heidegger in Being and Time (1927), as a "labori-
ous soil" (Conf. X.16), or when in searching for God, Augustine writes, "I have become a question to myself"
(Conf X.33)? How does 'becoming a question to oneself' relate to Augustine's various descriptions of truth-i.e.
truth as that which I must make or do, truth as that in which I must stand firm, and truth as that which I may
access only through love? Drawing upon contemporary historical and theoretical research on Augustine, and
upon Augustine's various other writings and sermons, we will aim to show why it is that the Confessions remain
even today a fertile ground for those interested in thinking through issues of subjectivity and hermeneutic theory.
Format: seminar. Requirements: class participation and a final 10-page essay.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15.
Cost to student: approximately $50 for books.
Meeting time: mornings.

REL 25 Jerusalem: A Travel-Study Course with Three Narratives
Jerusalem will present the ancient and modern city from three points of view simultaneously. Jewish, Muslim,
and Christian religious and cultural traditions have been attached to this city for more than two millennia. Three
cultures are attached to the same geography, but their points of view are very different. Intellectually and emo-
tionally, the narratives of the three cultures are very different stories. It will be our project to encounter these three
perspectives to see how they form vectors of emotions and praxis that sometimes coincide and sometimes collide
in a small geopolitical space.
Our reading will include an introduction to the three faiths of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, as religious tradi-
tions which, though world-wide, are centered in historic and faith experience in Jerusalem. We will look at art,
architecture, music, and commerce as ways of understanding the region's history and meaning. Texts, to be
introduced and studied in the Williamstown portion of the course, will include: Karen Armstrong, Jerusalem:
Winter Study Program
­ 383 ­
One City, Three Faiths; Pamphili, Eusebius, The History of the Church from Christ to Constantine; F.E. Peters,
Mecca and Jerusalem.
We'll also read selections from The Bible, the Koran, Hilda Prescott, Friar Felix at Large: A Fifteenth Century
Pilgrimage to the Holy Land, and Mark Twain, Innocents Abroad,and Melville's. Journal in the Straights.
The course will be in the Religion Department, by agreement with Prof. Bill Darrow. Our study will begin in
Williamstown, with class sessions tentatively scheduled for January 3, 5, 8, 10, 12. We will fly to Israel on
Sunday, January 14 and return on the 25th. This will give us an opportunity for a final meeting prior to Dead
Week.
In Jerusalem, we will see the city from three perspectives. We expect to stay at Christ Church Guest House, near
the Jaffa Gate in the Old City, on a half-board plan. We will have guides from the Jewish, Muslim, and Christian
perspectives, and will work through
Rabbi Reuven Hammer and Herb Alexander (Jewish perspective), Zougbi Zougbi (Muslim/Palestinian perspec-
tive), Yisga Harani (Palestinan/Christian perspective) and the Franciscan Center (for the multi-cultural Christian
perspective, e.g. Armenian, Roman, Lutheran, etc.) Our activities will offer guided walks in various neighbor-
hoods, home visits, and some bus touring. We will have visiting speakers offering presentations and leading dis-
cussions from varying religious, cultural, and political points of view. Our timing will enable us to experience
religious dimensions of Friday prayers for Muslims, Sabbath experience for Jews Friday night and Saturday, and
Sunday Sabbath observance for Christians.
Students will be encouraged to journal throughout the course, including describing certain expectations and pre-
dispositions that may change as the course proceeds. The ten page reflective paper that will be completed upon
return will be presented to the instructor at the end of Winter Study Term, and will be discussed a week later at the
beginning of the Spring Semester (to give additional reflective time) at a dinner Thursday, February 1.
What if there should be outbreaks of violence, making our travel in January of 2007 unwise? Should this be the
case, we would cancel our trip to Israel (by prior arrangement with our travel agent, Ayelet Travel of Albany) and
travel instead to Los Angeles, where I have contacts with the Jewish/Israeli, Palestinian/Muslim, and Christian
communities. Why Los Angeles? Because these communities have large immigrant populations, there are mu-
seum facilities, and it is a pleasant place to travel; I am confident we could still do a meaningful job on the course.
Enrollment limit: 10, preferably from various religious/cultural backgrounds, to encourage wide ranging discus-
sion on the varying viewpoints presented in the course. Not open to first-year students. The projected price of the
travel is $2400, including half board, guiding, fees for speakers, and the instructor's trip. Travel will originate in
Albany.

RLFR 10 "Astérix the Gaul: French Culture through the Prism of the Comic"
The longevity and popularity of the Astérix comic strip series over successive generations of an international
readership can be explained, in part, by its subtle and penetrating rendering of Europeanism through caricature.
This course will examine some of the most enduring texts in the Astérix saga as interpretations, first, of French
culture and the way the French view themselves with respect to the rest of Europe and, second, of the way they
view Europe in dialogue with French cultural norms. Such issues as "la Patrie" (homeland), linguistic character-
istics, the idea of France, French provincial distinctiveness, France's view of a homogeneous national character
seen through its own cultural diversity, and the relationship of France to other specific regional cultures will be
studied as a way not only of defining the nation's historic legacy, but of coming to terms with the way it sees its
place within the vision of the European Union. Among the texts to be studied will be Astérix the Gaul, Astérix
and the Normans, Astérix and the Mansions of the Gods, Astérix in Corsica, Astérix in Britain, Astérix in Swit-
zerland, Astérix and the Goths, and Astérix in Belgium. Analysis of the primary texts will be complemented by
secondary cultural readings, especially those of Fernand Braudel and other prominent interpreters of French cul-

RLSP 10 Animal Consciousness: Crossing the Species Boundary in Literature and Film
If you've ever owned a cat or dog, you've probably found yourself looking into those well-loved eyes and ask-
ing, "What are you thinking?" This course explores literature and films that take that question as their point of
departure. We will examine works by a very distinguished group of artists--Virginia Woolf, Leo Tolstoy, Soseki
Natsume, Horacio Quiroga, Franz Kafka, Robert Bresson, Verlyn Klinkenborg, and others--all of whom en-
deavor to imagine and represent the consciousness of an animal. Some focus on companion animals, while oth-
ers explore the experience of an insect, a reptile, a beast of burden, or a so-called "predator." These works are
often humorous, but they are also surprisingly serious: they raise issues ranging from the mixed blessings of
domestication to the role of instinct, the hierarchy of species, and the rights of non-human animals. Through
them, we will ultimately explore the limits of human nature and our ethical relationships with the non-human
others who inhabit our lives and our planet.
Requirements include regular response papers, one oral presentation, and a final paper.

THEA 25 Making Theatre in Johannesburg, South Africa
A Winter Study Away Program in collaboration with the Multicultural Center Williams in Africa Program: An
Exchange with students from the Market Theatre Laboratory School of Performance in Johannesburg, South
Africa.
The Market Theatre of Johannesburg, founded in the early 1970's in apartheid South Africa, stands as a testa-
ment to the power of theatre to transform. In its early days, The Market challenged the miscegenation laws by
performing and creating plays that opened, sometimes covertly, questioning the status quo. It was to the theatre
that people could go to sit and watch and listen to their lives being reflected on the stage. The tradition of this
theatre has been carried in to the next, post-apartheid generation of South Africans. The Market Theatre Labora-
tory School trains actors and directors and creators of theatre. There is a new intake every 2nd year of between 18
and 20 students for the two-year course. Aspiring theatre-makers come from all over the country to audition for
the program and competition is fierce. There is a graduation ceremony every two years in December.
Students in this course (and several Williams instructors) will fly to Johannesburg and spend two and half weeks
working with the recently graduated Market Theatre Lab Class of 2006. Each morning, both Williams and Lab
students will take classes from the Lab instructors. Instructors from the '62 Centre for Theater and Dance will
observe the work. The students will begin to create a theatre piece of their own, under supervision from all of the
instructors.
Students will live with the Market Lab Students in a conference centre that has been rented. There are lounges,
classrooms, dorm rooms, and kitchen facilities. The Johannesburg students will host social events and accompa-
ny Williams students on expeditions to explore Johannesburg and the surrounding townships. There will be trips
to see theatre in and around Johannesburg.
If money and time permit, there will be a safari trip to the famous Kruger National Park in the north of the coun-
try, or possibly a trip to Cape Town.
At the conclusion of Winter Study, we will fly home and await the arrival in late February of the Lab students and
Winter Study Program

their instructors in Williamstown. The work we started in Johannesburg will continue. This time students will
take classes from Williams instructors, and continue work on their theatre piece.
In March, the finished piece will be performed for the Williams community on one of the stages of the '62
Centre.
Enrollment limit: 18. Not open to first-year students.

SPEC 10 Quest for College: Early Awareness in Berkshire County Schools
Today's extremely competitive higher education market places significant pressure on students nationwide to
start planning for college at an increasingly early age while simultaneously demanding ever-higher standards of
excellence for admission to top schools. "Early Awareness" initiatives aim to educate middle school students as
to what lies ahead on the college horizon, empowering them to make sound academic and extracurricular choices
that will keep open a maximum of options. The first week of this course will be spent in the classroom, exploring
and discussing problems and issues germane to the national trends towards greater (and earlier) college-related
pressures. Students will respond to a series of readings dealing with such issues as tracking, paid test preparation
and untimed testing, early decision, parental and peer pressures, special interests, misrepresentation of informa-
tion, independent counseling, and others. Class time will also be devoted to familiarizing students with both the
nuances of the college admission process and the administration of the early awareness game, Quest for College.
Students will spend the next two weeks visiting 10-12 Berkshire County middle schools, administering the game
and inviting students to the culminating College Day. All 8 students will then work together to plan and run Col-
lege Day activities for students and their parents. This day will include a) campus tours, b) general higher educa-
tion info sessions, and c) financial aid/scholarship info for the parents. If student and community interest is suffi-
cient, the course may culminate in a public presentation and open forum early second semester.
Evaluation will be based on completion of field work (school visits), organization and execution of project to
bring local middle school students to the Williams Campus for a day of early-awareness related activities and a
final paper (approximately 10 pages) reflecting on a course-related issue of the student's choosing.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 8. Preference given to a) students with prior education/admission experience,
b) students with access to transportation c) juniors and seniors. Interested students must consult with instructors
prior to registration.
Cost to student: transportation to field work sites and purchase of text.
Meeting time: afternoons.

A course designed to prepare students for the Massachusetts EMT exam and to provide training to become certi-
fied as an Emergency Medical Technician. The course teaches the new national standard curriculum which
makes reciprocity with many other states possible. This is a time-intensive course involving approximately 130
hours of class time plus optional emergency room observation and ambulance work. Students learn, among other
skills, basic life support techniques, patient assessment techniques, defibrillation, how to use an epi-pen, safe
transportation and immobilization skills, as well as the treatment of various medical emergencies including
shock, bleeding, soft-tissue injuries, and child birth. In order to reduce the number of class meetings required dur-
ing Winter Study Period, the course holds a few meetings beginning in the fall semester. These class meetings,
which are mandatory, with the following schedule: 14 October (orientation), 28 October, 29 October, 11 Novem-
ber, and 12 November. Any questions regarding this course should be directed to the instructor, Kevin Garvey,
via email (pece@netscape.com).
Evaluation is based on class participation and performance on class exams, quizzes and practical exercises.
Prerequisite: It is recommended that students have American Heart Association Level C BLS Provider CPR
Cards or American Red Cross BLS provider CPR cards before entering the EMT Class. A CPR class will be
offered in October for those students wishing to take the EMT class who don't already have CPR cards. Enroll-

SPEC 19 Medical Apprenticeship
Firsthand experience is a critical component of the decision to enter the health professions. Through this appren-

types of medicine. Apprenticeships are arranged in two distinct ways: some students live on campus and are
matched with a local practitioner, while others make independent arrangements to shadow a distant professional.
The expectation is that each student will observe some aspect of medicine for the better part of the day, five days
per week. In recent years, students have shadowed physicians, veterinarians, dentists, nurses, and public health
experts.
In addition to observation in clinical settings, there will be discussion sessions and optional evening events on
campus which give participants further opportunity to reflect upon their experiences.
A 10-page reflective paper is required.
Prerequisites: Interested students must attend an information meeting in early October.
Local enrollment is limited by the number of available practitioners. Preference for placements will be given on
the basis of seniority and demonstrated interest in the health professions.
Cost to student: Local apprenticeships--vaccinations and local transportation. Distant apprenticeships--costs
will vary based upon location.

SPEC 21 The Psychology of the Workplace, A Field Study
Field experience is a critical component of the decision to enter a profession. Through this field study, students
can clarify their understanding of the rewards and challenges that accompany the practice of many different as-
Winter Study Program
­ 388 ­
pects within a profession, and understand the psychology of the workplace. Field placements are arranged in two
distinct ways: some students live on campus and are matched with a local professional, while others make inde-
pendent arrangements to work with a distant professional. The expectation is that each student will observe some
aspect of the profession for the better part of the day, five days per week. It is also expected that the instructor will
assign a specific project to be completed within the 3-week duration of the course depending upon appropriate-
ness.
Participation in this winter study will require the student to quickly assess the work environment, make infer-
ences about corporate culture, performance norms and expectations, and to take initiative not only to learn from
this experience, but also to contribute where and when appropriate. Understanding the dynamics within a work
environment is critical to success in any organization and this hands-on experience will illuminate lessons
learned in the classroom. Upon completion of the winter study, it is expected that the student write a thorough
report evaluating and interpreting the experience.
Requirements: students will complete assigned readings, keep a daily journal, and write a 5-page expository re-
view and evaluation that will become public record as a resource for other students. Finally, the student will be
expected to create a 20-minute PowerPoint presentation on his/her experience due at the end of Winter Study. If
possible the student will make a presentation to fellow students at some time during the spring semester.
Prerequisites: interested students must attend an information meeting in early October. Preference for placements
will be given on the basis of seniority and demonstrated interest in the profession of interest. Enrollment limit: 10.
Cost to student: if the field placement is off campus, the student will be responsible for living expenses at the field
site.
Meeting time: The expectation is that each student will bein the field to observe some aspect of the profession for
the better part of the day, five days per week. In addition to observation there may be an opportunity to work on
distinct projects generated by the instructor depending upon appropriateness.
Instructors: a list of instructors and available field placements will be published early in the Fall Semester and
discussed in detail at the October information meeting.

SPEC 24 Eye care and Culture on the Atlantic Coast of Nicaragua
Continuing the model of recent eye care winter studies in Nicaragua, the trip will follow a similar protocol, how-
ever, we will add a dimension of "sustainability" to our efforts by training local people in Pearl Lagoon in the
basic techniques of prescribing reading and distance glasses. Our class will leave a set or two of "flippers" (lenses
for prescribing), some eye charts and a quantity of glasses of differential diopters. Glasses for the future of this
effort can be procured at little or no cost and shipped to Nicaragua or brought by future visitors.
After a partial week of classes on campus on the culture and politics of Nicaragua and a weekend of training in
the prescription of glasses we will travel to Managua for a day of cultural visits (national museum, Masaya vol-
cano, local market) before flying to Bluefields on the Atlantic Coast for a day or two of clinics for local groups
e.g. teachers, police, health care workers, deaf school, etc.
We will then travel to Pearl Lagoon, about an hours ponga ride upriver. We will set up our training protocol and
practicing our method and training our local workers for two days while we examine the local groups. Then we
will send teams of an optometrist and 3 or 4 students to small remote isolated communities of Mayanga Suma,
Miskitu and Creole peoples.
After about a week on the Atlantic Coast we will return to Managua and the US. We will wind up our course by
turning in our journals, a requirement that has proved very insightful and we believe meaningful to our students.
The course would conclude with the sharing of specific incidents and insights that were important learning about
ourselves and the developing world.

SPEC 29 Non, non, non! Nonviolence, Nonaggression and Noncoercion
When is violence or the threat of violence morally acceptable? Can violent means ever lead to peaceful ends? In
this course we will examine the relationship between nonviolence and noncoercion in moral and political con-
texts. Principled nonviolence, or ahimsa in Gandhi's writings, implies among other things that one must not
harm others, even one's violent oppressors, as a means of affecting social or political change. By comparison, the
noncoercion (or nonaggression) principle is a moral position that one must not initiate the use of force against
another person. Although nonviolence and noncoercion are clearly related, for historical reasons their philosoph-
ical literatures have remained almost entirely separate. We will survey both literatures, including selections from
Gandhi, King, Nozick, Rothbard, Ruwart, and Tolstoy, and use class discussion to bring out their similarities and
differences.
Evaluation will be based on class attendance and participation, and a 10-page paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20. Preference to seniority.
Cost to student: less than $50 for books.
Meeting time: afternoons, two hours three times per week.

SPEC 34 Winter Emergency Care, CPR, Ski Patrol Rescue Techniques
The course is in three parts. When successfully completed, it can lead to certification as a National Ski Patrol
member and certification in Professional Rescue CPR. It will also be designed to teach wilderness and outdoor
emergency techniques.
The Winter Emergency Care Course designed by the National Ski Patrol is the main ingredient. It will be supple-
mented by the Red Cross CPR/AED for the Professional Rescuer. An additional 18-hour outdoor course in Ski
Patrol rescue techniques will be taught. Passing all three courses will certify the student as a National Ski Patrol
member if he/she is a competent skier.
The course will deal with and teach how to treat wounds of all types, shock, respiratory emergencies, poisoning,
drug and alcohol emergencies, burns, frostbite and other exposures to cold, also bone, joint and back injuries, and
sudden illnesses such as heart attacks, strokes, convulsions, etc. It will also teach the use of all splints, back-
boards, bandages, and other rescue equipment. It will teach extrication and unusual emergency situations and the
use of oxygen.
The outdoor course will include rescue toboggan handling, organization of rescues, and outdoor practical emer-
gency care.
Classroom work will include lectures, seminars, and practical work. There will be a mid-term and a final exam
which will be both written and practical. Each week, there will be 17 hours of classroom work plus 8 hours of
practical outdoor work at Jiminy Peak ski area. Attendance at all classes is mandatory.
Enrollment limit: 18 students chosen on the basis of skiing interest and ability and prior first aid experience.
Cost to student: approximately $100 for all the materials, books, and registration fees.

SPEC 35 Making Pottery on the Potter's Wheel
Each class will begin with a lecture-demonstration, followed by practice on the potter's wheel. Each student will
have the use of a potter's wheel for each class. We will work on mugs, bowls, pitchers, plates, jars, lids, vases,
and bottles, and will finish these shapes as required by trimming and adding handles, lugs, lids, spouts, and
knobs. We will also work on several different handbuilding projects. After the tenth class session, all class work
will be biscuit-fired. The eleventh class will be devoted to glazing the biscuited pieces. Glazing techniques will
include pouring, dipping, layering, brushing, and stamping, and using wax resist and other masking techniques to
develop pattern and design. The completed work will then be glaze-fired. The last meeting will be devoted to a
"final project" gallery show of your best work. Woven into lecture-demonstrations will be presentations on vari-
ous topics relating to the science and history of pottery making.
Requirements: attendance at all class sessions and enthusiasm for learning the craft of pottery making.
No prerequisites or potterymaking experience necessary. Enrollment limit: 9.
Cost to student: $175 lab fee, plus makeup class fees ($35 per class) if applicable.
Meeting time: mornings.

SPEC 39 "Composing a Life:" Finding Success and Balance in Life After Williams
To be at Williams you have learned to be a successful student, but how do you learn to be successful in life? How
will you define success in both your career and in your personal life? How will you achieve balance between the
two? In short, what will constitute the "good life" for you? We borrow the concept of "composing a life" from
Mary Catherine Bateson, as an apt metaphor for the ongoing process of defining success and balance in life. This
course is designed: (1) To offer college students an opportunity to examine and define their beliefs, values, and
assumptions about their future personal and professional lives before entering the "real" world; (2) To encourage
students to gain a better understanding of how culture, ideology, and opportunity affect their life choices; (3) To
provide an opportunity for students to consider different models of success and balance through "living cases"
(in the form of guests from various professions and lifestyles); and (4) To aid students in contemplating their ca-
reer options through individual advising and introducing various career and life planning resources. Using se-
lected readings, cases, and guest speakers, we will explore both the public context of the workplace as well as the
private context of individuals and their personal relationships in determining life choices.
Requirements: regular attendance, class participation, field interview, and a 10-page final paper
No prerequisites. Questions about the course: please contact Michele Moeller Chandler at 458-8106 or mi-
chele.chandler2@verizon.net Enrollment limit: 15.
Cost to Student: approximately $30 for case/reading materials

SEXUAL HARASSMENT/DISCRIMINATION ADVISORS
Advisors are available to all members of the College community for consultation concerning inci-
dents that could be a form of discrimination. The advisor's role is described in the Discrimination
Grievance Policy and Procedures, printed in the handbooks. Persons serving as advisors are health
staff and counselors, assistant and associate deans, Human Resources officers, the Chaplain, and
the Affirmative Action Officer. There are also two faculty, two staff, and two student advisors who
have received training in sexual harassment and other discrimination advising.

NOTE: A recent enactment of the Massachusetts General Court provides: "Any student...who is unable, because of his
religious beliefs, to attend classes or to participate in any examination, study, or work requirement on a particular day
shall be excused from any such...requirement, and shall be provided an opportunity to make up such...requirement
which he may have missed because of such absence...provided, however, that such makeup examination or work shall
not create an unreasonable burden upon such school...No adverse or prejudicial effects shall result to any student be-
cause of his availing himself of the provisions of this section."
