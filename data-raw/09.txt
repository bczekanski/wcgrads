HISTORY OF THE COLLEGE
The chartering of Williams College in 1793 was an act of faith and certainly an act surpassing the
modest intentions of Colonel Ephraim Williams, for whom the college is named.
Colonel Williams had not intended to found a college. Enroute with his regiment of Massachu-
setts militia to join the battle with the French and Indians at Lake George, the Colonel had tarried
long enough in Albany to write his last will and testament on July 22, 1755. In it he bequeathed his
residuary estate for the founding and support of a free school in West Township, where for some
years he had commanded a detachment of militia at Fort Massachusetts, farthest outpost of the
province. The will stipulated that West Township, then in dispute between Massachusetts and New
York, must fall within Massachusetts and that the name of the township must be changed to Wil-
liamstown, if the free school was to be established at all.
On September 8, 1755, Colonel Williams was killed at the Battle of Lake George. On October 26,
1791, after many delays, fifteen scholars were admitted to the free school in Williamstown. Within a
year the trustees, not content with the original modest design of the founder, were captivated by the
idea of creating a college where, as they put it, "young gentlemen from every part of the Union" might
resort for instruction " in all the branches of useful and polite literature." The proposal was extremely
ambitious, to be sure, but ambition was a common American ailment. England did not develop a third
university until the nineteenth century; Williams was the twenty-first institution of higher learning to
flower in onetime British colonies, the second in Massachusetts, the sixth in New England. On June
22, 1793, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts granted a charter to Williams College.
I
The bold decision to plant a college in the wilderness betrayed the intentions of Colonel Wil-
liams; yet the new vision had been fed by the same sort of dreams that had led Ephraim Williams to
see a school and a comfortable community where only a military outpost had stood. The early trust-
ees and the legislature of the Commonwealth were to be remembered for their foresight, but in the
decades after 1793 they had reason to acknowledge that the soil they had chosen was stubbornly
uncongenial--so uncongenial, in fact, that for many years the trustees of Williams spent more time
and energy in trying to close the College than in trying to keep it open.
In 1819 they petitioned to move the college to Northhampton, and in 1821, having been spurned by
the legislature, President Zephaniah Swift Moore took matters into his own hands. Convinced that
almost everything about Williams was impossible--its location, its funds, its enrollment--he led a
group of students over the mountains into the Connecticut Valley. There he became their president
once again, at the struggling new college known as Amherst. As for Williams, one member of the
senior class wrote home to his father: "It remains for us to say whether it shall die suddenly, or whether
it shall linger along for two or three years."
In the past the public had come to the support of the institution. A lottery furnished funds essen-
tial to the opening of the free school. A public subscription was the answer of Berkshire County to
the threat of removal in 1819. What saved the College in 1821 was the willingness of the Reverend
Edward Dorr Griffin to take the job of president and the determination with which he drew upon the
College's reputation for religious conservatism to collect much-needed funds. By 1828, the Rever-
end Griffin could be seen standing in the middle of Main Street, supervising the construction of a
handsome new building, housing a chapel, a library, and classrooms, a testament to his confidence
and his skill. The building is now known as Griffin Hall.
The College which had been taking shape under Griffin and his predecessors was not unlike
many other New England colleges where the classical curriculum and a moral atmosphere served as
the basis for training young men for professional life. The college turned out its share of clergymen,
doctors, lawyers, and teachers, serving the needs of Western Massachusetts and surrounding com-
munities in New York and Vermont. But Williams was not yet a place to which "young gentlemen
from every part of the Union" resorted. In fact, Nathaniel Hawthorne, attending the commencement
exercises in 1838, jotted in his notebook some observations on the Williams students he saw there:
"Country graduates--rough, brown-featured, schoolmaster-looking...A rough hewn, heavy set of
fellows from the hills and woods in this neighborhood; unpolished bumpkins, who had grown up as
farmer-boys."
History of the College
­ 4 ­
Williams seldom knew financial security until the end of the nineteenth century. But it did have
assets that enabled it to develop into a prototype of the small New England liberal arts college. Scen-
ery, a reputation for moral soundness, a loyal body of alumni, and a devoted faculty went a long way
toward compensating for inadequate funds.
Of the scenery, Thoreau remarked, after a visit in 1844, "It would be no small advantage if every
college were thus located at the base of a mountain." For Thoreau the location of Williams was "as
good at least as one well-endowed professorship."
In the early years the religious reputation of the College depended on the essential orthodoxy of
its presidents and faculty. It gathered strength from the famous episode of the "haystack meeting" in
the summer of 1806. Five Williams undergraduates, seeking to continue their prayers and conversa-
tions in spite of a sudden thunderstorm, retired from a grove of trees to the shelter of a nearby hay-
stack, where they were inspired to launch the great adventure of American foreign missions. The
extremely informal ties with the Congregationalists saved it from the sometimes stifling strangle-
hold of an organic denominational connection.
During a crisis in the affairs of the College in 1821, a group of alumni met in Williamstown and
organized the Society of Alumni, dedicated to the future welfare of the College. Their action gave
Williams the distinction of organizing the first college alumni society in history. Alumni loyalty was
rewarded when, in 1868, the College provided for official alumni representation on the board of trust-
ees, an act of recognition in which only Harvard, among American colleges, anticipated Williams.
II
But essentially the College has built its reputation around teachers and teaching. Mark Hopkins,
who was a Williams professor from 1830 to 1887 and president of the College from 1836 to 1872, has
become a symbol of this emphasis. In American education Hopkins pioneered in making the student
the center of the educational experience, and he did it so well that one of his former students, U.S.
President James A. Garfield, immortalized his achievement in an aphorism which has passed into the
lore of American education: "The ideal college is Mark Hopkins on one end of a log and a student on
the other." The Hopkins tradition has become one of the College's great assets. It has been perpetuated
in the lives of generations of teachers.
Scenery, a reputation for building sound character, loyal but not especially affluent alumni, and
devoted teachers could keep the College open, but like most other colleges Williams did not experi-
ence growth and prosperity until the closing decades of the nineteenth century. The scenery, of
course, remained constant, but it developed into an even greater asset as the United States became
more urbanized and industrialized. Williams was still a country college; a Massachusetts court de-
cision of 1888 declared that cows owned by the college were tax exempt. The discovery that busi-
nessmen could profit from liberal education sent college enrollments upward as the century drew to
a close; now more Williams alumni were men of affairs, fewer were clergymen. By 1906, of all the
colleges in New England, Williams drew the largest percentage of students from outside New Eng-
land.
From 1793 through 1870 the Commonwealth of Massachusetts appropriated for Williams College
over $150,000, a sum of such importance that Mark Hopkins himself observed that he did "not see
how the College could have got on" without state aid. A new and more dependable source of financial
support was developed as the century drew to a close. In the 1890's Frederick Ferris Thompson of the
Class of 1856 became the first of many individuals to supersede the Commonwealth as the largest
benefactor of the College. Ephraim Williams' original bequest of $9,297 has since grown by addition-
al gifts and bequests to an endowment valued at approximately $1.3 billion.
III
Williams moved into the twentieth century firm in its intentions to remain a college, at a time when
aspirations toward university status were unsettling many of the old colleges. It adhered to a curricu-
lum that was designed for undergraduates; it made room for the elective principle, but it subjected
course election to safeguards and controls. The idea of a liberally educated man was not jettisoned in
favor of the widely accepted idea of almost complete student freedom in course election. A survey of
the college curriculum in 1925 showed that Williams had combined the principles of prescription and
election, the goals of concentration and distribution, in such a way as to be the only major American
college without any absolutely required courses and without any uncontrolled wide-option electives.
History of the College
­ 5 ­
The Williams curriculum has continued to evolve, but it has not undergone such a series of major
overhauls as characterize curriculums inspired by the popular educational fancy of the moment. Not
having abandoned itself to the elective principle in the nineteenth century, Williams did not need to
rescue itself with the general education principle of the twentieth century.
During its long history much of the life and tone of the college was shaped by students. While the
same influence continues, the competitive pressure for admission since World War II has allowed
for a new and significant degree of selectivity on the part of the College. Among the consequences
of this change have been a quickening of the intellectual life of the College and a reconsideration of
traditions and emphases no longer considered appropriate for an institution of liberal learning.
Among the first traditions to go was compulsory religious exercises, abandoned in 1962 after a
hundred years of gradual but steady erosion. Voluntary worship in the form of ecumenical chapel
services and the activities of student religious organizations carry on another long tradition. In re-
sponse to the concern of undergraduate leaders and the faculty and in recognition of the failure of
Greek Letter Fraternities to fulfill adequately objectives consistent with college purpose, the Trust-
ees in 1962 took the first of a series of actions that replaced fraternities with a residential house sys-
tem. Williams became, as a result, a much more open community. The decision to become coeduca-
tional and the admission of women to Williams as degree candidates in 1970 have reinforced the
spirit of equality and freedom conducive to a climate of learning.
In this atmosphere of change and heightened purpose the curriculum underwent appropriate
transformations, as a careful comparative study of the yearly catalogues readily shows, leading to
the present 4-1-4 curriculum and a more flexible and wide-ranging schedule and program both on
and beyond the campus. Changes in the curriculum included the addition of majors and the
introduction of interdisciplinary programs, along with the expansion of language offerings to in-
clude full, four-year cycles in Chinese and Japanese. Continuing the tradition of putting the student
at the center of the educational experience, Williams in the Fall of 1988 introduced in each depart-
ment at least one course taught as a tutorial, in which, typically, pairs of students meet weekly with
the professor to discuss a paper, problem set, or work of art produced by one of the students. By
1992 some 40 percent of the graduating class had experienced at least one tutorial course either in
Williamstown or in the Williams-Oxford program, run in association with Exeter College, Oxford,
which provides each year for some 30 Williams juniors a year-long immersion in the life of Oxford
University.
This curricular expansion reflected, and in part resulted from, the fact that the makeup of the col-
lege community was changing to mirror more closely the growing racial, ethnic, and religious di-
versity of American society. The percentage of Williams students who identified themselves as
members of one or more American minority group rose to 25 percent; of faculty almost 13 percent.
At the beginning of this decade, President Morton Owen Schapiro inaugurated a strategic plan-
ning process, through which the College community identified priorities for change in the curricu-
lum and in residential life. The size of the faculty is being expanded to provide more curricular op-
portunities for students in tutorials and experiential learning. Requirements have been added in in-
tensive writing instruction and in quantitative and formal reasoning. New programming and struc-
tures are being added to student residential life and major projects have been undertaken to greatly
enhance the College's student center, its facilities for theatre and dance, and its office and teaching
spaces for faculty.

MISSION AND PURPOSES
Williams seeks to provide the finest possible liberal arts education by nurturing in students the aca-
demic and civic virtues, and their related traits of character. Academic virtues include the capacities to
explore widely and deeply, think critically, reason empirically, express clearly, and connect ideas cre-
atively. Civic virtues include commitment to engage both the broad public realm and community life,
and the skills to do so effectively. These virtues, in turn, have associated traits of character. For exam-
ple, free inquiry requires open-mindedness, and commitment to community draws on concern for
others.
We are committed to our central endeavor of academic excellence in a community of learning that
comprises students, faculty, and staff, and draws on the engagement of alumni and parents. We recruit
students from among the most able in the country and abroad and select them for the academic and
personal attributes they can contribute to the educational enterprise, inside and outside the classroom.
Our faculty is a highly talented group of teachers, scholars, and artists committed deeply to the educa-
tion of our students and to involving them in their efforts to expand human knowledge and under-
standing through original research, thought, and artistic expression. Dedicated staff enable this teach-
ing and learning to take place at the highest possible level, as does the involvement and support of our
extraordinarily loyal parents and alumni.
No one can pretend to more than guess at what students now entering college will be called upon to
comprehend in the decades ahead. No training in fixed techniques, no finite knowledge now at hand,
no rigid formula can solve problems whose shape we cannot yet define. The most versatile, the most
durable, in an ultimate sense, the most practical knowledge and intellectual resources that we can offer
students are the openness, creativity, flexibility, and power of education in the liberal arts.
Toward that end we extend a curriculum that offers wide opportunities for learning, ensures close
attention of faculty to students but also encourages students to learn independently, and reflects the
complexity and diversity of the world. We seek to do this in an atmosphere that nurtures the simple joy
of learning as a lifelong habit and commitment.
We place great emphasis on the learning that takes place in the creation of a functioning communi-
ty: life in the residence halls, expression through the arts, debates on political issues, leadership in
campus governance, exploration of personal identity, pursuit of spiritual and religious impulses, the
challenge of athletics, and direct engagement with human needs, nearby and far away.
To serve well our students and the world, Williams embraces core values such as welcoming and
supporting in the College community people from all segments of our increasingly diverse society
and ensuring that College operations are environmentally sustainable.
From this holistic immersion students learn more than they will ever know. Such is the testimony of
countless graduates--that their Williams experience has equipped them to live fuller, more effective
lives. Ultimately, the College's greatest mark on the world consists of this: the contributions our
alumni make in their professions, their communities, and their personal lives.
Therefore, we ask all our students to understand that an education at Williams should not be re-
garded as a privilege destined to create further privilege, but as a privilege that creates opportunities to
serve society at large, and imposes the responsibility to do so.
At the same time, being itself privileged by its history and circumstances, Williams understands
its own responsibility to contribute by thought and example to the world of higher education.
The above description arises on its surface from public statements made by Williams presidents and
others associated with the College, from which it borrows, and at a deeper level from the felt experi-
ence of students, faculty, staff, alumni, and parents over many decades. It was approved by vote of
the Board of Trustees on April 14, 2007.

THE CURRICULUM
Williams College offers a course of study leading to the degree of Bachelor of Arts. The course
requirements prescribe both the number of courses to be completed and the minimum grade level to
be achieved; the curriculum also requires that each student explore several fields of knowledge and
concentrate in one. The full requirements for the degree include meeting the minimum academic stan-
dards stated below, residing at the College, fulfilling the distribution requirement, completing a major,
and completing the physical education requirement.
The academic year is divided into two regular semesters and a Winter Study Program. The student
takes four courses in each semester and during January pursues a single program of study on a pass-
fail basis.
The Winter Study Program, which began in 1967, is intended to provide students and faculty with
a dramatically different educational experience in the January term. The differences are in the na-
ture of the courses, the nature of the learning experience, and the change of educational pace and
format from the fall and spring semesters. These differences apply to the faculty and students in
several ways: faculty can try out courses with new subjects and techniques that might, if successful,
be used later in the regular terms; they can explore subjects not amenable to inclusion in regular
courses; and they can investigate fields outside their usual areas of expertise. In their academic
work, which is graded Honors, Pass, Perfunctory Pass, or Fail, students can explore new fields at
low risk, concentrate on one subject that requires a great deal of time, develop individual research
projects, or work in a different milieu (as interns, for example, or on trips outside Williamstown). In
addition, Winter Study offers studentsan opportunity for more independence and initiative in aless
formalsetting, more opportunity to participate in cultural events, and an occasion to get to know one
another better.
REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR OF ARTS DEGREE
Academic Requirement
To be eligible for the Bachelor of Arts degree a student must pass 32 regularly graded semester
courses and receive grades of C minus or higher in at least 19 of those semester courses, pass four
Winter Study Projects, fulfill the four-part distribution requirement, complete all requirements for
the major including an average of C minus or higher, and complete the physical education require-
ment. A student may not repeat a course for which degree credit has been awarded.
Distribution Requirement
The distribution requirement falls into four parts. Please note that courses used to fulfill these requirements
must be regularly graded.
1) DIVISIONAL REQUIREMENT--designed to ensure that in their course of study at Williams,
students take an appropriately diverse distribution of courses across the full range of the curricu-
lum.
For the purposes of the requirement, courses are grouped into three divisions: Division I, Lan-
guages and the Arts; Division II, Social Studies; and Division III, Science and Mathematics. A full
listing of the subjects in each division appears below.
Students must complete at least three graded semester courses in each division. Two in each divi-
sion must be completed by the end of the sophomore year. No more than two of the courses used to
satisfy the requirement may have the same course prefix. The courses must be taken at Williams or
at programs under the direction of Williams College Faculty.
Courses that fulfill the distribution requirement in Division I are designed to help students become
better able to respond to the arts sensitively and intelligently by learning the language, whether
verbal, visual, or musical, of a significant field of artistic expression. Students learn how to develop
the capacity for critical discussion, to increase awareness of the esthetic and moral issues raised by
works of art, and to grow in self-awareness and creativity.
Courses which fulfill the Division II requirement consider the institutions and social structures that
human beings have created, whether knowingly or unknowingly, and which in turn markedly af-
fect their lives. These courses are intended to help the students recognize, analyze, and evaluate
these human structures in order that they may better understand themselves and the social world in
which they live.
The Curriculum
­ 8 ­
Courses which fulfill the Division III requirement are intended to provide some of the factual and
methodological knowledge needed to be an informed citizen in a world deeply influenced by
scientific thought and technological accomplishment, and to cultivate skill in exact and quantita-
tive reasoning.

Please note: Any Environmental Studies course that is also cross-listed with another subject carries dis-
tribution credit of that subject. Other Environmental Studies courses may fulfill distribution requirements
as indicated under individual course listings.
Williams-Exeter Programme at Oxford University tutorial courses (WIOX) may be used toward fulfilling
the divisional distribution requirement; a student may earn a maximum of three distribution requirements,
with no more than one from each division, for the year. Courses at Williams-Mystic Program and Williams
in New York may also be used toward fulfilling the requirement.
1) THE EXPLORING DIVERSITY INITIATIVE REQUIREMENT--Williams College is com-
mitted to creating and maintaining a curriculum, faculty, and student body that reflects and ex-
plores a diverse, globalized world and the multi-cultural character of the United States. Courses
designated "(D)" in the College Bulletin are a part of the College's Exploring Diversity Initiative
(EDI); they represent our dedication to study groups, cultures, and societies as they interact with,
and challenge, each other. Through such courses, Williams College students and faculty also con-
sider the multiple approaches that engage these issues. Rather than simply focus on the study of
The Curriculum
­ 9 ­
specific peoples, cultures, or regions of the world, in the past or present, however, courses fulfilling
the EDI requirement actively promote a self-conscious and critical engagement with diversity.
They urge students to consider the operations of difference in the world and provide them with the
tools to do so. The ultimate aim of the EDI requirement is to lay the groundwork for a life-long
engagement with the diverse cultures, societies, and histories of the United States and the rest of
the world.
Courses that comprise the Exploring Diversity Initiative may fall under a variety of categories,
including (but not limited to) the following:
1. Comparative Study of Cultures and Societies. These courses focus on the differences and similarities be-
tween cultures and societies, and/or on the ways in which cultures, peoples, and societies have interacted
and responded to one another in the past.
2. Empathetic Understanding. These courses explore diverse human feelings, thoughts, and actions by recreat-
ing the social, political, cultural, and historical context of a group in order to imagine why within that con-
text, those beliefs, experiences, and actions of the group emerged.
3. Power and Privilege: These courses link issues of diversity to economic and political power relations, inves-
tigating how cultural interaction is influenced by various structures, institutions, or practices that enable,
maintain, or mitigate inequality among different groups.
4. Critical Theorization: These courses focus on ways scholars theorize the possibilities of cross-cultural un-
derstanding and interaction; they investigate the ways that disciplines and paradigms of knowledge both
constitute "difference" and are reconfigured by the study of diversity-related questions.
5. Cultural Immersion: In various ways these courses immerse students in another culture and give them the
tools with which to understand that culture from the inside. They include those foreign language courses that
explicitly engage in the self-conscious awareness of cultural and societal differences, traditions, and customs
as an integral aspect of language study.
All students are required to complete ONE course that is part of the Exploring Diversity Initiative.
Although this course, which may be counted toward the divisional distribution requirement, may
be completed any semester before graduation, students are urged to complete the course by the end
of their sophomore year. Courses used to fulfill this requirement may not be taken on a pass/fail
basis.
By immersing students in foreign cultures, and often by furthering language acquisition, study
abroad programs can offer a robust way to study cultural diversity. Students wishing to fulfill the
EDI requirement via the completion of a study abroad program must submit a petition before their
departure proposing EDI credit for a particular course on their program, for particular experiences
(such as independent research or a homestay), or for a specific language training program they will
undertake while abroad. The petition will require students to describe how they believe their pro-
posed study abroad experience will meet one or more of the goals of the Exploring Diversity Initia-
tive; it will be considered by the Director of the Exploring Diversity Initiative working in concert
with the Committee on Academic Standing.
The one-course EDI requirement must be met by all members of the class of 2012; members of the
classes of 2009, 2010, and 2011 who have already completed a course designated "People's and
Cultures" do not need to complete an EDI course.
A list of courses offered in 2008-2009 that meet the requirement is on page 320.
3) QUANTITATIVE/FORMAL REASONING REQUIREMENT--intended to help students be-
come adept at reasoning mathematically and abstractly. The ability to apply a formal method to
reach conclusions, to use numbers comfortably, and to employ the research tools necessary to ana-
lyze data lessen barriers to carrying out professional and economic roles. Prior to their senior year,
all students must satisfactorily complete a Quantitative/Formal Reasoning (QFR) course--those
marked with a "(Q)." Students requiring extra assistance (as assessed during First Days) are nor-
mally placed into Mathematics 100/101/102, which is to be taken before fulfilling the QFR re-
quirement.
The hallmarks of a QFR course are the representation of facts in a language of mathematical sym-
bols and the use of formal rules to obtain a determinate answer. Primary evaluation in these courses
is based on multistep mathematical, statistical, or logical inference (as opposed to descriptive an-
swers). A list of courses offered in 2008-2009 that meet the requirement is on page 321.

4) WRITING REQUIREMENT--All students are required to take two writing-intensive courses:
one by the end of sophomore year, and one by the end of the junior year. Students will benefit most
from the writing-intensive courses by taking them early in their college careers, and are therefore
strongly encouraged to complete the requirement by the end of the sophomore year.
The goal of the writing-intensive course requirement is to improve student writing proficiency
across the disciplines. Students in these courses should expect to receive guidance on style, argu-
mentation, and other significant aspects of writing, as well as evaluation and criticism of their writ-
ing throughout the semester. This may be achieved through a variety of approaches: brief assign-
ments spaced over the semester, sequenced assignments leading to a longer final paper, etc. Writ-
ing-intensive courses may also include multiple drafts, conferences, peer review, or class discus-
sions designed to improve writing skills. A course with a single long paper due at the end of the
semester, but with no required or structured means of addressing writing issues, would not be con-
sidered writing intensive.
Writing-intensive courses require a minimum of 20 pages of writing and have a maximum enroll-
ment of 19 to allow the instructor to devote appropriate attention to writing over the course of the
semester.
All tutorial courses in the Williams-Exeter Programme at Oxford University (WIOX) meet the
Williams College `W' designation, except for those in the studio arts, mathematics, and the
sciences.
Major Requirement
The Major Requirement is designed to assure that all Williams undergraduates will have the experience of dis-
ciplined and cumulative study, carried on over an extended period of time, in some important field of intellectual
inquiry. Juniors are required to declare a major and the selection is normally made at the time of registration in the
spring of the sophomore year.
Majors are offered in the following fields:
American Studies History
Anthropology Japanese
Art Literary Studies
Asian Studies Mathematics
Astronomy Music
Astrophysics Philosophy
Biology Physics
Chemistry Political Economy
Chinese Political Science
Classics (Greek, Latin) Psychology
Comparative Literature Religion
Computer Science Russian
Economics Sociology
English Spanish
French Theatre
Geosciences Women's and Gender Studies
German
GENERAL STRUCTURE OF MAJORS
1) A student ordinarily must elect at least nine semester courses in his or her major field. A major
may also require an additional course and/or one Winter Study Project during the junior or senior year.
A student may also fulfill the minimum requirements for a major by taking eight semester courses
in the major field and two semester courses, approved by a major advisor, in associated fields. In inter-
departmental majors, such as Political Economy, a larger number of courses may be required.
2) A prescribed sequence of courses, supplemented by parallel courses, and including a major
seminar, is required in some major fields. Other majors ask the student to plan a sequence of elective
courses, including advanced work building on elementary courses in the field, and ending in a one- or
two- semester faculty-organized course or project in the senior year. All majors provide a system of
counseling to help students plan programs reflecting individual interests as well as disciplined and
cumulative patterns of inquiry.
Courses in many major programs require prerequisite courses in related areas. A full description
of the detailed structure of each major is found under the heading of that major.
The Curriculum
­ 11 ­
CONTRACT MAJOR
Students who wish to undertake the coherent study of an interdisciplinary subject not covered by
a regularly offered major may propose to be contract majors. Procedures for arranging a contract
major and for honors work in such a major are described in the section, "Courses of Instruction."
Students interested in this option should begin consulting with the Dean's Office and with potential
faculty advisors early in the sophomore year. A student completing a contract major may not do so
in conjunction with a second major. For further details, see page 134.
TWO MAJORS
A student may complete two majors with the permission of both majors and the Committee on
Academic Standing. Although a student may be granted permission to use a course from one major
to fulfill a particular requirement in the other, the student nevertheless must take the minimum num-
ber of courses in each field without counting any course twice. A student may be a candidate for
Honors in either or both of the majors, but a course for Honors in one major may not be used for an
Honors course in the other.
Physical Education Requirement
The Physical Education requirement provides students the opportunity of establishing and main-
taining a general level of fitness and well-being; of developing abilities in carry-over activities; of
discovering and extending their own physical capabilities; and of developing skills in activities with
survival implications, such as swimming.
A swim test is required of all first-year students at the start of the academic year. Students who fail
to complete the test must pass a basic swim course given in the Physical Education program during the
first quarter of the year.
Students must complete four quarters of physical education by the end of the sophomore year. Stu-
dents must enroll in at least two different activities in fulfilling the requirement.
Participation in a fall or spring intercollegiate sport is equivalent to two activity units and partici-
pation in a winter sport is equivalent to three units. A maximum of three credits may be attained
while participating in intercollegiate sports with the exception of a two sport athlete who can fulfill
the physical education requirement by totaling four units in two sports. Students may receive a
maximum of two activity units for participation in a club sport; the remaining two units must come
from the physical education activity program.
Residence Requirement
Students who begin college at Williams must spend a minimum of six semesters in residence at
Williams. Students transferring to Williams from other institutions must spend a minimum of four
semesters in residence at Williams, and those entering as sophomores are expected to spend six se-
mesters in residence. Students are considered to be in residence if they are taking a program of study
under the direction of the Williams College Faculty. Students must be in residence for both semesters
of the final year.
The degree requirements must be completed within eight semesters, including any semesters for
which a student receives credit while not in residence at Williams. Thus, semesters spent away on
exchange or other approved programs at other colleges are included in the eight semesters.
ADDITIONAL CURRICULAR OPPORTUNITIES
Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate
At the discretion of the appropriate departments or programs, students presenting satisfactory
scores in Advanced Placement tests or International Baccalaureate higher level examinations may
be placed in advanced courses not regularly open to them and/or may receive course credit toward
the major or concentration. Therefore, if granted, this credit may be used as a prerequisite or in par-
tial fulfillment of the major or concentration requirements. AP and IB credit, however, may not be
used to reduce the normal course load of any semester, to make up a deficiency incurred at Wil-
liams, or to satisfy the Distribution Requirement.
Certificate in European Languages
Students may pursue a Certificate in four European languages offered at Williams (French, Ger-
man, Russian, and Spanish). The program certifies a particular degree of proficiency, cultural liter-
acy, and experience with the language in the context of one's college education. In order to gain the
proficiency and experience certified by the program, students must have taken a) at least five se-
mesters of college language (or the equivalent) and b) a standardized proficiency test administered
by the departments. In addition, students are required to gain familiarity with the culture in question
The Curriculum
­ 12 ­
by taking at least one course each in a) the literature, music, art, or philosophy, and b) the history,
economics, or politics of the cultural area. Students must take seven courses altogether, up to two of
which may be taken abroad. Please refer to the respective language programs for details on the spe-
cific certificates.
Combined Program in Liberal Arts and Engineering
The 3-2 program enables qualified students to combine a liberal arts education at Williams with
undergraduate professional training in engineering. In this program, a student studies at Williams for
3 years, completing 24 courses and 3 Winter Study Projects. He or she then transfers to a leading engi-
neering school and studies for a Bachelor of Science degree, usually for 2 more years. Upon success-
ful completion of this program, the student receives a Bachelor of Arts degree from Williams and a
Bachelor of Science degree from the engineering school.
During their 3 years at Williams, 3-2 students must complete all of the normal requirements for a
Williams degree, including a major and the distribution requirements. For students majoring in phys-
ics, chemistry, computer science, or mathematics, the requirements for the senior year courses and
major exercise are waived for the Williams degree. Only students who have taken the prerequisite
courses, who have at least a B average in scientific subjects, and who have a good record in other
subjects will be recommended by their major department and approved by the Committee on Aca-
demic Standing for this program.
The 3-2 program has an extensive list of prerequisite mathematics and science courses, so it is nec-
essary to plan course selections at Williams carefully. The booklet "Choosing First Year Courses"
includes a list of Williams courses recommended to prospective engineers.
A popular alternative to the 3-2 program is to complete the Williams B.A. in the usual 4 years, ma-
joring in one of the sciences, and then go directly to a graduate program in engineering. Please see the
section of this catalog titled "Preparation for Graduate and Professional Study." Also, prospective en-
gineers at Williams have the opportunity to take undergraduate engineering courses at other institu-
tions through various exchange programs. For information about these opportunities, please see the
section titled "Exchange Programs."
The pre-engineering advisor, Professor Jefferson Strait, will be happy to assist students inter-
ested in any of the options leading to engineering careers. Many more details about pre-engineering
can be found in the Physics Department section of the College website.
Co-ordinate Programs Offering Concentrations
In addition to majoring in a field, a student may choose to concentrate elective courses on a single
topic or area. Normally, a student declares a concentration at the time of registration in the spring of
the sophomore year. Concentrations are offered in the following programs:
Africana Studies
Biochemistry and Molecular Biology
Cognitive Science
Environmental Studies
International Studies
Jewish Studies
Latina/o Studies
Leadership Studies
Legal Studies
Maritime Studies
Neuroscience
Science and Technology Studies
Descriptions of these programs appear under the appropriate heading in this publication. If the
co-ordinate program courses are directly related to the major, a student may be allowed to reduce
the number of courses required to complete the major.
Co-ordinate Programs
A number of programs do not formally offer concentrations, but do provide students with the op-
portunity to work in areas that cut across departmental and program lines. These are: Bioinformatics,
Genomics, and Proteomics; History of Science; Materials Science Studies; Performance Studies; and
Public Health. They are listed in this publication in alphabetical order.
These programs provide guidance only and do not appear on transcripts.
The Curriculum
­ 13 ­
The Critical Reasoning and Analytical Skills (CRAAS) Initiative
To one degree or another, every class at Williams goes beyond its subject--be it mathematics, Ma-
chiavelli, or modernism--to teach intellectual skills that have wide application in other fields as well
as outside of the academy: scientific reckoning, expository writing, rhetorical analysis, oral presenta-
tion, and so on.
Courses offered under the CRAAS initiative foreground such analytical skills. While each CRAAS
class covers a different topic, all are aimed particularly at developing the processes necessary for ex-
cellence in a range of fields: techniques for analyzing ideas, data, texts or artworks; approaches to
interpreting, synthesizing, and developing arguments; strategies for presenting ideas and results.
CRAAS classes typically emphasize the practices of meta-analysis--self-criticism, editing, and re-
vision--with the goal of constant improvement. Many classes feature peer tutoring, small group
work, and intensive one-on-one engagement with the professor. Students should leave a CRAAS
course with a substantially heightened ability to approach problems, analyze texts, and craft argu-
ments in whatever discipline they may go on to explore.
A few CRAAS courses are restricted to advanced students, but the majority are open to all, and
some are specifically targeted for first -year students. Most have strictly limited enrollment. Because
these classes cultivate the general strategies of effective scholarship, students are encouraged to con-
sider taking a CRAAS course early in their academic careers.
A list of CRAAS courses offered in 2008-2009 is on page 318.
Cross-Enrollment Programs
A limited number of students may register at Bennington College or Massachusetts College of
Liberal Arts for courses not offered by Williams. Interested students should contact the Registrar's
Office about arrangements.
Experiential Education at Williams
Experiential education, involving "learning by doing" outside the classroom, has been a relatively
understated but successful part of the Williams curriculum for a number of years. In addition to the use
of traditional laboratory work in the natural sciences and studio work in art, faculty have been chal-
lenging students to become engaged more personally in the Williams curriculum through field work,
whether in the form of research, sustained work on special projects or through placement with com-
munity organizations. Courses which include experiential learning provide students with opportuni-
ties to encounter firsthand the issues that they read and study about, requiring them to apply academic
learning to nonacademic settings and challenging them to use their experiences in those settings to
think more critically and deeply about what they are studying. Courses involving experiential educa-
tion as defined above range from fully integrated off-campus programs such as the Williams-Mystic
Maritime Studies Program (page 338) and Williams in New York (page 338) to courses involving one
small field research project. The amount and nature of the experiential component(s) varies according
to the instructor's judgment. See page 318 for a list of 2008-2009 courses involving experiential
education.
A range of non-credit experiential education opportunities is also available to interested stu-
dents. Community service, internships, research, and the Museum Associates Program of the Col-
lege Museum of Art all provide students the chance to "learn by doing" outside the classroom. In-
formation on each of these opportunities is provided below.
Community Service:
Opportunities to apply creative energy and initiative abound in community organizations in the
Williams College area. Service ranges from tutoring or building homes with Habitat for Humanity,
to working with developing non-profit organizations such as Northern Berkshire Creative Arts. For
more information, go to the Office for Community Engagement homepage on the College website
at <www.williams.edu/resources/commservice/> or contact Stewart Burns, Director of the Center
for Community Engagement (Stewart.Burns@williams.edu).
Internships and Research Opportunities:
A wide variety of summer internship opportunities are available to interested students through
the Office of Career Counseling (OCC) and the Center for Environmental Studies (CES). Research
opportunities are also available through individual departments. Information about OCC's Wil-
liams College Alumni Sponsored Summer Internships can be found at http://www.williams.edu/re-
sources/occ/ or by contacting Ron Gallagher, Assistant Director of Career Counseling (Ro-
nald.L.Gallagher@williams.edu). Information about CES's summer internship and research op-

Sarah Gardner, Assistant Director of the Center for Environmental Studies, Kellogg House (Sa-
rah.S.Gardner@williams.edu). Information about research opportunities sponsored by individual
departments is available from Department Chairs.
Museum Associates:
The Museum Associates Program of the Williams College Museum of Art provides students an
opportunity to broaden their knowledge of art and art history, to learn about the field of museum
education, and to develop valuable communication and public speaking skills while working with the
public. The only academic requirement is the completion of ArtH 101-102. Applications are accepted
every spring. For more information, contact Rebecca Hayes, Director of Education at Rebec-
ca.L.Hayes@williams.edu.
For more information about experiential education at Williams College, visit the Experiential
Education website at www.williams.edu/admin/deanfac/exped/ or contact Paula Consolini, Coor-
dinator of Experiential Education at 597-4588 (pconsoli@williams.edu)
Honors Program
Williams awards the degree with honors to those students who have demonstrated imagination,
initiative, and intellectual independence within the major. The Honors Program requires two or three
courses constituting a clearly interrelated pattern of study, whether in the form of a thesis, specializa-
tion within the major, or interdisciplinary study with courses from other programs or departments. At
least one of the courses must be in addition to the minimum number required for the major; one may
be a Winter Study Project. A student who is completing two majors may be a candidate for honors in
either or both of the majors, but a course for honors in one major may not be used as an honors course
in the other. Some programs also award honors for their concentrations.
Individual departments and programs describe special criteria, procedures, and patterns of study
for honors in the "Courses of Instruction" section. Students should consult with their departments
on their honors options prior to the senior year. Before the student has begun the last of the required
course units, the department or program determines whether the student is admitted to honors can-
didacy. The degree is awarded with Honors or Highest Honors at the end of the senior year if, in the
judgment of the department, its criteria of excellence have been met.
Independent Study
When a particularly able student wishes to study a subject not covered by the normal offerings of
the College, arrangements may be made to undertake courses of independent study under faculty
supervision. Such arrangements are made with the appropriate department at the time of registra-
tion.
Study Away from Williams
Many students decide to study at another college or university, in this country or abroad, during
their undergraduate education. The College encourages students to think about the option of study
away as they begin the process of considering major fields and course requirements during their soph-
omore year.
All students in good standing with no deficiencies, including financial aid recipients, may study
away on approved programs during all or part of the junior year. Academic credit is earned after evi-
dence of the satisfactory completion of the program. A student wishing to enroll in another institution
or program in this country or abroad, and to transfer credits earned on this program to Williams, must
consult with Dean Laura McKeon and the appropriate department chair early in the Fall Semester of
the sophomore year. Students are responsible for reading the Guide to Study Abroad available in the
Dean's Office. They should also consult faculty members with expertise in the area or region of inter-
est to them. All students who are curious about the off-campus study option should browse through
the reference library in the Dean's Office and Weston Hall and attend one of the general information
meetings which Dean McKeon offers throughout the autumn and in February. After attending an in-
formation session, students are free to schedule an appointment with the Dean. Approval is required
from the chair of the student's major department, Dean McKeon, and the Committee on Academic
Standing. Students wishing to study away for any portion of the junior year must request approval in
March of the sophomore year by submitting a pink petition to Dean McKeon.
When a student has decided to accept an offer of admission from a program, he or she must notify
the Dean's Office. The Committee on Academic Standing will make a final decision at that time.
Students must attend a pre-departure meeting and meet all the guidelines as directed in the Guide to

Study Abroad. Upon return to Williams, students must complete a program evaluation in order to
receive credit.
The Williams Tutorial Program
The Tutorial Program offers Williams students a distinctive opportunity to take a heightened form
of responsibility for their own intellectual development. No student is required to take a tutorial
course, but any student with the appropriate qualifications and interests is invited to do so.
Tutorials at the 100/200 level are designed primarily for first-year students and sophomores; they
are usually given enrollment preference for such courses, though interested juniors and seniors are
often welcome. Tutorials at the 300/400 level are designed primarily for juniors and seniors (and,
often, for majors in the discipline); first-year students and sophomores are welcome to apply, but are
urged to consult the instructor before registering.
Tutorials place much greater weight than do regular courses--or even small seminars--on student
participation. They aim to teach students how to develop and present arguments; listen carefully, and
then refine their positions in the context of a challenging discussion; and respond quickly and cogent-
ly to critiques of their work. Tutorials place particular emphasis on developing analytical skills, writ-
ing abilities, and the talents of engaging in rigorous conversation and oral debate.
The ways in which particular tutorials are conducted vary across the disciplines, but here is a de-
scription of how most tutorials at Williams are organized. Tutorials are usually limited to ten students.
At the start of term, the instructor divides the students into pairs. Each pair meets weekly with the
instructor for roughly one hour. Many tutorial courses begin and end the term with a group seminar,
and in a few departments, instructors hold weekly group meetings of all tutorial members to provide
background information designed to facilitate the students' independent work. But the heart of every
tutorial course is the weekly meeting of the two students with the instructor.
At these weekly meetings, one student delivers a prepared essay or presentation (e.g., an analysis of
a text or work of art, a discussion of a problem set, a report on laboratory exercises, etc.) pertaining to
the assignment for that week, while the other student--and then the instructor--offer a critique. In the
following week, students switch roles. Typically, students write five or six essays (usually in the range
of 4-7 pages) during the term, and offer five or six critiques of their partners' work.
Since the program's inception in 1988, students have ranked tutorials among the most demand-
ing--and rewarding--courses they have taken at Williams. While not designed to be more difficult
than other courses, tutorials are nonetheless challenging, with frequent writing assignments and the
expectation that students will be well prepared to participate actively and effectively in weekly discus-
sions. At the same time, students have consistently placed tutorials among the most enriching and
consequential courses they have taken. They have appreciated the close attention to their writing and
argumentation skills; the opportunity to be held accountable, in a detailed way, for the extended im-
plications of their ideas; the chance to develop their oral abilities as they engage in debate; and the
close intellectual bonds tutorials build between teachers and students, and students with each other.
Many students have formed important advising and mentoring relationships with their tutorial teach-
ers.
Registration information: Students register for tutorials as they would for any other course (but
should first check the description for prerequisites and to see if permission of the instructor is re-
quired). Because of limited enrollments and the special arrangements involved in organizing tutorials,
students are encouraged to determine, as early as possible, their interest in and commitment to the
course. Students may not drop or add a tutorial after the first week of class. Tutorials may not be taken
on a pass/fail basis.
More information: Please see page 324 of this catalog for a list of tutorials offered in 2008-2009.
Students may obtain detailed information about particular tutorials from the course descriptions
and the instructors. (All tutorials have a "T" after the course number.) For general information, ad-
vice, or suggestions about the program, please contact Professor Stephen Fix, Tutorial Program Di-
rector for 2008-2009, in Stetson.
Williams-Exeter Programme at Oxford University
Williams offers a year-long programme of studies at Oxford University in cooperation with Exeter
College, Oxford. Based at Ephraim Williams House, Williams' study center at Oxford, the Pro-
gramme is designed to offer the fullest possible integration of the students into the intellectual and
social life of one of the world's great universities. It makes full use of the Oxford tutorial system and
the Oxford three-term calendar is followed.
The Curriculum
­ 16 ­
In addition to extensive opportunities to pursue British and Commonwealth studies, the Pro-
gramme also offers instruction in other fields for which Oxford is particularly noted or which are
represented only marginally or infrequently in the Williams curriculum. Interested students should
consult the Dean's Office and the "Courses of Instruction" section of this catalog.
Williams-Mystic Maritime Studies Program
The William-Mystic Seaport Maritime Studies Program offers students a unique opportunity to
explore the ocean, to travel the Atlantic, Pacific and Gulf Coasts, and to undertake original research
of their own design in the humanities and sciences. A term at Williams-Mystic satisfies both a se-
mester's credit and one winter study requirement, as well as intensive writing course credit. Four
Williams courses are offered as an integrated, multidisciplinary curriculum in the semester-long
program at Mystic Seaport, in Mystic, Connecticut: Maritime History, Literature of the Sea, Marine
Policy, and either Marine Ecology or Oceanography (see the American Maritime Studies section in
this catalog). Williams College faculty members serve as the Director and Marine Scientist. Travel
includes an offshore voyage on the open ocean sailing aboard a tall ship, a seminar along the Pacific
Coast, and a Louisiana seminar, all of which are cross-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary exercises.
Students live in historic, cooperative, coed houses at Mystic Seaport, the world's largest maritime
museum, and have full access to world-class maritime collections, a maritime library, well-
equipped laboratory, and diverse coastal habitats (where field research can be undertaken in a wide
variety of environments, ranging from tidepools and salt marshes to sandy beaches and estuaries).
Students also participate in maritime skills under professional instruction, with choices such as
celestial navigation, maritime art, music of the sea, boat building, or small boat handling and sail-
ing. Williams-Mystic seeks candidates who are willing to try new things and work in a compelling
academic environment. No sailing experience necessary, and all majors welcome--a typical se-
mester at Williams-Mystic is represented by 12 to 14 different majors spanning the sciences and
humanities. Sophomores, juniors, and seniors can attend. Interested students should contact Wil-
liams-Mystic at admissions@williamsmystic.org, call (860-572- 5359), visit the website
(www.williams.edu/williamsmystic), or obtain a Williams-Mystic catalog from the Dean's office.
Applications are on the web and at the Dean's office. Financial aid and scholarships are available.
Williams in New York
Williams in New York is a one-semester study away program with a focus on experiential educa-
tion. It is distinctive, rigorous, and highly experiential, integrating traditional scholarship with on-
going fieldwork in related areas. Students attend classes and also spend 15 hours each week in a
workplace environment, gaining hands-on experience that provides them with new insights and
ideas which relate to their coursework. In turn, they bring this new-found knowledge into the work-
place and are able to analyze their experiences against an academic background. The fieldwork
placements are arranged in consultation with a Williams faculty member who serves as program
director. Students are placed in city organizations or agencies, where they work closely with non-
faculty supervisors throughout the semester. Classes are taught by the program director and other
professors from Williams or New York area colleges and universities. The program is headquar-
tered at the Williams Club in midtown Manhattan in close proximity to the New York Public Li-
brary, the City University of New York Graduate Center, Grand Central Station, and other New
York landmarks.

ACADEMIC STANDARDS AND REGULATIONS
Attendance
In order to give students a larger share of responsibility for their own education, Williams College does
not administer a general system of required classroom attendance. The College expects students to make
full use of their educational opportunities by regular class attendance and to assume the academic risks
incurred by absences.
Although no formal system of class attendance is maintained by the College, instructors may set such
standards of attendance as they feel are necessary for the satisfactory conduct of their courses. Students
who fail to meet these standards may be warned by the instructor and notice sent to the Dean that continued
absence will result in their being dropped from the course. A failing grade will be assigned to any course
dropped after the regular course change period. Students who do not attend the first class meeting in a
semester course or Winter Study Project may be required to withdraw by the instructor. Attendance is re-
quired at announced tests and final examinations unless the student is specifically excused by the instructor
or the Dean's Office. Satisfactory attendance in four quarters of activities approved by the Department of
Physical Education is required except for students excused by the Dean and the Director of Health.
Registration
Registration for fall and spring semesters and for the Winter Study Program takes place at designated
periods during the academic year. There may be a $5 per day processing fee for any registration changes
accepted after the announced deadlines.
New students register by mail in early summer; soon after arrival at Williams, they meet with their as-
signed Academic Advisors to discuss the curriculum and their course selections. All course changes for
new students are made after these meetings. During the first two years of study, students are limited in the
number of courses they may take in one department or subject each semester. For full details, see page 45.
Course Change Period
Course changes may be made during a designated period at the beginning of each semester. No course
changes may be made after that period except with the approval of the Committee on Academic Standing,
after consultation with the Dean's Office. During Winter Study, a second Winter Study Project may be
added if the instructor approves but the original Project may not be dropped. A processing fee of $5 per day
may be assessed for each course change accepted after the announced deadline.
First-year and first-semester transfer students may be permitted to withdraw from one course (incurring
a deficiency but no grade penalty) as late as the tenth week of the semester. Upperclass students also may
once in subsequent years withdraw from a course under the same conditions. A withdrawal, recorded on
the transcript as a "W," is granted only with the approval of the instructor and a dean and only if there is
complete agreement between the instructor and the dean that, despite conscientious effort to do the work,
continuation in the course would be detrimental to the overall educational interest or health of the student.
The deficiency thereby incurred must be removed in the normal manner. See references to making up defi-
ciencies on page 18.
Course Load
Students are required to take and complete four courses each semester. In exceptional cases, students
may, upon petition to the Committee on Academic Standing and with departmental approval at the time of
registration, elect a pattern of five semester courses in the fall semester and three in the spring or three in the
fall and five in the spring; a pass-fail course cannot be used as the fifth course in this pattern.
If a student with a disability believes that he/she is unable to pursue a full course of study, the student
may petition the Disabilities and Accommodations Advisory Group for permission to pursue a reduced
course load. Such a petition must be accompanied by a professional evaluation which addresses the stu-
dent's inability to maintain a full course of study and discusses the rationale for a reduced course load.
Upon consideration of a student's petition and supporting documentation, the Disabilities and Accom-
modations Advisory Group makes a recommendation to the Committee on Academic Standing which
renders decisions. Such cases are considered on an individual basis and may be initiated at any time during
the student's tenure at Williams.
Fifth Course Pass-Fail Option
Except in the case of the unbalanced course program described above, a student may, at the beginning of
any semester, enroll in a fifth course that must be specified as the pass-fail course. By the sixth week, a
student must decide whether to continue the course, and if so, whether on a pass-fail or regularly graded
Academic Standards and Regulations
­ 18 ­
basis. A form for designating the option chosen will be sent from the Registrar's Office. A processing fee
of $5 per day may be assessed for 5th course grading option designations accepted after the announced
deadline. A course graded "Pass" may not be used as one of the thirty-two semester courses required to
complete the degree, to fulfill distribution or major requirements, or to make up a deficiency. A pass-fail
course converted to a fifth regularly graded course may be used to fulfill distribution or major requirements
or to make up a deficiency incurred in a prior term. The grade received will be included in the calculation
of the student's cumulative grade-point average.
Winter Study Project
Students must take and pass a Winter Study Project in each of their four years. Winter Study Projects are
graded Honors, Pass, Perfunctory Pass, or Fail. All work for Winter Study Projects must be submitted by
the last day of the Winter Study Program; work may be accepted after this date only with the permission of
a dean. Students who fail their Winter Study Projects will be placed on Academic Probation by the Com-
mittee on Academic Standing and will be required to make up the deficiency (see page 18). Students who
fail through gross neglect of work will normally be required to resign. A student who receives a second
Perfunctory Pass grade in Winter Study will be required to pass a fifth course, which may be graded on the
regular A-E or pass/fail basis, in the following spring or fall semester.
Grading System and Records
Williams uses the following system of grades: A, excellent; B, good; C, fair; D, passing; E, failing.
These letters, with plus and minus value, have the following numerical equivalents in calculating grade
averages:
A+ = 4.33 B+ = 3.33 C+ = 2.33 D+ = 1.33
A = 4.00 B = 3.00 C = 2.00 D = 1.00 E = 0
A­ = 3.67 B­ = 2.67 C­ = 1.67 D­ = 0.67
A permanent record of each student's grades is kept and this official record forms the basis for any aca-
demic action by the College.
A transcript of a student's cumulative academic record is available from the Registrar's Office upon
written request. Transcripts will not be issued for students who are in financial arrears.
Provisions relating to student records, access to them, and safeguards on their use are in the Student
Handbook.
First-Year Student Warnings
In the middle of each semester, instructors report to the Registrar those first-year students whose grades
at that time are unsatisfactory. The students and their academic advisors receive notices of warnings as a
matter of routine. The Dean's Office may inform parents of students who receive two or more warnings.
Extensions of Deadlines
Deadlines for course work are set by the instructor with the following limitations:
 for courses with final exams, the latest that written work may be due is 5:00 p.m. on the last
day of reading period.
 for courses without final exams, the latest that written work may be due is 5:00 pm. on the
third-to-last day of the exam period.
If work is due before these deadlines, the instructor may grant an extension up to these deadlines solely
at his or her discretion. Short extensions beyond these deadlines may be granted by a dean but only with the
concurrence of the instructor. No extensions will be granted beyond the examination period except in the
case of serious illness.
Instructors may require students who have missed announced quizzes or hour tests to present satis-
factory explanations to a dean before they are permitted to make up the exercises.
If a student is absent from a final examination, a make-up examination may be given only with the
permission of a dean and at a time determined by the dean.
Deficiencies
A student receives credit for a course by obtaining a grade of at least D minus. A student may not
repeat a course for which degree credit has been awarded. If the student fails a course, he or she must
make up the deficiency.
Academic Standards and Regulations
­ 19 ­
If a failure occurs in the first semester of a full-year course, the student may, with the consent of the
instructor, continue the course and receive credit for the second semester only. If a failure occurs in the
second semester of a full-year course, credit for passing the first semester may be retained only with the
approval of the Committee on Academic Standing.
A senior who incurs a failure in the first semester in a required major course may be dropped from the
College at midyear.
Normally deficiencies can be made up only by courses taken after the deficiencies have been incurred.
A student must make up a deficiency in one of these ways:
1) obtain a grade of at least C minus in a summer school course, approved in advance by the Registrar,
at a regionally accredited four-year college or university; (The grade will not, however, be included
in the calculation of the student's cumulative grade point average.)
2) pass an extra graded course at Williams in the semester following the failure;
3) in the case ofafirst-semester failure ofayear-long language course, obtainagrade of at leastaCminus
in the work of the second semester of that course. The failure for the first semester will, however, re-
main on the student's record and will be included in the cumulative grade point average.
A deficiency must normally be made up before the start of the following academic year, or in the case of
a deficiency incurred in the spring semester, no later than the following fall semester. A student may, in
consultation with the Dean's Office, petition the Committee on Academic Standing with an alternate plan.
Separation for Low Scholarship
It is the policy of Williams College not to permit a student to remain in residence after it has become
evident that he or she is either unable or unwilling to maintain reasonable standards of academic achieve-
ment. At the end of each term, the Committee on Academic Standing reviews all academic records that fail
to meet the following minimum academic requirements:
For first-year students: Three grades of C minus or better and no failures each semester, and
at least Perfunctory Pass on the Winter Study Project
For upperclass students: Four grades of C minus or better each semester, and
at least Perfunctory Pass on the Winter Study Project
Students whose records fail to meet these minimum academic requirements or whose records otherwise
fail to show adequate progress may receive an academic warning, be placed on academic probation, or be
required to resign.
Students who are required to resign from the College for academic reasons are normally not permitted to
return for at least one year from the date of their resignation. A student who has been required to resign
from the College may petition the Committee on Academic Standing through the Dean for reinstatement
on two conditions only: all deficiencies must have been made up and a letter submitted to the Committee
that offers convincing evidence that the student is ready and able to complete work toward a degree at
Williams without further interruption.
When required to resign, students must vacate their rooms promptly. Financial aid students must also
see the Director of Financial Aid before leaving to discuss loan repayment and renewal of aid in the event
of readmission.
A student who fails to meet minimum academic standards in his or her final semester at Williams may
be required by the Committee on Academic Standing to meet them by earning grades of at least C minus
elsewhere before the B.A. will be awarded. If such work is required, it must be completed within three
years unless stipulated otherwise, and the courses must be approved in advance by the Registrar.
Withdrawal from the College in Good Standing
Students may request personal leaves of absence from a dean and, if granted, withdraw from the Col-
lege. Such time away, often as a period of reassessment and self evaluation, can prove to be educationally
beneficial. A withdrawal in good standing may be granted for not less than one semester and not more than
three years. Students who withdraw in good standing are readmitted with the approval of the Dean's Office
and are expected to complete the degree without further interruption.
Students may request permission from a dean to withdraw at any time. If a student is granted a personal
leave of absence after the semester begins, but before the end of the drop/add period, the transcript will list
the date of withdrawal as the day before the term began. If a personal leave is granted after the end of the
Academic Standards and Regulations
­ 20 ­
drop/add period, but before the end of the eighth week of the semester, the transcript will list the date of
withdrawal, but the semester will not count toward the maximum of eight allowed to complete the degree.
If a personal withdrawal is allowed after the eighth week of the semester, the transcript will list the date of
withdrawal and the courses in progress, each with a W; the semester will normally count toward the maxi-
mum of eight allowed to complete the degree and the student will incur deficiencies that must be made up
before returning to the College.
Refunds
Payment refund or credit in the event of withdrawal is described on page 27.
Eligibility for and Completion of Majors
To be eligible for any major, students must have received grades of C minus or better in each course in
the major taken in the first two years of college and Honors or Pass on any Winter Study Project taken in
the major department or program. A senior may enter a major only upon the approval of the department
chair and the Committee on Academic Standing.
All semester courses in the major must be taken on a regularly graded basis. In addition to passing each
major course and, where required, a major Winter Study Project, the student must maintain an average in
the major of 1.67 or higher. Seniors who have an average below 1.67 in the major field normally will not be
allowed to continue. A senior who receives a grade of E in the first semester of a required major course
may be dropped from the College at mid-year. A student who falls below these standards may continue in
the major only with the approval of the Committee on Academic Standing.
A senior major exercise is not required by every department but is by some. All departments requiring
such an exercise specify it as such in the description of their major programs in the "Courses of Instruction"
section, and all students in those departments must complete the exercise satisfactorily.
Eligibility for Extracurricular Activities
A student is eligible to represent the College in any athletic, dramatic, literary, or musical event and be in
the student government, or other organization as a member, substitute, or officer, unless he or she is de-
clared ineligible:
1) by the Dean;
2) by vote of the Discipline Committee; or
3) by vote of the Committee on Academic Standing because of a dangerously low record.
The Student Honor Committee may recommend to the Dean loss of eligibility as a penalty for a viola-
tion of the Honor Code.
Dean's List
All students who attain a semester average of 3.50 or higher in a program of four or more courses are
placed on the Dean's List for that semester.
Phi Beta Kappa Society
Students of the highest academic standing are eligible for election to membership in the Phi Beta Kappa
Society in accordance with the following rules:
1) The requirements for election to membership shall be a grade point average of 3.3 and Honors or
Pass in all required Winter Study Projects. There shall be two elections of new members for each class, at
the end of the junior and senior years.
2) At the end of the junior year, all students in the highest five percent of the class, ranked by cumulative
grade point average, shall be eligible for election provided they have met the requirements and have com-
pleted enough courses to be considered candidates for the B.A. degree in the following year. A student who
leaves Williams at the end of the junior year to attend graduate school may be elected under the above
procedures.
At the end of the senior year, all students not yet elected and in the highest 12.5 per cent of the class,
ranked by cumulative grade point average, shall be eligible for election provided they have met the require-
ments.
3) Students shall be eligible for election only if they have been students at Williams College for at least
two years.
4) Honorary members may be elected from distinguished alumni of at least twenty years' standing. No
more than one such member shall be elected each year.
5) Any student who shall have gained his or her rank by unfair means or who in the judgment of the
Dean of the College is not of good moral character is ineligible to election.
Academic Standards and Regulations
­ 21 ­
6) The name of a member elect shall be entered on the roll only after he or she has accepted the election
and has paid to the Treasurer the regular entrance fee.
7) Any undergraduate member who withdraws from the College before graduation or who falls short of
the minimum Phi Beta Kappa scholastic standing may, upon a two-thirds voteof the members present at
the annual meeting, be deprived of membership in the society.
8) Any undergraduate member who is expelled from the College shall be deprived of membership in
the Society.
9) While connected with Williams College as an officer of instruction or administration, any graduate of
Williams College who is a member of another chapter of Phi Beta Kappa shall be considered a regular
member of the Williams chapter.
10) While connected with Williams College as professor, associate professor or assistant professor, or
an officer of administration, any member of another chapter of Phi Beta Kappa shall have all the privileges
of the Williams chapter, including holding office and voting. While connected with Williams College, any
other officer of instruction or administration who is a member of another chapter shall have all the privi-
leges of the Williams chapter, except holding office and voting.
Awarding of Degrees
By vote of the Trustees, the degree of Bachelor of Arts is conferred at Commencement upon students
who have completed the requirements as to courses and grades to the satisfaction of the Faculty. The right
to a degree may, however, be forfeited by misconduct at any time prior to the conferring of the degree. No
degree in absentia will be conferred except by special vote of the Trustees on petition presented to the
Dean. Diplomas will not be authorized for students who have not paid College charges or have not re-
turned all books belonging to the library.
Graduation with Distinction
The Faculty will recommend to the Trustees that the degree of Bachelor of Arts with distinction be con-
ferred upon those members of the graduating class who have passed all Winter Study Projects and obtained
a four year average in the top:
35% of the graduating class -- Bachelor of Arts cum laude or higher
15% of the graduating class -- Bachelor of Arts magna cum laude or higher
2% of the graduating class -- Bachelor of Arts summa cum laude

ACADEMIC ADVISING
A variety of academic advice and counsel is offered to students. Instructors, departmental and adminis-
trative officers and some special programs are available to partner with students to help them explore and
develop their academic interests and talents and take advantage of the academic and intellectual opportuni-
ties available through the College.
In the first-year, each student is assigned an Academic Advisor who is either a member of the faculty or
an administrative officer whose responsibilities keep him or her in close contact with the curriculum of the
College. The Deans of the College also advise undergraduates and coordinate the first-year advising pro-
gram, review the academic progress of individual students, and--when appropriate--call students in to
discuss their situations.
In the sophomore year, students continue to meet with their first-year advisors and it is recommended
that they seek advice from deans and instructors, along with pre-professional and other special advisors
(see page 412). Sophomores are also encouraged to discuss major options and requirements with faculty
members from departments and programs in which they have an interest before declaring a major in the
spring semester.
The student-run Peer Mentor programs can provide additional advice and information for students dur-
ing their first and sophomore years in particular, as well as for any student wishing a peer perspective about
courses, departments, programs, majors, or areas of study. Peer Mentors are nominated by departments and
programs from the senior majors. During the year, the Peer Mentors keep informed about any changes in
faculty and curriculum in their departments and generally make themselves available for students.
In the junior and senior years, students are advised by faculty from their major departments or programs.
Each department or program determines its own advising system for its majors, although chairs are regu-
larly available for consultation.
ACADEMIC ASSISTANCE
Additional programs of academic assistance are also available through the Academic Resources office.
Any student who desires extra help in a course in which he or she is registered may request a tutor who has
been recommended by the respective departments to Academic Resources office; costs of this tutoring are
covered by Academic Resources. Students seeking to enhance their writing skills in any course may take
advantage of the Writing Workshop. Trained and supervised by a coordinator, student writing tutors pro-
vide assistance on papers already corrected and with drafts of papers in any stage of the writing process.
The Math and Science Resource Center (MSRC), a drop-in help center staffed by student tutors who come
highly recommended from the respective departments, is also available to students of Biology 101, 102,
and 202, Chemistry 151, 153, 155, 156, 251, 255, Mathematics 100, 101, 103, 104, 105, and 106, Physics
131, 132, 141, and 142, and Statistics 101, and 201. The MSRC (which is open from 8 p.m. to 12 midnight
Sundays through Thursdays throughout both academic semesters) works in close cooperation with the fac-
ulty teaching those courses.
All students are encouraged to take full advantage of these academic resources.
STUDY ABROAD
Advising of Williams students wishing to study abroad in the junior year is coordinated by the Dean's
Office. Special orientation and information meetings are held during the fall semester for new students and
for students wishing to study abroad. Orientation and counseling of international students is arranged by
the International Student Advisor in the Dean's Office.

­ 23 ­
ACADEMIC HONESTY
All students are expected to be familiar with the Williams College Honor Code and to reaffirm their
commitment to the Statement of Academic Honesty at the beginning of each academic year. The Honor
Code covers all aspects of academic honesty, including the writing of papers and laboratory reports as well
as all quizzes, homework assignments, hour tests, and examinations.
Statement of Academic Honesty
As an institution fundamentally concerned with the free exchange of ideas, Williams College has al-
ways depended on the academic integrity of each of its members. In the spirit of this free exchange, the
students and faculty of Williams recognize the necessity and accept the responsibility for academic hones-
ty.
A student who enrolls at the College thereby agrees to respect and acknowledge the research and ideas
of others in his or her work and to abide by those regulations governing work stipulated by the instructor.
Any student who breaks these regulations, misrepresents his or her own work, or collaborates in the mis-
representation of another's work has committed a serious violation of this agreement.
Students and faculty are to report violations and alleged violations of this agreement. Such reports are to
be submitted to the Student Honor Committee, consisting of eight student members of the joint Faculty-
Student Honor System-Discipline Committee. This committee is responsible for determining the guilt or
innocence of the accused person or persons, and for recommending appropriate punishments to the Dean.
A committee of faculty members to be designated by the Faculty will sit with the Student Honor Commit-
tee in an advisory capacity.
A quorum of three-quarters shall be required for the Committee to meet. A vote of guilty by at least
three-quarters of those present is necessary for conviction. A recommendation for dismissal must be made
by unanimous vote of those present, and shall be carried out only with the assent of the President of the
College.
The Committee is responsible for informing the student body of the meaning and implications of this
statement. The aforementioned faculty committee shall be responsible for informing faculty members of
the meaning and implications of this statement.
Any amendments to this statement must be made through a student referendum in which two-thirds of
the student body votes, and in which two-thirds of those voting vote for the amendment. These alterations
must be ratified by the Faculty.
Adopted 1971
Guidelines
Instructors are encouraged to submit to the Honor Committee a written statement defining how the
Statement of Academic Honesty applies to their courses or laboratories, and to explain such guidelines to
their students. Instructors may set any type of final examination or hour test, ranging from closed-book,
alternate-seating classroom exercises to open-book, "take-home" examinations or papers, and any require-
ments for laboratory exercises. Some instructors encourage cooperation among students but others do not.
If a student is unsure how the Honor Code applies in a particular situation, it is ultimately the student's
responsibility to find out from his or her professor, or from a member of the Honor Committee, how the
Honor Code applies in that situation. An open and highly individualized system can last only as long as
both the students and the faculty work together to create a true academic community.
In written material, students are expected to avoid the possibility of even unintentional plagiarism by
acknowledging the sources of their work. Careful observance of accepted standards of reference and
attribution is required. The basic rules are summarized below. Students are further advised to consult a
recognized style manual to learn how to acknowledge sources correctly. While academic honesty does not
demand a footnote on statements of common fact, it does require that a student provide clear footnotes or
other appropriate documentation and give credit in the bibliography to ideas, interpretations, and facts that
particular sources have contributed to the student's final work.
Academic Honesty
­ 24 ­
The basic rules of attribution require that:
1) A direct quotation (whether a single word or a phrase, sentence, paragraph, or series of paragraphs)
must always be identified by quotation marks, by indenting and single spacing, or by reduced type size of
the quoted material, and a note must be used to state the exact source.
2) A paraphrase of the work of another must be acknowledged as such by a note stating the source.
3) Indebtedness to the specific ideas of others, or the summarizing of several pages, even though ex-
pressed in different words, must be acknowledged by a note stating the source.
4) Every instance of the use of another student's laboratory reports, computer programs, or other mate-
rial must be acknowledged by a note.
5) Even the use of a student's own previous work must be acknowledged; thus, a student must obtain
the prior permission of all instructors concerned before submitting substantially the same paper in more
than one course.
Procedures for Alleged Violations
Students or faculty members who have discovered a violation or a possible violation of the Honor Code
should report it promptly either to the faculty chair or to the student chair of the Honor Committee. As
soon as possible after receiving a report of an alleged Honor Code violation, the Student Honor Committee
will convene to hear the case. The person bringing the charge will present the evidence to the Committee in
the presence of the accused student, who may then speak in his or her own defense both with and without
the accuser present. After the accused student has left the proceedings, the Committee will determine inno-
cence or guilt and, if the latter, will recommend an appropriate penalty to the Dean. Depending on the
circumstances of the violation, penalties then imposed by the Dean may include such possibilities as a
directed grade of E in the course, disciplinary probation, or temporary or permanent separation from the
College.
­ 25 ­
EXPENSES
Within the limits of available funds, Williams endeavors to offer its educational opportunities to all who
qualify for admission. Income from its endowment and annual contributions from its alumni and friends
have enabled Williams to keep its tuition at about half the actual cost per student to the College.
Payment of Term Bills
College bills for one-half of all tuition and fees are mailed to parents twice a year (in mid-July and mid-
December) for payment on August 15 and January 15; a fee of $250 may be charged if payment is re-
ceived after these dates. Term bills must be paid before the semester's classes begin or the student may not
be permitted to enroll in classes or remain in residence at the College. Billing statements for accounts with
outstanding balances or current activity will be issued monthly and are due upon receipt.
All outstanding balances must be paid to the Bursar, and all books and materials must be returned to the
Library, before the student is entitled to a degree or a transcript.
College Bills
College charges for tuition, room, board, and fees for the academic year 2008-2009 are as follows:
Tuition $37,400
Room Fee (including telephone service) 5,030
Full Board 4,860
Student Activities Fee* 190
House Maintenance Fee (upperclass) or First-Year Dues 50
_______
$47,530
Other Expenses
Based on a study of expenses reported by financial aid students, a minimum normal budget for a college
year at Williams includes additional expenses estimated as follows:
Books 800
Clothing, Laundry, Recreation approximately 1200
_______
Estimated year's total, exclusive of travel expenses** $2,000
________________
*A student activities fee for support of non-athletic student organizations is charged to all un-
dergraduates as part of the College term bill. It includes, for example, subscriptions to the col-
lege newspaper, and admission to most drama productions and musical events on campus.
**Travel expenses are not included in figures listed above. The cost of two round-trip tickets is
added into each successful financial aid candidate's award.
Additional Items
A House Maintenance Fee of $50 per year is charged to upperclassmen as a part of the College term bill.
It is used to provide a base for the social and cultural programs of each residential House and to meet any
unusual maintenance expenses for the Houses. First-year class dues of $50 are charged at the rate of $25
each semester. Co-op residents and off-campus residents are charged a $25 neighborhood residential fee
each semester.
The Commonwealth of Massachusetts requires that, effective September 1, 1989, all full- and part-time
students enrolled in institutions of higher education located in Massachusetts must participate in a qualify-
ing student health insurance plan offered by the institution or in another health insurance program affording
comparable coverage.
Expenses
­ 26 ­
The College offers a qualifying student health insurance plan to all students. The College will allow
students to waive participation in this insurance plan if the student will certify in writing, before the begin-
ning of the academic year, that the coverage offered by an alternative program chosen by the student is
comparable to that of the qualifying program available at the College.
Information about the student health insurance program offered by the College, including current details
of its cost, is mailed to all students each year. Additional information about this program or about the Com-
monwealth's requirements is available through the Thompson Health Center at (413) 597-3166.
There may be a $5 per day processing fee for any registration changes accepted after the announced
deadlines. There is a charge of $25 for a lost key.
Payment of College Bills
A non-refundable deposit of $200 to reserve a place in the first-year class is required from all admitted
candidates (except certain financial aid recipients) by the Candidate's Reply Date of May 1. The deposit
appears as a credit on the term bill rendered in July.
College tuition statements for one half of all fees are mailed to the billing name(s) and addresses on
record twice a year--in July, payable by August 15, and in December, payable by January 15. Payment
may be made by check, money order, or wire transfer. Credit cards can not be used to pay tuition and fees.
A fee of $250 may be charged if payment is received after these dates.
Students who receive a scholarship(s) that was not awarded through the Williams Office of Financial
Aid must complete a Scholarship Information Sheet and mail it to the Financial Aid Office by early June.
Provisional credit will be posted to the semester bill for the following; anticipated disbursements of direct
loans for which a promissory note has been signed and returned to the Office of Financial Aid, anticipated
disbursements of outside loans approved by the lender, outside scholarships which have not yet been re-
ceived and applied against the student account and any remaining semester contract amount for the Ten
Month Payment Plan. If actual payment for the above provisional credits are not received by the date antic-
ipated, the provisional credit will expire and be removed from the student's account creating a balance due.
A check returned to the College for any reason such as "account closed" or "insufficient funds" will be
charged to the student's term bill and a "return check charge" of $20.00 will be assessed. The College
reserves the right to require that payment be made in the form of cash, cashier check or money order.
Students with bills still unpaid at the start of the semester who have not made satisfactory arrangements
with the Bursar will not be permitted to enroll in classes or remain in residence at the College. Furthermore,
if arrangements for payment after the start of the semester are approved by the Bursar and these expected
payments are not made on time, students may not be allowed to enroll for the next semester.
If efforts by the Bursar's Office to collect the monies owed are unsuccessful, the account could be
placed with a collection agency, and if the delinquency persists, the College's experience with the account
may be reported to a national credit bureau. It is the policy of the College to pass on to the debtor all reason-
able costs associated with collection of the debt through a collection agency. If at any time the student
believes information concerning payment delinquency is inaccurate, he/she should notify the College c/o
The Bursar's Office, P.O. Box 406, Williamstown, MA 01267.
There are several loan options available to parents through outside sources. These include the MassPlan
Loan through the Massachusetts Educational Financing Authority and the Federal Plus Loan Program.
Information on these loans can be found in the brochure A Guide to Borrowing for College.
Williams also offers an installment plan, administered by Tuition Management Services whereby the
yearly charges are paid in 10 equal installments starting in June, with no interest charges. There are no
income restrictions. Monthly payments will be the total cost (less any scholarships, Stafford or parent
loans) divided by 10. There is an administration fee for this program. Information on this program is sent
each spring to all parents or can be obtained by calling Tuition Management Services at (888) 216-4258.

Financial Aid
Williams has a substantial financial aid program to promote the greatest possible diversity in the social
and economic background of the student population. Students interested in financial aid policies and pro-
cedures should consultWilliams College Prospectus,theStudent Handbook, or the Office of Financial Aid.
Distinctive Undergraduate Scholarships
Williams College, through the Office of Financial Aid, administers over three hundred endowed schol-
arships, all of which are based on demonstrated need. Students who apply for financial assistance are auto-
matically considered for all these and other endowed scholarships. No separate application is required.

year to six to eight of the most promising scholars in the first-year class. Tyng Scholars are also eligible for
assistance for up to three years of graduate/professional study.
Alumni Funded Tutorials
Tutorials bring a professor and two students together in weekly sessions that epitomize President James
A. Garfield's (Class of 1856) legendary statement: "The ideal college is Mark Hopkins on one end of the
log and a student on the other." They forge student-professor bonds, teach students about arguments, about
arriving at and defending a position, and about responding on the spot to questions, criticisms, and sugges-
tions. They also promote critical reading, the writing of succinct analyses, and oral defense.
The College recognizes the Classes of 1953, 1954, and 1979 with deepest gratitude for supporting Tuto-
rials with their generous 25th and 50th Reunion gifts. Williams is also pleased to recognize the following
individuals who have created generous endowments to support Tutorials, many in honor of their 25th and
50th Reunions: Hugh Germanetti 1954, David A. Gray 1954, Robert L. Guyett 1958, John D. Mabie
1954, and John H. Simpson 1979.
­ 30 ­
PREPARATIONFORGRADUATEAND PROFESSIONALSTUDY
Although the principle function of Williams is to provide a broad and solid liberal education that will be
of lasting value no matter what the vocation a student may pursue, the College recognizes that no funda-
mental conflict exists between a liberal education and preparation for a professional career; on the contrary,
a foundation of liberal studies increases professional competence in any field. A student should plan his or
her program of study so as to provide as much educational breadth and enrichment as circumstances per-
mit. A student should also give serious consideration to post-college plans early in the college career.
Each departmental major provides the foundation for graduate study in the corresponding field. Stu-
dents should consult the departmental programs listed under "Courses of Instruction" for requirements,
and for special advice regarding preparation for graduate study. Students should also consult with the ap-
propriate departmental chairman or the special faculty advisors as early as possible in their college careers
to make certain they have taken all the necessary factors into consideration.
Particular attention is called to the foreign language requirements of graduate study. Candidates for the
degree of doctor of philosophy at almost all graduate schools are required to have a reading knowledge of
both French and German. Under certain circumstances another language may replace French. Many grad-
uate schools require also a knowledge of Latin for students of English and Romantic Languages. Candi-
dates for the master of arts degree are required to have a reading knowledge of either French or German.
Students should consult departmental chairmen or the faculty advisors for the requirements in specific
fields of study.
Visual Arts
Students interested in graduate studies in art or architecture should meet with faculty with whom they
have completed advanced work in the areas they wish to pursue. Their counsel and that of the Department
of Art Academic Advisor, Ed Epping, can help the student narrow the search of programs that would best
match the student's needs. The specific requirements of all art and architecture schools offering Master of
Arts and/or Master of Fine Arts is available from their online resource.
The College Art Association (CAA) has written:
"Admission to (graduate) programs should be based on the nature, extent, and quality of un-
dergraduate preparation, including courses in studio, art history, and other academic subjects.
Quality of studio preparation can best be judged on the basis of careful evaluation of work
done at the undergraduate level; therefore, a portfolio review (usually represented by slides) is
regarded as an absolute necessity in the admission process.
While many institutions consider the BFA to be the standard qualifying degree, the fact that the
applicant has attended a BA- or BS-granting institution does not necessarily rule out accep-
tance in most MFA programs. Whatever the undergraduate degree, most entering graduate
students tend not to be completely prepared in one or more of the areas cited above and will
require remedial make-up work...
Some institutions use the MA degree as a qualifying prerequisite for final acceptance into
MFA candidacy, allowing the student to apply the earned credits toward the higher degree."
Students are advised to take into consideration not only current minimum requirements but also recom-
mended courses.
Business Administration
Williams offers no special course in preparation for a business career for graduate study in business
administration. The qualities which are important to succeed in business, and which graduate business
schools are seeking, are an ability to reason and to express oneself logically and clearly in written and oral
exposition; a good understanding of the physical and social environment in which business operates; a
solid background in quantitative skills; and an appreciation of human motivations and goals. This means
that a broad liberal arts program is preferred over a highly specialized one.
Within this broad prescription it may be desirable to have at least one year of economics and one year of
mathematics (including statistics and calculus). For those interested in production management or opera-
Preparation for Graduate and Professional Study
­ 31 ­
tion research, additional work in any quantitative course and/or a course in computer science would be
helpful.
But there is no particular major at Williams that is designated as preparation for the business profession.
Students interested in futures in business are encouraged to undertake a broad educational program in the
arts, humanities, and sciences. It is important that one gets involved in extra-curricular activities, one holds
a leadership position, and pursuing relevant summer internship is critical.
Students interested in graduate work in business administration should consult with the Pre-MBA Advi-
sor, Robin Meyer, at the Office of Career Counseling.
Engineering
Many Williams graduates enjoy productive careers in engineering, applied science, or technical
management. Successful engineers need to be able to communicate effectively, reason logically, and
understand both the technical and the social dimensions of a problem. A prospective engineer should
major in one of the sciences (usually physics, chemistry, computer science, or mathematics), while
pursuing a broad liberal arts education at Williams. Most often he or she will complete a Williams
B.A. in the usual four years and then go to an engineering school for professional training leading to a
master's degree or doctorate in engineering. While it may be necessary to make up a few undergradu-
ate engineering courses, the opportunities at Williams to participate in scientific research and the
breadth of a liberal arts education prepare Williams graduates to succeed in engineering graduate
study and in their careers.
The booklet "Choosing First Year Courses" contains a list of Williams courses recommended to
prospective engineers. Students interested in engineering also have the opportunity to take under-
graduate engineering courses at other institutions. Williams maintains formal exchange programs
with California Institute of Technology, Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth College, and
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Williams students can arrange to study at one of these leading engi-
neering schools for one or two semesters, typically during the junior year. Please see the "Exchange
Programs" section of this catalog for more information. The 3-2 program offers another opportunity
to study engineering at the undergraduate level. Please see the "Combined Program in Liberal Arts
and Engineering" section for information.
The pre-engineering advisor, Professor Jefferson Strait, will be happy to help plan course selections and
to discuss the possible paths to a career in engineering. Many more details about pre-engineering can be
found in the Physics Department section of the College website.
Law
Williams graduates regularly proceed directly to law schools on the strength of their liberal education.
As a rule, law schools do not require particular pre-law curriculum for undergraduates. Consequently, ap-
plication and admission to law school is open to qualified students from all academic disciplines. This does
not mean, however, that law schools are indifferent to one's undergraduate academic experience. In fact,
law schools will be very conscious of the quality and rigor of one's undergraduate education. A serious
student, considering law school, will heed this advice and undertake a challenging program.
Students intending to study law should consult with the Pre-Law Advisor, Dawn Dellea, at the Office of
Career Counseling. Also, on a regular basis each fall, law schools from around the country will visit Wil-
liams to provide information and to answer questions of potential applicants. Check the OCC calendar for
notice of these visits.
The Health Professions
Many Williams graduates elect to pursue a career in medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine, public
health, or other health-related fields. All are welcome to seek guidance from the Health Professions Office.
Students interested in medicine and related fields should pursue a broad liberal arts education, letting
enthusiasm for subjects be a guide. In most cases, a student should consider volunteer service and field-
specific internship experience in an effort to confirm interest in the chosen field. With careful planning, any
major can be studied.
In order to pursue a career in a health-related field, a student must pay particular attention to the courses
required for graduate school admission. In certain fields, upwards of twelve courses are listed as prerequi-
sites. The general requirements for many programs are outlined in "Choosing First Year Courses," but each
student considering advanced study in the health fields should plan on meeting with the Health Professions
Preparation for Graduate and Professional Study
­ 32 ­
Advisor early in the college career to ensure that planned coursework will meet specific admissions re-
quirements.
Jane Cary, the Health Professions Advisor, will be happy to discuss goals and specific steps which might
help a student realize them. Detailed information is available at the Health Professions website (www.wil-
liams.edu/go/careers/prehealth_welcome.php).
Pre-College and College Teaching/Research
A central qualification for careers in teaching at any level is proficiency in a major. Students interested in
college teaching and research should prepare themselves at Williams for graduate work in the subject of
their choice. Those interested in teaching at the elementary or secondary level should plan to attain state
certification and/or earn an MAT or M.Ed at a good graduate school. There are many opportunities to do
teaching internships and study education as an undergraduate while at Williams.
Students interested in college teaching should consult with the chairs of the departments in which they
intend to major. Those interested in teaching at the elementary and secondary level should consult with the
Director of the Program in Teaching. Additional advice for both of these options is also available at the
Office of Career Counseling.
Teaching After Williams
There are many options for teaching after Williams, including independent and public school teaching.
Many states now offer streamlined programs to certify public school teachers, and many states offer wide
range of options for acquiring certification while you teach. Students who are interested in teaching are
encouraged to contact Susan Engel, the Director of the Program in Teaching at Williams, to find out how
they might participate in the program.
The Office of Career Counseling has a very active on-campus educational recruiting program that in-
cludes many private schools as well as Teach for America and similar programs. The program begins in
the fall and continues through the spring. Students interested in teaching at independent elementary- or
secondary-level schools or participating in the Teach for America or similar programs directly after gradu-
ation from Williams (certification is not required) should consult with the Office of Career Counseling.
Religious Study
There is no particular path through the Williams curriculum designed or recommended for students in-
tending to prepare for a career as a religious professional, enroll in a seminary or pursue theological educa-
tion. Most undergraduate liberal arts courses can be useful to the prospective minister, priest, rabbi, imam,
or teacher of religion. Ordination requirements vary widely depending on the particular religious commu-
nity or tradition; in some cases it may be possible to make progress on certain credentials in academic study
or field experience during the undergraduate years. A basic foundation in the study of religion is certainly
helpful--sacred texts, scriptural languages, history, philosophy, phenomenology and comparative studies,
etc. Students contemplating advanced academic work in religious studies in preparation for a career in
teaching or scholarship should give serious consideration to concentrated undergraduate study in the field.
Students with vocational interests that may include ordination or certification as a religious professional
are urged to make themselves known to one of the chaplains (or, where appropriate, one of the local clergy)
as soon as these interests begin to come into focus. Those interested in graduate academic programs in
religious studies should consult with the faculty advisor in that field.

GRADUATE PROGRAMS AT WILLIAMS
Master of Arts in Policy Economics
The Center for Development Economics (CDE), which opened at Williams College in 1960, offers an
intensive one-year program in economic analysis leading to the degree of Master of Arts in Policy Eco-
nomics. The program is specifically designed for economists from developing countries who have already
embarked on professional careers in the public sector. The curriculum requires courses in development
economics, macroeconomics, public finance, and econometrics. CDE fellows choose among other courses
in lecture, seminar, and tutorial formats. Course electives for 2008-2009 include the following: tax policy;
political economy; institutions and governance; finance and development; international trade; microfi-
nance; agriculture and development; developing country macroeconomics II; empirical methods in ma-
croeconomics; environmental policy and natural resource management; urbanization; international finan-
cial institutions; and the role of social safety nets. Williams undergraduates who satisfy course prerequi-
sites, with the consent of the individual instructor, are encouraged to take courses at the CDE.
Admission to the master's degree program is highly selective, with several hundred applicants each year
for approximately 25 places. Candidates normally have a B.A. or B.Sc. degree with honors in economics
or a related field, two or more years of relevant work experience, and an effective command of spoken and
written English. CDE fellows are often nominated for the program by public agencies from which they
will be on leave.
More information is available on the CDE website, www.williams.edu/cde. All communications relat-
ing to the degree of Master of Arts in Policy Economics should be addressed to the CDE, Assistant Direc-
tor, 1065 Main Street, Williams College, Williamstown, MA 01267, or e-mail cde@williams.edu.
Master of Arts in the History of Art
In cooperation with the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute, Williams College offers a two-year
course of study leading to the degree of Master of Arts in the History of Art. The objective of the program
is to offer to a small number of students a thorough professional preparation for careers in teaching and
museums, and to enable them to pursue further research whether independently or at other institutions of-
fering higher degrees. The curriculum consists of seminars in art historical subjects and an intensive study
of foreign languages in the context of the general literature of art. Problems of criticism, connoisseurship,
and conservation arising from the study of original works of art are fundamental to the program, and op-
portunities are provided for practical experience in museum work at The Clark, the Williams College Mu-
seum of Art, and the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art. The study of primary materials is fur-
ther extended by field trips to other collections. The degree is normally awarded after two years of resident
graduate study. To earn the degree, students must take ten courses, of which at least six must be graduate
seminars (including ARTH 504). In connection with the preparation of a paper for the Graduate Sympo-
sium, students will register for an eleventh course (ARTH 509), to be graded pass/fail, in their fourth se-
mester. Ademonstration of proficiency in reading two foreign languages is required. Of these two, German
is required, and French is recommended. In January of the first year, students participate in a European
study trip with selected faculty; in January of the second year, students must complete a Qualifying Paper.
In addition to all course work, students must, at the end of the second year, present a shortened version of
the Qualifying Paper in a graduate symposium to be held on Commencement weekend. To enter the pro-
gram a successful applicant must have been awarded the degree of Bachelor of Arts or its equivalent from
an accredited institution. An undergraduate major in art is not required for acceptance to the program.
For further information, write: The Director, Graduate Program in the History of Art, Box 8, Williams-
town, Massachusetts 01267, telephone (413) 458-9545, or email gradart@williams.edu.

COURSE NUMBERING SYSTEM
Courses designated by a single number are semester courses.
Year courses are designated by an odd number and an even number joined by a hyphen; the work of the two
semesters constitutes an integral, indivisible course. Therefore, if a student does not pass the second half of a year-
long course, he or she forfeits credit for the first half and incurs a deficiency as a result of the forfeiture. Students
who register for a year course are required to do both semesters of that course within the same academic year.
In some departments, course numbers have special meanings that are explained in their listings.
The (F) or (S) following a course's number indicates the semester, fall or spring, in which the course will be
offered.
THESE SYMBOLS ARE USED IN DEPARTMENTAL MASTHEADS TO INDICATE

HONORS PROGRAM IN AFRICANA STUDIES
A candidate for honors in Africana Studies must maintain at least a B+ average in the concentration and be
admitted to candidacy by the program faculty. In addition to the five courses normally required for the concentra-
tion, an honors candidate will enroll in either AFR 491 or 492 plus a Winter Study in his or her senior year, in order
to complete a substantial written thesis or an equivalent project in the performing or studio arts. A student wishing
to become a candidate for honors in Africana Studies should secure a faculty sponsor and inform the program
chair in writing before spring registration of her/his junior year.
An honors project should demonstrate creativity, depth, and intellectual rigor. A candidate for honors is encour-
aged to pursue non-traditional projects, such as presentations in the performing arts, visual arts, or creative writing,
as well as more conventional research projects. The advisor will evaluate the honors project, and the program
faculty will then decide whether to confer honors.
STUDY ABROAD
The curricular impact on potential majors of studying abroad in the junior year would be positive if students
chose to study in countries that reflect the Africana diaspora.

This course will serve as an introduction to postcolonial African literatures, and it organizes a set of African nov-
els, essays, and poetry around the concept of revolution. In this course, we will attend to fiction that address pre-
revolutionary, revolutionary, and post-revolutionary moments in various African societies. In addition to represen-
tations of social/political revolutions (decolonization, civil war, feminism, etc.), this course will also consider liter-
ary ones (realism, postmodernism, etc.). In doing so, we will consider a variety of questions: What is "revolution-
ary" literature? To what extent can a literary form be political/revolutionary? What is the relationship between
politics and aesthetics? Readings will likely include selections from among Ngugi wa Thiong'o, Njabulo Ndebele,
Ama Ata Aidoo, Bessie Head, Nuruddin Farah, Ayi Kwei Armah, Dambudzo Marechera, and Tsitsi Dangaremb-
ga.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based upon attendance and participation, reading responses, class
presentations, one midterm essay, and one final research paper.

AFR 160(S) Defining the African Diaspora (Same as Comparative Literature 214 and English
251)
What is the "African diaspora"? How are we to understand the nature of black belonging? Are the relationships
across the African diaspora mutable? What factors facilitate or complicate black identity over time and space?
This introductory course will take up these questions by turning to (a) key figures and essays and (b) the fiction,
poetry, and film from across the black world. To help better understand the conditions of transnational black identi-
ty, we will turn to the work of W.E.B. Du Bois, Kwame Nkrumah, Amie Cesaire, Paule Marshall, Toni Cade
Bambara, Marcus Garvey, Frantz Fanon, Caryl Phillips, and Julie Dash, among others. In the process, we will take
up defining cultural and political movements that have emerged over the years: Pan-Africanism, Negritude, and
other forms of black internationalism.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based upon attendance and participation, two exams, and two es-
says.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20 (expected: 15). Preference given to (potential) concentrators in Africana
Studies.

AFR 180(F) Foundations of Afro-Caribbean Thought (Same as Political Science 206)
This course is an introduction to the foundations of Afro-Caribbean thought, a branch of study within the larger
field of Africana thought. Africana thought encompasses ideas from Africa, the Caribbean, North America, and
other regions containing African Diasporic populations. In this class, we will examine the contours of the Afro-
Caribbean intellectual and political tradition by analyzing important historical figures and movements, the African
philosophical roots of the tradition, processes of enslavement and creolization, identity formation, nationalism,
anti-colonialism, the role of gender, and the function of mass revolution. We will discuss in particular two influen-
tial branches of thought outlined by Paget Henry in the seminal text Caliban's Reason: the poeticists and the histor-
icists. Afro-Caribbean thought distinguishes itself not only by its unique categories of poetic and historical knowl-
edge production, but also by the collapse of barriers between poetics and history in the domain of politics. Evaluat-
ing the moments of tension and symbiosis between the poeticist and historicst schools will allow us to investigate
further the tradition comprehensively. A key objective of the course is to provide students with the necessary prep-
aration to engage in higher level courses in this field of inquiry.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based upon attendance and participation, one 5- to 7-page midterm
essay, class presentation, and one 10- to 12-page final paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 25. Preference given to first- and second-year students.

200-Level Courses
AFR 200(F) Introduction to Africana Studies
This course serves as an introduction to Africana studies and interrogates this interdisciplinary field of inquiry. It is
required for concentrators but open to all students. We will examine the representation, arts and culture, politics
activism, and history of black peoples in the United States, Caribbean, Latin America, and Africa. In addition to
drawing upon key historical, literary and theoretical texts in Africana Studies, the class will incorporate lectures
from core and affiliated faculty to address issues such as the black arts movement and Africana music; democracy
and captivity in the United States; feminism, gender, and sexuality; black radicalism in the Americas; and identity,
class, and race in Latin America and the Caribbean. Accompanying texts will include documentary and feature
films, essays, novels, critical and theoretical studies.
Format: lecture. Visits from other Africana Studies faculty will be interspersed. Evaluations will be based upon
two 4- to 6-page papers, 2 exams, and a final project.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 30 (expected: 25). Preference given to (potential) concentrators in Africana
Studies.
Hour: 11:20-12:35 TR ROBOLIN
AFR 200(S) Introduction to Africana Studies
This survey course introduces students to the content and contours of Africana Studies as a field of study-- its
genealogy, development, and future challenges. The course focuses on historic and contemporary experiences of
African-descended peoples in the Americas, particularly the United States, the Caribbean, and Latin America. We
will also give some attention to how members of the Diaspora remember and encounter Africa, and to how Afri-
cans respond to the history of enslavement, colonialism, apartheid, racism and globalization. In addition to litera-
ture and research, film, music, photography, and artwork will be used to develop a critical understanding of the
African Diaspora. These non-written texts will make abstract readings come to life while stimulating the develop-
ment of critical thinking skills. Students are encouraged to draw connections between these visual/audio represen-
tations and the ideas and issues that we uncover from course readings.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based upon two 3- to 5-page papers, midterm exam, and final anno-
tated bibliography/or research proposal.
No prerequisites. No enrollment limit (expected 30). Open to all.

American society. The goal of this 200-level course is to explore issues of race and ethnicity in American educa-
tion. We will investigate issues facing racial and ethnic minorities such as school and residential segregation, aca-
demic tracking, language isolation, and family/peer group influences. Students will be asked to consider the ways
in which schools alleviate or reproduce racial inequality, and how schools reproduce advantage and social privi-
lege.

AFR 245(F) Monk and the Bebop Revolution (Same as Music 242)
Pianist, Thelonious Monk, called the "high priest of BeBop," is one of the key figures in this movement that is the
basis of all modern jazz. His music is rooted in earlier jazz styles but his genius has given us music that is unique
and meaningful to this day. In the early 1940's he and Charlie "Yardbird" Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, Bud Powell,
Max Roach and a thriving community of young, innovative musicians in New York developed this new style in
places like Minton's Playhouse in Harlem. They inspired a generation of musicians who continued their legacy
and became iconic figures in the jazz world including Miles Davis, Sonny Rollins, Charles Mingus, The Modern
Jazz Quartet, Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers. "Cool Jazz," "Hard Bop," and even "Free Jazz" and the Avante
Garde of the 1960's emerged from the creative landscape that BeBop nurtured. This immense influence reached
beyond music and into poetry and the arts. The Beat poet Jack Kerouac idealized "Bird" and African-American
poetry has been influenced by jazz from Langston Hughes to Amiri Baraka until today. BeBop and its offshoots
developed alongside the post-war Civil Rights movement. The give and take between the cultural and political
development of Black America is an important theme of this course-Jim Crow, integration, Civil Rights, Black
Power, self-expression, improvisation, artistic, and political freedom. Readings include essays and poetry that il-
lustrate these influences as well as biographies of the major artists. With the introduction of any innovative art
form, there can be an expected backlash from the previous generation. We will read critical writings and reviews
from the period that give us a better idea of the impact of this movement including essays by Ralph Ellison. Listen-
ing will include jazz: weekly listening and reading assignments-with a written journal, two short papers and one
end of semester 8-10 page research paper, midterm listening/short answer exam. Musicians may choose to substi-
tute the research music from the 1930's until the present.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements paper for a creative project (i.e. musical composition, transcriptions
and/or performance or recording). Evaluation will also be based upon attendance and class participation.

AFR 302(S) Rastafari: Dread, Politics, Agency (Same as Political Science 234 and Religion 261)
The emergence of Rastafari in the twentieth-century marked a distinct phase in the theory and practice of political
agency. From its heretical roots in Jamaica, Garveyism, Ethiopianism, and Pan-Africanism, Rastafari has evolved
from a Caribbean theological movement to an international political actor. This course investigates the political
theory of Rastafari in order to develop intellectual resources for theorizing the concept of agency in contemporary
Africana thought and political theory. We will analyze texts and audio-visual works on the political economy of
late colonial Jamaica, core Rastafari thinking, political theology, the role of reggae music, the notion of agency,
and the influence of Rastafari on global politics.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based upon one 5- to 7-page midterm essay, a group lyrics and politics project,
and one 10- to 12-page final exam.

AFR 305(F) The Hip-Hop Generation: Power, Identity, and Social Change (Same as Sociology

This 300-level course investigates the social, cultural, and political dynamics of the hip-hop generation. Hip-hop is
used to frame the analysis of U.S. and urban "social problems" since the late 1970s. First, students will be asked to
consider the larger structural forces that have given rise to hip-hop including economic dislocation, discrimination,
the drug economy, and mass incarceration. Second, the course will use hip-hop as a critical framework for explor-
ing how popular/youth culture (re)produces and (re)defines cultural assumptions about race-ethnicity, gender and
sexuality, and social class. Drawing on social interactionist and dramaturgical theory, we will examine how hip-
hop facilitates and defines how we understand and "perform" these social identities. Third, students will be chal-
lenged to consider how popular identity and culture might facilitate or hinder social change. Combining ideas
from theories of social movements, we will explore how hip-hop can be used to resist and challenge inequality,
"speak truth to power," and enact social change. Scholarly and popular texts, film, hip-hop music, and original
student research projects will be used to gain a comprehensive understanding of these social issues.
Format: seminar/research practicum. Requirements: Students will maintain a critical listening journal throughout
the semester; Final research paper and formal presentation of findings.

This course explores the historic and contemporary dynamics of the African American family in U.S. society. We
shall begin by analyzing how the trans-Atlantic slave trade and Jim Crow created, altered, transported, and/or
strengthened black families. The course proceeds to consider more contemporary sociological topics including
gender roles, divorce and marriage dissolution, sexuality and love, mate selection, parenting and fatherhood, and
the well-being of black children. We will pay special attention to how black families are imagined in popular cul-
ture, including representations in the news, film, and literature. The overall goal of this course is to highlight the
resiliency of African American families.
Format: seminar/discussion. Evaluation will be based upon a series of short response papers, midterm exam, and

AFR 400(F) Race, Gender, Space (Capstone Seminar) (Same as Comparative Literature 369,
English 365, and Women's and Gender Studies 400)
Physical or symbolic manipulation of space is one mode through which power operates, one manner in which
power is exercised and experienced. Historically and currently, space has been divided and resources have been
unevenly distributed along numerous axes. Thus, we are left with a constellation of dubiously constructed but
nonetheless segregated spaces: public vs. private, male vs. female, white vs. black, native vs. immigrant, rich vs.
poor, Christian vs. heathen (even Protestant vs. Catholic), and straight vs. queer sexuality. In this senior seminar,
we will examine the ways in which power is enacted, experienced, and resisted through space. In particular, we
will investigate the role of space in the creation of raced and gendered identities. Also, because the political and
social manipulation of space is not the exclusive prerogative of the empowered, we will consider ways that resist-
ing communities have sought to negotiate, redesign, or redefine space-or even transgress constrictive physical or
social boundaries. Finally, we will inquire into the complex politics involved in attempts to establish alternative
spaces of relative autonomy beyond the rules or the space of dominant culture. Likely texts include but are not
limited to: Henri LeFebvre's The Production of Space, McKittrick and Woods' Black Geographies, Toni Morri-
son's Paradise, Phanswane Mpe's Welcome to Our Hillbrow, essays by Morrison, Michel de Certeau, Neil Smith,
bell hooks, David Harvey, Sarah Mills, among others.
Format: seminar. Evaluations will be based upon: attendance and class discussion, regular short writing assign-
ments, presentations, final projects, and one seminar paper.

Martinican psychiatrist, philosopher, and revolutionary Frantz Fanon was among the leading critical theorists and
Africana thinkers of the twentieth-century. Fanon ushered in the decolonial turn in critical theory, a move calling
on those both within and outside of Europe to challenge the coloniality of the age and to forge a new vision of
politics in the postcolonial period. This course is an advanced seminar devoted to a comprehensive examination of
Fanon's political thought. We will begin with an analysis of primary texts by Fanon and end by considering how
Fanon has been interpreted by his contemporaries as well as activists and critical theorists writing today.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based upon attendance and participation, a class presentation (oral and written
components), and one 25-page final research paper.
Enrollment limit: 14. This seminar is open to all seniors, but priority will be given to Africana Studies concentra-
tors.

GENERAL PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The American Studies Program, an eleven-course major, uses interdisciplinary approaches to develop students'
understanding of the complexity of the culture(s) usually labeled "American." Examining history, literature, visual
media, performance, and other forms of expression, we explore the processes of cultural definition as contested by
diverse individuals and groups. We ask new questions about aspects of American life long taken for granted; we
also use American culture as a laboratory for testing classic and contemporary theories about how cultures work.
NON-MAJORS, FIRST-YEAR STUDENTS, AND SOPHOMORES
American Studies 201 is open to non-majors including first-year students. All elective courses are open to stu-
dents who meet the requirements of the departments that sponsor those courses. Courses designated as junior or
senior seminars are open to non-majors with permission of the instructor.
RATIONALE FOR COURSE NUMBERING
In addition to an occasional 100-level topical course, the introductory course is offered at the 200 level to sug-
gest the desirability of some preliminary training in college-level history, literature, sociology, or political science.
The intermediate courses, designated as Junior Seminars at the 300 level, are offered primarily for juniors, al-
though they are open to sophomores who have had 201 and will be away from campus during the spring of their
junior year. 400-level courses designated as Senior Seminars are designed for senior majors.
THE MAJOR
Required major courses:
American Studies 201
300 level courses designated Junior Seminar
400 level courses designated Senior Seminar
Elective courses:
Eight courses: five should be chosen from one of the specializations listed below, the other three chosen
from among any of the electives listed, but students must draw their remaining courses from two of the
other specializations. Students are also required to take at least one course covering pre-1900 American
history or culture.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN AMERICAN STUDIES
Candidates for honors in American Studies will undertake a substantial, year-long independent project during
their Senior year. Applicants should have a consistent record of high achievement in courses taken for the major,
and normally will have done work in the field of study of their proposed thesis. Students who wish to write or
produce an honors project should consult with a prospective faculty advisor in their junior year. Formal application
to pursue honors should be made by the time of spring registration in the junior year. Students must submit a 1- to
2-page preliminary proposal describing the proposed project to the Chair of the American Studies Program at this
time. Final admission to the honors thesis program will depend on the AMST advisory committee's assessment of
the qualifications of the student and the merits and feasibility of the project. If the proposal is approved, they will
be permitted to register for AMST 491, W30, and AMST 492 the following year. The completed project is due in
mid-April. Each student will present a short oral presentation of his or her thesis at the end of spring semester.
Honors Theses count as one of the eleven courses required for the major.
ADVISING
All majors will be assigned a faculty advisor. Majors must meet with their advisor during the first week of
classes during the fall semester and at the time of the spring semester registration period in order to have their
courses and plans for the American Studies major approved. Both majors and non- majors are encouraged to talk
at any time with the program chair or other affiliated faculty about the major.
AMERICAN STUDIES AND OTHER PROGRAMS
Students majoring in American Studies are encouraged to consider pursuing concentrations in Africana Stud-
ies, Environmental Studies, Latina/o Studies, Performance Studies, and Women's and Gender Studies. Many of
the courses counted for those concentrations may also earn credit toward the American Studies major.
STUDY AWAY FROM WILLIAMS
We encourage students to pursue cross-cultural comparative studies. A major in American Studies can be com-
bined with study away from Williams for a semester or a year if plans are made carefully. Many courses that will
be approved for College credit may also count toward the American Studies major if their subject matter is Ameri-
can culture.
Students planning to be away in the junior year should have taken American Studies 201 before they leave;
those away for junior-year spring term should take a Junior Seminar in their sophomore year. Students should
consult as early as possible with the chair or their advisor about their plans for fulfilling the requirements of the
major.

AMST 201(F,S) Introduction to American Studies (D)
To be an "American" means something more than U.S. citizenship. In this course, we focus on the problems and
possibilities of American identity. Access to Americanness is shaped by factors such as class, race, ethnicity, gen-
der, sexuality, religion, and region--categories which themselves change in meaning over time. Given the geo-
graphical, racial, and cultural diversity of the United States, the ways in which Americans imagine nation inevita-
bly vary over time, according to place, and among different individuals and groups. Rather than a survey of any
one aspect or period of American history, literature, or popular culture, this course is an introduction to the interdis-
ciplinary field of American Studies, a field defined both by the range of texts we read (essays, novels, autobiogra-
phies, photographs, films, music, architecture, historical documents, legal texts), and by the questions we ask of
them: How have different Americans imagined what it means to be an American? What ideas about national his-
tory, patriotism, and moral character shape their visions of Americanness? How do the educational system, mass
media, government policies regarding citizenship and immigration shape American identities? How are bound-
aries of inclusion and exclusion in the nation drawn? What uses have been made of the claim to an American
identity, and what is at stake in that claim? How have Americans imagined a national landscape, a national culture,
and to what ends?
Format: discussion. Evaluation will be based on a series of short critical essays and a group project.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 25 per section (expected: 25 per section). Preference given to sophomores and

AMST 302(F) The United States and the Pacific (Junior Seminar)
The history and culture of the United States cannot be thought of separately from those of Asia and the Pacific.
From the "City on the Hill" to Manifest Destiny and beyond, the momentum of expansion into the Pacific has
catalyzed culture and politics in the U.S. This course examines the intertwined histories of the U.S. and the Pacific,
focusing on regions, nations, and empires. We will explore the ways that these regions constituted each other over
the course of their shared history, with an aim towards understanding the history of the U.S. as part of a larger
history of the world. Through economic, diplomatic, military, cultural, and community histories, we will consider
encounters and contestations between the U.S. and the Pacific, to explore the shifting, contradictory emergence of
ideas and conceptions of "America."
Format: seminar/discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, weekly response papers, a cumulative

Critics reading minority writing often focus on its thematic--i.e., sociological-content. Such literature is usually
presumed to be inseparable from the "identity"/body of the writer and read as autobiographical, ethnographic,
representational, exotic. At the other end of the spectrum, avant-garde writing is seen to concern itself "purely"
with formal questions, divorced from the socio-historical (and certainly not sullied by the taint of race). In the
critical realm we currently inhabit, in which "race" is opposed to the "avant-garde," an experimental minority
writer can indeed seem an oxymoron. In this class we will closely read recent work by Asian American, African
American, Native American and Latino/a writers which challenges preconceptions about ethnic literature, avant-
garde writing, genre categorization, among other things. The writing done by these mostly young, mostly urban,
poets and fiction writers is some of the most exciting being written in the United States today; their texts push the
boundaries of aesthetic form while simultaneously engaging questions of culture, politics, and history. Reading
them forces us to re-think our received notions about literature. Authors to be read include Renee Gladman, John
Keene, Ed Roberson, Amiri Baraka, Linh Dinh, Bhanu Kapil, Charles Yu, Paola Javier, James Thomas Stevens,
and Edwin Torres.
Format: seminar/discussion. Evaluation will be based on either one 16- to 18-page seminar paper or two shorter

AMST 405(S) Home and Belonging: Comparative Explorations of Displacements, Relocations,
and Place-Making (Same as Latina/o Studies 405) (Senior Seminar) (W) (D)
The metaphor of "home" and idea of "belonging" bring insight to theories and investigations centered on commu-
nity building and identity formation within and across national borders. These constructions give us an indication
of what people value, what is worth fighting for, as well as what is considered expendable. Our objective in this
course is to interrogate constructions of home and belonging by studying how individuals, communities, and na-
tions are transformed by experiences of dislocation, migration, and renewed place-making. What are the ways a
sense of belonging shapes these identities and the investments made in these formations? Working with ethnogra-
phy, history, memoir, literature, critical essays, and documentary film, we will consider the personal and political
uses and meanings of memory, nostalgia, and imagination in "rooting" migrating subjects in place and time.
Among the many case studies we will examine are the politics of homeland among Cuban-Americans, Native
American and West Indian festive forms, and place-claiming and racial sincerity among African Americans. This
course explores the experiences and expressions of racialized populations in the United States, focusing on the
myriad ways in which they confront, negotiate, and at times challenge dominant U.S. hierarchies of race, culture,
gender and class.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class participation, annotated bibliography, short essay, writing
workshop participation (and related assignments), research paper related assignments, and a final research paper
and presentation.
Prerequisites: Prior courses in Latino Studies, American Studies, or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 19

AMST 465T(F) Two American Public Intellectuals: Noam Chomsky and Edward Said (Same as
English 367T) (W)
Course description: The "public intellectual"--privileged over and against the "ivory tower" intellectual--has
been touted by both the American right and the left and his decline or demise decried on a regular basis. In the
United States, with its history of anti-intellectualism, few thinkers have made a mark in their academic disciplines
and also intervened significantly in public discourses. This tutorial will interrogate the role of the intellectual in
society by examining the work of two major American public (and politically active) intellectuals: Edward Said
(1935-2005) and Noam Chomsky (b. 1928). Said, a Columbia University English professor was one of the major
literary critics of the last century, the inaugurator of the field of postcolonial studies (with his 1978 text Oriental-
ism), and an advocate for Palestinian rights. Chomsky, the son of a Hebrew scholar, is a pioneer in the field of
linguistics (he founded the theory of generative grammar and taught at MIT for many years) and, since his work in
the anti-Vietnam-War movement, has been a highly vocal critic of various forms of hegemonic power. He has
been voted the "world's top public intellectual" by one poll and is the most widely cited living scholar in the hu-
manities and social sciences. We will focus on a few major issues on which Chomsky and Said shared deep con-
cerns: ideologies within the academy and society at large, media representations, Palestinians and the Middle East,

9/11, U.S. global dominance, and the role of the intellectual in society. Said and Chomsky were largely in agree-
ment ideologically, but we will also discuss their differences and read criticisms of their ideas.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: 5-page analytical paper every other week and a critical commentary on the tutorial
partner's paper in alternate weeks.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Open to all students, preference at instructor's discretion.

SPECIALIZATION FIELDS
To provide focus for work in the major, each student will choose one of the Specialization Fields listed below
and record this choice when registering for the major. (This commitment can be revised, in consultation with the
chair.) At least five electives will be taken from among those designated to support a specialization field. In ex-
traordinary cases, students who wish to do so may be permitted to design their own specialization field. All such
arrangements must be approved by the American Studies Advisory Committee.
ARTS IN CONTEXT
This specialization is for students interested in American arts, literature and media. Its approaches are interdis-
ciplinary: it trains students to examine cultural artifacts with attention to aesthetic form and to the contexts--his-
torical, social, political--that determine and situate those forms. Broadly, it asks how history has shaped the arts
and media and how the arts and media have shaped how we think and who we are. Students in this specialization
take courses across a range of genres and media: poetry, fiction, music, film and video, pop culture, visual culture,
performance, experimental and activist art.
Elective courses:

COMPARATIVE STUDIES IN RACE, ETHNICITY, AND DIASPORA
This interdisciplinary specialization examines the role of race, ethnicity, and diasporic movements in the
construction of American identities. Students explore how experiences and concepts of race and ethnicity are
transformed through the processes of diaspora and immigration. These courses may encompass a broad spectrum
of fields such as history, literature, religion, politics, anthropology, gender studies, media and the performing arts,
among others. NOTE: Concentrators in this area are required to take a combination of courses that will allow them
to comparatively assess the experiences of at least two ethno-racial groups in the Americas.

The Department of Anthropology and Sociology at Williams aims to help students achieve an integrated under-
standing of biography, history, culture, and social structure in both traditional and modern societies.
Anthropology explores the full range of human experience by introducing students to the study of tribal and
peasant societies, especially those on the periphery of the West, as well as to the cultural complexities of stratified,
industrial societies such as our own. Integrated with the study of specific peoples is an examination of the various
analytical schemes anthropologists have developed to understand them. Courses offered in the department repre-
sent two of Anthropology's major subfields: sociocultural anthropology--that is, the comparative study of human
social life, institutions, and beliefs--and archaeology, the study of the origins and lifeways of prehistoric peoples.
Sociology studies the social and institutional intricacies of modern industrial societies and the social psycholog-
ical dilemmas facing the individual in our epoch. Sociology courses introduce students to classical and contempo-
rary social thought about men and women and society, to the systematic analysis of social institutions and social
interaction, and to the social analysis of modern culture. The Sociology major at Williams emphasizes the human-
istic tradition of sociology, stressing qualitative approaches to understanding how social reality is constructed.
MAJORS
The department offers separate majors in both Anthropology and Sociology, with a broad and diverse array of
courses in both disciplines. The department is committed, however, to the unity of the social sciences. To this end,
Anthropology and Sociology offer joint core courses in methodology and theory, as well as several elective
courses in common. All joint courses are designated "ANSO."
Requirements
For the degree in Anthropology or Sociology, students must complete a minimum of nine courses as outlined
below:
(1) Core Courses. Majors in both disciplines must take a sequence of four core courses. Three of these are
joint (ANSO) courses. The sequences are:
Anthropology Joint (ANSO) Sociology
ANTH 101 The Scope SOC 101 Invitation to
of Anthropology Sociology
ANSO 205
Ways of Knowing
ANSO 305
Social Theory
ANSO 402
Senior Seminar
(2) Elective Courses. Majors in Anthropology or Sociology must take five elective courses from the course
listings of their respective disciplines or from the joint ANSO listings. Two of the courses chosen are nor-
mally at the 300 level or above. In close consultation with their departmental advisors, students may take
some selected courses from other disciplines to fulfill major requirements in either Anthropology or So-
ciology.
(3) Majors in each wing of the department are allowed to count up to two courses in the other wing towards
fulfillment of their major requirements.
STATISTICS AND DATA ANALYSIS
In addition to the nine total courses required for the major, it is recommended that Anthropology and Sociology
majors take Statistics 101 or a comparable course in statistics and data analysis.
AREA STUDIES CONCENTRATION
Students who wish to combine a major in Anthropology or Sociology with an Area Studies concentration are
encouraged to do so. Courses taken to satisfy an Area Studies requirement may be counted toward the major with
prior approval of a student's departmental advisor. The only exception to this rule is the Area Studies senior semi-
nar, which cannot ordinarily be counted toward the Anthropology or Sociology degree.
LANGUAGE STUDY, STUDY ABROAD, AND WINTER STUDY
Departmental advisors will help interested students integrate a major with study abroad, foreign language study,
or field research during the winter study period. The department encourages Williams students to take advantage
of established foreign study programs in Egypt, Japan, India, Hong Kong, and other countries. Because some for-
eign study programs do not offer courses that can be counted toward the Anthropology or Sociology degrees,
however, sophomores planning to study abroad in junior year must consult with the departmental advisor before
declaring a major.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN ANTHROPOLOGY OR SOCIOLOGY
Honors and highest honors are normally awarded for the completion of a year-long research project that has
resulted in an original thesis of high quality. Students wishing to write an honors thesis should engage a member of
the department faculty as a Thesis Advisor as soon as possible and must submit a proposal for the thesis for depart-
Anthropology and Sociology
­ 60 ­
ment approval no later than preregistration in the spring of the junior year. If the proposal is approved, they will be
permitted to register for Anthropology and Sociology 493-W31-494, during which they will write and defend a
thesis. If their overall work in the major continues to be of high quality and the thesis is deemed of a similar quality,
they may be awarded honors or highest honors in Anthropology or Sociology.
ANTHROPOLOGY / SOCIOLOGY COURSES
JOINT CORE COURSES
ANSO 205(S) Ways of Knowing
This class is an exploration of how one makes sense of the social world through fieldwork. Some of the key ques-
tions of the course are: What are the philosophical and epistemological underpinnings of social inquiry? How does
one frame intellectual problems and go about collecting, sifting, and assessing field materials? What sets social
reality apart from nature, and what implications does this difference have for our study of society? What are the
uses and limits of statistical data? What is the importance of history to sociological and anthropological research?
How can one use archival and other documentary materials to enrich ethnographic research? What are the empiri-
cal limits to interpretation? What is the relationship between empirical data and the generation of social theory?
How does the social organization of social research affect one's inquiry? What are the typical ethical dilemmas of
fieldwork and of other kinds of social research? How do researchers' personal biographies and values shape their
work? We will approach these problems concretely rather than abstractly through a series of case studies, drawing
upon the field experiences of departmental faculty and visitors who represent a variety of research methods and
disciplinary perspectives.
Format: seminar. Requirements: a series of short papers and a take-home final exam.
Prerequisites: Anthropology 101 or Sociology 101 or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 25 (expected: 25).
Hour: 1:10-3:50 W SHEVCHENKO
ANSO 305(F) Social Theory
An introduction to social theory in anthropology and sociology, with strong emphasis on enduring works by major
thinkers--Marx, Weber, Durkheim, and Freud, among others--who have shaped views of society in the West and
beyond. Several key questions inform exploration of these works: What are the historical roots and principal at-
tributes of modernity? From the perspective of modernity, how do social theorists understand "the primitive"? Do
society and culture have organizing rules? What role does human agency play in the unfolding of social life? What
are the possibilities and limits of scientific approaches to the study of human social experience? In considering
such questions, we will reconstruct the intellectual and social histories of both disciplines, examining in particular
how they abandoned common ground and language, with sociologists gravitating toward paradigms of scientific
predictability and anthropologists toward relativistic frameworks of interpretation. Finally, we will examine the
migration of ideas from anthropology and sociology to other disciplines and back again. The course emphasizes
major differences between interpretive frameworks as well as common elements that contribute to a deeper under-
standing of the social world.
Format: seminar. Requirements: three 5- to 7-page essays.
Prerequisites: Anthropology 101 or Sociology 101 and ANSO 205 or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit:
25 (expected: 15).
Hour: 8:30-9:45 TR M. F. BROWN
ANSO 402(S) Senior Seminar (Same as Anthropology 402 and Sociology 402)
This capstone seminar combines intensive discussion and individual research. The first half of the semester will be
dedicated to the discussion of a social issue central to the concerns of both anthropology and sociology. The class
will meet with the instructor in spring 2008 to decide on that topic. Then, in the second half of the semester, stu-
dents will pursue independent, original projects and produce a major term paper. Toward the end of the semester,
students will present their projects to the seminar. Students who are not senior majors in anthropology or sociology
are admitted to this course only on the instructor's permission.
Format: seminar. Requirements: full participation, major research project and paper, class presentation.
Prerequisites: senior Anthropology and Sociology majors or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 18 (ex-
pected: 15).

ANTHROPOLOGY COURSES
ANTH 101(F,S) The Scope of Anthropology (D)
Is there such a thing as "human nature"? Why have human societies developed such a bewildering range of cus-
toms to deal with problems common to people everywhere? This course addresses these questions by introducing
students to the comparative study of human social life and culture. Topics surveyed in the course include econom-
ics, language and thought, kinship and marriage, law and politics, and the wide variations in human belief systems,
including religions. The course also considers the ways that anthropology, a discipline that was until recently prac-
ticed almost exclusively by Westerners, approaches other societies in search of insights on our own customs and
values. Ethnographic descriptions of both "simple" tribal societies and complex modern ones are a prominent part
of the readings. This course explores differences and similarities between cultures and societies and ways in which
they have interacted and responded to one another in the past.

ANTH 103(S) Pyramids, Bones, and Sherds: What is Archaeology?
Anthropology examines not only living societies, but also prehistoric cultures whose remains are found world-
wide. This course will present how archaeology examines the various aspects of human society from the physical
record of prehistory. How do we study the subsistence and settlement patterns, the political and social
organization, and the economy and ideology of prehistoric societies who have left behind mute material records?
The objective of anthropological archaeology is to bring to life these prehistoric cultures through archaeological
analysis. The different goals, approaches and methodologies of modern archaeology will be discussed
theoretically and then applied to case studies.

Over the centuries, philosophers and historians have asked how societies evolved from simple hunter-gatherer
bands to complex urban civilizations. Human prehistory and history have shown the repeated cycles of the rise,
expansion and collapse of early civilizations in both the Old and New World. What do the similarities and differ-
ences in the development of these first civilizations tell us about the nature of societal change, civilization and the
state, and human society itself? The course will examine these issues through an introductory survey of the earliest
civilizations in Mesopotamia, Egypt, India, Mesoamerica and South America. Classical and modern theories on
the nature, origin, and development of the state will be reviewed in light of the archaeological evidence.

tices across the globe? This course seeks to examine the myriad ways that societies police the range of practices
surrounding reproduction---including fertility, conception, pregnancy, birth, abortion, and motherhood. The class
will pursue a comparative analysis of reproduction across major cultures and religions, as well as a deeper under-
standing of specialized topics such as the new reproductive technologies, the medicalization and ritualization of
obstetrics in America, the continuing controversies over abortion across the globe, and the fracas over motherhood
in the US popularly dubbed the 'Mommy Wars'. Throughout the course, we remain focused on the cultural, social,
and medical construction of birth and reproduction more generally. To this end, we explore the varying ritual and
medical practices that surround birth in different cultural contexts, from high tech to low tech settings and soci-
eties. We will deconstruct the process of human reproduction through readings culled from a variety of cultures
and disciplines including anthropology, medicine, religious studies, sociology, and women's studies. By the end of
the course, we will appreciate how and why reproduction in such a contentious issue today.

ANTH 328T(S) Emotions and the Self (W)
Everyone everywhere experiences emotions, and everyone everywhere is faced with the task of conceptualizing a
self-hood and its place in the social world. This course analyzes a variety of recent attempts in the social sciences
to come to grips with topics that have long been avoided: the nature of the interior experience and an epistemolog-
ical framework for its cross-cultural comparison. Exploring the borderlands between anthropology, sociology, and
psychology, we will bring the tools of ethnographic analysis to bear on central pan-human concepts: emotions and
the self. By examining these phenomena as they occur in other cultures, we will be better placed to apprehend and
challenge the implicit (and often unconsciously held) assumptions about emotions and the self in our own culture,
both in daily life and in academic psychological theory. What are emotions? Are they things--neuro-physiologi-
cal states--or ideas--sociocultural constructions? How are they to be described; compared? What is the self?
How are selves constructed and constituted? How do various cultures respond to categories of emotion and self,
and how can we develop a sense of the relationship between self and emotion?

ANTH 331(S) Witchcraft, Sorcery, and Magic
Beliefs in magic, malign and otherwise, have been nearly universal in human experience. This course examines
these beliefs in an attempt to understand their cognitive basis, symbolic effectiveness, and social consequences. In
particular we will approach the question of "magical thinking": is magical thought "mistaken science" or a univer-
sal non-rational way of seeing the world? What does the fact of presumably rational people holding apparently
irrational beliefs say about the whole idea of rationality? Are witches self-aware agents who believe in the malign
magic they practice, or are they innocent, marginalized victims of hegemonic powers? To answer these and other
questions we will draw on case studies from a broad range of ethnographic and historic sources, including Agua-
runa love magic, Azande oracles, Voodoo in Brooklyn, and witches in Renaissance Italy and twentieth-century
England.

How does a society define the moral life and by what means does it resolve the internal conflicts that inevitably
arise? These questions are approached through a survey of the anthropology of law in the broad sense, as con-
cerned not just with codified laws and formal institutions, but with all forms of dispute settlement and conflict
resolution, including mediation and arbitration. Taking an ethnographic and cross-cultural perspective, we will
examine the cultural construction of dispute, the nature of evidence, and the variety of processes by which disputes
can be resolved. We will further examine the relationship between the scale of a community and its legal mecha-
nisms, with particular attention to plural legal systems and the tension between customary and national law in
modernizing nations. Ultimately we will try to come to grips with the question of justice: its definition and the
means by which it may be achieved.

ceptualize and interact with nature. We will focus on movements which mobilize around environmental issues in
the non-Western world, whether they involve the management of natural resources, the protection of human
health, or the preservation of species, ecosystems, or wilderness. We will also examine what happens when people

ANTH 391(F) Insurgencies: Revolts, Revolutions, Wars of National Liberation, and Jihads
(Same as History 391 and INTR 391)
We often tend to think of warfare in the classic terms described by Clausewitz: states waging armed conflict
against other states using uniformed armed forces that are distinct from non-combatant civilian populations.
Throughout history, however, we may also encounter many instances of asymmetric conflict within states, colo-
nies, and other political entities, involving combatants who are often indistinguishable from the general population
and whose objectives are often unlike those of states: Peasant revolts, revolutions, wars of independence or nation-
al liberation, and other forms of resistance and civil insurgency pit the relatively weak against the power of the
state and may succeed because, to use Mao's metaphor, the insurgents move among the people like fish in water.
The close relationship between insurgent fighters and the supporting population makes the social structure, social
values, social institutions-in short, the culture-of the society particularly relevant to understanding the nature of a
given asymmetric conflict. In this course we will use theoretical and analytical concepts from anthropology, so-
ciology, history, and political philosophy to examine asymmetric conflicts of the twentieth century and the present
day. The course will be divided into three parts: in the first we will explore some of the theoretical literature on
violence and warfare as well as some of the basic literature on tribal and peasant society, peasant revolts, wars of
national liberation, guerilla warfare, and insurgencies. The second part of the course will be devoted to presenta-
tions prepared by small groups of students on case studies, e.g., the Hukbalahap insurgency in the Philippines, the
communist revolutions of China, Cuba, and Malaysia, wars of national liberation such as those in Algeria and
Vietnam, and other ongoing civil conflicts such as the Palestinian intifadah and "ethnic cleansing" in the Balkans.
The final portion of the course is devoted to an in-depth study of Iraq following the American invasion and to a
consideration of the evolving nature of asymmetric conflict in a globalizing world.

SOC 202(S) Terrorism and National Security
An analysis of the roots, goals, and social organization of contemporary radical Islamist terrorism and of the state
efforts to defeat it. A focus on: the recruitment, training, and indoctrination of Islamist terrorists; their ideologies
and self-images; and case studies of specific terrorist attacks and the vulnerabilities of modern societies that such
attacks reveal. The course analyzes the exigencies and dilemmas of ensuring public safety in a democratic society.
Special attention to: the structure and ethos of intelligence work; the investigation of terrorist networks and their
financing; the relationship between organized and semi-organized crime and terrorism; the legal dilemmas of sur-
veillance, preemptive custody, and "extraordinary rendition" in democratic societies; and the technology and orga-
nization of ascertaining identities in modern society. The course also addresses the crisis facing European soci-
eties-particularly the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Germany- with growing popula-
tions of radical Islamist minorities who reject cultural assimilation into Western social or legal frameworks, a crisis
paralleled in the United States, with important differences, by widespread illegal immigration. An assessment of
the ideology of multiculturalism and its intended and unintended consequences in the fight against terror. The
course also examines the threat of terrorists' use of biological, chemical, and nuclear weapons of mass destruction
and the defenses against such threats. Finally, it appraises the structure and content of mass media coverage of
terrorism, as well as official and nonofficial propaganda on all sides of these issues. Experts in different fields will
give guest lectures throughout the course.

SOC 214T(F) Exploring the American Culture Wars (W)
In the early 1990s, the term "culture wars" entered the lexicon of American political discourse at the same time
that social scientists began using the concept to explain cultural division in contemporary American society. Pro-
ponents of the culture wars thesis discern deep and historically unprecedented fissures in the American cultural
and religious landscape. Critics of the thesis, however, argue that the divide is not nearly so polarized, that there is
instead relative harmony in American culture, and that America remains "one nation after all." In examining the
debate over the culture wars thesis, the course will engage a variety of questions: Is the notion of warfare a proper
metaphor to depict cultural conflict in contemporary American society? In what ways is the division between so-
called "red states" and "blue states" an electoral expression of the American culture wars? What are the historical
roots of contemporary cultural conflict? What, if any, are the international implications of the American culture
wars? In considering these questions, the course will situate the culture wars thesis within the sociological litera-
ture on religion and society and will examine a variety of cultural skirmishes in contemporary American society,
including disputes within such "fields of conflict" as the family, education, law, electoral politics, and the contested
role of religion in public life.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: students will meet in pairs with the instructor each week for one hour. One student

SOC 218(S) Law and Modern Society
This class is designed to introduce students to the field of law and society. The course begins with an overview of
the various theoretical perspectives on the subject, including Durkheimian, Marxist, Foucauldian, and Weberian
analyses of law and society; as well as the work of those following in the different theoretical schools established
by these scholars. Informed by the theoretical overview, the next part of the course considers empirical research in
selected areas of law, including tort law, criminal trial procedures, abortion and divorce law, "community justice,"
and the adjudication of drug offenses. Recognizing that understandings of our own legal practices are enlightened
through comparisons to other legal systems, the second half of the course is primarily historical/comparative in
focus. In this section, through an exploration of several case studies, American legal processes and habits are
compared with related legal practices in such places as England, Scotland, Ireland, Australia, Germany, Norway,
and Canada.

"This is obvious!" is what we say when we feel that our point is irrefutable. But images are far less obvious than
we may like to think. This course will create a forum for discussing the role of images in our lives, as well as the
role played by visual representations in sociological inquiry. It will explore the variety of ways in which images
can be used as diagnostics of society, develop skills for critical analysis of existing representations, and address the
limitations, as well as specific strengths that come with the study of signs and images. Topics for discussion in-
clude truth in photography, the problem of interpretation, different visual languages, the contributions of photogra-
phy, cinema, TV and digital technologies to changes in social relations, power in visual imagery, the appropriation
and redefinition of visual symbols in different contexts, the "visualization" of ethnic and national stereotypes, and
the dilemmas of representation. Primary sources for the discussions will be drawn from a variety of spheres, from
Soviet propaganda posters to Nike commercials, and will include the images we encounter in everyday life, me-
dia, politics, academia, `high' art and pop culture.

A sociological examination of how craft shapes consciousness. How and in what ways do work experiences shape

views? How do men and women in different occupations and professions establish criteria of validity and reliabil-
ity to assess their work experiences? How do they develop and internalize rules for discernment that enable them
to sort through multiple and always conflicting versions and representations of social reality? How do they make
moral judgments on complex business, political, and social issues? How and with what results do common work
experiences shape close-knit occupational communities in a modern society? The course will pay particular atten-
tion to the functionally interconnected but experientially disparate occupational worlds of great metropolises. The
course will host men and women from a wide range of occupations and professions--from police detectives to
policy analysts, journalists, filmmakers, artists, educators, attorneys, corporate executives, and scientists--to dis-

SOC 316(F) Consumer Society and Its Critics in the Modern World
In the age of Byron, to speak of consumption meant to refer to the tubercular disease. Today, the term "consumer
society" hardly requires explanation... or does it? This course will approach the notion of consumption and con-
sumerism from a critical sociological and historical vantage point. What do we mean, exactly, by "consumer soci-
ety," and are there non-consumer societies in the modern world? Why have both consumption and the critiques of
consumerism become so prominent in the 19th and 20th century, and how are they evolving today? What are the
philosophical and religious traditions that underlie the various takes on consumption? What interests, investments,
and ideologies are at stake in the debates about the "proper" way to consume? The course will draw on texts from
sociology, anthropology, history and geography, as well as on the analysis of mass media and film, in order to
discern the consistent themes and approaches to framing consumption, and to place them in wider debates about
the nature of modernity. We will explore money, fashion, advertising, tourism, shopping and culture-jamming in
places as varied as nineteenth-century France , postsocialist Hungary and contemporary America , critically ex-
amining how various groups grapple with consumer abundance and its effects on society. In doing so, we will pay
equal attention to the politics of consumption (the way in which seemingly free and independent consumption
choices play a role in the system of global capitalism) and to its symbolic element: the role of consumer practices
in creating and articulating identities, building relationships and creating solidarities.
Format: seminar. Requirements: Class participation, one small group presentation, consumption blog, annotated

SOC 368(F) Technology and Modern Society
With expanding access to and use of the internet, controversial developments in such biotechnical practices as the
cloning of mammals, rapid advances in various forms of telecommunication, and the increasing sophistication of
technological weaponry in the military, the triumph of technology remains a defining feature of modern life. For
the most part, modern humans remain unflinchingly confident in the possibilities technology holds for continuing
to improve the human condition. Indisputably, technology has benefited human life in innumerable ways. Howev-
er, as with other features of modernity, technology has also had significant, albeit largely unanticipated, social
consequences. Working within a sociological paradigm, this course will focus on the less often examined latent
functions of technology in modern society. It will consider, for example, the social effects of technology on com-
munity life, on privacy, and on how people learn, think, understand the world, communicate, and organize them-
selves. The course will also examine the effects of technology on medicine, business, education, and the military
and will consider such countercultural reactions to technology as the Luddite movement in early-nineteenth-cen-
tury England and the U.S. agrarian movements of the twentieth century.

as well as maintain them. The course will proceed through a series of intensive case studies with a particular focus
on propagandists themselves, considered as experts with symbols, and on the institutional milieux in which they
work. Among other examples, we will examine the U.S. Committee on Public Information during the First World
War; the Nazi Ministry of Propaganda; the propaganda machinery in contemporary states and non-state actors of
both the left and right, with special attention to the Middle East; conservative and liberal "public interest" groups;
propaganda in contemporary social movements and national political campaigns; the workings of corporate and
university personnel offices; and advertising and public relations agencies in the United States. Throughout the
course, we will analyze how the language, ideologies, and visual symbols of particular varieties of propaganda
seem to affect mass audiences.

ARAB 215(F) Topics in Modern Arab Culture: Twentieth-Century Debates
This course aims to give students an overview of contemporary Arab culture using a wide array of visual and
written materials. From Egypt to Algeria, Lebanon to Saudi Arabia, we will explore the major political and social
debates circulating in the region. Possible topics include but are not limited to the role of Islam, secularism and
radicalism, gender and sexuality, the issue of freedom of speech as it relates to broadcast and print journalism,
national identity, the presence of minorities in the region, and the issue of Palestine/Israel. Students will consider
these themes through an analysis of various media and cultural forms, such as films, documentaries, novels, plays,
short stories, photography, music, and cuisine. No prior knowledge of Arabic is required as all materials will be
read or viewed in translation. In addition, films will be screened outside of class on a bi-weekly basis prior to class
discussion.
Format: discussion/seminar. Evaluation will be based on attendance and active participation, periodic quizzes,
midterm and final exam, and a final presentation.

ARAB 216(S) Protest Literature: Arab Writing Across Three Continents (Same as Comparative
Literature 216)
This course will begin with an analysis of the idea of protest literature as it emerged in an American cultural con-
text in the early twentieth century through the civil rights movement of the 1960s. We will then seek to revisit the
meaning of this term today, particularly as it resonates in the cultural production of Arabs and Arab youth across
three very different locations: the Middle East (specifically Egypt and Palestine), France, and the United States.
How are these Arab youth subcultures constituted? In what ways has the globalization of hip-hop influenced the
literary, musical, and cinematic production of Arab artists? In what way do rap and the spoken word in these spe-
cific social contexts provide a vocabulary for expressing the violence, lack, and frustration pervasive in these 4th
World locations? In short, how has the contemporary American construction of "blackness" been exported and
appropriated by young Arabs today? From Paris to Cairo, from the West Bank to Detroit, we will examine the
varied strands of this new movement for social justice, observing how different forms of literature and music have
been used as a vehicle for resisting war-torn circumstances, poverty, racism and social disenfranchisement across
diverse national spaces. Texts for this course will include novels and poems, as well as a number of films and
selections of music. All of these works will be available in translation, although advanced students may read the
originals in French and/or Arabic. Possible novels include those of Charef, Sebbar, Smail, Begag, Chraibi, Ayaidi,
Golayyel, Latif, Kanafani, Darwish, Youssef, Hammad, and Kahf.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: active participation, two shorter papers, a presentation, and final paper
or project.

MAJOR
Three routes are offered: the emphasis of the first is on the history of art, and that of the second is on creative
work in studio. The third route through the major allows students to take courses in both halves of the department
in more or less equal numbers.
Note: The Art History and Art Studio routes are strongly recommended for any prospective Art major who is
contemplating graduate study in Art History or Art Studio.
Art History Route
Sequence courses
ArtH 101-102 Aspects of Western Art
One of the following courses in Studio Art to be taken by the end of the junior year: ArtS 100, 101, 102,
109
ArtH 301 Methods of Art History
One 400-level Seminar or Graduate Course
Parallel courses
Any five additional semester courses of art history including three concerned with the following:
1) a period of Western art prior to 1800,
2) a period of Western or non-Western art, prior to 1400, and
3) non-Western art.
Although the structure of the art history route allows for flexible scheduling, the faculty strongly recommends
that students proceed through the major in the recommended sequence. Introductory 100- and 200-level courses
should be taken in the first or second year. So that they are prepared for the research requirements of the seminar
classes that cap the sequence, majors are required to take the required Junior major class, ArtH 301 during their
junior year. If the student is studying abroad for the entire junior year, this requirement may be filled in the senior
year (see STUDY ABROAD policy of the Art Department for more information.)

Any four additional Art Studio or Art History courses. At least one elective must be taken in each wing of
the department. At least one of the electives must be an Art History course concerned with a period of
Western or non-Western art prior to 1800.
Art History Route: The history of art is different from other historical disciplines in that it is founded on
direct visual confrontation with objects that are both concretely present and yet documents of the past. We
emphasize analysis of images, objects, and built environments as the basis for critical thought and visual
literacy. In addition to formal and iconographic analysis, we use the work of other disciplines to understand
visual images, such as social history, perceptual psychology, engineering, psychoanalysis, cultural studies,
Art
­ 69 ­
and archaeology. Because of its concentration on visual experience, the Art History major increases one's
ability to observe and to use those observations as analytical tools for understanding history and culture.
ArtH 101-102 introduces students to a series of critical studies of important works selected from the history of
Western art from antiquity to the present. The critical approach of the introductory course is maintained in all fur-
ther courses, especially by assigned study of original works in the Williams College Museum of Art, Chapin Li-
brary, the Clark Art Institute, and Mass MoCA.
An introductory studio course, ArtS 100, in which no artistic talent or prior experience are assumed, provides
vital training in what is a visual as well as a verbal discipline. The requirement of a course in non-Western art
expands majors' geographic as well as cultural horizons, and the requirement of two courses in art from periods
prior to 1800 provides a necessary concentration on earlier moments in culture. (As the late contemporary archi-
tect, Philip Johnson, said, "You cannot not know history.") The junior course (ArtH 301) develops awareness of
the theoretical implications, as well as the possibilities and limitations of different art-historical methods. The re-
quirement of a seminar or graduate course in the senior year enables students to apply that knowledge of method-
ology to their most specialized work in the Art History route.
Art Studio Route: The studio division of the Art major has been structured to foster the development of a critical
understanding of making art; to support creative interests and to develop students' perceptions and imaginations
as they investigate a variety of visual media. Drawing I, ArtS 100 serves as an introduction to the basic draw-
ing and design principles which establish the foundation for the development of visual expression. ArtH 101-102,
Aspects of Western Art, provides part of the necessary background in the critical analysis of art. The 200-level
ArtS courses provide opportunities to learn the elements of some of the principal visual arts media: architecture,
painting, photography, printmaking, sculpture, and video. These courses combine technical foundations in the me-
dium with analysis of the interrelation of visual form and content. The 300- and 400-level courses place a greater
emphasis on the application of appropriate visual skills and strategies to particular thematic concerns, and to the
development of the student's individual vision. All students taking ArtS418 are required to exhibit in the spring of
their senior year at the Williams College Museum of Art or other appropriate venues. Students who choose to take
two 300-level classes do not exhibit at WCMA in the spring of the senior year.
History and Practice Route: This route allows students to study in depth both the history of art and the making of
it. It offers considerable flexibility: students may propose courses of study that emphasize particular media, themes
or methodological issues. To mention just three examples, students may design sequences of courses that focus on
architecture, gender or narration in both the history of art and contemporary practice. Students may take more
courses in one wing of the department than the other, as long as the minimum requirements in each wing are
satisfied. The History and Practice route is especially well-suited to students interested in arts-related careers out-
side of higher education, including work in art galleries, art museums, and primary or secondary school education.
Unlike the history or studio routes, acceptance into the History and Practice route is not automatic. The student
must first submit a written application in two copies, one for each advisor from the two wings of the department, as
well as a list of proposed courses; this application and list of proposed courses must be given to the department
secretary before registering for the major.
The application must provide a narrative statement of the theme of the major, and why it cannot be accommodated
in either history or studio. It is not enough to submit a list of courses; the student needs to show the coherence and
integrity of the plan of study, and how it develops the theme of the proposed major.
Some students will be attracted to both wings of the department but will not have a field of study that falls between
the two. In these cases, it is better for the student to choose between history and studio--taking additional courses
from the other wing as desired. In short, the History and Practice route is reserved for students with a strong record
of achievement who cannot be accommodated in the two wings of the department.
History and Practice majors do not participate in the senior studio exhibition at the end of the year.
History and Practice Faculty Advisors: Michael Glier, Ann McCallum, and Ben Benedict in studio; E. J. John-
son, Peter Low and Michael Lewis in history.
COURSE NUMBERS
First Digit
The 100-level courses in both Art History and Studio are introductions to the field and emphasize visual and
critical analysis. These courses do not require previous experience in the subject and they are often prerequi-
sites for other courses in the department; 200-level courses are introductions to specific fields; 300-level
courses prepare students for independent research; 400-level courses emphasize independent research, oral
presentation, and active participation and are intended for advanced students, usually senior majors.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN ART
Students who wish to become candidates for the degree with honors must show prior evidence of superior
performance in the major as well as research capabilities to carry out the proposed project.
Art History
To graduate with honors in art history, students are to enroll in the Senior Honors Seminar during the Spring
semester of their senior year, where they will develop an original research paper based on prior research. To be
admitted to the seminar, students must have completed ArtH 301 in their Junior year. To enter the class, students
must either be nominated by a faculty member, or apply independently to the Department Honors Committee for
admission. Students who have been nominated, as well as students who wish to apply for admission to the Honors
Seminar, must submit an original research paper that was completed in a prior art history class. The paper must be
properly formatted and include illustrations, a bibliography, and an abstract of not more than 250 words. These
documents are to be turned in to the Department Secretary no later than the end of the exam period of the Fall
Art
­ 70 ­
semester. The department Honors Committee will invite students (no more than 10) to enroll in the Honors Semi-
nar based on the quality of the original research, the student's GPA within the major, and the willingness and avail-
ability of appropriate faculty advisors. Notification of admission to the seminar will be sent to students by early
January. Since enrollment is by invitation only, students should pre-register for four classes and, if invited, drop
one of them and add the Honors Seminar during drop-add period. The Honors Seminar is to be taken in addition to
the required courses for the major. Once in the seminar, students will revise, refine and expand on previous re-
search and produce a paper of approximately 25 pages and present a shortened version of the paper to the faculty
and public at the Williams College Museum of Art.
Art Studio:
Studio art concentrators who wish to be candidates for honors are required to add a 200-level course, and to take
the 400-level senior tutorial. An additional 300-level tutorial or 200-level course must be added for a total of
twelve courses.
Honors candidates enrolled in the senior tutorial must "evidence" prior experience in the media chosen for the
honors work. This "evidence" may consist of one or more 200-level courses in the medium, course work at the
300 level and/or a slide portfolio demonstrating the student's proficiency in the media chosen for the honors proj-
ect. This work is presented to the senior tutorial instructor at the start of the spring semester.
At the end of the spring semester of the senior year, the honors candidate will orally defend his/her work in the
senior exhibition at WCMA. The entire studio faculty will attend the defense. Based on the work and the oral
defense, the studio faculty (as a whole) will designate honors, high honors or no honors.
History and Practice:
The route to honors is a combination of the Art Studio and Art History honors routes. At the beginning of senior
year, a candidate for honors in History and Practice makes a proposal to two faculty members, one faculty advisor
from each wing of the department. If both advisors agree to supervise the project, the candidate enrolls in indepen-
dent study and works through the fall semester and winter study. The progress of the project is assessed by both
advisors at the end of winter study; if the project is not well enough developed, the advisors may end it at that time.
If the project is allowed to move forward, the student enrolls either in ArtS 418T Senior Tutorial, if the project is
primarily a matter of making art, or in an Honors Independent Study, if it is primarily a writing project. The final
project is submitted to the two advisors, who will determine whether or not it will receive honors.
STUDY ABROAD
Although the Art Department encourages students to travel and study abroad, we feel that it is very important
for students to begin their major with a required seminar in their Junior year. The Junior seminars, ArtH 301 and
ArtS 319, prepare students for independent research and/or independent artistic production which is the focus of
the senior year.
a. Studio Art Majors must take the required Junior Seminar (ArtS 319) in their junior year unless they are
planning to study abroad for a full year; in that case they may take the required class in their senior year.
b. History and Practice students must include their Study Abroad plans in their application to the major and
discuss them with their advisor.
c. Art History students must take one of the required Junior Seminar (ArtH 301) in their junior year unless
they are planning to study abroad for a full year; in that case they may take the required class in their senior
year.
ART HISTORY COURSES
ARTH 101(F)-102(S) Aspects of Western Art
A year-long introduction to a history of some European and North American art, this course concentrates on three-
dimensional media in the fall (architecture and sculpture) and two-dimensional media in the spring (painting,
drawing, prints and photography). Even though the course focuses on Western art, it also explores interchanges
among other cultures and the west, particularly in more recent times.
Both semesters cover the same chronological span, from Ancient Greeks to computer geeks. We organize the
course in this unusual way not only to give students the grasp of history but also to heighten their ability to under-
stand visual objects by coming to grips with only one artistic medium at a time. To train students to look carefully
at art, we use the wealth of art resources in Williamstown: the Clark Art Institute, the Williams College Museum of
Art and the Chapin Rare Book Library. Students spend time with, and sometimes even hold, original works of art.
For the study of architecture we have a unique set of "Virtual Buildings," made expressly for this course, that
approximate the experience of being in structures thousands of miles away.
Format: lecture. Requirements: quizzes, midterm, two papers and a final exam.
ArtH 101-102 cannot be taken on a pass/fail basis; however, the course may be audited. Students who have au-
dited ArtH 101-102 lectures on a registered basis may enroll in any Art History course at the 200 or 300 level.
Both semesters of the course must be taken on a graded basis to receive credit for either semester.

ARTH 103(F) Asian Art Survey: From the Land of the Buddha to the World of the Geisha
This course introduces to students some of the major monuments of Asian art with an emphasis on the art of India,
China, and Japan. Its contextual approach helps students gain insight into the aesthetic, religious, and political
ideas and cultural meanings conveyed by the works of art. Visual analyses and thematic discussions will bear upon
the interconnectedness among these three cultures, and their respective interactions with the West. This course also
provides students with the vocabulary, techniques, and patterns of thinking needed for advanced art history

ARTH 105(F) Picturing God in the Middle Ages: An Introduction
How did Christians come to depict God? How did they visualize the deity described in the Bible as well as such
theological subtleties as the Incarnation and the Trinity? And what purposes did pictures of God serve, both in
public and private life? Paying particular attention to the function of works of art, this freshman seminar will ex-
amine the evolution of medieval Christian images of God, in both the Eastern and Western halves of Europe, and
the problems these images often generated. Among other specific topics, the course will investigate: the impact of
the Roman cult of the emperor and of images of the dead on the earliest portraits of Christ; theological debates
about the nature of spiritual versus physical vision and their influence on the making and viewing of images; the
relationship of sacred images to relics, the Eucharist, and other aspects of Christian ritual; and the pictorial explora-
tion of both the torture and sexuality of Christ.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on several short writing assignments, oral presentations, a research pa-
per, and class participation.
Enrollment limit: 10; limited to first-year students. This course is part of the Critical Reasoning and Analytical
Skills Initiative. This course satisfies the pre-1400 and pre-1800 requirements. This course does NOT satisfy the

ARTH 110(F) Reading the Renaissance: Interpreting Italian Renaissance Art and History
Many works of Renaissance art, such as Botticelli's Birth of Venus, Leonardo's Mona Lisa, and Michelangelo's
David, are remarkably familiar to us. But even as they live in our cultural consciousness, we may perceive them as
elevated and remote masterpieces of western culture, housed away in museums halfway around the world. Just
what is it that makes these objects so admired and important? And what might we all have to gain, intellectually,
by considering them? We will focus in depth on a series of individual works of art, learning and honing skills of
observation, visual and contextual analysis, and written and oral expression. But we will also step back from the
objects to explore and balance different approaches and points of view and to consider, more broadly, different
issues that can factor into the very act of interpretation. The goal of the course is that students emerge from it with a
rich understanding of the selected works in question, as well as a mindfulness of the ways in which the Renais-
sance period might inform our aesthetic perceptions and our critical understanding of the construction of the past.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on three 5- to 7-page papers (including installments and revisions), two
presentations, and engaged peer critiques and class participation.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Preference to first-year students and sophomores.

ARTH 201(F) American Landscape History (Same as Environmental Studies 201) (W)
A survey course stressing the visual attributes and historical geography of regional, vernacular (that is, ordinary or
pervasive) American settings, with the goal of discerning a national style of spatial or landscape organization.
Among the human-altered environments to be studied, from an evolutionary or diachronic perspective, are: forest-
lands, rangelands, croplands, outdoor recreational sites, mines and quarries; power and utilities; small towns, mill
towns, central business districts, and suburbs; housing, industry, commerce, and institutional uses such as the
American college campus; water, road, and rail corridors as examples of circulation nets. Given the course's
breadth of topics and, by contrast, other courses (see ArtH 308 and 310 during this academic year) concentrating
on specific land uses, a major objective in this survey will lie in discerning generic stylistic continuities and discon-
tinuities, or changes, which the landscape activities or sites express.
One outdoors, afternoon meeting each week provides discussion opportunities in situ, and enables class members
to obtain a deeper or first-hand familiarity with a rural-urban gradient of representative land uses and occupants
of the Hoosic-Hudson watershed and Taconic upland region surrounding Williamstown, as well as practicums
in interviewing and field study methodologies.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: weekly essays advancing the documentation of an individually-chosen
landscape site or behavior, simultaneously with the wider textual and field context which the course itself pro-
vides. The first Friday in November there will be an obligatory all-day field session, pondering an urban-rural
gradient from Troy, New York to Salem, New York.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 22 (expected: 22). Open to first-year students. Preference to American Stud-

ARTH 212(S) Distant Encounters: East Meets West in the Art of the European Middle Ages
This lecture course investigates the rich artistic consequences--in architecture, manuscript illumination, mosaic,
sculpture, panel painting, fresco, metalwork, and other minor arts--of European contact with the Eastern Mediter-
Art
­ 72 ­
ranean between approximately 300 and 1450 AD. From the beginnings of Christianity, pilgrims from Europe
made the long journey to sacred sites in the Holy Land (extending across parts of present-day Egypt, Israel, Syria,
and Turkey). When these sites became less accessible with the spread of Islam in the seventh century, Europeans
sought to recreate the sites at home. Later, from 1095 onward, Christian Europeans attempted to reclaim and hold
the Holy Land from non-Christians by force, through an ill-fated series of five major and several lesser "crusades."
Over the centuries, before, during, and after the Crusades, exposure to the peoples, ideas, and cultures of the East-
ern Mediterranean also came through trade and through the travel and settlement of non-Europeans in Europe
itself, particularly in Spain, Sicily, and Venice. The course aims to survey artistic production within each of these
different contexts of East-West encounter.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: two to three short papers, midterm, and final exam.
No prerequisite, but previous coursework in medieval art helpful (ArtH 101-102, 223, or 224). Enrollment limit:

ARTH 213(F) Greek Art and Myth (Same as Classics 213)
Classical myth provides rich subject matter for painters and sculptors throughout the history of western art. This
course investigates the earliest representation of myth in Greek art of the seventh through the first centuries B.C.E.
Sophisticated narratives involving gods and heroes first appear in a variety forms and contexts. Myth informs the
visual culture of the Greeks on many levels, from paintings on vases used in domestic contexts to the marble
sculpture that decorated the monumental temples of great sanctuaries throughout the Greek world. The purpose of
the course is two-fold: to familiarize students with the subjects and narratives of Greek myths and the underlying
belief system that, in part, produced them, and also provide a comprehensive outline of developments in Greek art
in the first millenium B.C.E. Of special interest will be the techniques developed by artists for representing narra-
tives visually, as well as the conceptual issues that underlie certain myths, such as sacrifice, war, marriage, coming
of age, specific festivals, and the relationships between men and women, and those between mortals and immor-
tals. Reading will include ancient literature in translation (Hesiod, Homer, Sappho, Aischylos, Sophokles, Euri-
pides and Apollodorus) as well as secondary literature by contemporary authors that provides insights into the
religious, social and historical developments that influenced artists in their choices of subject matter and style.
Format: lecture. Requirements: two short papers; quiz; hour test; final exam. Required fieldtrip to The Metropoli-
tan Museum in New York.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 45 (expected: 45). The course satisfies the pre-1400 and pre-1800 require-

ARTH 222(F) Foto Art: Germany 1960 to the Present (Same as ArtH 561)
Since its invention in 1839, photography has periodically challenged artists in traditional media to rethink their
practice. Already in the nineteenth century, major painters such as Edgar Degas used photographs as an aid. There
was also a widespread notion that photography could achieve a superior, "objective" knowledge of the visual
world that would render representational painting superfluous and obsolete. What was not foreseen was the poten-
tial for unusual forms of intermedial cross-fertilization that began to emerge in the 1960s, as, for example, individ-
ual artists began working in both painting and photography, sometimes combining them in single work. Neither
did one anticipate the use of photography--and even of painting--to interrogate and critique the photographic
medium itself, nor its deployment in the new genre of installation art. These examples represent a new category of
artistic practice, that of "artists who work with photography," as opposed to practitioners of "straight photography"
or even of art photography. These practices have arguably found their richest embodiment in Germany: in the
work of painters such as Anselm Kiefer, Sigmar Polke, and Gerhard Richter, in Joseph Beuys's expanded notion
of sculpture, in the serial photography of Bernd and Hilla Becher and their pupils Candida Höfer, Thomas Ruff,
and Thomas Struth, in the installations of Hanne Darboven, and the work of Thomas Demand, Hans-Peter Feld-
mann, Andreas Gursky, and Katharina Sieverding among others. Their practices will be examined in both a histor-
ical and a contemporary international context.

ARTH 224(F) Romanesque and Gothic Art and Architecture: The Medieval Church in Context
The goal of this course is to survey the major works of ecclesiastical architecture, sculpture and stained glass
produced in France between approximately 1050 and 1400. These works were not created in isolation from their
surroundings; thus we will attempt to understand them not only stylistically, but also in their original functional,
social, and sometimes even political settings. The course will emphasize the abbey church and the cathedral, the
two major ecclesiastical buildings of this period, as heterogeneous entities that used architecture, sculpture, stained
glass and other media, in conjunction with church ritual, to render their sacred spaces distinct from, and elevated
above, the world outside. We will furthermore try to appreciate the special centrality of the abbey church and the
cathedral in high medieval society. Sites for contact with God and for the development of advanced learning, they
could also serve as critical determinants of local economic and political life, and as focuses of pilgrimage, trade,
and international cultural exchange.
Format: lecture. Requirements: midterm, final, three to four short papers.

ARTH 232(F) The Visual Culture of Renaissance Rome
During the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, the city of Rome saw itself transformed from a shrinking and
neglected medieval town into a thriving center of artistic achievement. This lecture course focuses on the
historical, geographic, and ideological forces behind this period of renovation and restoration forces that reworked
the urban fabric of the city while shaping the character of the visual arts from Filarete and Fra Angelico to Bra-
mante, Michelangelo, and Raphael. We will examine monuments such as Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel, then,
not only as touchstones for the history of western art, but also as images capable of reflecting, and even
constructing, a uniquely Roman sense of power, time, and historical destiny.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: midterm, final, and two papers.

The use of commercial and mass media imagery in art became recognized as an international phenomenon in the
early 1960s. Items such as comic strips, advertising, movie stills, television programs, soup cans, "superstars" and
a variety of other accessible and commonplace objects inspired the subject matter, form and technique. This

itself, and methods it has adopted for executing them. Works of art will inevitably enter into our discussions, but
the main objects of study will be texts about art as well as texts about methods for an historical study of art. Topics
include (depending on individual instructor): style and periodization; iconography, semiotics; narratology, specta-
torship; the social functions of images and the social history of art; art and the market; gender and sexuality; and
art-historical narrative as representation.

ARTH 305T(S) Art, Life, Death: Studies in the Italian Renaissance (W)
We often think the Italian Renaissance as a transformation of the visual arts--a moment that pulled away from the
Middle Ages and set the stage for a new world of images detached from function and human experience. But art in
Renaissance Italy was hardly produced "for art's sake." This sophomore-level tutorial course will examine,
through a series of focused case studies, ways in which the exciting and innovative world of the Renaissance was
also a vital one. We will examine canonical works by Masaccio, Donatello, Botticelli, Michelangelo, Raphael, and
others not as mere examples of artistic achievement, but as complex visual responses to life's big questions. What
is love? How do we bridge the world of the living and that of the dead? How can we conceptualize our relationship
with divinity? How is power constructed along the lines of gender and sexuality? What defines us and constructs
us as individuals? How will we be judged by our contemporaries and by posterity? We will consider these ques-
tions and more. Along the way we will explore the distance and proximity of the Renaissance past and our own
moment, considering ways to articulate or refine the notion of universal resonance of artistic expression. Course-
work will include many primary sources, not least the works of art themselves (students will be expected to look as
well as read in preparation for class).
Format: tutorial. Course requirements will include five papers of 5-7 pages, 5 written responses to the work of the
tutorial partner, and one final paper (a revised version of one of the original 5 papers). Evaluation will be based on
written work and critical conversation.

ARTH 308(S) The North-American Park Idea (Same as Environmental Studies 308) (W)
A research seminar considering those sites whose nature is often displayed in an idealized form, for reasons of
stewardship, curiosity, delectation, or some other intention. Among the "open spaces" to be studied, both in
terms of design intent and design execution, are: commons and squares; groves and pleasure grounds; cemeteries;
exposition grounds; playgrounds; a few "landmark" residential subdivisions (sometimes called "parks"); some
landmark campuses or estate grounds; and those large natural areas or reservations generally subsumed, in com-
mon usage, by the wording "national park." Many of these "parks" are sites of leisure activities, and the design and
furnishing of outdoor recreation will comprise one major theme. We will consult primary evidence, in the form of
contemporary reports, letters, and journals from the period of these sites' creation. Secondary evidence will lie in
accounts of the behavior induced by the scouting, wilderness, ecological and naturalist-explorer movements.
Frederick Law Olmsted, Steven Mather, Robert Moses, and Walt Disney are among the seminal figures whose
careers in park creation or site design will be scrutinized.
Format: lecture, discussion. Evaluation to be based on weekly essays and on class participation. This course in-
cludes an obligatory all-day field session, the last Wednesday in April, to the Boston environs, and site assess-
ments there of the Old Granary Burying Grounds, the Common and Public Garden, the Emerald Necklace, in-
cluding Harvard University's living collections and the city's largest recreational ground, Franklin Park. This ses-
sion will include discussions with designers, scholars, park advocates, and public officials. Occasional Wednes-
day afternoon field sessions will visit sites or designs within range of Williamstown.

An exploration, in seminar format, of the historical aspects of the production of food and fibre, concentrating on
the North American experience but preceded by anthropological and other evidence from both the New and Old
Worlds. Behind this subject's inclusion within the purview of art history lies the fact that agriculturists are the
largest-scale "designers" of the surface of the earth, especially where crops are grown. The evolution of rural
settlements; the development of forest, range, and crop land uses; the relationship of technology to rural societies;
and the nurturing of rurality, especially in its pastoral guise. Particular emphasis on the spatial attributes of differ-
ent agricultural regimes, as well as their depiction in the visual arts.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on: weekly essays, half of them advancing an agricultural

The urge to commemorate individuals, heroic acts or historic events whether unspeakable or splendid is both hu-

both commemorative ones, and those that admonish or inform without commemorating a specific event or indi-
vidual. Students will study and analyze monuments and memorials from the ancient Mediterranean (Egypt; My-
cenae; Greece of the Archaic, Classical and Hellenistic periods; Imperial Rome) and chart their their influence on
monuments in later history, especially those of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The current trend towards
countermonuments, or anti-monuments, such as Maya Lin's Vietnam Veterans Memorial or the Gerzes' vanishing
"Monument Against Fascism, War and Violence and For Peace and Human Rights" in Hamburg/Harburg will be
discussed in light of the monumental tradition of combining word, image, and architecture to create memorials
that will endure in both spatial and temporal terms. Ongoing discussions of Holocaust memorials and the prob-
lems inherent in the design of the monument for the WTC will also be addressed. Students will be asked to design

The ways in which women are represented in European and American art is a much-debated topic in our time.
This seminar explores feminine imagery in Chinese art both from a historical perspective and in the contemporary
context. Topics of interest include early Chinese writing about women and the subsequent portrayal of feminine
ideals (physical beauty and familial, social, and religious roles) in relation to men; erotic feminine imagery in
painting and poetry; the chastity cult and the popularization of woodblock printed and illustrated books on exem-
plary women in 16th- to 17th-century China, a period when illustrated erotic novellas also experienced a boom;

ARTH 422(S) Making the Stones Speak: The Emergence and Development Of the Romanesque
Sculpted Portal
Beginning around the year 1000, European Christendom experienced a great ecclesiastical building boom. Ac-
cording to a contemporary chronicler, "it was as if the whole earth, having cast off the old by shaking itself, were
clothing itself everywhere in the white robe of the church." During the course of the eleventh century, the design-
ers of these structures fashioned a new architectural language that we now label "Romanesque." One of the most
innovative and dramatic aspects of this new language was its assimilation of monumental sculpture, absent in
Europe since the fifth century. The focus of attention in this regard was the portal, which marked the threshold
between the profane realm of the outside world and the sacred space of the church. This seminar will investigate
the antecedents and origins of the Romanesque sculpted portal and examine in detail its greatest manifestations.
Emphasis will be placed on understanding these often complex sculptural schemes within their original functional
and physical contexts. What role did this imagery play in structuring the medieval visitor's overall experience of
the church? And what did it mean to have this imagery carved into the very fabric of "God's temple"?

ARTH 461T(F) Writing about Bodies (Same as INTR 461 and Women's and Gender Studies

The goal is to think about describing bodies from a variety of disciplinary approaches and genres of writing. Its
focus is on living bodies, or bodies that were once alive, with an emphasis on bodies that move i.e., performing
bodies--actors, dancers, singers--and what makes them unique. We will also consider objects associated with
bodies, and the ways they are animated, including how they are animated when the person who had them dies. The
course is meant for juniors, seniors, and graduate students who wish to analyze bodies from different disciplinary
formations-art, theatre, literature, anthropology, philosophy--and who have a particular interest in writing. We
will read scholarly writing, fiction, New Yorker profiles, as well as memoir/autobiography, and take each as a
model through which to write about a person or an object redolent of a person.
Possible readings: Roland Barthes on cultural theory and representation; Zine Magubane and Zadie Smith on oth-
ered bodies; Tamar Garb on portraiture; Elaine Scary on the body in pain; Joan Acocella, Hilton Als, Judith Thur-
man and other writers on the arts; Judith Butler and Peggy Phelan on the performative body; Joseph Roach, Diana
Taylor, and Michael Taussig on the body, memory, and ritual; Marvin Carlson and Terry Castle on haunting; and
Bill Brown on things. These will be supplemented by selected tapes of live performances as well as films.

ARTH 463(F) The Holocaust Visualized (Same as Jewish Studies 463)
This seminar will examine how memories of the Holocaust have been conveyed through visual means and con-
sider what historical, cultural and political circumstances have caused various nations to remember the Holocaust
differently. We will discuss the issues prompted by public memorials, exhibitions and, as one writer puts it, the
"museumification" of concentration camps. How should we define the Holocaust? Whose memory should take
precedence? What is lost or gained by the inclusion of texts with images? How might memory be misrepresented
by the exhibition of visual materials such as video testimony, photographs and artifacts? In addition, we will study
art about the Holocaust, including Art Spiegelman's graphic novel, Maus, and non-fiction films, such as Night and
Fog, Shoah and Schindler's List, to ask whether constructed or simulated images can convey the experience of the
Holocaust as well as documentary ones. Additionally, we need to consider ways in which the images of the Holo-
caust, by now too well-known, have been instrumentalized by groups wishing to minimize the Shoah (e.g. the
recent Holocaust cartoon competition in Tehran, 2006.)
Requirements: active participation in class discussion and regular participation in a class listserver discussion

ARTH 464(F) Latina/o Visual Culture: Histories, Identities, and Representation (Same as

This course examines the contemporary history of Latina/o visual culture and explores the various relations be-
tween cultural expression, identity formation, and public representation. We will begin by considering the critical
and aesthetic practices that emerged in the context of civil rights actions and nationalist movements, which often
focused on issues of visibility, self-representation, and autonomy. The topics of immigration, transnationalism, and
the "Latinization" of the United States will then be analyzed in depth as we examine representations of and repre-
sentations by Latina/os in film and television, the visual arts, advertising, and other forms of popular media.
Throughout the course, we will investigate the role of visual culture in determining taste and trends as well as

ARTH 494(S) Honor's Thesis Seminar
To graduate with honors in art history, students are to enroll in the Senior Honors Seminar during the Spring se-
mester of their senior year, where they will develop an original research paper based on prior research. Under the
guidance of the instructor, students will present and defend their own work in both written and oral form, as well as
respond to, and critique, the work of their peers. As students work toward transforming their existing paper into an
honor's thesis, they will also be trained in skills necessary to analyze an argument effectively, and strategies of
constructive critique.
Format: seminar. Once in the seminar, students will revise, refine and expand on previous research and produce a
paper of approximately 25 pages and present a shortened version of the paper to the faculty and public at the Wil-
liams College Museum of Art.
Prerequisites: to be admitted to the seminar, students must have completed ArtH 301 in their Junior year. To enter
the class, students must either be nominated by a faculty member, or apply independently to the Department Hon-
ors Committee for admission. Students who have been nominated, as well as students who wish to apply for ad-
mission to the Honors Seminar, must submit an original research paper that was completed in a prior art history
class. The paper must be properly formatted and include illustrations, a bibliography, and an abstract of not more
than 250 words. These documents are to be turned in to the Department Secretary no later than the end of the exam
period of the Fall semester. The Department Honors Committee will invite students (no more than 10) to enroll in
the Honors Seminar Based on the quality of the original research, the student's GPA within the major, and the
willingness and availability of appropriate faculty advisors. Notification of admission to the seminar will be sent to
students by early January. Since enrollment is by invitation only, students should pre-register for four classes and,
if invited, add the Honors Seminar during drop-add period. The Honors Seminar is to be taken in addition to the
required courses for the major. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 6). Permission of instructor required.

ARTS 100(F) Drawing I
The purpose of this course in beginning is to advance your understanding of fundamental aspects of the language
of visual communication and expression. Through the development of greater visual acuity, an examination of the
structure of the two dimensional image, and the study of appropriate working methods, you will work to give
coherent visual form to your own observations, and will develop an enhanced ability to understand the images
created by others. The development of appropriate technical skills, strengthening of observational skills, and a
basic understanding of the interrelationship between form and content in drawing are the key aims of this course.

ARTS 105(F,S) Participatory Media Production (Same as American Studies 105)
This course is an introduction to the history and theory of participatory media production and community media
practice. Community media production, be it local, identity-based, or virtual, can challenge the mainstream and
encourage communities to add their voices to the media landscape. The convergence of art, media and social jus-
tice is at the core of community media practice. We will engage in this rich history through studying and writing
about examples of community radio stations, guerrilla television, public access television, satellite television, tacti-
cal media, intervention, Indymedia and more. Readings will include Paolo Freire, Dee Dee Halleck, Clemencia
Rodriguez, Robert McChesney, Suzana Milevska, and Ellie Rennie. Additionally, students in the course will form
teams to work on participatory digital media projects (examples could include a short documentary, video blog or
photo exhibit) reflecting concerns of specific communities with which they identify. These projects will be partici-
patory in nature, meaning that we will take an approach to making art in which the "audience" is engaged directly
in the production process, allowing them to become co-creators. No production experience is required; this course
serves as a pre-requisite for more advanced video production courses. Lab fee.

ARTS 211(F) The Sample
"When I sample something, it's because there's something ingenious about it; it's a genius moment, or an accident
or something that makes it just utterly unique to the other trillions of records that I've plowed through." --DJ
Shadow. This interdisciplinary course will provide a history of sample -based music, art and literature as well as
hands -on practice in recognizing, archiving, and employing samples in personal creative work. Topics of discus-
sion will include sampling in music from early musique concrete to viral samples such as the Amen Break, the
contemporary trends of mashups, remixes, glitch -pop, and plunderphonics, the literary cut -ups of Buroughs and
Gysin, and the documentary films of Errol Morris etc. We will also touch on the lurid history of legal battles over
sample ownership, fair use law, the public domain, and the creative commons movement.
Format: As part of the Arthur J. Levitt visiting artist program, this course is designed to bridge the real or imagined
boundaries between the creative disciplines of art, music, creative writing, dance and theater. Creative minds from
any of these fields are equally invited to participate, and collaborations between class members will be encour-
aged. Evaluation will be based on a short paper, active participation in the development of a shared body of sam-
ples to be used in creative assignments, and a final project employing elements of this sample library' in one's

ARTS 310T(S) Appearance/Disappearance
Appearance and disappearance are conditions that intuitively and intellectually link a subject to its surrounding
environment. We are made aware of things appearing (or disappearing) by the degrees and kinds of contrasts ex-
hibited by the subject (ideas or objects) in relation to its ground (ephemeral or material). The particular array of
relationships between subject and ground constructs diverse kinds of evidence. From medical research in the
imaging processes of the internal body to the forensic cues offered by the "black box" in-flight recording; from the
military use of camouflage to the video taped "appearances" of Osama bin Laden; from the inability of an eating
disorder patient to recognize a self image to the masquerades we willingly wear-appearance and disappearance
have governed the evidences of our actions, beliefs and identities.
This image-based studio examination of the subject will look at material that has been shaped by its link with our
central theme. Each of five studio projects will successively build a cumulative view of how appearance and/or
disappearance might shift a viewer's ability to render any point of view. While work in a variety of media will be
encouraged, most of the studio exercises will be two-dimensional or low-relief in their final presentation.
Format: tutorial. Evaluation will be on the basis of the technical and conceptual strengths of the portfolio, the
weekly paired-student format and full class studio discussions, and regular written analysis of work produced dur-
ing this term. Lab fee.

ARTS 364T(F) Artists' Books
This course will investigate the processes and ideas associated with the making of artists' books, works that are
fine art objects primarily using visual images and/or text. For example, individual projects could include literary
text/visual image combinations, visual diaries, three-dimensional pop-up books, solely visual narratives, autobi-
ographies, animated "flip" books, or sculptural books. Limited-editioned as well as one-of-a-kind work will be
encouraged. Media options include etching, lithography, relief printing, hand painting, drawing, some photo pro-
cesses and bookbinding techniques (from boxes to hard binding). As a tutorial, this course is designed to meet
individual needs, stress student participation and responsibility for learning, and to examine differing points of
view. Students will meet in groups of two for discussion and critique of individual projects in the tutorial format:
i.e., students are expected to give a half-hour presentation weekly regarding their projects and selected readings,
and to respond to criticism and questions by the peer student and the instructor. Students will also meet once a
week as a group for demonstrations, slide presentations, meetings with visiting artists, and discussion of readings.

With current staffing limitations, it is difficult for studio faculty to supervise more than a very few independent
studies projects. We feel our curriculum includes rich and varied offerings and believe that the need for most
independent work can be met through those regular offerings.
Prerequisites: no student will be accepted into an independent study project unless he/she has completed two
200-level ArtS courses and one 300-level ArtS tutorial. Permission of instructor is required.
GRADUATE COURSES IN ART HISTORY
Requirements for the Degree of Master of Arts in Art History
The degree is normally awarded upon successful completion of two years of resident graduate study. To earn
the degree the student must earn a grade of at least B- in each of ten courses, at least six of which must be graduate
seminars (including ArtH 504). There is a geographical/chronological distribution requirement that these ten
courses must fulfill (details available from the Graduate Program Office.) In connection with the preparation of a
paper for the Graduate Symposium, students will register for an eleventh course (ArtH 509), to be graded pass/fail,
in their fourth semester.
In addition to completing the required courses, students must participate in a group study trip to Europe during
winter study period in the first year, complete a Qualifying Paper in January of the second year, and satisfy the
language requirement in the manner described below (see "Language Courses").
Senior art majors may enroll in graduate seminars, space permitting, with the permission of instructor.
ARTH 500(F) Clark Visiting Professor Seminar: The Hudson River School Revisited (Same as
ArtH 400)
After a long series of blockbuster and quasi-blockbuster exhibitions beginning with the Metropolitan Museum of
Art's American Paradise (1987) and ending with the Brooklyn Museum's Kindred Spirits: Asher B. Durand and
the American Landscape (2007), now is a perfect time to take a fresh look at the Hudson River School and its
offshoots. This course provides an opportunity to assess what has been learned over the past two decades and to
explore further the influence of new social formations, new cultural practices, and new technologies of vision on
American landscape representation in the period 1800-1875.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class participation, presentation of research, and a term paper.
Enrollment limit: 14, with places for 7 undergraduate [ARTH 400] and 7 graduate students [ARTH 500] assured.
Preference will be given to senior majors and graduate students.
Hour: 1:10-3:50 M WALLACH
ARTH 500(S) Clark Visiting Professor Seminar: Reassessing Modernism: European Modern
Architecture between the Wars (Same as ArtH 400)
It is fashionable to render Modernist architecture and design in the plural. Decorative Modernism, Vernacular
Modernism, Conservative Modernism, Domestic Modernism, Irrational Modernism have all appeared in the re-
cent literature. Applying pluralism retrospectively to the modern movement in architecture does disservice to the
discourses of the 1920s, which generally revolved around a central spine of ideas. To understand the often bitter
wrangling over apparently small differences of meaning and architectural detailing, it is better to adopt a model of
competing claims to a single and authoritative core of belief. This is more in tune with the times than imagining a
free market of brands or ideologies. The problem is that the core ideas were not themselves coherent, leading to
contradictory and incompatible conclusions. The strength and endurance of Modernism in architecture and design
derived from its capacity, from the outset, to accommodate complexity and contradiction at the core of its doctrine.
The course is designed to interrogate these contradictions.
The course divides into two sections. In the first half we explore how the ideas carried forward from the nineteenth
century were transformed into the practice of Modernist architecture by 1925-8 in Europe. The focus will be on
testing meaning in selected texts against buildings and designs. In the second half of the course, we will interrogate
the contradictory ways these ideas were interpreted in different countries in the 1930s, looking especially at
France, Italy, Britain and the United States. We will pay particular attention to the means of diffusion and elabora-
tion of ideas and images, through lectures, books, periodicals and exhibitions.
Evaluation will be based on a short midterm paper and a final term paper.
Enrollment limit: 14, with places for 7 undergraduate [ARTH 400] and 7 graduate students [ARTH 500] assured.
Preference will be given to senior majors and graduate students.
Hour: 1:10-3:50 M T. BENTON
ARTH 501(S) Museums: History and Practice
This course will examine the history of museums in Europe and America, focusing on historical traditions and
current expectations affecting institutional operations today. Historical tradition and current practice as it relates to
museum governance and administration, architecture and installation, acquisitions and collections, cultural prop-
erty issues as well as the many roles of exhibitions in museum programming will be addressed along with mu-
seums' social responsibility as scholarly and public institutions in an increasingly market-driven, non-profit envi-
ronment. Evaluation will be based on oral presentations as well as two term papers.
Enrollment limit: 12 (expected: 8-12).

ARTH 504(F) Methods of Art History and Criticism
This is a seminar in the intellectual history of the history of art, with some concentration on the ways in which this
disciplinary tradition has been challenged by recent critical theory. It will begin its study with the "founders" of the
field and end with issues and problems that generated the "new art history" twenty years ago and "visual studies"
Art

in the last decade. Topics to be covered include: style, iconography/iconology, semiotics, identity politics, formal-
ism, deconstruction, phenomenology, psychoanalysis, feminism, Marxism, and gender studies. Resident Clark
Fellows will occasionally talk to us on perspectives of their choice. Each student will write one short midterm
paper and a longer concluding essay, as well as present a couple of the readings to the class. Limited to and re-
quired of first-year students in the Graduate Program in the History of Art.
Hour: 1:10-3:50 T HOLLY
ARTH 505(F) The Artist and the Studio: Representations of Representation, Then and Now
This thematically based course explores depictions of the artist and the studio from (roughly) Velázquez into the
present. Such representations often constitute a privileged arena for the development of reflexive concerns-con-
cerns by artists about the nature and terms of the artistic enterprise. Precisely for this reason, that arena has also
attracted a substantial body of ambitious art historical writing. Accordingly, much of the class will be devoted to
exploring problems of interpretation raised by such "representations of representation," along with the art histori-
cal literature they have spawned. Artists include (but are not limited to) Velázquez, Vermeer, Delacroix, Courbet,
Matisse, and Picasso; readings by Michel Foucault, Michael Fried, Svetlana Alpers, Daniel Arasse, and Leo Stein-
berg, among others. We might also read Balzac's Unknown Masterpiece and other works of art fiction.
Format: seminar. Requirements: students will be responsible for readings, and one research paper/presentation.
Enrollment limit: 12 (expected: 8-12). Preference will be given to graduate students and then to senior majors.

ARTH 508(S) Art and Conservation: An Inquiry into History, Methods, and Materials
This course is designed to acquaint students with observation and examination techniques for works of art, arti-
facts, and decorative arts objects; give them an understanding of the history of artist materials and methods; and
familiarize them with the ethics and procedures of conservation. This is not a conservation training course but is
structured to provide a broader awareness for those who are planning careers involving work with cultural objects.
Class format will include slide presentations, lectures, gallery talks, hands-on opportunities, technical examina-
tions, and group discussions. Sessions will be held at the Williamstown Art Conservation Center, Williams Col-
lege, the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute, and the Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller Empire State Plaza Art
Collection in Albany. Examination questions may be formulated from exhibitions at these locations. Six exams
will be given. Exams scores will be weighed in proportion to the number of sessions covered by the exam (e.g., the
paintings exam, derived from six sessions of the course, will count as 25% of the final grade). There is no overall
final exam. Some exams may be designated "open book"; however, all work should be a student's individual ef-
fort.
Enrollment limit: 12 (expected: 8-12).
Hour: 6:30-8:30 MR BRANCHICK
ARTH 509(S) Graduate Student Symposium
This course is designed to assist qualified fourth-semester graduate students in preparing a scholarly paper to be
presented at the Graduate Program's annual spring symposium. Working closely with a student/faculty ad hoc
advisory committee, each student will prepare a twenty-minute presentation based on the Qualifying Paper. Spe-
cial emphasis is placed on the development of effective oral presentation skills.
Requirements: each student is required to present two or three dry runs and a final oral presentation at the sympo-
sium.
Prerequisites: successful completion and acceptance of the Qualifying Paper.
Hour: TBA GOTLIEB
ARTH 511(S) The Image of God in Ancient Greek Art
The visual representation of the Greek gods and goddesses poses special interpretive problems because the Greeks
held their gods to be not visible in the ordinary sense yet powerfully present. The interpretation of images of deities
in Greek art poses especially interesting questions because of the importance of naturalism in ancient conceptions
of visual representation. To understand the seemingly paradoxical idea of a naturalistic imagery of supernatural
gods, scholars have employed semiology, narratology, phenomenology, and the psychology of religion. In this
course, we will explore the representation of gods from those and other points of view. We will acquire an under-
standing of the basic stylistic, iconographical, and ritual parameters surrounding the imagery of gods through short
presentations on individual deities. In a series of in-depth presentations, we will examine influential ancient monu-
ments and modern interpretive problems. Topics will include the sculptures of Delphi, Olympia, and the Parthe-
non; divine corporeality in poetry; the theology of mortal-immortal relations; the religious-historical phenomena
of statue-rituals; the function of representations of deities, and the comparative study of imagery of god in Medi-
eval and Renaissance art.
Format: lecture, discussion, and student presentations. Requirements: one short and one long presentation, one
research paper, and participation in class discussion.
Enrollment limit: 12 (expected 8-12). Preference will be given to graduate students, senior art-history majors, and
classics majors, in that order.

ARTH 546(S) What Is Genre Painting?
Genre painting is both a firmly established and a puzzling category in art history. In this course we will explore
some of the key aesthetic and social questions it provokes: What precisely is it and why does it matter? What
social and cultural forces shaped its development? How was it defined and understood in particular countries and
Art
­ 85 ­
at particular moments? What was its relationship with other modes and genres of painting, and with wider cultural
phenomena such as theater and proverbs? The course will focus on the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries in the
Low Countries, France, and England, and will examine the work of Teniers, Steen, Chardin, Hogarth, and Greuze,
among others.
The course will be assessed on the basis of oral presentation (normally focused on an individual painting or group
of paintings) and one research paper per student. In addition, students will be expected to lead discussions of read-
ings and to respond to the presentations of others in the class.
Enrollment limit: 12 (expected: 8-12). Preference will be given to graduate students and then to senior majors.

ARTH 557(F) James McNeill Whistler
The Massachusetts-born, Sankt Petersburg-raised, West Point-educated, Paris-trained, London-residing,
Japan-worshipping James McNeill Whistler (1834-1903)--in addition to exemplifying the cosmopolitanism
of his age--revolutionized the arts of painting, printmaking, interior decoration, exhibition design, and artistic
self-promotion. We will study his many achievements through study of selected works and considerations of the
varied cultural circles in which he moved: the French avant-garde of several generations, British Pre-Raphaelites
and Aesthetes, American expatriates, and a panoply of European poets, industrialists, and celebrities. Substantial
archival resources and bibliography will assist our investigations and itself be a field of inquiry.
Expectations: synopses of the weekly readings; two short written assignments; an oral report, to be presented in
revised, written form at semester's end; and a critical commentary on another student's report. An overnight field
trip to Washington, D.C., is likely.

ARTH 562(S) Themes in Domestic Architecture, 1953-1973
By 1953, it seemed that despite the great challenge of reconstruction in Europe after World War II, all the technical
obstacles for providing comfortable homes for all had been resolved (standardized production, control of heat,
light, ventilation, acoustic insulation). All these standards were enshrined in building legislation in Europe and in
the United States and would be brought about by heavy investment and mass production, standardization, and the
rational solving of technical problems. The three CIAM meetings (Congrès Internationaux d'Architecture Mod-
erne) after WWII seemed to be in control of technology and planning. But the new generation of architects and
designers was not satisfied. In fact it was one of the leading figures of the old generation who asked in 1953 the
fundamental question: "How should we live today?"
This seminar is about the different ways in which people tried to answer this question. Well-known architects such
as Louis Kahn, Marcel Breuer, Jean Prouvé, and Charlotte Perriand all approached the problem in different ways,
and we will examine their ideas. We will also explore radical approaches to architecture, from high tech to low
tech (lightweight structures, alternative lifestyles and the counterculture, ecology, and sustainability), from the
1950s to the 1970s.
Evaluation will be based on a short midterm paper and a final term paper.
Enrollment limit: 12 (expected: 8-12). Preference will be given to graduate students and then to senior majors.

ARTH 567(F) Writing on Contemporary Art: "Opponents, Audiences, Constituents, and

In his 1982 essay "Opponents, Audiences, Constituents, and Community" Edward Said asked "Who writes? For
whom is the writing being done? In what circumstances?" While addressing these questions, the class will look at
the various modes of interpretation used to analyze and illuminate contemporary art today. We will read criticism,
theory, interviews, and museum catalogue essays and didactics in order to understand not only the subject - the art
itself - but also how it is described, contextualized, and disseminated to various audiences. The class will also
explore the changing definitions and roles of author, artist, curator, audience, and text.
Evaluation will be based on class discussions and a series of writing assignments completed over the semester.
Enrollment limit:12 (expected 8-12). Preference will be given to graduate students. Senior majors will be admitted
with permission of the instructor only.

ARTH 575(F) Forbidden Image?
It is commonly assumed that Islam categorically forbids figural representation. This is a myth. We will seek a
more nuanced appreciation of Muslim image-making practices in this course, first by considering idolatry and
related anxieties associated with monotheistic visual cultures, and then by exploring the rich traditions of Persian
manuscript painting and photography in greater detail. A particularly charged form of figuration-the portrait-will
serve as a springboard from which to articulate the character and limits of Islamic "iconoclasm."
Students will be evaluated on their class participation and a major research project.
Enrollment limit: 12 (expected: 8-12). Preference will be given to graduate students and then to senior majors.

ARTH 595(F), 596(S) Private Tutorial
Students may petition to take a private tutorial by arrangement with the instructor and with permission of the
Director of the Graduate Program.
ARTH 597(F), 598(S) Undergraduate Courses Taken for Graduate Credit
LANGUAGE COURSES
Reading proficiency in two European languages is required for the M.A. degree in Art History at Williams, and
provision for attainment of this qualification is an integral part of the program of study. Of these two, German is
required, and French is recommended. Elementary and intermediate undergraduate courses offered by the lan-
guage departments are open to graduate students, and the graduate program offers advanced, one-semester
courses in French and German art-history readings. A student who begins elementary language study after enroll-
ment in the program should expect to take a sequence of courses. Details may be obtained from the Graduate
Program office. Entering students with some previous language background will be asked to take a standard read-
ing examination for purposes of placement. Students should aim to complete all language work no later than the
end of the third semester.
To satisfy the requirement in each of the two required languages, a student must: (a) score 700 or better on the
SAT II reading examination upon enrollment in the program or, (b) complete punctually and satisfactorily (B- or
better) all assignments and tests in the advanced courses. The same standards and expectations apply to language
courses as to other courses and seminars.
Second-year students who have successfully completed German 511-512 and have independently developed
their German language skills during the summer may, before the commencement of their third semester of study,
arrange to take a two-hour translation examination administered by the Graduate Program. Students who pass the
examination are exempted from German 513.
If appropriate to his or her course of study, a student may petition to substitute another language for French.
Instruction in Italian, Spanish, Russian, Latin, and Greek is regularly offered in the undergraduate curriculum,
whereas independent arrangements must be made for Dutch and other languages.
GERM 511(F)-512(S) Reading German for Beginners (Same as German 111(F)-112(S)
This course is for students who have had no previous study of German.
GERM 513(F) Readings in German Art History and Criticism
This is an advanced course in German reading, focused on the literature of art history. Texts are selected from
fundamental works of art history and criticism and from the writings related to concurrent seminars in the Grad-
uate Program in the History of Art. The course includes a grammar review.
Evaluation will be based on written homework, quizzes, tests, and class participation.
Prerequisites: German 511-512 or equivalent preparation (a score of 500 or higher on SAT II German Reading
Test). Enrollment limited to art-history graduate students; others by permission of the instructor.
RLFR 511(F) Intensive Grammar and Translation
An intensive grammar course for students interested in developing and improving their reading skills in French.
Emphasis will be on a thorough and systematic review of sentence structures and grammar. The students will also
be expected to learn and develop a wide lexical range centered on art history and criticism. Conducted in English.
Evaluation is based on participation, papers, a midterm and a final examination.
Enrollment open for graduate students; other students are welcome, by instructor's permission.
Hour: 8:30-9:45 TR DESROSIERS
RLFR 512(S) Readings in French Art History and Criticism
This course will provide students of the Williams College Graduate Program in the History of Art and others inter-
ested with knowledge of French acquired through translation and interpretation.
The core of this course is based on the reading and translating of a variety of critical works covering different
periods and genres in the field of art history. The material read (excerpts from museum entries, the Gazette des
Beaux-Arts, Salons by Diderot, Baudelaire or Thoré, and authors such as Francastel, Valery, Focillon, Derrida to
name a few), will be analyzed in form and content, translated or summarized, in order to develop the skills and
understand the techniques necessary for reading French. Grammar will be reviewed in context.
Evaluation is based on class participation, papers, a midterm, a project and a final examination.
Prerequisite: French 511 or permission of instructor.

The mission of the Department of Asian Studies is to help as many students as possible--both majors and
non-majors--develop practical proficiency in Asian languages and, in the tradition of the liberal arts, acquire a
meaningful understanding of important facets of one or more of the disciplines represented within Asian Studies
(including anthropology, art history, economics, history, linguistics, literature, music, political science, religion,
and sociology), so that they may realize their fullest intellectual and personal potential and be able to make useful
contributions to society.
We offer courses in English in the field of Asian Studies as well as courses in Chinese and Japanese language,
literature, and culture. Three distinct majors are offered: a major in Chinese; a major in Japanese; and an interdisci-
plinary Asian Studies major which allows students to choose from a wide range of courses in the anthropology, art,
economics, history, languages, linguistics, literatures, music, politics, religion, and sociology of China,Taiwan,
Japan, and other Asian countries. Students with questions about the Asian Studies majors or about Asian Studies
course offerings should consult the chair. Please note: Courses with ASST prefix carry Division II credit and
courses with CHIN and JAPN prefixes carry Division I credit unless otherwise noted.
THE MAJOR
All students wishing to major in the Department of Asian Studies are required to take and pass a total of eleven
courses, as follows:
1) Asian Studies 201 or, with permission of the Chair, students may select a substitute course that treats more
than a single Asian country
2) four semesters of Chinese or Japanese language (including no more than two 100-level courses)
In addition to completing (1) and (2) above, all majors choose either an Area Studies track, leading to a major in
Asian Studies; or a Language Studies track, leading to a major in Chinese or Japanese. The requirements for each
of these tracks are indicated below:
3A) Asian Studies Major
a. a three-course qualification in one of the disciplines represented within Asian Studies (anthropology/sociol-
ogy, art history, economics, history, linguistics, literature, music, political science, religion). The qualifica-
tion, to be determined through consultation between students and their advisor, normally includes an
introductory course, a more advanced methodological or comparative course, and a course on Asia.
b. three approved electives, which may include further language work
3B) Chinese Major
a. four additional semesters of Chinese language (300-level or higher)
b. Chinese 412
c. one approved course in Chinese literature or culture in translation

STUDY ABROAD
Students intending to major in Asian Studies are encouraged to study in Asia during one or both semesters of
their junior year. Williams faculty serve on the boards of several study abroad programs in China and Japan. Op-
portunities to study in India, Indonesia, Korea, Taiwan,Thailand, and other Asian countries are also available. Pro-
spective Asian Studies majors who are planning to study abroad should discuss their plans with their advisor as far
in advance as possible. Up to eight courses taken overseas can count toward graduation, and up to four courses
taken off campus may be counted toward the major.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS
Students interested in writing an honors thesis in Asian Studies, Chinese, or Japanese should submit a proposal
to the department chair when they register for courses in the spring of their junior year. The proposal should in-
clude a statement of the topic, a general description of the types of materials available for study and how the study
will be carried out, and the name of the faculty member who will serve as advisor. Admission to the honors thesis
program will normally be limited to students who have maintained at least a B+ average in their courses for the
major.
Students admitted to the program should register for ASST 493-W31-494, CHIN 493-W31-494, or JAPN
493-W31-494. They will be expected to turn in the final draft of their thesis shortly after spring break and to dis-
cuss their results formally with their faculty graders. Their final grades in the three courses listed above and the
award of Honors, Highest Honors, or no honors will be determined by the quality of the thesis and the student's
performance in the oral defense.
THE ASIAN STUDIES ENDOWMENT
The Linen summer grants for study abroad, the Linen visiting professorships, and several other programmatic
activities in the department are supported by an endowment for Asian Studies established by family and friends in
memory of James A. Linen III, Class of 1934, Trustee of the College from 1948 to 1953 and from 1963 to 1982.

COURSES IN CHINESE (Div. I)
The department regularly offers four levels of instruction in Modern Standard Chinese (Mandarin), designed to
enable the student to become proficient in aural comprehension, speaking, reading, and writing, as well as
introductory courses in Cantonese, Taiwanese, Classical Chinese, and Chinese linguistics. The course numbering
system for Chinese is sequential. Students move from Chinese 101-102 to 201, 202, 301, 302, 401, and 402. Inde-
pendent study (Chinese 497, 498) may be offered depending on student needs and available resources. Those stu-
dents entering with proficiency in Chinese should see the Coordinator concerning placement.
The department also offers courses on Chinese literature and culture in English translation for students who
wish to become acquainted with the major achievements in Chinese literary, intellectual and cultural history. For
the purpose of the distribution requirement, all courses in Chinese are considered Division I unless otherwise
noted.
STUDY ABROAD
Students majoring in Chinese are strongly encouraged to study in mainland China or Taiwan during one or both
semesters of their junior year, during the summer, or over Winter Study. It is important that students interested in
any of these options consult as early as possible with the department and the Dean's Office concerning acceptable
programs.
CHIN 101(F)-W88-102(S) Basic Chinese (D)
An introduction to Mandarin, the language with the largest number of native speakers in the world, which is the
official language of China and Taiwan, and one of the official languages of Singapore. Course objectives are for
the student to develop simple, practical conversational skills and acquire basic proficiency in reading and writing
in both the traditional and the simplified script at about the 500-character level. The relationship between language
and culture and the sociolinguistically appropriate use of language will be stressed throughout. Both audio and
video materials will be employed extensively.
Format of spoken classes: dialog performance, drills, communicative exercises. Format of written classes: oral
reading, questions and discussion in Chinese, translation and explanation in English. Evaluation is based on class-
room performance, homework, quizzes, unit tests, and an oral and written final exam.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 12 per section (expected: 10 per section). Preference given to first-years and
sophomores.
Credit granted only if both semesters and the winter study sustaining program are taken.

CHIN 131(S) Basic Cantonese
An introduction to Standard Cantonese, a major regional language of southern China which is spoken by over 50
million people in Hong Kong, Macao, Guangdong, and Guangxi as well as by many overseas Chinese in South-
east Asia, Hawaii, and North America. Due to the pervasive influence of Hong Kong as well as the economic
transformation of Guangdong Province, the prestige of Cantonese within China has been rising steadily over the
Asian Studies
­ 90 ­
past few decades. Our focus in this course will be on developing basic listening and speaking skills, though we will
also study some of the special characters which have been used for centuries to write colloquial Cantonese. Since
students will ordinarily possess prior proficiency in Mandarin, a closely related language, we should be able to
cover in one semester about as much as is covered in the first two to three semesters of Mandarin.
Evaluation will be based on classroom performance, quizzes, tests, and a final exam.

CHIN 201(F), 202(S) Intermediate Chinese (D)
These two courses are designed to consolidate the foundations built in Basic Chinese and continue developing
students' skills in aural comprehension, speaking, reading, and writing. Upon completion of the courses, students
should be able to speak Chinese with fluency on everyday topics, reach a literacy level of 1000 characters (approx-
imately 1200 common words written in both traditional and simplified characters), read materials written in sim-
ple Standard Written Chinese, and produce both orally and in writing short compositions on everyday topics. Con-
ducted in Mandarin.
Format: drill/discussion/reading. Evaluation will be based on classroom performance, homework, daily quizzes,
weekly written and oral tests, a midterm, and a final exam.

CHIN 251T(S) Crises and Critiques: The Literature and Intellectual History of Early 20th Century
China (Same as Comparative Literature 256T and History 215T) (W) (D)
The first fifty years of the 20th century saw unprecedented changes in almost every sphere of Chinese society. A
political system that had survived in some form for over two millennia abruptly disintegrated. New ideas chal-
lenged orthodox intellectual culture in profound and complex ways. Chinese intellectuals questioned the value of
inherited traditions while simultaneously facing the real possibility of the near total extinction of those traditions.
Literature, which had historically been an important locus of cultural debates, served this role to perhaps an even
greater extent during this tumultuous period, as writers struggled with questions of how to save a country and
culture wracked by internal disintegration and facing urgent external threats. These debates framed many of the
issues that continue to influence the political, intellectual, and literary cultures of the People's Republic of China
and Taiwan to this day. In this course we will examine a broad range of sources that engage the key debates of this
period. This is an EDI course in which we will address such questions as the role of traditional culture versus that
of modern or Western culture, the role of ideology and politics in literary and artistic production, ideas of nation-
hood and cultural identity, and the relationship between the individual and the state. All readings will be in English
translation.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: students will meet with the instructor in pairs for an hour each week. Every other
week the student will write and present orally a 5- to 7-page paper on the assigned topic of that week. In alternative
weeks, the student will write a 2-page critique of the fellow student's paper. There will also be a final paper dealing
with the issues addressed during the course. Evaluation will be based on written work and analysis of the fellow
student's work.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Preference given to Chinese majors.
Tutorial meetings to be arranged. NUGENT
CHIN 301(F), 302(S) Upper-Intermediate Chinese (D)
Although the oral skills will continue to receive attention, there is at this level increased emphasis on reading and
writing. A major goal of the course will be developing students' reading proficiency in standard written Chinese,
the grammar and vocabulary of which differ considerably from the colloquial written Chinese which was
introduced during the first two years of instruction. About half of the course will be devoted to newspaper reading,
with the remainder consisting of several modules that may include short selections from modern Chinese fiction,
films, or other types of performance literature. Both simplified and traditional character texts will be used. Con-
ducted in Mandarin.
Requirements: three 50-minute classes plus a conversation session; primarily reading and discussion; students are
required to write a short essay every other week. Evaluation will be based on classroom performance, homework,
quizzes, tests, and a final exam.

CHIN 352(S) Bridging Theory and Practice: Learning and Teaching Chinese as a Second
Language (Same as Linguistics 383)
This course introduces students to the principles of second language acquisition (SLA), a field of study that inves-
tigates how people learn a foreign language and provides a basis for understanding research related to foreign
language learning and teaching. Theoretical issues to be covered include what it means to know a language, how
one becomes proficient in a foreign language, factors that affect the learning process, and the role of one's native
language. We will also examine what SLA research has discovered about teaching grammar, pronunciation, vo-
cabulary, and writing. The goal is to explore ways in which SLA theories can be applied to facilitate acquisition of
Chinese in terms of learning strategies and curriculum design. This course will be useful to both students who
want to improve their own learning of Chinese and those who plan to teach or conduct research on Chinese. All
readings in English with some examples in Chinese.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, several oral presentations and short
papers, and a final research project.
Prerequisites: Chinese 101 or permission of instructor. No enrollment limit (expected: 8).
Hour: 1:10-2:25 MR C. CHANG
CHIN 401(F), 402(S) Advanced Chinese (D)

eotapes, and films featuring Chinese speakers from various segments of society; and (for reading) newspaper and
magazine articles dealing with Chinese politics and economics as well as selections from modern Chinese litera-
ture. Conducted in Mandarin.
Requirements: two 75-minute classes plus a conversation session; primarily reading and discussion; students are
required to write a short essay every other week. Evaluation will be based on classroom performance, homework,

CHIN 412(S) Introduction to Classical Chinese
Classical or "Literary" Chinese was the standard written language of China from around the seventh century BC
until the 1920s and served for many centuries as an important written language in Japan, Korea, and Vietnam as
well. Moreover, remnants of Classical Chinese are still used frequently in Modern Chinese, in both writing (e.g.,
newspaper, road signs and academic writing) and speech (e.g., proverbs and aphorisms). This course will serve as
an introduction to the basic grammar and vocabulary of Classical Chinese. We will focus on philosophical, politi-
cal, and historical anecdotes from works from the Spring and Autumn period (770-481 B.C.) through the Han
Dynasty (202 B.C. -220 A.D.), as they served as the foundation for the language. While the main objective is to
develop reading proficiency in Classical Chinese, the course will also serve to enhance proficiency in Modern
Chinese through classroom discussion in Mandarin, translation of Classical Chinese into Modern Chinese, and
comparison of Classical Chinese and Modern Chinese vocabulary and grammar. Conducted primarily in Manda-
rin.
Evaluation will be based on classroom performance, homework, tests, and a final exam.

CHIN 431(F) Introduction to Chinese Linguistics (Same as Linguistics 403)
Is Chinese--whose nouns "lack" number and whose verbs have no tense--a monosyllabic, "primitive"
language? Are the Chinese characters a system of logical symbols or "idiographs," which indicate meaning
directly without regard to sound? Should (and could) the characters be done away with and alphabetized? Are
Cantonese, Hakka, and Taiwanese dialects or languages? And what is the relationship between Chinese, Japanese,
Korean, and Vietnamese? These are some of the questions we will be taking up in this one-semester introduction
to the scientific study of the Chinese language. Topics to be covered include: the phonological, syntactical, and
lexical structure of Modern Standard Chinese; the Chinese writing system; the modern Chinese dialects; the
history of the Chinese language; sociolinguistic aspects of Chinese; and language and politics in the Chinese-
speaking countries. Readings in English and Chinese, with class discussion primarily in Mandarin.
Evaluation will be based on classroom performance, homework, two short papers, and one longer paper.

JAPN 254(F) Japanese Literature and the End of the World (Same as Comparative Literature
264)
From the endemic warfare of the medieval era to the atomic bombing and the violent explosion of technology in
the last century, the end of the world is an idea which has occupied a central place in almost every generation of
Japanese literature. Paradoxically, the spectacle of destruction has given birth to some of the most beautiful, most
moving, and most powerfully thrilling literature in the Japanese tradition. Texts may be drawn from medieval war
narratives like The Tale of the Heike; World War II fiction and films by Ibuse Masuji, Imamura Shôhei, and Ichi-
kawa Kon; fantasy and science fiction novels by Abe Kôbô, Murakami Haruki and Murakami Ryû; and apocalyp-
tic comics and animation by Oshii Mamoru, Ôtomo Katsuhiro and Takahata Isao. The class and the readings are
in English; no familiarity with Japanese language or culture is required.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: in-class exam, ungraded creative project, and a few short response as-

JAPN 256(S) Confession and Deception in Japanese Literature (Same as Comparative
Literature 266)
Situated at the origins of Japanese literature are the beautiful and revealing diaries of ladies in waiting of the tenth-
century imperial court. Since that time, Japanese literary tradition has placed great value on confessional writing of
many kinds, from Sei Shônagon's classical Pillow Book and the haiku master Bashô's eighteenth-century travel
diaries to postwar autobiographical fiction by writers like Mishima and Tanizaki. The source of interest in many of
these texts lies in their combination of self-revelation and concealment or deception. This course asks what it
meant for these authors to write from their own experience, and also what new things we can reveal in their work
by writing about it ourselves. The class and the readings are in English; no familiarity with Japanese language or
culture is required.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: in-class exam, ungraded creative project, and a few short response as-

Some of Japan's performance traditions, which developed in different historical settings, have survived to this day
and continue to coexist and compete for the attention of audiences both domestically and abroad. This course
examines the Japanese literature of three major periods in Japan's history, focusing on how literary and perfor-
mance traditions have been interrelated in the unfolding of Japanese literary history. We will begin by looking into
the Heian period (794-1185), when the work of female authors occupied center stage and some of the canonical
texts of the Japanese literary and cultural tradition were born. Next we will consider the medieval period
(1185-1600), which saw the rise of the samurai class and the consequent shift in the domain of artistic creation.
Then we will look at the Edo period (1600-1867), when a new bourgeois culture flourished and audiences were
greatly transformed. We will also explore the continuing force of premodern literary traditions in contemporary
performing arts. All readings and discussions will be in English.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: active class participation, presentations, written journals, two essay
questions, one paper, and attendance of live performance events.

ASTRONOMY (Div. III)
Chair, Professor KAREN B. KWITTER
Professors: KWITTER, J. PASACHOFF*. Visiting Professor: DEMIANSKI. Observatory Supervisor/
Lecturer: SOUZA.
How long will the Sun shine? Are there planets like Earth among the many circling other stars? How did the
universe begin and how has it evolved over its 13.7 billion-year history? Astronomy is the science that asks and
tries to answer questions like these. We have come a long way toward understanding what makes the sky appear as
it does and how the Universe is fashioned. The Astronomy Department offers courses for anyone who is interested
in learning about the Universe, and who would like to be able to follow new astronomical discoveries as they are
made. All courses in Astronomy satisfy the Division III requirement. The Astrophysics major, administered joint-
ly with the Physics Department, and the Astronomy major, are described below.
The beginning astronomy courses are offered on two levels. Astronomy 101, 102, 104, and 330-range courses
are intended primarily for non-science majors, and have no prerequisite. Astronomy 111 is designed for students
with some exposure to or interest in physics. It has a prerequisite of one year of high school physics or permission
of the instructor, and a corequisite of Mathematics 104 or equivalent background in calculus.
Most of the astronomy courses take advantage of our observational and computational facilities including a
24-inch computer-controlled telescope with sensitive electronic detectors, and our own computer network for
image processing and data analysis. The Astronomy Department homepage can be found at http://www.wil-
liams.edu/Astronomy.
ASTROPHYSICS MAJOR
The Astrophysics major is designed for students who want a rigorous introduction to the field, and includes not
only those who plan graduate study in astronomy, astrophysics, or a closely related area, but also those interested
in a wide variety of careers. Alumni are not only astronomers but also computer scientists, geologists, teachers,
doctors, lawyers, business school professors, and so on. In recent years, many astrophysics majors have had a
second major in fields as wide ranging as mathematics, geosciences, economics, and art history. This major em-
phasizes the description of the Universe and its constituents in terms of physical processes. Potential Astrophysics
majors should consult early with members of the Astronomy and Physics Departments to determine their most
appropriate route to and through the major. An essential ingredient in such students' undergraduate training is
experience in physics and mathematics. Therefore, the major normally will begin in the first year a student is at
Williams with Physics 131, 141, or 151 and Mathematics 104 or 105 or 106 in the fall. Students with very good
background placing them out of Physics 142 and out of Mathematics 104 may choose to take Physics 201 and
Mathematics 105 or 106 instead. Astronomy 111 will often be taken in the fall of the sophomore year; however,
many students take it in the fall of their first year at Williams, along with physics and math. Students who might
place out of physics courses should read the section on placement under Physics; those who place out of Physics
131 or 141 into Physics 142 or 151 should particularly consider taking Astronomy 111 in the fall of their first year.
In addition to the major courses described below, other courses in geosciences, mathematics, and computer
science may also be appropriate.

The total number of courses required for the Astrophysics major, an interdisciplinary major, is eleven. Students
entering with Advanced Placement in physics and/or mathematics may obtain credit toward the major for the
equivalent of Physics 141 and/or Mathematics 104 and/or 105 or 106 taken elsewhere, but at least 8 courses in
astronomy, physics, and mathematics must be taken at Williams. There are some aspects of astrophysics that are
closely related to chemistry or geosciences. In recognition of this relation, certain advanced courses in those de-
partments can be accepted for credit toward the Astrophysics major on a two-for-one basis. It is not possible to
double major in Astrophysics and Physics.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN ASTROPHYSICS
The honors degree in Astrophysics will be awarded on the basis of a senior thesis presenting the results of
an original observational, experimental, or theoretical investigation carried out by the student under the direc-
tion of a faculty member in Astronomy or Physics. There are no specific grade requirements (other than Col-
lege-wide requirements for remaining in good academic standing) for entry into the thesis research program;
however, a student wishing to do a thesis should have demonstrated both ability and motivation for indepen-
dent work in previous courses and in any earlier research involvement. Students doing theses will normally
choose a topic and an advisor early in the second semester of their junior year and usually begin their thesis
work during the summer. During the senior year, those students whose proposals have been approved will
elect two courses and a winter study project in addition to the minimum requirements for the major. Prepara-
tion for the thesis will occupy at least one course (Astrophysics 493) and the winter study project (Astrophys-
ics 031). At the end of the winter study period, the departments will decide, in consultation with each student,
whether to admit that student to honors candidacy. Both a written thesis and an oral presentation to faculty and
fellow students are required. The degree with honors will be awarded to those who meet these requirements
with distinction. The degree with highest honors will be awarded to those who fulfill the requirements with
unusually high distinction.
The departments will be flexible with regard to the number and timing of courses devoted to thesis research
within the general guidelines of two courses and a winter study project over and above the minimum major re-
quirements and the written and oral presentations, especially in cases of students with advanced standing and/or
summer research experience. Students considering unusual requests are urged to consult with potential advisors or
the department chairs as early as possible.
ASTRONOMY MAJOR
The Astronomy major is designed for students with an interest in learning about many aspects of modern as-
tronomy, but who do not choose to take the advanced physics courses of the astrophysics major. It is also appropri-
ate as a second major for students concentrating in another field. The Astronomy major emphasizes understanding
the observed properties of the physical systems that comprise the known Universe, from the Sun and solar system,
to the evolution of stars and star clusters, to the Milky Way Galaxy, to external galaxies and clusters of galaxies.
Because some knowledge of physics and calculus is necessary to understand many astronomical phenomena, the
Astronomy major requires the first two semesters each of the physics and calculus that are also required of Physics
majors and Astrophysics majors.
There are several possible routes through the Astronomy major, depending on preparation and interest. Stu-
dents considering a major in Astronomy should consult with members of the department early and often. A first-
year student, unsure about choosing between Astronomy and Astrophysics, may wish to take not only Astronomy
111 but also Physics 131, 141, or 151 and Mathematics 104 (if necessary) in the fall. Students who might place out
of physics courses should read the section on placement under Physics.

for remaining in good academic standing) for entry into the thesis research program; however, a student wishing to
do a thesis should have demonstrated both ability and motivation for independent work in previous courses and in
any earlier research involvement. Students doing theses will normally choose a topic and an advisor early in the
second semester of their junior year and usually begin their thesis work during the summer. During the senior year,
those students whose proposals have been approved will elect two courses and a winter study project in addition to
the minimum requirements for the major. Preparation for the thesis will occupy at least one course (Astronomy

ASTRONOMY COURSES
COURSES FOR NON-MAJORS WITH NO PREREQUISITES
ASTR 101(F) Stars: From Suns to Black Holes
What makes a star shine? For how long will the Sun keep shining? What are black holes and how can they form?
Astronomy 101, a non-major, general introduction to the part of contemporary astronomy that includes how stars
form and how they end their existence, will provide answers to these questions and more. The course gives special
attention to the exciting discoveries of the past few years. Topics include modern astronomical instruments such as
the Hubble Space Telescope, the Spitzer Space Telescope, the Chandra X-ray Observatory, the new generation of
8- and 10-meter mountaintop telescopes, and results from them; how astronomers interpret the light received from
distant celestial objects; the Sun as a typical star (and how its future will affect ours); and our modern understand-
ing of how stars work and how they change with time. We will also discuss how pulsars and black holes result
from the evolution of normal, massive stars and how giant black holes are at the center of galaxies and quasars. We
will discuss the discovery of planets around stars other than the Sun. We regularly discuss the latest news briefs
and developments in astronomy and relate them to the topics covered in the course. This course is independent of
and on the same level as Astronomy 102 and 104, and students who have taken those courses are welcome.
Observing sessions will include use of the 24-inch telescope and other telescopes for observations of stars, star
clusters, planets and their moons, nebulae, and galaxies, as well as daytime observations of the Sun.
Format: lecture (three hours per week), observing sessions (scattered throughout the semester), afternoon labs
(five times per semester), and a planetarium demonstration. Evaluation will be based on two hour tests, a final
exam, an observing portfolio, and laboratory reports.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 48 (expected: 48). Non-major course.

ASTR 104(S) The Milky Way Galaxy and the Universe Beyond
It has been only about 85 years since the Sun was discovered not to be at the center of the Milky Way Galaxy, and
only 80 years since our Milky Way Galaxy was determined to be only one of countless "island universes" in space.
A host of technological advances is enabling us to understand even more clearly our place in the universe and how
the universe began. For example, the Hubble Space Telescope, the Spitzer Space Telescope, and the Chandra X-
ray Observatory bring clearer images and cover a wider range of the spectrum than has ever been obtainable be-
fore; they are speeding up progress on determining the past and future of the Universe. They are confirming and
enlarging our understanding of the Big Bang. In addition, the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe space-
craft's study of the early Universe and large-scale mapping programs are giving clues into how the Universe's
currently observed structure arose. Astronomy 104, a non-major, general introduction to part of contemporary
astronomy comprising the study of galaxies and the Universe, explores the answers to questions like: What is the
Milky Way?; Why are quasars so luminous?; Is the Universe made largely of "dark matter" and "dark energy"?;
What determines the ultimate fate of the Universe? We regularly discuss the latest news briefs and developments
in astronomy and relate them to the topics covered in the course. This course is independent of, and on the same
level as Astronomy 101 and 102, and students who have taken those courses are welcome.

ASTR 332(S) A Guide to Black Holes and Other Exotic Astronomical Objects
What is a black hole? Are we inside a huge black hole? What are neutron stars and pulsars? The lives of different
kinds of stars will be examined, with an emphasis on scenarios of the late phases of stellar evolution. Starting with
a general description of stars and their evolution and the physical processes taking place in their centers, this course
will discuss the final outcomes of stellar evolution: white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes. We will discuss
how neutron stars were discovered and later led to the very important discovery of gravitational waves and extra-
solar planets. Detailed discussion of the bizarre properties of black holes will concentrate on relativistic effects,
methods of observation and finally observational proofs of their existence. Recent astronomical observations with
the most powerful telescopes, including the Hubble Space Telescope and Chandra X-ray Observatory, revealed
that the Universe contains many more black holes than previously expected and almost every galaxy harbors a
super massive black hole at its center. Hypothetical but very interesting possibilities of time travel and quantum
effects connected with black holes will be covered. Students will have the opportunity to observe with our 24-inch
telescope.
Format: lecture/discussion, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on classroom participation, homework
assignments, a midterm exam and a final exam.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 48 (expected: 48). Closed to first-years and sophomores, and to Physics, As-

Biochemistry and molecular biology are dynamic fields that lie at the forefront of science. Through elucidation
of the structure and function of biologically important molecules (such as nucleic acids, lipids, proteins, and carbo-
hydrates) these disciplines have provided important insights and advances in the fields of molecular engineering
(recombinant DNA technology, "intelligent" drug design, "in vitro evolution"), genomics and proteomics, signal
transduction, immunology, developmental biology, and evolution.
The Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Program is designed to provide students with an opportunity to ex-
plore living systems in molecular terms. Biochemistry and molecular biology are at the interface between the
chemical and biological methods of looking at nature; therefore, the program draws heavily from these disciplines.
While chemistry is concerned with the relationship between molecular structure and reactions, and biology fo-
cuses on cells and organisms, biochemistry and molecular biology probe the details of the structures and interac-
tions of molecules in living systems in order to provide the foundation for a better understanding of biological
molecules both individually and as members of more complex structures.
PROGRAM
While aspects of biochemistry and molecular biology can be very diverse, a common set of chemical and bio-
logical principles underlie the more advanced topics. With this in mind, the program has been structured to provide
the necessary background in chemistry and biology and the opportunity to study the many facets of the modern
areas of the biochemical sciences. Students interested in the Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Program should
plan their course selection carefully. Since it is expected that Biochemistry 321 and 322 would be taken in the
junior year, students are advised to take the prerequisites for those courses in both chemistry and biology during
their first two years at Williams. While the program is open to all students, it is expected that it will appeal primari-
ly to majors in biology and chemistry because of the number of courses required in those fields. In addition to
taking the required courses, students planning to complete the Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Program are
strongly encouraged to elect courses in mathematics and physics.
The following interdepartmental courses serve as the core of the Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Pro-
gram.
BIMO 321 and 322 provide a comprehensive introduction to biochemistry. BIMO 401, the capstone course for
the concentration, provides students the opportunity to examine the current scientific literature in a wide variety of
BIMO-related research areas.
BIMO 321(F) Biochemistry I--Structure and Function of Biological Molecules (Same as Biology
321 and Chemistry 321) (Q)
This course introduces the basic concepts of biochemistry with an emphasis on the structure and function of bio-
logical macromolecules. Specifically, the structure of proteins and nucleic acids are examined in detail in order to
determine how their chemical properties and their biological behavior result from those structures. Other topics
covered include enzyme kinetics, mechanism and catalysis and regulation; the molecular organization of biomem-
Biochemistry and Molecular Biology
­ 99 ­
branes and membrane transport; and the principles of recombinant DNA technologies. In addition, the principles
and applications of the methods used to characterize macromolecules in solution and the interactions between
macromolecules are discussed. The laboratory provides an opportunity to study the structure of macromolecules
and to learn the fundamental experimental techniques of biochemistry including electrophoresis and chromatogra-
phy.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, four hours per week. Evaluation will be based on three hour
exams, a final exam, problem sets and performance in the laboratories including lab reports.
Prerequisites: Biology 101 and Chemistry 251/255 and Chemistry 155/256. No enrollment limit (expected: 25).

BIMO 322(S) Biochemistry II--Metabolism (Same as Biology 322 and Chemistry 322) (Q)
This lecture course provides an in-depth presentation of the complex metabolic reactions which are central to life.
Emphasis is placed on the biological flow of energy including alternative modes of energy generation (aerobic,
anaerobic, photosynthetic); the regulation and integration of the metabolic pathways including compartmentaliza-
tion and the transport of metabolites; and biochemical reaction mechanisms including the structures and mecha-
nisms of coenzymes. This comprehensive study also includes the biosynthesis and catabolism of small molecules
(carbohydrates, lipids, amino acids, and nucleotides). Laboratory experiments introduce the principles and proce-
dures used to study enzymatic reactions, bioenergetics, and metabolic pathways. Format: lecture, three hours per
week; laboratory, four hours per week. Evaluation will be based on several exams, an oral presentation, and per-
formance in the laboratories including lab reports that emphasize conceptual and mathematics analysis of the data
generated.
Prerequisites: Biology 101 and Chemistry 251/255. No enrollment limit (expected: 36).

BIMO 401(S) Topics in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology
This seminar course involves a critical reading, analysis, and discussion of papers from the current biochemistry
and molecular biology literature. Specific topics vary from year to year but are chosen to illustrate the importance
of a wide range of both biological and chemical approaches to addressing important questions in the biochemical
and molecular biological fields.
Format: seminar, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on class discussions and presentations, several
short papers, and a final paper.
Prerequisites: Biology 202 and BIMO 321. Enrollment limit: 12 (expected: 8). Preference given to those complet-
ing the BIMO program; open to others with permission of instructor.

To complete the concentration in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, a student must complete all of the
required courses listed below, take one elective not within the student's major from the list below, and at-
tend at least eight Biology and/or Chemistry Department colloquia. Since the Chemistry Department
counts two biology courses and the Biology Department counts two chemistry courses toward the majors
(each of which can be completed with only eight other courses), a student majoring in either chemistry or
biology would have to take only two or three additional courses to complete the program.

Bioinformatics, genomics, and proteomics are rapidly advancing fields that integrate the tools and knowledge
from biology, chemistry, computer science, mathematics, physics, and statistics in research at the intersection of
the biological and informational sciences. Inspired by the enormous amount of biological data that are being gen-
erated from the sequencing of genomes, these new fields will help us pose and answer biological questions that
have long been considered too complex to address. Research in genomics, proteomics, and bioinformatics will
also significantly impact society affecting medicine, culture, economics, and politics.
The Bioinformatics, Genomics, and Proteomics curriculum involves faculty from the biology, chemistry, com-
puter science, mathematics/statistics, and physics departments and was designed to provide students with an un-
derstanding of these revolutionary new areas of investigation. The introductory level courses, Computation and
biology and Statistics for Biologists are accessible to all students interested in gaining familiarity with the power of
genomic analysis. Students interested in graduate work in bioinformatics, genomics, and proteomics should take
the core courses and five of the recommended courses. Interested students are also encouraged to participate in
independent research with members of the advisory faculty as they explore the development of these new fields.

The Biology curriculum has been designed to provide students with a broad base for understanding principles
governing life processes at all levels, from biochemistry and cell biology to physiology to ecology and behavior.
Courses emphasize fundamentals common to all subdisciplines including the coupling of structure to function, the
transfer of energy in living systems, communication, and the molding of diversity by the evolutionary process. In
upper-level courses and in independent and honors research, students have the opportunity to investigate areas at
the frontiers of modern biology.
Although the Biology major is specifically designed to provide a balanced curriculum in the broader context of
the liberal arts, it is also excellent preparation for graduate studies in the life sciences and in the health professions.
MAJOR REQUIREMENTS
In order to make the major accessible to students with diverse interests, required courses are kept to a minimum.
The Biology major is satisfied by nine courses, as follows:
Biology 101 The Cell
Biology 102 The Organism
Biology
­ 101 ­
Biology 202 Genetics
Any two 300-level courses, each of which must have a laboratory associated with it.
Any one 400-level course other than 493-494.
Any other three courses or any other two courses and two semesters of Organic Chemistry.
NOTE: Independent study courses and AMS 311 (Same as Biology 231) do not fulfill the 300-level or
400-level course requirements. WIOX 216, Biology: Evolution, in the Williams Oxford Program qualifies
for major credit.
Distribution Requirement
In order to ensure that majors broaden their knowledge of biology, one of the elective courses for the major
must include an upper-level course covering biological processes at levels of organization above the cell. Courses
that satisfy this distribution requirement are indicated in the individual course description.
COURSE SELECTION AND PLACEMENT
It is preferable for students who plan to major in biology, or think they may be interested in doing so, to take
Biology 101, 102 during their first year at Williams. It is also possible to begin the Biology major during the soph-
omore year, although students should understand that it may require taking two or more biology courses during
several semesters.
Students interested in biology, whether or not they intend to major in it, are encouraged to take Biology 101,
102. It is also possible, with permission of the instructor, to take Biology 203 Ecology, Biology 204 Animal Behav-
ior, Biology 220 Field Botany and Biology 225 Natural History of the Berkshires without prerequisite. Other
100-level biology courses are designed specifically for students who do not intend to take additional upper-level
courses in biology. All of these courses satisfy the Division III distribution requirement.
Beginning students should normally enroll in Biology 101 and 102. Students with unusually strong back-
grounds in biology, such as those with outstanding performance on the College Board Biology Advanced Place-
ment Test, may be permitted to elect a sophomore-level course in lieu of Biology 101 and/or Biology 102 upon
successful completion of a departmental qualifying exam, administered during First Days.
COURSES RELATED TO THE BIOLOGY MAJOR
Students planning to pursue their interest in biology and related fields after completing their undergraduate de-
grees are strongly encouraged to take one year of chemistry, at least one semester of mathematics (a course in
statistics is recommended), and one semester of physics. Students may wish to check the requirements for gradu-
ate admission at relevant universities, and are also encouraged to consult with the Biology Department's graduate
school advisor about prerequisites for admission to graduate programs.
BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
Students interested in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (BIMO) should consult the general statement un-
der Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.
BIOINFORMATICS, GENOMICS AND PROTEOMICS
Students interested in Bioinformatics, Genomics and Proteomics (BiGP) should consult the general statement
under Bioinformatics, Genomics and Proteomics. Biology majors interested in this field are strongly encouraged
to enroll in Integrative Bioinformatics, Genomics, and Proteomics (Biology 319).
NEUROSCIENCE
Students interested in Neuroscience (NSCI) should consult the general statement under Neuroscience.
ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
Students interested in Environmental Studies (ENVI) should consult the general statement under Environmen-
tal Studies.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN BIOLOGY
In order to be recommended for the degree with honors, a Biology major is normally expected to have com-
pleted the equivalent of two semesters and a winter study (031) of independent research culminating in a thesis
which demonstrates outstanding achievement of an original and innovative nature. Although the presentation of a
thesis and associated oral presentation in the fall and poster defense in the spring are required for consideration for
a degree with honors, their completion should not be interpreted as a guarantee of a degree with honors. The prin-
cipal considerations in admitting a student to the program of independent honors research will be mastery of fun-
damental material and skills, ability to pursue independent study successfully, and demonstrated interest and mo-
tivation. Students interested in participating in the honors program should consult with the department early in the
spring semester of the junior year; approval must be received before spring registration in the junior year.
The minimum course requirements for a degree with honors in Biology are Biology 101, Biology 102, Biology
202, two 300-level biology courses (each of which must have a laboratory associated with it), one 400-level biolo-
gy course, Biology 493, Biology 494, WSP 031, and any other two courses in biology (or any other one course and
two semesters of Organic Chemistry).
In addition to the normal honors route, which includes two semesters (Biology 493-494) and a winter study of
research (WSP 031) during senior year, students have the option, subject to the approval of their thesis advisor, to
begin the honors research during winter study junior year or during the second semester junior year. Students be-
ginning honors in winter study of junior year would take Biology 494 in the spring of their junior year followed by
Biology 493 in the fall of their senior year; students beginning honors during the second semester of junior year
would take Biology 494 that semester, followed by Biology 493 in the fall of senior year and winter study research
in the winter of the senior year.
STUDY ABROAD
Students planning on majoring in Biology are strongly advised to take Biology 202 before going abroad, since
Biology 202 is required for the major and a prerequisite for many upper-level courses; a Genetics course taken
Biology
­ 102 ­
while studying away cannot substitute for Biology 202. Biology majors studying abroad may receive credit to-
ward the major for at most two 200-level electives; the departmental distribution requirement can be satisfied
through an appropriate course taken during study abroad. Students should meet with the Department Chair to dis-
cuss study abroad options.
CREDIT FOR COURSES AT OTHER INSTITUTIONS
Students who enroll in study away programs may receive credit for up to two 200-level electives towards the
biology major upon approval of the course syllabi by the Biology Department Chair.
Students wishing to satisfy prerequisites for courses offered by the Biology Department with courses taken at
other institutions should consult, in person, with a member of the Biology Department, prior to registering for the
course that requires a prerequisite. Such consultations will include a review of the course syllabi and the transcripts
of the relevant previous college work, and students should bring these materials with them.

BIOL 134(F) The Tropics: Biology and Social Issues (Same as Environmental Studies 134) (D)
Intended for the non-scientist, this course explores the biological dimensions of social issues in tropical societies,
and focuses specifically on the peoples and cultures of tropical regions in Africa, Asia, Latin America, Oceanea,
and the Caribbean. Tropical issues have become prominent on a global scale, and many social issues in the tropics
are inextricably bound to human ecology, evolution, and physiology. The course begins with a survey of the tropi-
cal environment of humans, including major climatic and habitat features. The next section focuses on human
population biology, and emphasizes demography and the role of disease particularly malaria and AIDS. The final
part of the course covers the place of human societies in local and global ecosystems including the challenges of
tropical food production, the importance of organic diversity, and the interaction of humans with their supporting
ecological environment.
Format: lecture/debate, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on two hour exams, a short paper, panel
preparation, and a final exam.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 100 (expected: 80). Preference given to seniors, juniors, sophomores, and first-
year students-- in that order. Does not count for major credit in Biology.
This course fulfills the EDI requirement. Through lectures, debates and readings, students confront social issues in
the tropics from the perspective of biologist. This builds a framework for life long exploration of human diversity.
Hour: 10:00-10:50 MWF D. C. SMIITH
BIOL 202(F) Genetics (Q)
Genetics, classically defined as the study of heredity, has evolved into a discipline whose limits are continually
expanded by innovative molecular technologies. This course covers the experimental basis for our current under-
standing of the inheritance, structures, and functions of genes. It introduces approaches used by contemporary
geneticists and molecular biologists to explore questions about aspects of biology ranging from embryonic devel-
opment to aging. The laboratory part of the course provides an experimental introduction to modern genetic analy-
sis. Laboratory experiments include linkage analysis, bacterial transformation with plasmids and DNA restriction
mapping.
Format: lecture/laboratory, six hours per week. Evaluation will be based on biweekly problem sets, weekly labora-
tory exercises and laboratory reports, and three examinations; 90% of the final grade is determined by perfor-
mance on written exercises and exams.
Prerequisites: Biology 101 and 102. No enrollment limit (expected: 85).
Hour: 11:00-11:50 MWF Lab: 1-4 M,T,W,R ALTSCHULER
BIOL 203(F) Ecology (Same as Environmental Studies 203) (Q)
This course combines lectures with field and indoor laboratory exercises to explore factors that determine the dis-
tribution and abundance of plants and animals in natural systems. The course begins with an overall view of global
patterns and then builds from the population to the ecosystem level. An emphasis is given to basic ecological
principles and relates them to current environmental issues. Selected topics include population dynamics (com-
petition, predation, mutalism); community interactions (succession, food chains and diversity) and ecosystem
function (biogeochemical cycles, energy flow).

BIOL 206T(S) Genomes, Transcriptomes, and Proteomes (W)
This tutorial course, intended for sophomores, explores recent discoveries made possible by analyzing and
comparing organisms' full DNA sequences. From evolution to cancer treatment, genome-wide experiments have
enhanced our understanding of biology. Initially in the course, we consider experimental approaches and tools
used to obtain and analyze DNA sequences. Subsequently, we will examine recent research findings that explore
(i) comparative genomic analyses, (ii) genome-wide changes in expression and mRNA levels (transcriptomes),
and (iii) analysis of proteomes and protein-protein interactions.
The class meets twice per week, once as a full group and once as a tutorial meeting between two students and the
instructor. Every other week at this tutorial meeting, students present a written and oral critical analysis of the
assigned research articles. Students not making a presentation question and critique the work of their colleague.
Format: discussion 75 minutes a week, tutorial meeting 1 hour a week. Evaluation is based on five tutorial papers
of four pages each, five critiques, tutorial presentations, and general participation.

BIOL 209T(F) Animal Communication (W)
Animal communication systems come in as many varieties as the species that use them. What they have in com-
mon is a sender, who encodes information into a physical signal, and a receiver, who senses the signal, extracts the
information, and adjusts subsequent behavior accordingly. This tutorial will consider all aspects of communica-
tion, using different animal systems to explore different aspects of the biology of signaling. Topics will include the
use of syntax to carry meaning in chickadee calls, the "piracy" of signaling system by fireflies, statements of iden-
tity, allegiance and affiliation in the form of toothed whales' signature whistles, and long-distance chemical attrac-
tants that allow male moths to find the object of their desire.

BIOL 218T(S) DNA, Life, and Everything (W)
Since the molecular biology revolution of the 1960s, a view of biology has developed which regards living organ-
isms as predictable products of their encoded DNA programs. A motto for this philosophy and scientific approach
could be "To know my DNA is to know me." In this tutorial we'll examine the power and the limitations of DNA
analysis and manipulation for understanding life. Students will read and discuss scientific articles that deal with
creating artificial life (the field of synthetic biology), environmental DNA sampling (to deduce community struc-
ture; to discover new, uncultured species), human genome diversity surveys (to discover the basis for human phe-
notypic variation and human evolutionary history), comparative genomics to address evolutionary questions (ex.,
chimps compared to humans), reproductive cloning by nuclear transfer, and the genetic and non-genetic nature of
stem cells.
Evaluation will be based on 5 papers (4-5 pages each) and on in-class performance as a presenter or challenger.

BIOL 310(S) Neural Development and Plasticity
Development can be seen as a tradeoff between genetically-determined processes and environmental stimuli. The
tension between these two inputs is particularly apparent in the developing nervous system, where many events
must be predetermined, and where plasticity, or altered outcomes in response to environmental conditions, is also
essential. Plasticity is reduced as development and differentiation proceed, and the potential for regeneration after
injury or disease in adults is limited; however, some exceptions to this rule exist, and recent data suggest that the
nervous system is not as hard-wired as previously thought. In this course we will discuss the mechanisms govern-
ing nervous system development, from relatively simple nervous systems such as that of the roundworm, to the
more complicated nervous systems of humans, examining the roles played by genetically specified programs and
non-genetic influences.
Format: lecture/discussion/laboratory, six hours per week. Evaluation will be based on exams, class participation
and lab reports.
Prerequisites: Biology212/Neuroscience 201. Enrollment limit: 24 (expected: 12). Preference given to Biology

The rapidly evolving field of immunology examines the complex network of interacting molecules and cells that
function to recognize and respond to agents foreign to the individual. In this course, we will focus on the biochemi-
cal mechanisms that act to regulate the development and function of the immune system and how alterations in
different system components can cause disease. Textbook readings will be supplemented with current literature.
Format: lectures, three hours a week; laboratory, three hours a week. Evaluation will be based on exams, laborato-
ry reports, and a research paper.
Prerequisites: Biology 202. Enrollment limit: 24 (expected: 24). Preference given to senior and then to junior Biol-
ogy majors.

BIOL 315(S) Microbiology: Diversity, Cellular Physiology, and Interactions
Bioterrorism and the alarming spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria are but two of the reasons for the resurgence of
interest in the biology of microorganisms. This course will examine microbes from the perspectives of cell struc-
ture and function, genomics, and evolution. A central theme will be the adaptation of bacteria as they evolve to fill
specific ecological niches, with an emphasis on microbe:host interactions that lead to pathogenesis. We will con-
sider communication among bacteria as well as between bacteria and their environment. Topics include: microbial
development, population dynamics, bioremediation, plant and animal defenses against infection, and bacterial
strategies to subvert the immune system. In the lab, major projects will focus on horizontal gene transfer, metage-
nomics, and the isolation and characterization of bacteria from natural environments. Students will also use flow
cytometry to investigate fundamental aspects of the mammalian immune system. The lab experience will culmi-
nate in multi-week independent investigations. Readings will be supplemented by articles from the primary litera-
ture.
Evaluation will be based on three exams, a lab report, and a poster presentation or term paper.
Prerequisites: Biology 202. Enrollment limit: 24 (expected: 24). Preference given to senior and then to junior Biol-
ogy majors.

BIOL 319(F) Integrative Bioinformatics, Genomics, and Proteomics Lab (Same as Chemistry 319,
Computer Science 319, Mathematics 319 and Physics 319) (Q)
What can computational biology teach us about cancer? In this capstone experience for the Genomics, Proteom-
ics, and Bioinformatics program, computational analysis and wet-lab investigations will inform each other, as stu-
dents majoring in biology, chemistry, computer science, mathematics/statistics, and physics contribute their own
expertise to explore how ever-growing gene and protein data-sets can provide key insights into human disease. In
this course, we will take advantage of one well-studied system, the highly conserved Ras-related family of pro-
teins, which play a central role in numerous fundamental processes within the cell. The course will integrate bioin-
formatics and molecular biology, using database searching, alignments and pattern matching, and recombinant
DNA techniques to reconstruct the evolution of the RAS gene family by focusing on the gene duplication events
and gene rearrangements that have occurred over the course of eukaryotic speciation. By utilizing high through-
put approaches to investigate genes involved in various signal transduction pathways, students will identify path-
ways that are aberrantly activated in mammalian cell lines carrying a mutant, constantly active Ras protein. This
functional genomic strategy will be coupled with microscopic examination of tissue sections from a variety of
human colon tumors, using phosphorylation-state specific antisera, to test our hypotheses. Proteomic analysis will
introduce the students to de novo structural prediction and threading algorithms, as well as data-mining ap-
proaches to identify specific amino acids involved in protein-protein contacts. Flow cytometry and mass spec-
trometry will be used to study networks of interacting proteins in normal colon and colon tumor tissue.
Format: lab, with one-hour of lecture per week. Evaluation will be based on lab participation and several short

BIOL 321(F) Biochemistry I--Structure and Function of Biological Molecules (Same as
Biochemistry and Molecular Biology 321 and Chemistry 321) (Q)
This course introduces the basic concepts of biochemistry with an emphasis on the structure and function of bio-
logical macromolecules. Specifically, the structure of proteins and nucleic acids are examined in detail in order to
determine how their chemical properties and their biological behavior result from those structures. Other topics
covered include enzyme kinetics, mechanism and catalysis and regulation; the molecular organization of bio-
membranes and membrane transport; and the principles of recombinant DNA technologies. In addition, the prin-
ciples and applications of the methods used to characterize macromolecules in solution and the interactions be-
tween macromolecules are discussed.
The laboratory provides an opportunity to study the structure of macromolecules and to learn the fundamental
experimental techniques of biochemistry including electrophoresis and chromatography.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, four hours per week. Evaluation will be based on three hour

BIOL 322(S) Biochemistry II--Metabolism (Same as BIMO 322 and Chemistry 322) (Q)
This lecture course provides an in-depth presentation of the complex metabolic reactions which are central to life.
Emphasis is placed on the biological flow of energy including alternative modes of energy generation (aerobic,
anaerobic, photosynthetic); the regulation and integration of the metabolic pathways including compartmentaliza-
tion and the transport of metabolites; and biochemical reaction mechanisms including the structures and mecha-
nisms of coenzymes. This comprehensive study also includes the biosynthesis and catabolism of small molecules
(carbohydrates, lipids, amino acids, and nucleotides). Laboratory experiments introduce the principles and proce-
dures used to study enzymatic reactions, bioenergetics, and metabolic pathways.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, four hours per week. Evaluation will be based on several exams
and performance in the laboratories including lab reports that emphasize conceptual and quantitative and/or graph-
ic analysis of the data generated.

BIOL 413(F) Molecular Basis of Biological Clocks
Circadian rhythms have been described in all organisms studied, including humans, a wide range of other eukary-
otes and several prokaryotes. With periods of about 24 hours, these rhythms regulate biochemical, cellular, physio-
logical and behavioral activities. Circadian rhythms are generated by cellular clocks--genetically determined in-
ternal pacemakers that maintain their oscillations in the absence of environmental cues but may be reset by period-
icities in the environment, especially the light-dark cycle. Only recently have we begun to understand how circa-
dian rhythms are generated and controlled at the cellular level. This course will explore the basic biochemical
features of biological clocks with the aim of understanding their crucial role in regulating key biological parame-
ters, such as enzyme levels, levels of hormones and other regulatory molecules, and activity and sleep cycles.
Class discussions will focus on readings in the original literature.
Format: discussion, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on class participation and several short papers.
Prerequisites: Biology 202. Enrollment limit: 2 sections of 12 per section (expected: 12 ). Open to juniors and

BIOL 414(F) Life at Extremes: Molecular Mechanisms
All organisms face variability in their environments, and the molecular and cellular responses to stresses induced
by environmental change often illuminate otherwise hidden facets of normal physiology. Moreover, many organ-
isms have evolved unique molecular mechanisms, such as novel cellular compounds or macromolecular structur-
al modifications, which contribute to their ability to survive continuous exposure to extreme conditions, such as
high temperatures or low pH. This course will examine how chaperonins, proteases, and heat- and cold-shock
proteins are regulated in response to changes in the external environment. We will then consider how these and
other molecular mechanisms function to stabilize DNA and proteins -and, ultimately, cells and organisms. Other
extreme environments, such as hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor, snow fields, hypersaline lakes, the intertidal
zone, and acid springs provide further examples of cellular and molecular responses to extreme conditions. Bio-
technological applications of these molecular mechanisms in areas such as protein engineering will also be con-
sidered. Class discussions will focus upon readings from the primary literature.
Format: discussion, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on class participation and several short papers.
Prerequisites: Biology 202. Enrollment limit: 12. Open to juniors and seniors, with preference given to senior
Biology majors who have not taken a 400-level course.

BIOL 416(S) Epigenetics
After decades of studies emphasizing the role of DNA in heredity, scientists are now turning their attention from
genetics to a variety of heritable phenomena that fall under the heading of epigenetics, heritable changes that do
not result from an alteration in DNA sequence. Research reveals that stable changes in cell function can result
from, for example, stable changes in protein conformation, protein modification, DNA methylation, or the loca-
tion of a molecule within the cell. Using readings from the primary literature, we will explore the epigenetic nature
and molecular mechanisms underlying a diverse array of phenomena such as prion propagation, genetic imprint-
ing, dosage compensation, transvection, centromere formation, synapse function, and programmed genome re-
arrangements. The significance of epigenetic processes for development, evolution, and human health will be dis-
cussed.
Format: discussion, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on class participation and several short papers.
Prerequisites: Biology 202. Enrollment limit: 12 (expected: 12). Open to sophomores, juniors and seniors, with
preference given to senior Biology majors who have not taken a 400-level course, then to juniors.

BIOL 418(S) Viral Pathogenesis and the Immune Response
Viruses have an absolute requirement for a host in order to replicate. Whether that replication process causes dis-
ease in the host is a secondary byproduct of the ultimate goal of reproduction. Pathogenesis can be caused by the
virus directly, or as a result of the host immune response. This course will focus on the molecular and cellular
interactions between eukaryotic viruses and their hosts and how that interaction causes disease. With a primary
focus on human pathogens, we will examine how viruses evade and modulate the immune response and the chal-
lenges that creates for the development of anti-viral treatments and vaccines.
Format: discussion, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on class participation and several short papers.
Prerequisites: Biology 202. Enrollment limit: Two sections of 12 (expected: 12 per section). Open to juniors and

MAJOR
Through a variety of individual courses and sequential programs, the department provides an opportunity for
students to explore the nature and significance of chemistry, an area of important achievement in our quest for
knowledge about ourselves and the world around us. The student of chemistry is able to become aware of the
special viewpoint of chemists, the general nature of chemical investigation, some of its important results, how
these results are expressed, and something of their significance within the fields of science and in the area of hu-
man endeavor as a whole. The Chemistry major provides excellent preparation for graduate study in chemistry,
biochemistry, chemical engineering, environmental science, materials science, medicine, and the medical
sciences.
A major in chemistry can be achieved in several ways, preferably beginning in the student's first year at Wil-
liams, but also beginning in the sophomore year. Building on a foundation in general chemistry, organic chemistry,
and physical chemistry, a student elects additional advanced courses to complete a major that is consistent with his
or her background in other sciences, interests, and goals. A student's program might emphasize biochemistry, or-
ganic chemistry, physical chemistry, or inorganic chemistry, with additional courses available in analytical chem-
istry, environmental science, and materials science. Students considering a major in chemistry should consult with
a member of the department as early as possible in order to plan a program which best suits their interests and
abilities and which makes full use of their previous preparation.
All students begin their study in the department with either Chemistry 151, 153, or 155. Placement at the
introductory level is based upon performance on the departmental placement test results and consultation with the
chair; results of the College Board Advanced Placement Test or the International Baccalaureate Exam are also
taken into account. The first year is completed with Chemistry 156. In the second year at the introductory level,
students take Chemistry 251 (or 255) and Chemistry 256 (those students who complete 155 are exempted from
256). Completion of a Chemistry major requires either nine semester chemistry courses or eight semester chemis-
try courses plus two approved courses from among the following: Biology 101; Computer Science 134; Mathe-
matics 103, 104, 105, 106; Physics 131, 141; or any courses in these departments for which the approved courses
are prerequisites. Starting at the 300 level, at least three of the courses taken must have a laboratory component,
and at least one must be selected from Chemistry 361, 366, 364, or 367. (The specific course elected, in consulta-
tion with the chair or major advisor, will depend on the student's future plans.) In addition, the department has a
number of "Independent Research Courses" which, while they do not count toward completion of the major, pro-
vide a unique opportunity to pursue an independent research project under the direction of a faculty member.

For the purpose of assisting students in selecting a program consistent with their interests and possible
continuation of their studies at the graduate level, the following groupings of electives and faculty
advisors are suggested. However, a case can be made for selecting courses from the different groups.
Chemistry
­ 109 ­
Biochemistry: Chemistry 321, Chemistry 322, Chemistry 324, Chemistry 341, Chemistry 364, Chemistry
367. Students interested in biochemistry should consult with Professors Gehring, Kaplan, or Lovett.
Organic Chemistry: Chemistry 341, Chemistry 342, Chemistry 344, Chemistry 364, Chemistry 361,
Chemistry 366. Students interested in organic chemistry should consult with Professors S. Goh, Richard-
son, or Smith.
Physical and Inorganic Chemistry: Chemistry 335, Chemistry 336, Chemistry 361, Chemistry 364, Chem-
istry 366, Chemistry 368T. Students interested in physical chemistry should consult with Professors Bin-
gemann, Peacock-López, or Thoman. Students interested in inorganic chemistry should consult with Pro-
fessor C. Goh or Park. Students interested in materials science should consult with Professors C. Goh or
Park.
While any accepted route through the major would permit a student to proceed to graduate study in
chemistry, four electives should be considered a minimum, and at least a semester of research is
strongly recommended.
The department is accredited by the American Chemical Society (A.C.S.), a professional body of aca-
demic, industrial, and research chemists. The A.C.S. suggests the following courses for someone con-
sidering graduate study or work in chemistry or a related area: 151 (153 or 155), 156, 251 (255), 256,
335, 361, 364, 366, 493-494; and at least two courses from 321, 322, 342, 344, 368T, BIMO 401.
Students completing these courses are designated Certified A.C.S. Majors.
BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY (BIMO)
Students interested in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology should consult with the general statement under the
Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Program (BIMO) in the Courses of Instruction. Students interested in com-
pleting the BIMO program are also encouraged to complete the biochemistry courses within the chemistry major
by taking 321, 322, 324, and 367 in addition to the first and second year required courses.
BIOINFORMATICS, GENOMICS, AND PROTEOMICS (BiGP)
Students interested in Bioinformatics, Genomics, and Proteomics should consult the general statement under
Bioinformatics, Genomics, and Proteomics in the Courses of Instruction. Students interested in these areas are also
encouraged to complete the biochemistry courses within the chemistry major by taking 319, 321, 322, 324 and
367 in addition to the first and second year required courses.
MATERIALS SCIENCE
Students interested in Materials Science are encouraged to elect courses from the Materials Science program
offered jointly with the Physics Department, and should consult that listing.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN CHEMISTRY
The degree with honors in Chemistry provides students with an opportunity to undertake an independent re-
search project under the supervision of a faculty member, and to report on the nature of the work in two short oral
presentations and in a written thesis.
Chemistry majors who are candidates for the degree with honors take the following in addition to a major out-
lined above:
Chemistry 493-W31-494 Senior Research and Thesis
The principal considerations in admitting a student to a program of independent research are mastery of funda-
mental materials and skills, ability to pursue independent study successfully, and demonstrated student interest and
motivation. In addition, to enroll in these courses leading to a degree with honors, a student must have at least a B-
average in all chemistry courses or the permission of the chair. At the end of the first semester of the senior year,
the department reviews the student's progress and determines whether the student is a candidate for a degree with
honors. The designation of a degree with honors in Chemistry or a degree with highest honors in Chemistry is
based primarily on a departmental evaluation of the accomplishments in these courses and on the quality of the
thesis. Completion of the research project in a satisfactory manner and preparation of a well-written thesis usually
results in a degree with honors. In cases where a student has demonstrated unusual commitment and initiative
resulting in an outstanding thesis based on original results, combined with a strong record in all of his or her chem-
istry courses, the department may elect to award a degree with highest honors in Chemistry.
EXCHANGE AND TRANSFER STUDENTS
Students from other institutions wishing to register for courses in chemistry involving college-level prerequi-
sites should do so in person with a member of the Chemistry Department. Registration should take place by ap-
pointment during the spring semester prior to the academic year in which courses are to be taken. Students are
requested to have with them transcripts of the relevant previous college work.
COURSES FOR NON-MAJORS WITH NO PREREQUISITES
Students with principal interests outside of the sciences may extend a secondary school foundation in chemistry
by electing a basic two-semester introductory course of a general nature or they may elect semester courses de-
signed for non-majors. All courses in chemistry satisfy the divisional distribution requirement.
STUDY ABROAD
Students who wish to complete a chemistry major (or chemistry requirements for pre-medical study) as
well as to study abroad during their junior year are encouraged to begin taking chemistry in their first se-
mester at Williams, and should consult with members of the department as early as possible.

CHEM 115(S) AIDS: The Disease and Search for a Cure
Since the discovery of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) in 1983, modern techniques of molecular biol-
ogy have revealed much about its structure and life cycle. The intensity of the scientific investigation directed at
HIV-1 is unprecedented in history. We now know more about this virus than any other known pathogen. However,
the early optimism concerning the prospects for an effective AIDS vaccine has now waned and HIV strains that
are resistant to drug therapies are common. We are now nearly three decades into the AIDS pandemic and the
World Health Organization estimates that there are more than 33 million HIV-infected persons worldwide.
After an introduction to chemical structure, we examine the molecular biology of the HIV virus, the molecular
targets of anti-HIV drugs, and the prospects for a cure. We look at how HIV-1 interacts with the human immune
system and discuss both old and new methods of vaccine development as well as the prospects for making an
effective AIDS vaccine.
This course is designed for the non-science major who does not intend to pursue a career in the natural sciences.
Format: lecture, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on problem sets, a midterm, quizzes, a final exam,

CHEM 322(S) Biochemistry II--Metabolism (Same as BIMO 322 and Biology 322) (Q)
This lecture course provides an in-depth presentation of the complex metabolic reactions which are central to life.
Emphasis is placed on the biological flow of energy including alternative modes of energy generation (aerobic,
anaerobic, photosynthetic); the regulation and integration of the metabolic pathways including compartmentaliza-
tion and the transport of metabolites; and biochemical reaction mechanisms including the structures and mecha-
nisms of coenzymes. This comprehensive study also includes the biosynthesis of small molecules (carbohydrates,
lipids, amino acids, and nucleotides). Laboratory experiments introduce the principles and procedures used to
study enzymatic reactions, bioenergetics, and metabolic pathways.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, four hours per week. Evaluation will be based on several exams,
a paper, and performance in the laboratories including lab reports that emphasize conceptual and mathematics
analysis of the data generated.

CHEM 324(S) Enzyme Kinetics and Reaction Mechanisms
Enzymes are complex biological molecules capable of catalyzing chemical reactions with very high efficiency,
stereo-selectivity and specificity. The study of enzymatically-catalyzed reactions gives insight into the study of
organic reaction mechanisms in general, and into the topic of catalysis especially. This course explores the meth-
ods and frameworks for determining mechanisms of enzymatic reactions. These methods are based on a firm
foundation of chemical kinetics and organic reaction mechanisms. The first portion of the course is devoted to
enzyme kinetics and catalysis including discussions of transition state theory, structure-reactivity relationships,
Michaelis-Menten parameters, pH-dependence of catalysis, and methods for measuring rate constants. As the
course progresses, the concepts of mechanism and its elucidation is applied to specific enzymatic processes as we
discuss reaction intermediates and stereochemistry of enzymatic reactions. Our discussions of modern methods
include the use of altered reactants, including mechanism-based inactivators and genetically modified enzymes as
tools for probing enzymatic reactions.
Format: lecture, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on problem sets, quizzes, a midterm exam, a paper,
and a final exam.
Prerequisites: Chemistry/Biology/BIMO 321 or permission of instructor. No enrollment limit (expected: 15).

CHEM 335(F) Inorganic/Organometallic Chemistry
This course addresses fundamental issues in chemistry of transition metals and main group elements that are rele-
vant to a variety of important areas, including applications in organic synthetic transformations, medicine, and
industrial and biological catalysis. The course introduces symmetry and group theory concepts, and applies them
in a systematic approach to the study of structure, bonding, and spectroscopy of coordination and inorganic com-
pounds. The course also covers selected inorganic and organometallic reactions and their mechanisms and bioi-
norganic chemistry. Primary literature and review articles are used to discuss recent developments and applica-
tions in the field. The course is supported by a laboratory which involves experiments closely tied to lectures, and
introduces techniques for handling air-sensitive materials and research into catalysts.

CHEM 336(S) Materials Chemistry
Materials Science is a very broad term which describes the study of bulk physical properties of substances, such as
hardness, electrical conductivity, optical properties, and elasticity. Materials chemists bridge the gap between
traditional synthetic chemists and materials scientists, by working to understand the relationships between bulk
physical properties and molecular structure. Many areas of chemistry are grouped under the heading of materials
chemistry including polymer chemistry, solid state chemistry, liquid crystals, conducting polymers, superconduc-
tors, and buckyballs. Materials science holds the promise for the design of new technologies and devices; in this
course, we examine some of the latest developments in materials chemistry, as well as some potential applications
of emerging technologies.
Format: lecture, three hours per week. Evaluation is based on problem sets, reviews of research articles, hour ex-

CHEM 342(S) Synthetic Organic Chemistry (W)
The origins of organic chemistry are to be found in the chemistry of living things and the emphasis of this course is
on the chemistry of naturally-occurring compounds. This course presents the logic and practice of chemical total
synthesis while stressing the structures, properties and preparations of terpenes, polyketides and alkaloids. Modern
synthetic reactions are surveyed with an emphasis on the stereochemical and mechanistic themes that underlie
them. To meet the requirements for the semester's final project, each student chooses an article from the recent
synthetic literature and then analyzes the logic and strategy involved in the published work in a final paper. A
summary of this paper is also presented to the class in a short seminar. Laboratory sessions introduce students to
techniques for synthesis and purification of natural products and their synthetic precursors.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, four hours per week. Evaluation will be based on problem sets,
midterm exams, laboratory work, a final project, and class participation.
Prerequisites: Chemistry 251/255. May be taken concurrently with Chemistry 256 with permission of instructor.

CHEM 361(F) Physical Chemistry: Structure and Dynamics
This course integrates a number of physical chemistry topics. An introduction to quantum mechanics provides
students with the basis for understanding molecular structure. Statistical mechanics is then used to demonstrate the
formal and quantitative link between the properties of single molecules and the thermodynamic and kinetic behav-
ior of macroscopic collections of molecules. Rate laws, molecular dynamics, and transport properties are dis-
cussed. Applications of these principles are chosen from a variety of areas, including polymer chemistry, bio-
chemistry, photochemistry, and solid and liquid state chemistry. Quantitative laboratory experiments and consulta-
tion with the scientific literature provide the background necessary for carrying out an independent theoretical or
experimental project.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, four hours per week. Evaluation will be based on problem sets,
laboratory work, two exams, and an independent project.

CLASSICS (Div. I)
Chair, Professor KERRY CHRISTENSEN
Professors: CHRISTENSEN, HOPPIN. Assistant Professors: DEKEL*, WILCOX. Visiting Assistant
Professor: LOVELL.
The course offerings in Classics enable students to explore the ancient Greek, Roman, and Greco-Roman
worlds from various perspectives: art, archaeology, philosophy, religion, and especially literature and history.
Courses are of two types: language (Greek and Latin) and translation (Classical Civilization). The 100-level lan-
guage courses are intensive introductions to Greek and Latin grammar; the 200-level language courses combine
comprehensive grammar review with readings from Greek or Latin texts of pivotal historical periods; the 400-lev-
el language courses explore in depth selected authors or topics and the methods of analysis appropriate to each of
them. Courses in which texts are read in translation provide both introductory surveys and opportunities for more
specialized study of the ancient Greco-Roman world from earliest historical times through late antiquity.
MAJOR
Majors and prospective majors are encouraged to consult with the department's faculty to ensure a well-bal-
anced and comprehensive selection of Classics courses appropriate to their individual interests. A course or
courses in ancient history are strongly recommended. Majors may also benefit from advice on courses offered in
other departments which would complement their particular interests in Classics. A reading knowledge of French,
German, and Italian is useful for any study in Classics and is required in at least two of these modern languages by
graduate programs in classics, ancient history, classical art and archaeology, and medieval studies.
The department offers two routes to the major: Classics and Classical Civilization.
Classics: (1) Six courses in Greek and/or Latin, with at least two 400-level courses in one language; (2)
Three additional courses, elected from the offerings in Greek, Latin, or Classical Civilization or from ap-
proved courses in other departments.
Classical Civilization: (1) Either Classics 101 or 102 and one of Classics 222, 223, or 323; (2) Three additional
courses from the offerings in Classical Civilization or from approved courses in other departments. (3) Three
courses in Greek or Latin with at least one at the 400 level, or four courses in Latin at any level; (4) A senior
independent study is normally required to complete the Classical Civilization major. Several of the courses
elected, including the independent study, should relate to each other in such a way as to reflect a concentration on a
particular genre, period, or problem of Greek and Roman civilization, including topics in ancient art and archaeol-
ogy, religion in the Greco-Roman world, and ancient philosophy.
A number of courses from other departments are cross-listed with Classics and so when offered may be elected
for the major, including ArtH 213 Greek Art and Myth, Philosophy 221 Greek Philosophy and 330 Plato, and
Religion 210 Reading Jesus, Writing Gospels. Appropriate courses that are not cross-listed may also count toward
the major with the approval of the Chair of Classics. Examples of such courses, which vary from year to year, are
Classics
­ 115 ­
Art History 105 Picturing God in the Middle Ages, History 225 The Middle Ages, Religion/Jewish Studies 201
The Hebrew Bible, Religion 212 The Development of Christianity, and Political Science 231 Ancient Political
Theory.
Senior Colloquium: Senior majors are required to enroll in CLAS 499 in both semesters. The topics and activi-
ties of this colloquium, which normally meets every other week for an hour, vary according to the interests of the
participants. Junior majors are also encouraged to participate.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN CLASSICS
Students who wish to be considered for the degree with honors will normally present a thesis or pursue ap-
propriate independent study in the fall and winter study of their senior year. The thesis or independent study offers
students the opportunity to work in depth on a topic of their choosing and to apply and develop the techniques and
critical methods with which they have become acquainted during their regular course work. It may also include
relevant work with members of other departments. In order to write a thesis, students normally must have a mini-
mum GPA of 3.3 in their major courses and must submit a thesis proposal before the end of the spring semester of
their junior year that earns departmental approval. To be awarded the degree with honors in Classics, the student is
required to have taken a minimum of ten semester courses in the department (not including the thesis or indepen-
dent study) and to have demonstrated original or superior ability in studies in the field both through course work
and through the thesis or equivalent independent study.
COURSE NUMBERING SYSTEM
Language Courses: The numbering of courses through the 300 level reflects the prerequisites involved. The
only prerequisite for any 400-level course is Greek 201 or Latin 302, or equivalent language preparation. The
numbering of the 400-level courses partially reflects the order in which they are offered over a two-year period for
Greek and a three-year period for Latin. It also indicates a good order in which to take the 400-level courses but not
an essential order, and individual students may enter the sequence at any point. While not every student will take
every course, the rotation of 400-level courses is arranged to permit exposure, in a three- to four-year period, to
most of the important periods and genres of classical studies.
Classical Civilization Courses: The numbering of these courses often suggests a recommended but rarely nec-
essary sequence of study within a given area of classical studies. Most of the translation courses do not assume
prior experience in Classics or a cross-listed field.
STUDY ABROAD
We strongly encourage Classics majors to study abroad in their junior year, at programs in Italy (especially the
semester-length program at the Intercollegiate Center for Classical Studies in Rome), at programs in Greece (espe-
cially the College Year in Athens, which students need only attend for one semester), and in the Williams at Ox-
ford Program. Our majors have also had excellent Classics experiences in other study-abroad programs in Italy
and Greece and at various universities in Europe and the United Kingdom. In addition, we encourage students to
take advantage of opportunities available in the summer: study abroad programs in Italy and Greece, archaeologi-
cal digs, or even carefully planned individual travel to sites in Greece, Italy or other areas of the ancient Greco-Ro-
man world. When the college cannot do so, the department may be able to provide some financial support for
summer study abroad. So that students may learn more about all these opportunities, as well as how best to prepare
for them, the department holds open meetings twice each year. The department's faculty are always available to
advise students, the chair has materials to share, and students can visit the department's website for information
and links to helpful internet sites.
CLASSICAL CIVILIZATION
CLAS 101(F) The Trojan War (Same as Comparative Literature 107)
"The Trojan War" may or may not have taken place near the end of the Bronze Age (c. 1100), but it certainly
provided poets, visual artists, historians, philosophers, and many others in archaic and classical Greece (750-320)
with a rich discourse in which to engage questions about gender, exchange, desire, loss, and remembrance, and
about friendship, marriage, family, army, city-state and religious cult. This discourse of "The Trojan War" attained
a remarkable coherence yet also thrived on substantial variations and changes over the 300-400 years of Greek
literature we will explore, a dynamic of change and continuity that has persisted through the more than two mille-
nia of subsequent Greek, Roman, Western, and non-Western participation in this discourse. More than half the
course will be devoted to the Homeric Iliad and Odyssey, after which we will read brief selections from lyric
poetry (e.g. Sappho of Lesbos) and then several tragedies (e.g., Aeschylus' Oresteia, Sophocles' Ajax, and Euri-
pides' Trojan Women). Depending on time and on the particular interests of the class, we may briefly consider a
few short selections from other ancient Greek and Roman authors and/or one or two modern poets. We will also
watch several films, e.g., Troy, Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?, Gods and Monsters, Fight Club, In the Bedroom,
Grand Illusion, Zorba the Greek.
Format: discussion with short lectures. Evaluation will be based on a series of short papers involving close textual
analysis, two 5-page papers, and contributions to class discussion.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 50 (expected: 50). Preference given to first-year students and sophomores, and
to majors in Classics and Comparative Literature. Not open to students who have taken CLAS 101/COMP 107,
Greek Literature, or CLAS 224/WGST 224/COMP 244, Helen, Desire and Language.
Hour: 2:35-3:50 MR HOPPIN
CLAS 102(S) Roman Literature: Foundations and Empire (Same as Comparative Literature 108)
In the first book of Vergil's Aeneid, the god Jupiter prophesies the foundation and the greatness of Rome: "I place
no limits on their fortunes and no time; I grant them empire without end." Yet elsewhere in this epic account of
Rome's origins, this promise of unlimited power for the descendants of Romulus seems to be seriously abridged.
Some readers have seen, not only in the Aeneid but throughout classical Roman literature, a persistent tendency to
inscribe the decay and disintegration of Roman power into the very works that proclaim and celebrate Roman
Classics
­ 116 ­
preeminence. This course explores the ancient Romans' own interpretations of their past, their present, and their
destiny: the humble beginnings of their city, its rise to supreme world power, and premonitions of its decline. Re-
lated topics for our consideration will include Roman constructions of gender, the location and expression of virtue
in public and private spheres, the connections and conflicts between moral probity and political success, the exer-
cise of individual power versus action on behalf of the commonwealth, the absorption of foreign customs and
peoples into Rome, the management of literal and imaginary frontiers, and other anxieties of empire. We will read
selections and complete works by a wide variety of Roman authors, including Cicero, Catullus, Caesar, Vergil,
Sallust, Horace, Ovid, Seneca, and Tacitus. All readings will be in translation.
Format: discussion/lecture. Evaluation will be based on short written assignments, midterm and final exams with
essays, and contributions to class discussion.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 25 (expected: 15). Preference will be given to first-year students and sopho-
mores and to majors in Classics and Comparative Literature.
Hour: 1:10-2:25 TF WILCOX
CLAS 105(F) The Ancient Novel (Same as Comparative Literature 113)
The "rise of the novel" is often linked to the Industrial Revolution, but a number of fictional prose narratives most
aptly described as novels were composed and widely read under the Roman empire. While the Roman novels of
Petronius (Satyrica or Satyricon) and Apuleius (Metamorphoses, or The Golden Ass) are better known today,
Greek romances recounting the tribulations of unfortunate young lovers, such as Longus' Daphnis and Chloe and
An Ethiopian Story by Heliodorus, enjoyed enormous popular success in their own time. In this course we will
read a good number (seven or so) of the ancient novels that are extant today. To situate these works in their original
cultural context, we will consider the historical evidence for their production, circulation, and readership. We will
also study these works as precursors of the modern novel, examining, for example, their concern or disregard for
realism, and their treatment of the grotesque, miraculous, and fantastic. We will give equal attention to the
relationship these novels bear to other ancient genres, such as satire, pastoral, epic, and "Lives," including those of
saints.
Format: discussion, with occasional short lectures. Evaluation will be based on contributions to class, a midterm,
several short papers and one longer, final paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 25 (expected: 15-20). Preference will be given to majors and prospective ma-
jors in Classics and Comparative Literature, and to sophomores and first-years.

CLAS 208(S) Ancient Greek Religion (Same as Religion 208)
This course will explore the nature and evolution of ancient Greek religion from the Bronze Age (1200s BCE) to
the rise of Christianity, with a special focus on ritual and cultic practices in their cultural and historical context. We
will draw on the rich evidence provided by literary and documentary texts, and also take into account archaeologi-
cal evidence, including works of art such as sculpture and vase painting. We will pay special attention to the role of
ritual in civic and political life, and its role in expressing and forming individual and group identity. We will also
examine the intersection of religion and literature by reading works that describe or depict cultic practice, or that
were composed for performance in ritual contexts.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on several short papers, a midterm, a final research paper, and
class participation.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 25 (expected: 15). If the course is overenrolled, preference will be given to
majors in Classics and Religion.

CLAS 239(S) The Construction of Gender in Ancient Greece and Rome (Same as History 322 and
Women's and Gender Studies 239)
The inferior political status and heavily circumscribed lives of women in ancient Greek and Roman societies have
received extensive study in recent decades. Yet it is nearly impossible to understand women's lives without also
studying the often stringent cultural norms that governed men's lives as well. This course seeks to understand
these aspects of Greek and Roman societies over time as expectations for the behaviors, priorities, and activities of
Classics
­ 117 ­
both women and men evolved. While the impact of these gendered expectations on the lives of men and women
often varied considerably in kind and degree, their interplay was at the same time often intricate, and many that
constructed women's lives could only be articulated with reference to corresponding expectations for men. Others
emerged only during times of crisis and could even involve a reversal of the usual roles of men and women. Some
norms gave men and women a shared experience that is rare in other societies.
We will explore these and related issues by reading widely in such ancient authors as Homer, Sappho, Herodotus,
the Greek tragedians, Greek and Roman philosophers, Vergil and other Latin poets, and Roman didactic writers.
We will also read modern scholarship on such subjects as the family, prostitution, the exposure of unwanted in-
fants, demography, and the anthropology of gender in both Greek and Roman societies.
Format: lecture and discussion. Evaluation will be based on class preparation and participation, two short 5- to

and changes in Greek culture between the archaic and classical periods. The emphasis will vary from year to year,
but possible subjects to be explored include: the education and socialization of the community's children and
young adults; religion and cult practices; the performative aspects of epic (and choral) poetry and of prose genres
like oratory and the philosophical dialogue; traditional oral poetry and storytelling and the growth of literacy; the
construction of woman, of man; the development of the classical polis.

CLGR 404(S) Tragedy
Tragedy was a hybrid genre invented in sixth-fifth century Athens, where tragic performances in the city's festival
of the Greater Dionysia played a vital role in the democratic polis. This course will focus on reading in Greek a
complete tragedy of Sophokles or Euripides; we will also read in translation several other tragedies, a satyr-play,
and a comedy of Aristophanes. While focusing on questions of particular importance for the play we are reading in
Greek, we will also situate that play in a larger context by exploring, for instance: aspects of the social and political
situations in and for which tragedies were produced; the several performance genres out of which tragedy was
created; developments in the physical characteristics of the theater and in elements of staging and performance;
problems of representation particularly relevant to theatrical production and performance.
Format: recitation/discussion. Evaluation will be based on contributions to class, several 1- to 2-page papers
involving close textual analysis, perhaps a midterm exam, a final exam, and a final paper.

CLGR 407(F) Rhetoric and Democracy: the Greek Orators
The Greek orators of the 4th-century BCE have left us a rich and varied body of work. They were specialists in
rhetoric and persuasive discourse, and in the deployment of the one to produce the other. They wrote forensic
oratory intended to sway juries, often with little reference to the facts of the case; political speeches with which
they argued policy before the Athenian Assembly and aspired to be the city's leaders; attack speeches which they
hoped would destroy their rivals; and show pieces intended to dazzle the listener with their rhetorical brilliance.
Political careers were launched not by the noble birth and military success that were so important in the previous
century, but by high-profile prosecutions won by oratorical prowess. In their own words, the most influential ora-
tors of 4th-century Athens will instruct us in rhetoric, demonstrate the stylistic versatility of the Greek language,
teach us about what Athenians in the 4th century cared about, reveal theories of human psychology, and persuade
us of a thing or two. We will read selected speeches by Lysias, Aeschines, and Demosthenes, as well as portions of
speeches by other orators such as Isocrates, Antiphon, and Dinarchus.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class translation and discussion, several short exercises, a midterm, a
final paper, and a final translation exam.
Prerequisites: Greek 201 or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 12 (expected: 6).

LATIN
CLLA 101(F)-102(S) Introduction to Latin
This is a full-year course on the fundamentals of the Latin language. The first semester and part of the second
emphasize learning basic grammar; the rest of the second semester is devoted to reading selections from Latin
poetry (e.g., Vergil's Aeneid and some Medieval Latin poetry, e.g., the Carmina Burana) and from Latin prose
(e.g., Pliny's Letters and/or the Vulgate Bible). This course is designed for the student with no previous preparation
in Latin or who has had only a little Latin and wishes a refresher. Credit is granted for the first semester only if the
second semester is taken as well. Students with some previous experience in Latin may want to enroll in CLLA 102
only: consult the department.
Format: recitation/discussion. Evaluation will be based on frequent quizzes, tests, classroom exercises, and a final
exam.
Enrollment limit: 18 (expected: 10-12).
Hour: 11:00-12:15 MWF First Semester: HOPPIN

CLLA 201(F) Intermediate Latin I: The Late Republic
Reading of selections from Latin prose and poetry, normally from a speech or letters by Cicero and from the poetry
of Catullus. This course includes a comprehensive review of Latin grammar and aims primarily at developing
fluency in reading Latin. At the same time it acquaints students with one of the most turbulent and important peri-
ods in Roman history and attends to the development of their interpretative and analytic skills.
Format: recitation/discussion. Evaluation will be based on classroom performance, quizzes, a midterm, and a final
exam. Occasional oral presentations or short essays may be required as well.
Prerequisites: Latin 101-102 or 3-4 years of Latin in secondary school: consult the department. Enrollment limit:
12 (expected: 6-10).
Hour: 9:00-9:50 MWF LOVELL
CLLA 302(S) Vergil's Aeneid
This course is a comprehensive introduction to Vergil's Aeneid. Students will develop their ability to read and
translate the Latin text of the poem, while at the same time exploring the major interpretive issues surrounding the
definitive Roman epic. Through a combination of close reading and large-scale analysis, we will investigate the
poem's literary, social, and political dimensions with special attention to Vergil's consummate poetic craftsman-
ship.
Format: discussion/recitation. Evaluation will be based on class participation, a midterm exam, a final paper, and a
final exam.

CLLA 406(S) Horace Odes 1-3
Nietzsche claimed that he never had an artistic delight comparable to his experience of reading a Horatian ode.
Through close readings of selected odes in Books 1-3 we will seek to experience such delight for ourselves and to
learn why, as Nietzsche put it, "what is here achieved is in certain languages not even to be hoped for." We will
examine the relation between poetic landscapes, poetic programs and the poetry's exploration of subjects like love,
friendship, youth and old age, death, politics, private morality; the poet's capacity to define himself by offering his
own account of poetic traditions and his place in them; the variety of voices and perspectives within individual
poems and throughout the collection; the demands thereby placed on the poet's audience and the power of the
poetry to transform an audience equal to those demands. It is in terms of this transformational power of poetry that
we will consider Horace's relationship to his contemporaries, particularly Vergil, his patron Maecenas, and Au-

CLLA 407(F) Caesar and Cicero
The one a brilliant strategist, the other preeminent in the courts, Caesar and Cicero were both master politicians
whose ambitions for themselves and for their country brought them into bitter conflict. Their combined oeuvres
provide compelling, detailed accounts of the events and personalities that ended the Roman republic and ushered
in an era of prolonged civil war. Moreover, despite striking differences, their works can justifiably be claimed to be
the twin summits of classical Latin prose. In this course we will read extensive selections from Caesar's commen-
tarii (the Bellum Gallicum and Bellum Civile) and from Cicero's speeches and letters, aiming throughout at a better
understanding of these authors' stylistic achievements as well as the pragmatic persuasive goals that drove their
rhetoric.
Format: recitation/discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, several short written assignments
(such as article reviews), a midterm exam and essay of moderate length, plus a final exam and longer paper.

COGNITIVE SCIENCE (Div. II)
Chair, Associate Professor SAFA ZAKI
Advisory Committee: Professors: DANYLUK***, KIRBY***, H. WILLIAMS. Associate Professors:
CRUZ, ZAKI.
Cognitive science is concerned with how humans, non-human animals, and computers acquire, represent, ma-
nipulate, and use information. As an interdisciplinary field it combines research and theory from computer science
(e.g., artificial intelligence), cognitive psychology, philosophy, linguistics, and neuroscience, and to some extent
evolutionary biology, math, and anthropology. Complex issues of cognition are not easily addressed using tradi-
tional intra-disciplinary tools. Cognitive researchers in any discipline typically employ a collection of analytic and
modeling tools from across traditional disciplinary boundaries. Thus, the methods and research agenda of cogni-
tive science are broader than those of any of the fields that have traditionally contributed to cognitive science. The
Cognitive Science Program is designed to provide students with the broad interdisciplinary foundation needed to
approach issues of cognition.
THE CONCENTRATION
The concentration in Cognitive Science consists of six courses, including an introductory course, four electives,
and a senior research project.
Minds, Brains, and Intelligent Behavior (COGS 222) is the entry point into the concentration, and provides
an interdisciplinary perspective on issues of cognition. Ideally, it should be taken before the end of the sophomore
year. Emphasizing the highly interdisciplinary nature of the field, the four electives must be distributed over at least
three course prefixes. In the fall of the senior year, concentrators will conduct interdisciplinary Research in Cogni-
tive Science (COGS 493), supervised by members of the advisory committee from at least two departments.
REQUIRED COURSES
Cognitive Science 222 Minds, Brains, and Intelligent Behavior: An Introduction to Cognitive Science

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN COGNITIVE SCIENCE
Formal admission to candidacy for honors will occur at the end of the fall semester of the senior year and will be
based on promising performance in COGS 493. This program will consist of COGS W31-494(S), and will be
supervised by members of the advisory committee from at least two departments. Presentation of a thesis, howev-
er, should not be interpreted as a guarantee of a degree with honors.
STUDY ABROAD
Students who wish to discuss plans for study abroad are invited to meet with any member of the Cognitive
Science advisory committee.
COGS 222(F) Minds, Brains, and Intelligent Behavior: An Introduction to Cognitive Science
(Same as Philosophy 222 and Psychology 222)
This course will emphasize interdisciplinary approaches to the study of intelligent systems, both natural and artifi-
cial. Cognitive science synthesizes research from cognitive psychology, computer science, linguistics, neurosci-
ence, and contemporary philosophy. Special attention will be given to the philosophical foundations of cognitive
science, representation and computation in symbolic and connectionist architectures, concept acquisition, problem
solving, perception, language, semantics, reasoning, and artificial intelligence.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: midterm and final exams, and self-paced weekly computer lab exer-
cises.
Prerequisites: Psychology 101 or Philosophy 102 or Computer Science 134. Background in more than one of
these is recommended. Enrollment limit: 25 (expected: 25). Preference given to first-and second-year students.

COMPARATIVE LITERATURE (Div. I)
Chair, Professor GAIL M. NEWMAN
Professors: CASSIDAY, DRUXES, GOLDSTEIN, B. KIEFFER*, KLEINER, LIMON, NEWMAN,

Students motivated by a desire to study literature in the broadest terms, as well as those interested in particular
examples of literary comparison, will find an intellectual home in the Program in Comparative Literature. The
Program in Comparative Literature gives students the opportunity to develop their critical faculties through the
analysis of literature in its international and multicultural context. By crossing national, linguistic, historical, and
disciplinary boundaries, students of Comparative Literature learn to read texts for the ways they make meaning,
the assumptions that underlie that meaning, and the aesthetic elements evinced in the making. Students of Com-
parative Literature are encouraged to examine the widest possible range of literary communication, including the
metamorphosis of genres, forms, and themes.
Whereas specific literature programs allow the student to trace the development of one literature in a particular
culture over a period of time, Comparative Literature juxtaposes the writings of different cultures and epochs in a
variety of ways. Because interpretive methods from other disciplines play a crucial role in investigating literature's
larger context, the Program offers courses intended for students in all divisions of the college and of all interests.
These include courses that introduce students to the comparative study of world literature and courses designed to
enhance any foreign language major in the Williams curriculum. In addition, the English Department allows stu-
dents to count one course with a COMP prefix as an elective within the English major.
The Program supports two distinct majors in Comparative Literature and Literary Studies. The major in Com-
parative Literature requires advanced work in at least one language other than English and is strongly recom-
mended for students contemplating graduate study in the discipline. Both majors provide a strong basis for any
career demanding analytical, interpretive, and evaluative skills and allow the student, within a framework of gen-
eral requirements, to create a program of study primarily shaped by the student's own interests.
MAJORS
Comparative Literature
The Comparative Literature major combines the focused study of a single national-language literature with a
wide-ranging exploration of literary forms across national, linguistic, and historical boundaries. Each student de-
claring the major must select a single foreign language as his or her specialty, although the serious study of litera-
ture in foreign languages other than the student's specialty is strongly encouraged. The languages currently avail-
able are French, German, Ancient Greek, Latin, Russian, and Spanish. Each student will also be paired with a
faculty advisor with whom the student will meet each semester to discuss how best to fulfill the requirements for
the major.
Eleven courses are required for the major:
Comparative Literature 111 The Nature of Narrative
Any three comparative literature core courses. A core course is any course that meets the following
criteria: a) it must treat primarily literature and b) it must be genuinely comparative across cultures
and/or primarily theoretical. The three core courses may be chosen from the offerings of the Program
in Comparative Literature or from the offerings of other departments and programs, including the
foreign language programs and English, Religion, Africana Studies, and Latino/Latina Studies.
Three literature courses in the student's specialty language, in which texts are read in the original. At
least one of the three must be above the 200-level.
Three courses in which most of the course work concerns literature other than that of the student's
specialty language or literary theory. These courses may be selected from Comparative Literature of-
ferings or from other departments and must be approved by the student's major advisor. Only one may
be in English or American literature.
Comparative Literature 401 Senior Seminar (variable topics)
Students who are considering a major in Comparative Literature should aim to acquire intermediate-level profi-
ciency in their specialty language by the end of the sophomore year. They should also complete core course re-
quirements by the end of their junior year. Students pursuing the Comparative Literature major are strongly en-
couraged to study abroad during their junior year and may receive major credit for up to 4 courses taken during
study abroad. At least three courses towards the major must be at the 300 level or above. Students are expected to
take the version of 401 offered in their senior year.
Literary Studies
The Literary Studies major allows for a wide-ranging exploration of literary forms across national, linguistic,
and historical boundaries. Unlike the major in Comparative Literature, the Literary Studies major does not require
the student to choose a specialty language, although the serious study of literature in one or more foreign lan-
guages is strongly encouraged. Each student will be paired with a faculty advisor, with whom the student will meet
each semester to discuss how best to fulfill the requirements for the major.
Eleven courses are required for the major:
Comparative Literature 111 The Nature of Narrative
Comparative Literature
­ 122 ­
Any four comparative literature core courses. A core course is any course that meets the following criteria:
a) it must treat primarily literature and b) it must be genuinely comparative across cultures and/or primarily
theoretical. The three core courses may be chosen from the offerings of the Program in Comparative Litera-
ture or from the offerings of other departments and programs, including the foreign language programs and
English, Religion, Africana Studies, and Latino/Latina Studies.
Five courses devoted to literature or literary theory that cover at least three different national/cultural traditions.
The courses may be selected from Comparative Literature offerings or from other departments and must be ap-
proved by the student's major advisor. Of the courses taken outside of the Program in Comparative Literature, no
more than two may have the same course prefix. Students are strongly encouraged to include courses in a foreign
language among these five.
Comparative Literature 401 Senior Seminar (variable topics)
Students who are considering a major in Literary Studies should aim to complete core course requirements by
the end of their sophomore year. Students who choose to study abroad during their junior year may receive major
credit for up to 4 courses taken during study abroad. At least three courses towards the major must be at the 300
level or above. Students are expected to take the version of 401 offered in their senior year.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN COMPARATIVE LITERATURE OR LITERARY STUDIES
Prerequisites
Honors candidates in Comparative Literature or Literary Studies are required to have maintained a GPA of 3.5
in the major to qualify for submitting a thesis proposal. In addition, candidates must demonstrate a strong interest
in a specific topic for which an appropriate faculty advisor will be available in the senior year.
Timing
Students wishing to pursue a thesis in Comparative Literature or Literary Studies are strongly urged to secure
an advisor by the end of the week after Spring Break in their junior year. By May 15th of their junior year, candi-
dates must submit to the Program Advisory Committee a one- to two-page proposal and a preliminary bibliogra-
phy. The Advisory Committee will inform candidates by June 1 whether they may proceed with the thesis and
advise them about any changes that should be made in the focus or scope of the project. The summer before the
senior year will be spent compiling a more detailed bibliography and preparing for the process of writing the the-
sis.
In their senior year, candidates will devote two semesters and the winter study period to their theses
(493-W31-494). By the end of the Fall semester, students will normally have undertaken substantial research and
produced the draft of at least the first half of the project. At this point students should also have a clear sense of the
work remaining for completion of the thesis. In the course of the Fall semester, students will also have chosen and
met with a second reader for the project, who will provide additional guidance and read the final thesis. By the end
of Winter Study, students should have completed a draft of the entire project. At that time, the Comparative Litera-
ture Advisory Committee, together with the advisor, will determine whether the project may continue as an Hon-
ors Thesis, or whether its first portions (COMP 493-W) will be graded as Independent Studies.
The second semester of independent thesis work will be spent revising as necessary. The completed thesis in its
final form will be due one week before the last day of classes. At the end of the Spring term, the student will make
a public presentation of the final project, to which members of the Advisory Committee will be specially invited.
Characteristics of the Thesis, Evaluation, and Major Credit
The topic of the thesis must be comparative and/or theoretical. It is also possible to write a thesis that consists of
an original translation of a significant text or texts; in this case, a theoretical apparatus must accompany the transla-
tion. The complete thesis must be at least 50 and at most 75 pages in length, excluding the bibliography.
The advisor will assign the grades for the thesis courses (COMP 493-W-494); the Advisory Committee will
determine whether a candidate will receive Honors, Highest Honors, or no honors.
For students who pursue an honors thesis, the total number of courses required for the major-including the the-
sis course (COMP 493-W-494)-is 12, i.e., one of the thesis courses may substitute for one elective.
STUDY ABROAD
The Program in Comparative Literature strongly urges its students to study abroad. Students who have Com-
parative Literature as a major should seriously consider study abroad in a country where their specialty language is
spoken; they will likely be able to complete some of the specialty language courses required for the major during
study abroad. Literary Studies students can also benefit from study abroad; literature courses from abroad are often
candidates for credit as major electives.

genres. We will analyze the ways in which some of the world's best works of fiction, as well as other types of
writing such as newspaper articles and blogs, make use of narrative to communicate their thematic concerns, and
we will accompany the readings with a few pertinent theoretical texts. The works of fiction will include stories
from Antiquity, works by Cervantes, Austen, Gogol, Flaubert, Kafka, and García Márquez. We will also read a
selection of theoretical and critical texts by Aristotle, Walter Benjamin, and a few other literary critics. All readings
in English, although those with foreign language competency are invited to make comparisons with the original
where possible.

COMP 111(S) The Gendered Nature of Narrative (Same as English 120 and Women's and
Gender Studies 111) (W)
We spend our lives telling and listening to stories. Why is that so? Some stories compel us more than others, often
because of their novelty, while others force us forever to reread them even though they are simple, well-worn tales.
Why? These are some of the questions that will engage us in this course, which takes as its main premise the
notion that narrative, in terms of both its production and reception, can be fruitfully examined through the prism of
gender. Do men and women write differently? How do some authors make this apparent in their output? There are
writers for whom the creative process is a form of birthing, and for some it is an act of aggression, a battle waged
against the reader. Still others consider narrative form to be genderless and infinitely protean. In this course, we
will consider oral as well as written narratives and such authors as Margaret Atwood, Sholem-Aleichem, Isaac
Babel, Tahar Ben Jalloun, Isak Dinesen (Karen Blixen), and Julia Voznesenskaya. We will also read selections
from The Thousand and One Nights, examine some examples of relevant critical theory, and view one or two
films.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: active and consistent class participation, three short papers, and a final
project.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference given to students considering a major in Com-

COMP 212(S) Nordic Lights: Literary and Cultural Diversity in Modern Scandinavia (Same as
Women's and Gender Studies 200) (D)
Mythologized as the land of the aurora borealis and the midnight sun, Scandinavia's five distinct nations--Ice-
land, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Finland--are often mistakenly associated with blond-haired and blue-eyed
uniformity. Modern Scandinavia, however, is a place of great social and cultural diversity. From medieval Viking
sagas to contemporary Nordic rap, the Scandinavian literary tradition is rich in tales of global exploration, child-
hood imagination, sexual revolution, and multicultural confrontation. Through readings of nineteenth-century dra-
ma, twentieth-century novels, and twenty-first century cinema, we will investigate a wide range of issues on class,
ethnicity, and identity, including the indigenous reindeer-herding Sami people, Danish colonialism and the Green-
landic Inuit, Norwegian collaboration and resistance during World War II, and Nordic emigration (to North Amer-
ica) and immigration (from Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East). Discussion will also focus on Scan-
dinavia's leadership in gender equality and sexual liberation, Scandinavian political isolation and integration (into
both the UN and the EU), and the global effects of Nordic pop (ABBA to Björk), glamour (Greta Garbo to Helena
Christensen), technology (Volvo to Nokia), and design (IKEA to H&M). Readings to include works by Henrik
Ibsen, August Strindberg, Hans Christian Andersen, Karen Blixen, Astrid Lindgren, Halldór Laxness, Reidar
Jönsson, and Peter Høeg. Films to include works by Ingmar Bergman, Lasse Hallström, Bille August, Colin
Nutley, Lukas Moodysson, Josef Fares, and Tomas Vinterberg. All readings and discussions in English.
Format: seminar. Requirements: active participation, two short papers, an oral presentation, and a final paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15 (expected: 15). Preference given to Comparative Literature and Women's

COMP 231T(S) Postmodernism (Same as English 266T) (W) (D)
In one definition, postmodernism in art and literature is what you get when you combine modernism's radical
experimentation with pop culture's easy appeal. This term has been used to describe works from Andy Warhol's
Comparative Literature
­ 125 ­
paintings of Campbell's soup cans and Jean Baudrillard's critical essays on Disneyland to Thomas Pynchon's
paranoid novel about postal conspiracy, The Crying of Lot 49. Theorists of the postmodern have argued that it
represents not only a radical change in aesthetic sensibilities, but a fundamentally new relationship between art,
language, and society. In this tutorial, we will read some of the most important theoretical essays defining the
postmodern (essays which themselves often embrace this playful and sometimes ironic style), and we will pair
them with artistic texts that are said to illustrate the features of postmodernism. The latter will be mainly novels and
short stories from various countries, but one feature of this theory is a flattening of the distinction between high and
low culture as well as between the written and the visual, so we will also examine examples from film, architec-
ture, visual art, and/or broader pop culture. Along the way will ask whether global theoretical paradigms like post-
modernism can help us understand other cultures better (by locating them within a single universal system), or
whether this approach conceals important cultural differences. Texts will include essays by Jean Baudrillard, Fred-
ric Jameson, Jean-François Lyotard, and others; novels and short stories by writers like Don DeLillo, Jorge Luis
Borges, Italo Calvino, and Murakami Haruki; painting and sculpture associated with Pop Art and Superflat; the
architecture of Williamstown area museums; etc. Writing assignments will focus on reading the theoretical texts
critically and applying their ideas to the artistic texts in creative and interesting ways. Open to sophomores as well
as advanced students.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: After an introductory lecture meeting, students will meet with the instructor in
pairs for approximately an hour each week; they will write a 5-page paper every other week (5 in all), and respond
to their partners' papers in alternate weeks. Emphasis will be on understanding and engaging the criticism that we
read, and comparing the critical and fictional texts creatively in a way that sheds light on both.
Prerequisites: a 100-level literature course (Comparative Literature, English, etc.) and sophomore standing or
higher, or permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Priority will be given to students ma-
joring in a discipline related to critical theory (or considering such a major) and those with a demonstrated inter-
est in the material.

In this tutorial, we will read five novels written between 1850 and 1899, all of which focus on the figure of the
adulteress: Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter (1850), Gustave Flaubert's Madame Bovary (1856), Lev
Tolstoy's Anna Karenina (1873-77), Theodor Fontane's Effi Briest (1894), and Kate Chopin's The Awakening
(1899). For each week of class, students will read one of these primary texts, as well as a selection of secondary
literature that will allow us to understand, over the course of the semester, how and why the adulteress played a key
role in the cultural imagination of Europe and the United States during this time. Students will meet with the pro-
fessor in pairs, with one student from each pair writing a 5-page paper for each class session. All works not origi-
nally written in English will be read in English translation.
Format: tutorial. Evaluation will be based on completion of weekly reading and writing assignments, active en-
gagement during tutorial sessions, and completion of a final synthetic writing assignment.

COMP 308(S) Everyday Life in Literature and Film
To bring the all too familiar everyday to our attention, artists and writers have made it strange. What happens when
we view everyday life from elsewhere? While everyday culture has often been experienced as repressive and
alienating in modern Western societies, a new importance assigned to everyday life made it liberating in Japan
during the twenties and in contemporary China. The contours of the everyday are delightfully vague, and it always
exceeds theorizing. For instance, is its privileged place the street or the home? Is it lived largely in institutions that
regulate our daily lives, or is it lived between and outside them? Everyday objects and commodities like the potato,
the postcard, the car, clothes, housing, etc., will be analyzed. Fiction by Leo Tolstoy, Franz Kafka, Georges Perec,
Manil Suri, Ha Jin, and Banana Yoshimoto. Films by Chantal Akerman, Pedro Almodovar, Benoit Jaquot, and
Pierre Jeunet. Art projects that transform the everyday will also be discussed, including those of Sophie Calle,
Mary Kelley, Mierle Laderman Ukeles, and Christine Hill. Short theoretical excerpts from Freud, Kracauer, Gof-
fman, Lefebvre, de Beauvoir, Friedan, Debord, Foucault, and Bourdieu. All works not originally in English will be
read in English translation.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on two short oral reports on everyday objects and their history, two 3- to
5-page papers, and a 10- to 12-page final paper or creative project.
Prerequisites: one 200-level literature course. Enrollment limit: 20 (expected: 10). Preference will be given to stu-
dents majoring in Comparative Literature and Literary Studies.

COMP 311(F) US-China Foreign Cultural Relations, 1900-1950 (Same as American Studies 311,

Foreign relations between the United States and China, particularly on the level of culture, have emerged as a vital,
if poorly understood, topic in recent years. This course attempts to historicize this interest by exploring a period of
intense US-Sino cultural exchange from the turn of the 20th century to the start of the Cold War. We begin from the
perspective of cultural comparison: how did major American and Chinese authors respectively understand their
place in the world? How did they define and narrate issues such as industrialism, populism, and modernity? How
did they perceive their Chinese or American "Other," and develop new cultural forms to represent these perspec-
tives? In this section we will read major texts by (US) John Dos Passos, Frank Norris, Ezra Pound, Amy Lowell,
Jack London, and (China) Lu Xun, Shen Congwen, Mao Dun, Zhou Zuoren, Yu Dafu. Then, we proceed from an
angle of cultural connection by exploring authors who directly engaged and experienced both cultures, often
building bridges between the two. How did American writers in China use their time abroad to challenge their
own culture, and vice versa? What types of bonds did US and Chinese writers develop during this period? How
did contact and collaboration between these authors lead to new forms of literature and social critique? In this
section, we will read cultural works by (US) Pearl Buck, Agnes Smedley, Edgar Snow, W.H. Auden, and (China)
Lin Yutang, Lao She, Hu Shi, Zhang Ailing. Overall, the goal of this course will be to gain a better understanding
of our current moment of US-Sino contact by examining a period in which most of our present ideas of the "Oth-
er" took shape and crystallized. No reading knowledge of Chinese is required; all readings in Chinese will be
offered in English translation.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: active class participation, weekly response papers, and one final re-
search paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 25 (expected: 20). Preference given to students majoring in Comparative Lit-
erature or Literary Studies and who have previously studied Chinese.

COMP 401(F) Senior Seminar. Sublime Confusion: A Survey of Critical Theory (Same as
English 370)
What does it mean to have a theory of literature? Can something as vital, as varied, and as vague as art or fiction
ever be reduced to anything like a science? We will investigate these questions with a survey of art and literary
theory that takes up a cross section of texts from classical times to the present. We will focus particular attention on
the aesthetic quality called "the sublime"--a category that has often been constituted in opposition to "beauty" to
express the power and the attraction of art that is not beautiful, but whose frightening, confusing, even threatening
aspect is somehow thrilling or appealing. This idea interested early critics from the classical rhetorician pseudo-
Longinus to the German Idealists, as a way to make aesthetics more scientific paradoxically by identifying the
doorway through which art and literature escaped the realm of reason. More recently the notion of literature's
thrilling confusion has played a key role in modern literary theory from Russian formalism to New Criticism,
deconstruction, and postmodernism. (In fact, poststructuralist criticism itself has a thrillingly confusing quality that
we will not ignore.) The class will focus on careful reading of relatively short texts by Plato, pseudo-Longinus,
Burke, Kant, Schiller, Shklovsky, Eichenbaum, I.A. Richards, Barthes, Derrida, Lyotard, and others. We will find
and discuss illustrations drawn from literature, visual media, and contemporary culture.
Format: seminar. Requirements: active class participation, short writing assignments, a polished oral presentation,
and a final 15-page paper.
Prerequisites: a course in critical (art or literary) theory or permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 16 (ex-
pected: 16). Priority will be given to seniors majoring in Comparative Literature, Literary Studies, or a related
discipline, and those with a demonstrated interest in critical theory.

Computers and computation are pervasive in our society. They play enormously important roles in areas as
diverse as education, science, business, and the arts. Understanding the nature of computation and exploring the
great potential of computers are the goals of the discipline of computer science. A sample of the areas of research
investigated by the Williams Department of Computer Science alone illustrates the vast range of topics that are of
interest to computer scientists and computing professionals today. This includes: the use of computer-generated
graphic images in the arts and as a tool for visualization in the sciences and other areas; the protocols that make
transmission of information over the Internet possible, the design of revolutionary new computer languages that
simplify the process of constructing complex programs for computers; the development of machine learning algo-
Computer Science
­ 129 ­
rithms that can extract useful and even novel information from data that is too complex for humans to analyze;
algorithms that can solve problems that were previously too hard to solve in a reasonable amount of time, just by
giving up a little bit of optimality in the solution; the investigation of machine architectures and specific hardware
aimed at making computing fast.
The department recognizes that students' interests in computer science will vary widely. The department at-
tempts to meet these varying interests through: (1) the major; (2) a selection of courses intended for those who are
interested primarily in an introduction to computer science; (3) recommended course sequences for the non-major
who wants a more extensive introduction to computer science in general or who seeks to develop some specific
expertise in computing for application in some other discipline.
MAJOR
The goal of the major is to provide an understanding of algorithmic problem solving as well as the conceptual
organization of computers and complex programs running on them. Emphasis is placed on the fundamental prin-
ciples of computer science, building upon the mathematical and theoretical ideas underlying these principles. The
introductory and core courses build a broad and solid base for understanding computer science. The more ad-
vanced courses allow students to sample a variety of specialized areas including graphics, artificial intelligence,
computer architecture, networks, compiler design, and operating systems. Independent study and honors work
provide opportunities for students to study and conduct research on topics of special interest.
The major in Computer Science equips students to pursue a wide variety of career opportunities. It can be used
as preparation for a career in computing, for graduate school, or to provide important background and techniques
for the student whose future career will extend outside of computer science.
MAJOR REQUIREMENTS
Required Courses in Computer Science
A minimum of 8 courses is required in Computer Science, including the following:
Introductory Courses
Computer Science 134 Introduction to Computer Science
Computer Science 136 Data Structures and Advanced Programming
Core Courses
Computer Science 237 Computer Organization
Computer Science 256 Algorithm Design and Analysis
Computer Science 334 Principles of Programming Languages
Computer Science 361 Theory of Computation
Electives
Two or more electives (bringing the total number of Computer Science courses to at least 8) chosen from 300-
or 400-level courses in Computer Science. At least one of these must be a course designated as a PROJECT
COURSE. Computer Science courses with 9 as the middle digit (reading, research, and thesis courses) will
normally not be used to satisfy the elective requirements. Students may petition the department to waive this
restriction with good reason.
Required Courses in Mathematics
Mathematics 251 Discrete Mathematics
and any other Mathematics course at the 200-level or higher
Students considering pursuing a major in Computer Science are urged to take Computer Science 134 and to
begin satisfying their mathematics requirements early. Note in particular that Discrete Mathematics covers materi-
al complementing that in the introductory courses (Computer Science 134 and 136) and is a prerequisite for many
advanced courses.
Students who take Computer Science 107, 108 or 109 may use that course as one of the two electives required
for the major in Computer Science. Those who count Computer Science 109 toward the major must select an
elective different from Computer Science 371 (Computer Graphics) for their project course. Similarly, students
who count Computer Science 108 as an elective cannot select Computer Science 373 as their project course. Com-
puter Science 107, 108, 109, and 134 are not open to students who have taken a Computer Science course num-
bered 136 or higher.
To be eligible for admission to the major, a student must normally have completed Computer Science 136 as
well as Discrete Mathematics by the end of the sophomore year. A second Mathematics course at the 200-level or
higher must be completed by the end of the junior year. Students are urged to have completed two of the four core
courses (Computer Science 237, 256, 334, and 361) by the end of the sophomore year and must normally have
completed at least three out of the four core courses by the end of the junior year.
Satisfactory participation is required in the Computer Science Colloquium by all senior majors. With the ad-
vance permission of the department, two appropriate mathematics courses numbered 240 or above may be substi-
tuted for one Computer Science elective. Other variations in the required courses, adapting the requirements to the
special needs and interests of the individual student, may be arranged in consultation with the department.
Potential majors are strongly encouraged to look at the latest copy of the Informal Guide to Computer Science,
which can be obtained on the World Wide Web at http://www.cs.williams.edu. This document contains much
more information on the major, including suggested patterns of course selection and advice on courses relevant to
different student goals.
LABORATORY FACILITIES
The Computer Science Department maintains two departmental computer laboratories for students taking
Computer Science courses, as well as a lab that can be configured for teaching specialized topics such as robotics.
The workstations in these laboratories also support student and faculty research in computer science.

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE
The degree with honors in Computer Science is awarded to a student who has demonstrated outstanding intel-
lectual achievement in a program of study which extends beyond the requirements of the regular major. The prin-
cipal considerations in recommending a student for the degree with honors will be: mastery of core material, abili-
ty to pursue independent study of computer science, originality in methods of investigation, and creativity in re-
search. Honors study is highly recommended for those students with strong academic records in computer science
who wish to attend graduate school, pursue high-level industrial positions in computing, or who would simply like
to experience research in computer science.
Prospective honors students are urged to consult with their departmental advisor at the time of registration in the
spring of the sophomore or at the beginning of the junior year to arrange a program of study that could lead to the
degree with honors. Such a program normally consists of Computer Science 493 and 494 and a WSP of indepen-
dent research under the guidance of a Computer Science faculty member, culminating in a thesis which is judged
acceptable by the department. The program produces a significant piece of written work and often includes a ma-
jor computer program. All honors candidates are required to give an oral presentation of their research in the Com-
puter Science Colloquium in early spring semester.
Students considering honors work should obtain permission from the department before registering in the fall
of the senior year. Formal admission to candidacy occurs at the beginning of the spring semester of the senior year
and is based on promising performance in the fall semester and winter study units of honors work. Recommenda-
tions for the degree with honors will be made for outstanding performance in the three honors courses. Highest
honors will be recommended for students who have displayed exceptional ability, achievement, or originality.
INTRODUCTORY COURSES
The department offers a choice of four introductory courses--Computer Science 107: Strategy, Interaction,
and Design in Board and Video Games, 108: Artificial Intelligence: Image and Reality, 109: The Art and Science
of Computer Graphics, and Computer Science 134: Introduction to Computer Science.
Computer Science 134 provides an introduction to computer science with a focus on developing computer pro-
gramming skills. These skills are essential to most upper-level courses in the department. As a result, Computer
Science 134 together with Computer Science 136 are required as a prerequisite to most advanced courses in the
department. Those students intending to take several Computer Science courses are urged to take 134 early.
Those students interested in learning more about exciting new ideas in computer science, but not necessarily
interested in developing extensive programming skills, should consider Computer Science 107: Strategy, Interac-
tion, and Design in Board and Video Games, 108: Artificial Intelligence: Image and Reality, or 109: The Art and
Science of Computer Graphics.
Students with significant programming experience should consider electing Computer Science 136 (see "Ad-
vanced Placement" below). Students are always welcome to contact a member of the department for guidance in
selecting a first course.
STUDY ABROAD
Study abroad can be a wonderful experience. Students who hope to take computer science courses while
abroad should discuss their plans in advance with the chair of the department. Students who plan to study away but
do not expect to take courses toward the major should work with the department to create a plan to ensure that they
will be able to complete the major. While study abroad is generally not an impediment to completing the major,
students should be aware that certain computer science courses must be taken in a particular sequence and that not
all courses are offered every semester (or every year). Students who wish to discuss their plans are invited to meet
with any of the faculty in Computer Science.
ADVANCED PLACEMENT
Students with an extensive background in computer science are urged to take the Advanced Placement Ex-
amination in Computer Science. A score of 4 or better on the exam is normally required for advanced placement in
Computer Science 136.
Students who wish to be placed in Computer Science 136 but who have not taken the Advanced Placement
Examination should consult with the department. Such students should have had a good course in computer sci-
ence using a structured language such as Java.
PLANS OF STUDY FOR NON-MAJORS
The faculty in Computer Science believes that students can substantially enrich their academic experience by
completing a coherent plan of study in one or more disciplines outside of their majors. With this in mind, we have
attempted to provide students majoring in other departments with options in our department's curriculum ranging
from two-course sequences to collections of courses equivalent to what would constitute a minor at institutions
that recognize such a concentration. Students interested in designing such a plan of study are invited to discuss
their plans in detail with a member of the faculty. To assist students making such plans, we include some sugges-
tions below.
Students seeking to develop an extensive knowledge of computer science without majoring in the department
are encouraged to use the major requirements as a guide. In particular, the four core courses required of majors are
intended to provide a broad knowledge of topics underlying all of computer science. Students seeking a concentra-
tion in Computer Science are urged to complete at least two of these courses followed by one of our upper-level
electives. Such a program would typically require the completion of a total of five Computer Science courses and
one course in discrete mathematics.
There are several sequences of courses appropriate for those primarily interested in developing skills in pro-
gramming for use in other areas. For general programming, Computer Science 134 followed by 136 and 237 will
provide students with a strong background in algorithm and data structure design together with an understanding
of issues of correctness and efficiency. Students of the Bioinformatics program are encouraged to take Computer
Science 134 at a minimum, and should consider Computer Science 136 and 256. The sequence of courses Com-
puter Science 109 and 134 would provide sufficient competence in computer graphics for many students inter-
Computer Science
­ 131 ­
ested in applying such knowledge either in the arts or sciences. For students requiring more expertise in the tech-
niques of computer graphics, Computer Science 136 and 371 could be added to form a four-course sequence.
There are, of course, many other alternatives. We encourage interested students to consult with the department
chair or other members of the department's faculty.
GENERAL REMARKS
Divisional Requirements
All Computer Science courses may be used to satisfy the Division III distribution requirement.
Alternate Year Courses
Computer Science 107, 108, 109, 315, 336T, 337T, 339, 356T, 371, 373, 374T, 432, and 434T are each normal-
ly offered every other year. All other Computer Science courses are normally offered every year.
Course Numbering
The increase from 100, through 200 and 300, to 400 indicates in most instances an increasing level of maturity
in the subject that is expected of students. Within a series, numeric order does not indicate the relative level of
difficulty of courses. Rather, the middle digit of the course number (particularly in upper-level courses) generally
indicates the area of computer science covered by the course.
Course Descriptions
Brief descriptions of the courses in Computer Science can be found below. More detailed information on the
offerings in the department is available in the Informal Guide to Computer Science.
Courses Open on a Pass-Fail Basis
Students taking a Computer Science course on a pass-fail basis must meet all the requirements set for students
taking the course on a graded basis.
With the permission of the department, any course offered by the department may be taken pass-fail, though
courses graded with the pass-fail option may not be used to satisfy any of the major or honors requirements. How-
ever, with the permission of the department, courses taken in the department beyond those requirements may be
taken on a pass-fail basis.

CSCI 108(F) Artificial Intelligence: Image and Reality (Q)
Over 50 years ago, scientists began to envision a world where computers and humans could converse. In 1956 the
field of "Artificial Intelligence" was officially born, and the work on "AI" began in earnest. Walking and talking
robots are still mostly the stuff of science fiction, but AI is close to making them reality. In this course, we will
explore the field of Artificial Intelligence. We will try to answer the question "what makes a machine intelligent?"
Among the systems we will explore in lecture will be game-playing systems, systems that learn from their envi-
ronments, and systems that create plans for complex tasks. Underlying all the topics addressed in this course will
be two fundamental issues: How can information be represented in a computer so that the machine is able to make
use of it? How can the system manipulate that information so that it is able to perform a task that requires intelli-
gence? This course will emphasize hands-on laboratory experience. Laboratory projects will focus on the building
and programming of simple robots.
Format: lecture/laboratory. Evaluation will be based on weekly laboratory assignments, four problem sets, short
papers, and a final examination having similar format to the problem sets.
This course does not assume any programming experience. This course is not open to students who have success-
fully completed a Computer Science course numbered 136 or above. Enrollment limit: 18 (expected: 18). Prefer-
ence given to first-year students and sophomores.
Hour: 9:00-9:50 MWF Lab: 1-2:30 R DANYLUK
CSCI 109(S) The Art and Science of Computer Graphics (Q)
This course provides an opportunity to develop an understanding of the theoretical and practical concepts underly-
ing 2- and 3-dimensional computer graphics. The course will emphasize hands-on studio/laboratory experience,
with student work focused around completing a series of projects. Students will experiment with modeling, color,
lighting, perspective, and simple animation. As the course progresses, computer programming will be used to con-
trol the complexity of the models and their interactions. Lectures, augmented by guided viewings of state-of-the-
art computer generated and enhanced images and animations, will be used to deepen understanding of the studio
experience.
Format: lecture/laboratory. Evaluation will be based on progress in the quality of project work.
This course is not open to students who have successfully completed a Computer Science course numbered 136 or
above. No enrollment limit (expected: 35-40).

CSCI 136(F,S) Data Structures and Advanced Programming (Q)
This course builds on the programming skills acquired in Computer Science 134. It couples work on program
design, analysis, and verification with an introduction to the study of data structures. Data structures capture com-
mon ways in which to store and manipulate data, and they are important in the construction of sophisticated com-
puter programs. Students are introduced to some of the most important and frequently used data structures: lists,
stacks, queues, trees, hash tables, graphs, and files. Students will be expected to write several programs, ranging
from very short programs to more elaborate systems. Emphasis will be placed on the development of clear, modu-
lar programs that are easy to read, debug, verify, analyze, and modify.
Format: lecture/laboratory. Evaluation will be based on programming assignments and examinations.
Prerequisites: Computer Science 134 or equivalent. (Discrete Mathematics is recommended, but not required).

This course investigates methods for designing efficient and reliable algorithms. By carefully analyzing the struc-
ture of a problem within a mathematical framework, it is often possible to dramatically decrease the computational
resources needed to find a solution. In addition, analysis provides a method for verifying the correctness of an
algorithm and accurately estimating its running time and space requirements. We will study several algorithm
design strategies that build on data structures and programming techniques introduced in Computer Science 136.
These include induction, divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, and greedy algorithms. Particular topics of
study include graph theory, hashing, and advanced data structures.

CONTRACT MAJOR
Contract Major Advisor: CHARLES R. TOOMAJIAN, Jr.
Students with the talent and energy for working independently and with the strong support of two faculty advi-
sors may undertake a Contract Major: a coherent study of an interdisciplinary subject not covered by a regularly
offered major. Such a major must be in an area suitable to the talents of the faculty in residence and cannot consist
of minor modifications to an existing major. A Contract Major also must conform to the structure and have the
coherence of a departmental or program major--i.e., it must embody a disciplined cumulative study that moves
from an elementary to an advanced level and culminates in a synthesis similar to a senior major course. Hence a
Contract Major usually consists of a program of existing courses, sometimes supplemented by courses of indepen-
dent study and the senior course.
The process of constructing a proposal for a Contract Major is both interesting and demanding. As part of that
process, students should consider carefully the advantage of working within existing majors or programs, taking
note of the considerable intellectual pleasures involved in sharing similar educational experiences with other stu-
dents working within the same field. Students might also consider whether their interests could be met by complet-
ing a regular major and coordinate program, or two majors, or simply by working outside a major field in courses
of special interest. Because the Contract Major represents an exceptional opportunity provided for students whose
interests cannot be met through existing departmental and interdepartmental majors and programs, it cannot be
pursued in conjunction with another major.
Students who wish to explore or propose a Contract Major should consult with the Contract Major Advisor and
with potential faculty sponsors as early as possible in the fall semester of the sophomore year, and then--during
the sophomore year--follow these procedures:
1) The student must initiate discussion with at least two members of the faculty from differing departments who
expect to be in residence during the student's senior year and who are willing to endorse the Contract Major and
undertake a central role in supervising its implementation, criticism, evaluation, and ultimate validation. Since in
essence faculty sponsors substitute for the student's major department, they are expected to play an important role
in the Contract Major.
The student must develop, in conjunction with the faculty sponsors, a written proposal (forms and guidelines
are available in the Registrar's Office) which should contain:
a) a description of the proposed major area of study and an explanation of the reasons for proposing the
Contract Major. A sound and persuasive rationale for the major is crucial for obtaining approval from
the Committee on Educational Policy (C.E.P.).
b) a list of all courses in the proposed major and an explanation for each course choice. A minimum of
nine semester courses, one of which must be designated the senior major course (and taken during the
senior year), must be completed for a Contract Major. Normal rules governing course grades and
grade point average apply for entry into and continuation in a Contract Major.
c) a list of other courses taken or anticipated to meet College distribution requirements, including grades
received in courses already completed.
2) By mid-January, the student must meet with the Contract Major Advisor to discuss and further develop the
proposal.
3) By the first day of spring semester classes, the student must submit a complete draft of the proposal to the
Contract Major Advisor for feedback.
4) By the end of the fourth week of the spring semester, the student must submit the final proposal to the Con-
tract Major Advisor. By this date also, the faculty sponsors must submit their endorsement forms to the Contract
Major Advisor. If the student is essentially proposing to transform an existing coordinate program (e.g., Africana
Studies, area studies programs, Environmental Studies), into a Contract Major, the chair of that program should
also submit to the Contract Major Advisor a statement attesting to the validity of the proposal by the end of the
fourth week of the spring semester.
5) The Contract Major Advisor then conveys the proposal, a copy of the student's most recent academic prog-
ress report, the faculty sponsors' endorsement forms, and recommendations regarding the feasibility and sub-
Contract Major, Critical Languages
­ 135 ­
stance of the proposal, for approval by the Committee on Educational Policy. The C.E.P., after consultation with
departments and programs substantially affected by a proposal, will vote on each proposal individually and will
notify students and sponsors before the spring registration deadline. If the time needed for C.E.P. review demands
it, the Contract Major Advisor may permit them to register late without penalty. In making its decisions, the C.E.P.
considers the student's academic record, the coherence and feasibility of the plan of study, and the degree of sup-
port expressed by the faculty sponsors and, if appropriate, program chairs.
Subsequent changes in a Contract Major must be requested in writing by the student and approved by the facul-
ty sponsors as well as by the Contract Major Advisor. Where there has been substantial alteration of the original
program, the Contract Major Advisor will forward the student's written request to the C.E.P. for reconsideration.

The route to the degree with honors in the Contract Major will normally be a senior thesis requiring two semes-
ters and a winter study of work. In special circumstances a student may propose to substitute a one-semester
course or a winter study course for one of his or her thesis courses and write a mini-thesis. The Contract Major
with honors shall comprise a minimum of eleven semester courses or ten semester courses plus one winter study.
One semester of independent study undertaken for the thesis may be allowed to fulfill the requirement for a senior
major course.
The faculty sponsors shall determine by the end of winter study whether the student is to be admitted to honors
candidacy. If not admitted to honors candidacy, the student may elect not to continue further independent study. If
admitted to honors candidacy, the student shall submit a written thesis or minithesis to three faculty readers, at least
one of whom shall be a faculty sponsor and at least one of whom shall not be a faculty sponsor. The outside reader
or readers shall be selected by the Contract Major Advisor in consultation with the faculty sponsors. There will be
a one-hour oral exam by the readers, and they shall make a final decision regarding honors.

CRITICAL LANGUAGES (Div. I)
Coordinator, JANE CANOVA
The Critical Languages Program enables students to study important foreign languages not taught in regular
courses at Williams. Hebrew, Hindi, Korean, and Swahili can be studied for one year at the elementary level.
Students work independently with standard language textbooks and individual cassette tapes for roughly ten
hours per week and attend two one-hour group review sessions per week with native-speaking tutors. Language
faculty from other institutions conduct the midterm and final exams and determine the final grades.
To be eligible for a 200-level Critical Languages course, the student must:
z
demonstrate proven capability for independent work and previous success in foreign language study;
z
explain how study of the language will integrate with his or her major or other academic interests;
z
present a letter of recommendation from a Williams faculty member;
z
in some cases take a pretest for placement;
z
have attained sophomore standing or higher;
z
have at least a 3.00 Grade Point Average.
Interested students should obtain an application form for the desired course in early April. Forms are available
at the Center for Foreign Languages, Literatures, and Cultures in the North Academic Building. Students must
meet with the program coordinator and hand in the completed application forms no later than one week before
preregistration. The application must be approved before registering for the course.
Students should note that Critical Languages courses are hyphenated, meaning no credit is given for the first
semester until the second semester is successfully completed. Students must normally begin a course in the fall
semester. It cannot be taken Pass/Fail.
A Critical Languages course will be scheduled only if and when at least two students are accepted into the
course. Students planning to register for the course must attend an organizational meeting the first week of each
semester.
Note: Elementary to Advanced Arabic are now offered as regular courses.

MAJOR
Students who have not yet taken an economics course should begin their sequence with Economics
110 and should follow the following sequence:
Economics 110 Principles of Microeconomics
(Note that students may not take any economics courses, including Economics 110 and 120, without hav-
ing passed the quantitative studies exam or the equivalent.)
Economics 120 Principles of Macroeconomics (Economics 110 or the equivalent is a prerequisite for 120)
Economics 251 Price and Allocation Theory
Economics 252 Macroeconomics
Economics 255 Empirical Methods
Please note that Statistics 101 or 201 is a prerequisite from Economics 255. Students who are con-
sidering majoring in economics are thus strongly encouraged to take Statistics 101 or 201 early in
their college careers. Students may take the combination of Statistics 201 and 346 instead of Eco-
nomics 255. Economics 253 can not be substituted for Economics 255.
Note that Economics 251, 252, and the Empirical Methods course can be taken in any order. In
most cases all three of these courses are prerequisites for Economics Senior Seminars, at least one
of which is required for the major. Senior seminars are typically taken during senior year or during
the spring of junior year. Students are thus strongly encouraged to complete these three core courses
by the end of junior year at the latest.
Prospective majors please note that instructors in all sections of Economics 251, 252, and 255 and courses
numbered 350 and above feel free to use elementary calculus in assigned readings, lectures, problem sets, and
examinations; therefore, Economics 110 and 120 and Mathematics 103 or its equivalent are required as prerequi-
sites for these courses, with the exception of 251 which has only Economics 110 and Mathematics 103 as prereq-
uisites. By elementary calculus is meant differentiation of single variable polynomial functions and conditions for
a maximum or minimum; it does not include integration. Students are also reminded that some courses now have
specific mathematics requirements; see course descriptions.
Elective Requirements:
Students must complete four Economics electives, of which at least two must be selected from advanced
electives numbered 350 to 394 (or from the CDE courses offered), and one of which must be selected from
electives numbered 450-475. (Note: students may substitute an extra 450+ elective for a 350-394 elective.
However, in admitting students to these courses, the department will give preference to students who have
not yet taken a course numbered 450-475.)
The primary objectives of the major are to develop an understanding of economic aspects of contemporary life
and to equip the student to analyze economic issues of social policy. The introductory courses stress use of the
basic elements of economic analysis for understanding and resolving such issues. The two required intermediate
theory courses then provide a more thorough grounding in economics as a discipline by examining the strengths
and weaknesses of the price system in allocating economics resources and by examining the aggregate processes
which determine employment, inflation, and growth. A course in statistical methods, either Economics 255 or
alternatively, Statistics 201 plus Statistics 346 equips the major to understand and apply the basic tools of quantita-
tive empirical analysis. In elective courses students apply theoretical tools and empirical techniques to develop a
richer understanding of economic phenomena and public policy.
Graduate training in economics requires more mathematical sophistication than does undergraduate econom-
ics. We encourage students who are considering pursuing a Ph.D. in Economics to take Economics 255, Mathe-
matics 105 (or 106), Mathematics 209, Mathematics 211 and Mathematics 301. As graduate schools also look for
evidence of research experience and promise, we strongly encourage interested students to write a senior honors
thesis in Economics.
Should I Major in Economics to Prepare for a Career in Business?
Economics is a social science that deals with how individuals and organizations make choices, and with the
allocation of scarce resources among competing ends. An economics major is excellent preparation for a wide
variety of careers: public policy, law, teaching, economics research in government or in the private sector, as well
as more general careers in business. Training in economics is similar to training in other sciences: you will learn
about economic systems and the relationships between economic agents and the constraints that determine these
relationships. You will learn about economic data and how to test economic theories and measure economic out-
comes. Training in economics is not the same as training in business management. Success in business is achieved
by students from a wide variety of majors, not only economics, and students who choose to major in economics
solely because it seems similar to majoring in business may feel frustrated in their economics courses. We advise
students to acquire a broad exposure to the arts, social sciences and natural sciences, and to major in the subject
Economics
­ 137 ­
that most engages their interest, rather than attempt to acquire extensive pre-professional training while undergrad-
uates.
Credit for Coursework Done Elsewhere
The normal requirement that nine economics courses be taken at Williams will usually be waived only on the
basis of transferred credit deemed acceptable by the department. Credit is granted based on grades consistent with
college policy on various examinations:
z
Students who receive a 5 on the Microeconomics AP or Macroeconomics AP exam, or a 5 on each, may
place out of Economics 110 or 120, or both, respectively, but major credit will be given for only one
course.
z
The Department will grant major credit for both Economics 110 and 120 to a student who receives a 6 or 7
on the higher-level Economics IB examination, and that student can place into any 200-level course or
intermediate-level micro or macro course.
z
For A levels credit, the Department will grant major credit for both Economics 110 and 120 to a student
who receives a grade of A or B.
STUDY ABROAD
Students who are considering study abroad should consult with the Department's Coordinator for Transfers/
Study Abroad Credits early in the process of planning a year or semester abroad. (See the Department website to
determine which professor is the Coordinator for this academic year.) Economics majors or prospective majors
who are considering spending all or part of their junior year abroad are strongly advised to choose sophomore
courses such that they can complete their intermediate theory requirements (Economics 251, 252, and 255) prior
to the start of their senior year. We recommend as well that students complete at least part of the major's advanced
elective requirement prior to the beginning of the senior year. Students who hope to pursue Honors in economics
but who plan to be away for all or part of the junior year are strongly advised to meet with the Department's Direc-
tor of Research prior to going abroad to discuss options for pursuing honors. (See the Department website to deter-
mine the Director of Research for this academic year.)
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN ECONOMICS
We encourage all majors who have at least a 3.5 GPA in economics courses to consider honors. To be admitted
to candidacy for honors in economics a student must complete a substantial piece of independent research. Two
routes to honors are open: the Specialization Route and the Thesis Route.
1) Specialization Route, consisting of these three units:
a. Development of a thesis proposal;
b. An honors winter study project (W30) in January of the senior year;
c. Economics 491 or 492 Honors Seminar. Students may pursue the Specialization Route to honors in their
senior year, either in the fall semester plus WSP or WSP plus the spring semester. After selecting an advisor
and discussing the topic with the advisor, the student should submit a thesis proposal to the department for
approval. (A description of what should be included in proposals is listed on the department's website.) Such
proposals frequently build on research papers completed for advanced electives, but this is not a requirement.
Students should submit proposals at the end of the spring semester if they wish to pursue a fall-WSP thesis,
and by one week after the last day of classes in December if they wish to pursue a WSP-spring thesis. The
department provides a memorandum to majors with more details every spring and fall.
2) Thesis Route (Economics 493-W30-494):
A few students each year will be accepted for year-long thesis research on a subject closely related to the
scholarly interests of a faculty member. A student who hopes to do such independent and advanced research
in close association with a faculty member should begin to work out a mutually satisfactory topic early in the
second semester of his or her junior year. Application to the department must be made before the end of the
junior year by submitting a detailed proposal for work under the supervision of the faculty member. The WSP
of the senior year is also spent on the thesis.
The College Bulletin states that students who wish to receive honors must take at least one course in addition
to the minimum number required for the major. Students who pursue a year-long thesis and therefore take
both Economics 493 and 494 may substitute Economics 493 for an upper-level elective (excluding those
numbered 400-490) if they wish to. Students who pursue the Specialization Route to Honors may not substi-
tute Economics 491 or 492 for an upper- (or lower-) level elective requirement.
Because economics honors theses frequently make use of empirical economic methods, students considering
writing an honors thesis in economics are strongly advised to complete Economics 255 or Statistics 346 before the
end of junior year.
AFRICANA STUDIES AND AREA STUDIES
A major in economics who concentrates in Africana Studies or Area Studies may substitute the non-economics
courses in the concentration for one lower-level elective in the Economics major, but not for an advanced elective
(350-394).
Note on course numbers: Courses between 201 and 299 are lower-level electives and are open to students
who have taken 110 or 120. Courses 350 and above are advanced electives, have intermediate theory pre-
requisites, and are primarily designed for Economics and Political Economy majors. Courses numbered
450-475 are only open to students who have completed Economics 251, Economics 252, and who have
satisfied the statistical methods requirement unless the course prerequisite explicitly indicates otherwise.

ECON 110(F,S) Principles of Microeconomics (Q)
This course is an introduction to the study of the forces of supply and demand that determine prices and the alloca-
tion of resources in markets for goods and services, markets for labor, and markets for natural resources. The focus
is on how and why markets work, why they may fail to work, and the policy implications of both their successes
and failures. The course focuses on developing the basic tools of microeconomic analysis and then applying those
tools to topics of popular or policy interest such as minimum wage legislation, pollution control, competition
policy, international trade policy, discrimination, tax policy, and the role of government in a market economy. This
course is required of Economics and Political Economy majors and highly recommended for those non-majors
interested in Environmental Studies and Women's and Gender Studies. The department recommends that students
follow this course with Principles of Macroeconomics or with a lower-level elective that has Economics 110 as its
prerequisite. Students may alternatively proceed directly to Intermediate Microeconomics after taking this
introductory course.

ECON 111(S) Introduction to Economics and Its Applications (Q)
This course, open only to juniors and seniors who have not taken an economics course, is intended for students
who do not wish to major in economics but who would like to learn something about the discipline and to develop
a greater understanding of the ways in which economics can be used to explain behavior and to inform policy. Our
focus will be on providing some very basic tools of economic analysis and important institutional background
regarding the US and international economies, and then using those tools and institutional knowledge to analyze
current policy issues.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: problem sets, several short papers, at least one quiz, and midterm and
final exam.

ECON 203(S) Gender and Economics (Same as Women's and Gender Studies 203)
This course uses economic analysis to explore how gender differences can lead to differences in economic out-
comes, in both households and the labor market. Questions to be covered include: How does the family function as
an economic unit? How do individuals allocate time between the labor market and the household? How have
changes in family structure affected women's employment, and vice-versa? What are possible explanations for
gender differences in labor force participation, occupational choice, and earnings? What is the role of government
in addressing gender issues in the home and the workplace? How successful are government policies that primari-
ly affect women (e.g., comparable worth policies, AFDC/TANF, subsidization of child care)? The course will
focus on the current experience of women in the United States, but will place these gender differences in a histori-
cal and cross-cultural context.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: weekly discussion papers, two midterms, and a final paper and presen-
tation.

survey of the history of economic growth and development, as well as competing theories of economic growth.
The majority of the course will examine the main topics in the microeconomics of development including fertility,
human capital investments, labor and land markets, savings/insurance, community-based institutions, and migra-
tion. In addition, we will explore the role of the state in economic development, the relationship between develop-
ment and international trade, and the relationship between development and the environment.

ECON 207(F) The Economics of HIV/AIDS (Same as Women's and Gender Studies 207)
To fully understand how and why the AIDS pandemic is occurring, and how best to respond to it, we need eco-
nomic tools. And conversely, thinking carefully about HIV/AIDS can change how we think about economics. In
this class we will discuss what features of an economy could make a population particularly susceptible to infec-
tion with HIV, and what the economic impact of a largescale epidemic is. Then we will look at economic issues
involved in response to the pandemic, including the tools and critiques of cost effectiveness; the development and
pricing of treatment; and the political economy of North/South aid. Particular attention will be paid to gender, and
the issue of care labor.
Requirements: Two short papers and a research paper. Participation in class discussion will count for part of the
grade.

ECON 209(S) Labor Economics
This course covers basic labor markets and the determination of wages in the U.S. The determination of wages and
employment levels through demand and supply of labor in competitive and non-competitive markets is the basis
for analyzing the wide range of outcomes we observe in the U.S. Differences in earnings and employment are
analyzed through a variety of mechanisms such as labor force participation, the role of unions, human capital ac-
cumulation and occupational choices. Topics with important public policy implications such as discrimination and
affirmative action, minimum wages, and immigration will also be presented. Theoretical models will be presented
and critiqued with empirical evidence from U.S. labor markets.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on a combination of exams and short policy papers.
Prerequisites: Economics 110; students who have completed Economics 251 must have permission of instructor.

Why did Latin America fall behind in the 20th century? Why have the countries of East Asia recently experienced
such high rates of economic growth? And why has Africa remained so poor for so long? These and other questions
will guide our exploration of world economic development over the past several millennia. We will draw on micro
and macroeconomic theory to help explain and interpret the historical roots of the modern global economy. Our
focus will be broadly comparative across space and time, with an emphasis on how institutions, resource endow-
ments, cultural and technological revolutions, and market developments have driven economic changes.

ECON 253(F) Empirical Methods in Political Economy (Same as Political Economy 253) (Q)
This course introduces students to common empirical tools used in policy analysis and implementation. The broad
aim is to train students to be discriminating consumers of public policy-relevant research. The emphasis in the
course is on intuitive understanding of the central concepts. Through hands-on work with data and critical assess-
ment of existing empirical social scientific research, students will develop the ability to choose and employ the
appropriate tool for a particular research problem, and to understand the limitations of the techniques. Topics to be
covered include basic principles of probability; random variables and distributions; statistical estimation, inference
and hypothesis testing; and modeling using multiple regression, with a particular focus on understanding whether
and how relationships between variables can be determined to be causal-an essential requirement for effective
policy formation. Throughout the course, the focus will be on public policy applications relevant to the fields of
political science, sociology, and public health, as well as to economics.
Format: lecture and discussion. Requirements: problem sets, group projects, short essays, and three quizzes.
Prerequisites: Mathematics 103 or its equivalent and one course in Economics. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected:
19). Required in the Political Economy major but open to non-majors. This course does not satisfy the economet-
rics requirement for the Economics major.
This course is part of the Critical Reasoning and Analytical Skills Initiative.

ECON 255(F,S) Econometrics (Q)
An introduction to the theory and practice of applied quantitative economic analysis. This course familiarizes stu-
dents with the strengths and weaknesses of the basic empirical methods used by economists to evaluate economic
theory against economic data. Emphasizes both the statistical foundations of regression techniques and the practi-
cal application of those techniques in empirical research. Computer exercises will provide experience in using the
empirical methods, but no previous computer experience is expected. Highly recommended forstudentsconsider-
ing graduate training in economics or public policy. Students may substitute the combination of Statistics 201 and
346 for Economics 253 or 255.

ECON 352(S) Regulatory Reform and Innovation (W)
Recent national initiatives and legislative statutes on competitiveness, including the America COMPETES Act,
encourage the development of an infrastructure that promotes innovation and competitiveness in the public and
private sectors. Yet the organization of our markets and institutions will in part determine the success of such initia-
tives. The purpose of this course is to examine how current regulatory structure promotes or impedes economic
competitiveness. The efficacy of government policies in promoting the competitiveness of industries in local and
global markets will be examined in this course. We will focus on a broad spectrum of regulations and regulatory
reforms that have affected the transportation, telecommunications, electricity, pharmaceutical, and information
technology sectors, as well as policies that have had significant impacts on financial markets, intellectual property
rights and the environmental policy. We will also consider the implications of market and regulatory failures.

ECON 353(F) Decision Theory (Q)
Studies of decision-making suggest that most people substantially violate even undemanding models of rationali-
ty. Are people truly irrational, and, if so, can anything be done about it? This course focuses on normative decision-
making (how we should make decisions under general conditions), descriptive decision-making (how we do
make decisions under actual conditions), and the contrast between the two. We proceed to a view of prescriptive
decision-making, or how we might combine normative and descriptive insights to improve decision-making and
judgment. Topics include decision-analytic methods for improving decision-making rigor (e.g., decision trees);
microeconomic concepts and tools for optimization problems; game theory as appropriate; insights from cognitive
psychology on heuristics (short cuts) that sometimes help, but often distort, decision-making; integrated models of
judgment that call for both analysis and intuition; insights from the newly-emerging studies of judgment and wis-
dom. Until a few years ago, this topic was given normative treatment in departments of engineering, statistics and
economics, and was separately taught as a descriptive science in departments of psychology. The apparent value
of combining the two into a single, prescriptive analysis of decision-making and judgment has led to a recent wave
of interdisciplinary approaches such as the one adopted in this course.
Requirements: multiple problems and case analyses, one project, final exam.

This course first explores the role of the financial system and financial markets, and how they interact with the
economy. What does finance do? How are asset prices determined, and how are these prices related to interest
rates? Are financial markets efficient, and what are the implications of their efficiency or lack thereof? Second, it
analyzes the role of the central bank and the conduct of monetary policy. Special attention will be given to the
organization and the operation of the Federal Reserve System, but other monetary policy regimes will also be
considered. Third, it studies the complexities associated with managing and regulating modern financial instru-
ments. The impact of incentives on the shape and evolution of the financial system will be stressed throughout.
Format: lecture and discussion. In class taught during the fall, students will simulate a meeting of the Federal Re-
serve Open Market Committee, either to decide on monetary policy or to debate a current policy monetary policy

ECON 371T(S) Economic Justice
This tutorial will examine normative and empirical aspects of economic justice, with a special emphasis on con-
cerns related to income distribution. The course is loosely structured around three questions: a) How ought income
be distributed? b) How is income distributed? c) What policies should be considered when a) and b) differ? The
first question moves us into the area of ethics. We will spend several classes discussing the connections between
economic analysis and ethical theory. The second question moves us into the area of facts and theories surround-
ing income distribution. The third question moves us to consider policy responses to any perceived problems. In
considering question c) we will focus on issues related to the distribution of income and status in the United States.
Format: tutorial; will meet weekly for one hour in groups of 2. Evaluation will be based on six 5- to 7-page papers

This course examines the distribution of income in the U.S., with particular emphasis on how it is affected by
taxes, transfers, and other government programs. Most of the course will focus on the bottom of the income dis-
tribution, where the role for policy is greatest. Questions to be addressed may include the following: What are the
causes and consequences of poverty? How do welfare, the minimum wage, and the EITC affect those in poverty?
How does discrimination affect the incomes of various demographic groups? What are the effects of affirmative
action? How much mobility is there across the income distribution? What explains the recent growth in income at
the top of the distribution, and the resulting increase in inequality?

ECON 459(F) Economics of Institutions
Why are some countries rich and others poor? There are numerous candidate explanations emphasizing factors
ranging from demography to technological innovation to unequal international relations. However, some econo-
mists like Douglass North and Mancur Olson have argued that beneath the profusion of proximate causes the
quality of a country's "institutions" fundamentally determines its economic prospects. The word "institutions" is
used broadly; it can refer to micro-structures like households or macro-structures like the state. The course will
survey the literature on institutions and economic development, discussing both developed and developing coun-
tries. Readings will largely consist of published journal articles and unpublished work of similar quality. Students
should expect to use microeconomic theory and econometrics learned in previous courses. Evaluation will be
based on four short papers of 7-10 pages each.
Format: seminar.

ECON 461(S) Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) Modeling (Same as Economics 504)
The Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model is an important tool for applied policy work. CGE models are
the primary tool for many government organizations when evaluating policy alternatives and are also used exten-
sively by various NGO's when deciding aid and policy recommendations. The great advantage of these models is
that they capture the general equilibrium feedback effects of policy proposals on various sectors of the economy.
This is of great importance to applied work, as this allows the identification of the winners and losers from poten-
tial policies. The class will begin with a general overview of CGE models. This overview will be rigorous and
mathematical. This course will use the free programming packages GAMS and MPSGE to implement various
CGE models using real world data. While no previous computer experience is required, some familiarity with at
least one programming language is recommended. During the latter part of the course, students will create a CGE
model for a country of their choice and conduct policy experiments using their model. Interested students could
continue this project as a potential thesis topic.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on problem sets, two midterms, final project and presenta-

ECON 463(S) Financial History
This course opens with a brief survey of some of the major characteristics, issues, and challenges of financial
systems today, and then examines earlier experience with these phenomena. Topics to be examined include: the
role of finance in economic development historically; the relationship between finance and government, and the
extent to which it has changed over time; the lessons from early stock market, real estate, canal, railroad, and even
tulip bubbles, for modern financial systems; the effect of institutions (laws, norms, and culture) and political sys-
tems in shaping the impact of finance, as illustrated by comparisons between Mexico and the U.S., among other
cases. The course also examines the tools that were developed in earlier epochs to deal with different risks, evalu-
ate their efficacy, and consider lessons for modern financial regulation. Implications and lessons for current finan-
cial issues will be discussed throughout.

ECON 464(S) Empirical Methods in Macroeconomics (Same as Economics 514) (Q)
Macroeconomics and related fields in international finance and development have evolved specialized empirical
techniques, known generally as macroeconometrics, which are designed to meet the practical challenges that the
data and the empirical questions pose in these fields. The course will introduce the theory and application of these
techniques, and students will learn how to implement these techniques using real world data to address practical
questions drawn from the fields of macro, international finance and development. Topics to which these tech-
niques will be applied include business cycle analysis and forecasting, sources of exchange rate volatility and de-
terminants of long run economic growth. Computer work and programming will be an important and integral part
of the course, but no previous training is expected. Economics majors who are considering writing an honors the-
sis on related topics are encouraged to enroll in this course during the spring semester of their junior year. Students
studying abroad during their junior year may nonetheless take this course during their senior year.

Ample empirical and experimental evidence suggests significant departures from classical assumptions of eco-

towards identifying systematic ways in which behavior deviates from our classical assumptions and generating
new, and hopefully more realistic, assumptions of behavior. We explore the empirical, theoretical and policy im-
plications of these findings.
Format: seminar. Requirements: one long paper, one short paper, and a series of critiques.
Prerequisites: Economics 251 and 253 or 255 or the equivalent. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference

ECON 467T(S) Development Successes (Same as Economics 518T) (W)
Although living standards in most of the worlds poor countries have increasingly fallen behind those of the rich
industrial countries, a relatively small number of countries that were quite poor in the middle of the last century
have achieved dramatic improvements in their incomes since then. These development successes include coun-
tries such as Japan, the four dragons (Hong Kong, Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan), the MIT economies (Malaysia,
Indonesia, and Thailand), the Asian giants of China and India, as well as non-Asian economies as diverse as Bo-
tswana, Chile, and Turkey. This tutorial will explore why these countries have apparently succeeded where many
other poor countries have failed. A particular focus of the course will be on extracting insights from the experi-
ences of these success cases about the broad development strategies that have been advocated over the past 50
years by scholars as well as by the international financial institutions.
Format: tutorial. Methods of evaluation; students will write five papers during the term, and will prepare and deliv-

ECON 468(S) Microfinance (Same as Economics 508) (D) (Q)
Unequal access to finance (loans, savings, insurance) contributes to the persistence of poverty in developing coun-

enforced even when borrowers do not have collateral. We discuss how recent innovations in micro-insurance can
reduce vulnerability. We will study the role of governments and donors in equalizing financial access through
subsidies or targeting. Finally, we shall explore how microfinance can empower women within the household.
Readings include current empirical and theoretical research in development economics. This course is an EDI
course because it critically analyzes how microfinance interventions can reduce inequality both within and across
households.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on a midterm, a series of short papers and a longer final paper.

ECON 502(S) Institutions and Governance
Over the last two decades economists have become increasingly aware of the importance of the "social infrastruc-

late and implement policies, markets must be supported by suitable institutional frameworks, property rights must
be secure, and contracts reliably enforced. Even the structure of the household, the smallest institution analyzed by
economists, has been shown to have an important influence on economic development. This course will survey
the growing literature on institutions and governance. Evaluation will be based on several short papers. The class
will primarily follow a discussion format.

ECON 503(F) Public Economics
Public economics is the branch of economics concerned with government expenditure and taxation, focusing pri-
marily on microeconomic aspects of these activities. It provides tools for understanding the effects of government
policies, as well as a useful conceptual framework for analyzing normative questions such as "what is a good
policy?" This seminar will present the basic principles for public economics, and apply them to topics of particular
importance in developing countries. The course will begin by considering the efficiency of market economies, and
rationales for government intervention in the market, such as public goods, externalities, information-based mar-
ket failures, and equity. Applications include education, health care, aid to the poor, and infrastructure. We then
move on to the economics of taxation, considering what kinds of taxes are used in developing countries and how
they are designed, the economic and distributional effects of taxation, questions of administration and evasion, and
options for reform. Time permitting, we will also address topics such as pubic enterprises, political economy, and
decentralization.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: problem sets, one 5- to 7-page paper, a 15-page final paper, midterm,
and a final exam.
Prerequisites: Economics 251. In addition, an empirical methods course (Economics 253, 255, 510 or 511, or Sta-
tistics 346) must be taken before or concurrently with this class. Enrollment limit: 30 (expected: 25-30). Under-

This course focuses on the financial system and its role in economic development. The first part explores the func-
tions of finance, how it contributes to growth, and reviews different models of financial sector development and
their influence on how governments viewed the sector. It will examine experiences with financial sector repression
and subsequent liberalization, and investigate the causes and impact of financial crises. Then it will study how to
make finance effective and how to prevent or minimize crises, analyzing government's role as regulator, supervi-
sor, standard setter, contract enforcer, and owner. In this final part, attention will be devoted to the role of institu-
tions (laws, norms, culture) and incentives in financial sector development.

This course focuses on the relationship between macroeconomic policies and economic growth in develop-
ing countries. After examining the links between macroeconomic stability and long-run growth, the rest of
the course is divided into three parts. The first part is devoted to the construction of an analytical model that
is suitable for analyzing a wide variety of macroeconomic issues in developing countries. This model pro-
vides the general framework for a more specific analysis of fiscal and monetary policies in the two remain-
ing parts. In analyzing fiscal policy, the course will consider in particular the requirements of fiscal solven-
cy and the contribution that fiscal policy can make to macroeconomic stability. It will also examine alterna-
tive methods for achieving fiscal credibility, including the design of fiscal institutions. The final part of the
course will turn to an analysis of central banking, focusing on central bank independence, time consistency
of monetary policy, and the design of monetary policy rules in small open economies.

ECON 520T(S) Inclusive Growth: The Role of Social Safety Nets
Designing and implementing effective national strategies to promote inclusive economic growth can re-
quire difficult policy reforms, sometimes with adverse short-term impacts for vulnerable groups within so-
ciety. Social safety nets provide a pro-poor policy instrument that can balance trade and labor market re-
form, fiscal adjustments (such as reduced general subsidies) and other economic policies aimed at enabling
better market performance. In addition, social safety nets help the poor to cope with shocks to their liveli-
hoods, promoting resilience, human capital development and sometimes high-return risk-taking. This tuto-
rial will offer students the opportunity to explore the role of social safety nets in promoting inclusive eco-
nomic growth, drawing on case studies from Africa, Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe. The first part
of the tutorial will define social safety nets within the broader context of social protection, examining the
diversity of instruments and their linkages to economic growth. The second part will delve more deeply into
the design and implementation of effective interventions, assessing program choice, affordability, target-
ing, incentives and other issues. The third part will analyze the role of social safety nets in supporting eco-
nomic growth strategies, drawing on international lessons of experience.
Format: tutorial. Methods of evaluation: students will write five papers during the term, and will prepare
and deliver formal comments on five papers written by other students.

ECON 521(S) Urbanization and Development (Same as Economics 388 and Environmental Studies

At current rates of growth, the combined population of urban areas in developing countries will double in
the next 30 years. The land area devoted to urban use is expected to double even more quickly. The costs of
providing housing and infrastructure to accommodate this growth are enormous, but the costs of failing to
accommodate urban development may be even larger. The decisions made in response to these challenges
will affect the economic performance of these countries and the health and welfare of the urban residents.
By affecting global patterns of energy use, these decisions will have broader impacts on the entire planet.
This course will focus on these challenges. What are the economic forces that drive the process of urbaniza-
tion, and how does the level of urbanization affect economic development? How are policies towards hous-
ing, transportation, public finance and development affected by urbanization? What policy choices are
available, and which are most likely to succeed in dealing with the challenges of urban growth?
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: a midterm and a final exam, plus a paper that evaluates specific
problems, policy alternatives, and provides some analysis of relevant data.
Prerequisites: Economics 251 plus 253, 255, 510 or 511. Expected enrollment: 20. Undergraduate enroll-

In this course, each Fellow carries out an individual research study on a topic in which he or she has particular
interest, usually related to one of the three seminars. The approach and results of the study are reported in a major
paper. Research studies are analytical rather than descriptive and in nearly all cases include quantitative analyses.
Often the topic is a specific policy problem in a Fellow's own country.

COURSES AND COURSE-NUMBERING
The course offerings in English enable students, whether majors or non-majors, to explore literature in a variety
of ways, and to satisfy their interests in particular authors, literary periods, and genres. They emphasize interpre-
tive skills, systematic and critical thinking, and careful attention to the generic, cultural, and historical contexts of
literature written in English.
100-LEVEL COURSES
At the introductory level, the department offers a range of writing-intensive 100-level courses which focus on
interpretive skills as well as skills in writing and argumentation. The department also offers English 150, Exposito-
ry Writing, a course focusing on analytic writing skills. All 100-level courses are designed primarily for first-year
students, although they are open to interested sophomores, juniors, and seniors. A 100-level course other than 150
is required for admission to most upper-level English courses, except in the case of students who have placed out
of the introductory courses by receiving a score of 5 on the Advanced Placement examination in English Litera-
ture or of 6 or 7 on the International Baccalaureate.
200-LEVEL COURSES
Most 200-level courses are designed primarily for qualified first-year students, sophomores, and junior and
senior non-majors, but they are open to junior and senior majors and count as major courses. Several 200-level
courses have no prerequisites; see individual descriptions for details. 200-level Gateway courses are designed for
first- and second-year students who are considering becoming English Majors, or who are interested in pursuing
upper-level course work in the department. All Gateway courses are writing-intensive. First-year students who
have placed out of the 100-level courses are encouraged to take a Gateway course as their introduction to the
department. Completion of a Gateway course is a requirement for the major.
300-LEVEL COURSES
The majority of English Department courses are at the 300 level. 300-level courses are open to sophomores,
juniors, and seniors. First-year students who wish to enroll in a 300-level course are advised to consult the instruc-
tor.
400-LEVEL COURSES
400-level courses are intensive, discussion-oriented classes that place a premium on independent, student-initi-
ated work. Such classes can be structured in a variety of ways. A class might culminate in a long final paper on a
topic of the student's devising and involve conferences focused on the progress of that project. A course might
alternate tutorial sessions with seminar meetings, or it might take the form of a colloquium, with discussions orga-
nized around individual or group presentations on different aspects of a topic. Limited to 15 students, 400-level
courses are open to students who have completed at least one 300-level English course; they should be attractive to
any student interested in a course that emphasizes intensive discussion and independent work. Majors considering
Honors work are urged to take a 400-level course before senior year as a way of preparing for Honors work.
ADVISING
All junior and senior English majors are assigned a departmental faculty member as an advisor. Students' pref-
erences for advisors are solicited during the preregistration period in April, and assignments are announced at the
start of the school year.
Non-majors who wish to discuss English Department offerings are invited to see any faculty member or the
department chair.
MAJOR
Majors are urged to select a balance of intermediate and advanced courses, and to choose classes from the
American, British and Anglophone traditions. Each student can fashion his or her own sequence of study within a
basic pattern that insures coherence and variety. This pattern comprises at least nine courses.
They are also urged to elect collateral courses in subjects such as art, music, history, comparative literature,
philosophy, religion, theatre, and foreign languages with a view to supporting and broadening their studies in liter-
ature. In particular, the study of classical and modern languages, as well as of foreign literatures, is strongly recom-
mended.
Requirements
The nine courses required for the major must include the following:
1) Any 100-level English class except English 150. Students exempted by the department from 100-level
courses will substitute an elective course.
2) At least two courses dealing primarily with literature written before 1700 (identified in parentheses at the end
of the course description).
3) At least two courses dealing primarily with literature written between 1700 and 1900 (identified in paren-
theses at the end of the course description).
English
­ 150 ­
4) At least one course dealing primarily with literature written after 1900 (identified in parentheses at the end of
the course description).
5) At least one "criticism" course (identified in parentheses at the end of course description). A course fulfilling
the criticism requirement entails a sustained and explicit reflection on problems of critical method, whether by
engaging a range of critical approaches and their implications or by exploring a particular method, theorist, or
critic in depth. Please note that when a criticism course also deals with literature satisfying a historical distribution
requirement (pre-1700, 1700-1900, etc.), the course may be used to satisfy either the criticism or the chronological
requirement, but not both.
6) At least one 200-level Gateway course (listed at the end of the 200-level course descriptions). Gateway
courses are designed for first- and second-year students contemplating the major or intending to pursue more ad-
vanced work in the department; these courses focus on analytical writing skills while introducing students to criti-
cal methods and historical approaches that will prove fruitful as they pursue the major. (Note: a Gateway course
can fulfill a Period or Criticism requirement as well as a Gateway requirement.)
The department will now give one elective course credit toward the major for a course taken in literature
of a foreign language, whether the course is taught in the original language or in translation. Such a course
may not be used to satisfy the department's historical distribution, criticism, or gateway requirements.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN ENGLISH
The English Department offers three routes toward honors: a creative writing thesis, a critical thesis, and a criti-
cal specialization. Candidates for the program should have at least a 3.5 average in courses taken in English, but
admission will not depend solely on course grades. Formal application to pursue honors must be made to the di-
rector of honors (Theo Davis) by April of the junior year.
All routes require students to take a minimum of ten regular-semester courses (rather than the nine otherwise
required for the major), and to devote their senior year winter study course to their honors projects. All students
writing a critical thesis or pursuing a critical specialization will be required to take the Honors Colloquium in the
fall semester. Students doing a creative writing thesis must, by graduation, take at least nine regular semester
courses, and, in addition, take English 497 (Honors Independent Study) and English W31 (Honors Thesis, winter
study) during senior year. Students writing a critical thesis must, by graduation, take at least eight regular-semester
courses, and, in addition, take English 493 and English 494 (fall Honors colloquium and spring Honors Indepen-
dent Study) and English W31 (Senior Thesis, winter study) during senior year. Students pursuing a critical special-
ization must, by graduation, take at least eight regular-semester courses, and in addition, take English 493 and
English 494 (fall Honors colloquium and spring Honors Independent Study) and English W30 (Honors Thesis:
Specialization Route, winter study) during senior year.
Creative Writing Thesis
The creative writing thesis is a significant body of fiction or poetry completed during the fall semester and
winter study of the senior year, and usually including revised writing done in earlier semesters. (With permission
of the honors committee, the thesis may be undertaken during the winter study period and the spring semester of
the senior year.) Requirements for admission include outstanding work in an introductory and an advanced work-
shop, a recommendation from one of the creative writing teachers (who will then act as thesis advisor), and the
approval of the departmental honors committee. A creative thesis begun in the fall is due on the last day of winter
study; one begun in winter study is due the third Monday after spring break. The methods of evaluation are identi-
cal to those for critical projects (but their page limits do not apply).
Critical Thesis
The critical thesis is a substantial critical essay written during both semesters as well as the winter study period
of the senior year. It must consider critical and/or theoretical as well as literary texts. The thesis should be 15,000
words (45 pages); in no case should it be longer than 25,000 words. The proposal, a 3-page description of the
thesis project, should indicate the subject to be investigated and the arguments to be considered, along with a bibli-
ography. A draft of the entire thesis should be completed by the end of winter study; the finished thesis is due on
the third Monday following spring break. After the critical thesis has been completed, the student publicly presents
his or her work.
Critical Specialization
The critical specialization route is a series of forays into a broad area of interest related to work undertaken in at
least two courses. At least one of these courses must be in the English Department, and both need to have been
taken by the end of fall term in senior year. The specialization route entails: (1) a set of three 10 page essays which
together advance a flexibly-related set of arguments; (2) an annotated bibliography (5 pages) of secondary sources,
explaining their importance to the area of specialization; (3) a meeting with the three faculty evaluators (one of
whom is the advisor) during the last two weeks in February to discuss the trio of essays and the annotated bibliog-
raphy; (4) a fourth essay of 12 pages, considering matters that arose during the faculty-student meeting and reflect-
ing on the outcome of the specialization. The 3-page proposal for the specialization should specify the area and
range of the study, the issues likely to be explored, and the methods to be used for their investigation. It should also
describe the relation between previous course work and the specialization, and include a brief bibliography of
secondary works. The first two papers are due by the end of fall semester; the second paper is due at the end of
winter study; the bibliography is due mid-February; and the final paper is due the third Monday after spring break.
Applying to the Honors Program
All students who wish to apply to the honors program are required to consult with a prospective faculty advisor,
as well as with the director of honors before April of the junior year. Prior to preregistration in April, candidates for
critical theses and specializations submit a 3-page proposal that includes an account of the proposed project and a
bibliography. Students applying to creative writing honors submit a brief proposal describing the project they wish
to pursue. Decisions regarding admission to the honors program will be made by the end of May. Admission to the
honors program depends on the department's assessment of the qualifications of the student and the feasibility of
the project.
English
­ 151 ­
When pre-registering for Fall 2008, students who are applying to critical honors should register for the Honors
Colloquium as one of their four courses.
Progress and Evaluation of Honors
While grades for the fall and winter study terms are deferred until both the honors project and review process
are completed, students must do the equivalent of at least B+ work to continue in the program. Should the student's
work in the fall semester not meet this standard, the course will convert to a standard independent study (English
397), and the student will register for a regular winter study project. A student engaged in a year- long project must
likewise perform satisfactorily in winter study (English W30 or W31) to enroll in English 494 in the spring semes-
ter. When such is not the case, the winter study course will be converted to an independent study "99."
Students are required to submit three final copies of their written work to the department on the dates applicable
to the type of project pursued (see the above descriptions of each type of project for the due dates). All honors
projects are evaluated by not only the advisor, but by two other faculty members. The advisor determines the stu-
dent's semester grades in honors, while the two external readers recommend to the department that the project
receive Highest Honors, Honors, or no Honors. Honors of any kind are contingent upon satisfactory completion of
courses in the major during the spring semester of the senior year. Highest Honors are normally awarded only to
students whose performance in both the honors program and regular courses in the major has been exceptional.
COURSES
100-LEVEL COURSES (except English 150)
Through small class discussions (limited in size to 19 students per section) and frequent writing
assignments, 100-level English courses ask students to develop their skills as readers and as analyti-
cal writers. These courses are prerequisites for taking most other English courses. Students who
receive a 5 on the AP English Literature exam may take upper-level courses without first taking a
100-level. All 100-level English courses are writing intensive, requiring at least 20 pages of writing
in a series of four or more formal essays.
ENGL 105(F) Poetry and Magic (W)
Ancient Celtic texts--Irish and Welsh--associate the poet (meaning any creator of fiction) with powerful mag-
ic--with shape-shifting, access to the other-world, and visions of transcendent authority and truth. Plato, in his
famous condemnation of poetry in The Republic, also associates poetry with magic, but with magic as a con game
or sleight-of-hand trick. This course will use Plato and Celtic texts to establish a theoretical framework for reading
and interpreting the representation of poetry and magic in a variety of literary works from the Middle Ages to the
twentieth century. The goal of the course is to develop effective reading and writing strategies for works of differ-
ent genres and time periods. Reading will include Chaucer's Friar's Tale (where the poet-figure is evil); Mar-
lowe's Doctor Faustus (where the poet-figure sells his soul to the devil for magical power); Shakespeare's Mid-
summer Night's Dream and The Tempest (where fairies and magic represent the positive power of imagination);
and short poems by Coleridge, Keats, Tennyson, and Yeats.
The class will be run as a discussion. Requirements: a mix of writing assignments, formal and informal, totaling
about 25 pages. Students will be evaluated on writing and class participation.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference given to first-year students.
Hour: 1:10-2:25 MR KNOPP
ENGL 109(S) Monsters (W)
"The monster is difference made flesh, come to dwell among us," says Jeffrey Jerome Cohen in his essay "Mon-
ster Theory."These liminal beings-vampires, werewolves, dragons, the Minotaur--seem to literally embody the
darkest parts of our psyches. Their physical forms are aberrations: horned, fanged, scaled, halved, in all ways gro-
tesque. But what happens to us as readers when we are transported inside these monsters' bodies? What does this
monstrous displacement reveal about our own humanity, as well as our historical and cultural anxieties?In this
class we will read novels by contemporary American authors that are told from the monster's point of view, in-
cluding Katherine Dunne's Geek Love, John Gardner's Grendel, Anne Carson's The Autobiography of Red, and
Steve Sherrill's The Minotaur Takes a Cigarette Break, as well as stories by Borges, Calvino, Jim Shepard, and
Kelly Link. Monsters, the ultimate fiends and outsiders, are here recast as their stories' heroes. Grendel tells his
side of "Beowulf," the Minotaur's modern labyrinth is a North Carolina trailer park, red-winged Geryon fights to
survive first love, and Olympia the albino dwarf tries to be a better mother. Why? To what end have American
writers exploited the subversive potential of the monster in these mythic revisions and inversions? And what as-
pects of craft do these writers use to make the monster's fictional universe, psychology and physicality believable
to us?
Format: discussion/seminar. Evaluation will be based on class participation, two critical papers of 5-7 pages in
length, and three or four short writing assignments.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected 19). Preference given to first-year students.
Hour: 2:35-3:50 MR RUSSELL
ENGL 111(S) Poetry and Politics (W)
"Poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the world" wrote Shelley in his 1821 "Defence of Poetry," counter-
ing the widely held view of poetry's airy irrelevance to the material progress of humanity. His claims are echoed a
century and a half later in Audre Lorde's "Poetry is Not a Luxury," in which she argues that poetry is a vital and
essential part of her own political struggle as a Black lesbian feminist. But when W.B. Yeats--himself a very
politically involved poet--writes in 1917 that "from the quarrel with others comes rhetoric; from the quarrel with
ourselves comes poetry," he implies that poetry would suffer from too much involvement with the "quarrel with
others" that is politics, becoming, perhaps, something more like advertising jingles for political dogma. And when
English
­ 152 ­
W. H. Auden writes in 1939 that "poetry makes nothing happen" he appears to locate poetry's value precisely in its
irrelevance to politics as such. This course will focus on the vexed relationship between poetry and political
struggle, reading predominantly poetry and poetics (writings about poetry) of the last two centuries in an effort to
answer the questions: what can poetry do for politics? what does politics do for (or to) poetry? Is poetry essential to
political struggle, or do poetry and politics mix only to the detriment of both, producing, on the one hand, bad
poetry, and on the other, mere distractions from the "real" work of politics? The primary goal of the course is to
make students better readers of poetry, and better readers and writers of argumentative prose. No prior experience
with poetry (or politics!) is expected.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: active class participation and 20 pages of writing in the form of fre-
quent short papers.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference given to first-year students.
Hour: 11:20-12:35 TR CASE
ENGL 114(S) Literary Speakers (W)
The general purpose of this course is to develop students' skills as interpreters of poetry and short fiction. Its partic-
ular focus is on how-and with what effects- poets create the voices of their poems, and fiction writers create their
narrators. We'll consider the ways in which literary speakers inform and entice, persuade and sometimes deceive,
their audiences. Readings will include texts from various historical periods, with particular emphasis on the twen-
tieth century (including works by James Joyce, Henry James, Vladimir Nabokov, Robert Frost, Toni Cade Bam-
bara, Raymond Carver, and Seamus Heaney).
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: a discussion class with emphasis on close reading and frequent, care-
ful writing (about 20 pages, in the form of short papers).
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference given to first-year students.

ENGL 117(S) Introduction to Cultural Theory (Same as Comparative Literature 117) (W)
This course has a clear purpose. If you had signed up for a course in biology, you would know that you were about
to embark on the systematic study of living organisms. If you were registered for a course on the American Civil
War, you would know that there had been an armed conflict between the northern and southern states in the 1860s.
But if you decide you want to study "culture," what exactly is it that you are studying? The aim of this course is not
to come up with handy and reassuring definitions for this word, but to show you why it is so hard to come up with
such definitions. People fight about what the word "culture" means, and our main business will be to get an over-
view of that conceptual brawl. We will pay special attention to the conflict between those thinkers who see culture
as a realm of freedom or equality or independence or critical thought and those thinkers who see culture as a spe-
cial form of bondage, a prison without walls. The course will be organized around short theoretical readings by
authors ranging from Matthew Arnold to Constance Penley, but we will also, in order to put our new ideas to the
test, watch several films (Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Silence of the Lambs, The Lord of the Rings) and listen to a lot
of rock & roll. Why do you think culture matters? Once you stop to pose that question, there's no turning back.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: five short papers totaling about 20 pages, class attendance and partici-
pation.

ENGL 119(S) Missed Encounters (W)
Although we enjoin ourselves to engage directly those who are personally and culturally different, honesty may
compel us to recognize how inseparable such encounters are from our fantasies of otherness. Although such mutu-
al fantasies can be as reductive as a stereotype, they can also be enormously nuanced and self-revealing--as rich
as literature itself. Where does the fantasized Other come from? To whom does it address itself? Are we always the
masters of our own cultural fantasies? We will engage literary works, journalistic writing, and films, including:
Euripides, The Bacchae; Coetzee, Disgrace; Harriot, "Report of the New Found Land of Virginia"; Conrad, Heart
of Darkness; Faulkner; Gordimer, The Pick Up; Herzog, Aguirre; Barthes, Empire of Signs; Kapuscinski, Travels
with Herodotus; Nicholas Shakespeare, "In Pursuit of Guzman."

Stupidity fascinates authors, and they do not merely despise it--they feel it and make us feel it. Why? Around the
same time that psychologists began measuring and ranking intelligence--and stupidity, under various names, of
course occupied the space below (average) intelligence--literary authors were finding types of stupidity within
intelligence. What is stupidity? Why can't it stay sequestered from intelligence? Is there such a thing as literary
stupidity? (Can one be specifically a bad reader not only of books but of life?) What are the problems of intelli-

ENGL 133(F) New Poetry (W)
In this class we will read or otherwise experience a range of poetry being produced right now in the U.S. Some of
this poetry doesn't immediately seem to "fit" in the classroom: it's too new, too weird, too raw, too cerebral, too
multi-media, too performance-oriented, somehow "unteachable." The premise of the course is that by engaging
with these diverse voices we will come up with ways of talking about them, and that in the process we will have to
take up some big and interesting questions: What is poetry? Can it be defined? How does poetry aim to affect us?
Does one need "expertise" to appreciate it? And: is poetry important? Does it matter-socially, politically, cultural-
ly? The course is aimed at lovers of poetry, those who dislike poetry, those who are intimidated by the idea of it,
and those who can't see why we should bother. Readings will be structured around the work of the poets coming to
Williams to read, and may also include some "old poetry" (for purposes of comparison), critical articles, and man-
ifestos; we will also watch documentaries or listen to CDs of more performance-oriented work (e.g., slam, spoken
word).
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: regular participation; 4 short (from 2-3 to 5-6 pp.) papers, of which
you will be asked to revise two; one essay will be a research paper on a poet or poetic movement of your choice.
Occasional group projects and short postings for class discussion. This course is part of the Critical Reasoning and

ENGL 135(F) Vengeance (W)
For almost three thousand years revenge has been a central preoccupation of European literature. Revenge is invit-
ing to literary and dramatic treatment partly because of its impulse towards structure: it traces a simple arc of injury
and retaliation. A injures B, and B retaliates against A. But retaliation is never easy or equivalent, and there is
always a volatile emotive mixture of loss and grievance that stirs up ethical ambiguities that are seldom resolved.
Vengeance also fascinates because it is so paradoxical. The avenger, though isolated and vulnerable, can neverthe-
less achieve heroic grandeur by coming to personify nemesis. And yet the hero is always contaminated by trying
to make a right out of two wrongs--and he usually has to die for it. Driven by past events, cut off from the present,
and rapt up in stratagems for future reprisals, the avenger's actions are almost always compromised by impotence
or excess. At best, revenge is "a kinde of Wilde Iustice"--a justice that kills its heroes as well as its villains.
We will look at as many stories of vengeance, across as wide a range of cultures and media, as possible.
Evaluation will be based upon class participation; four short papers (5 pages), one of which will be revised into a
longer critical essay (of 10-12 pages). Preference will be given to first-year students and then to sophomores. No
prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19).

ENGL 137(F) Shakespeare's Warriors and Politicians (W)
From history, legend, and his own imaginative powers, Shakespeare has fashioned superlative warriors: Hotspur,
Othello, Macbeth, Antony, and Coriolanus are larger-than-life soldiers on the battlefield. They are, however, fre-
quently undone by love and politics. Hotspur is no match for the shrewd political maneuvering of Prince Hal;
Othello's love for Desdemona turns to hate through the machinations of the Machiavellian Iago; Macbeth is
pushed to regicide by his wife; and Antony is twice undone-made "a strumpet's fool" by Cleopatra and defeated
by a mere "boy" in the supreme politician Octavius Caesar. This course will examine seven plays by Shakespeare,
where the virtues and weaknesses of the warrior and the politician are seen to be in tension: Richard III, Henry IV,
Part I, Henry V, Othello, Macbeth, Antony and Cleopatra, and Coriolanus. In the last play, Shakespeare portrays
the convergence of sex, war, and politics with a new cynicism that leaves no character unscathed. Format:discus-
sion/seminar. Requirements: 20 pages of writing in the form of four essays, ranging in length from 3-7 pages, and
several short journal-style writing assignments, as well as active participation in class.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference given to first-year students.

ENGL 138(F,S) A Love for Literature (Same as American Studies 138) (W)
...might be a troubling thing, if you examine it closely. Like stamp-collecting, say, it sounds a little old-fashioned
these days, a little lonely and sad, probably harmless but possibly pathetic--no offense! Like any other love, it
demands loyalties and incites betrayals, and its contradictions become more volatile as its passion becomes more
intense. And like anything else, it testifies to the burden of its history as much through what it forgets as through
what it chooses to remember.
In this course, we'll encounter this love for literature as manifested, in ambivalent and often vexed ways, by Afri-
can American and Asian American writers as they reflect on literacy, culture, and the "civilizing mission." We will
English

consider how this love bears the weight of histories of slavery, conquest, exploitation, and violence, and how it has
been appropriated, recast, or rejected in pursuit of freedom and/or privilege. Readings may include works by Phil-
lis Wheatley, Frederick Douglass, Carlos Bulosan, José Garcia Villa, Harryette Mullen, Jhumpa Lahiri, and Ja-
maica Kincaid.

This course will examine ways in which diverse works make use of their status as inventions on a page. We will
look at the formal pleasures and interpretive puzzles generated by metafictional techniques including frame narra-
tives, repetition, and readerly address in texts ranging from Harold and the Purple Crayon to such canonical
works as Don Quixote, Lolita and One Hundred Years of Solitude. Might narrative self-consciousness operate as a
form of error-correcting code within the artificial intelligence of the novel?

through the study of three filmmakers: Robert Altman, Francis Ford Coppola, and Martin Scorsese. Films to be
studied include Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch; Polanski's Chinatown; Altman's McCabe and Mrs. Miller and
Nashville; Ashby's The Last Detail; Coppola's The Godfather, The Godfather Part II, The Conversation, and

ENGL 143(F) On Beyond Criticism: New Ways to Write about Fiction (W)
Pretty much what you do in English classes is read stories or novels or poems, discuss them, and write essays
about them. But critical essays are only one form of written response to a text, and in this class we will attempt
other forms as well: you could imagine, for example, reading a story, having a thought or two (or three!) about it,
and then using those thoughts to write another story entirely, whose implications form a critical interpretation of
the first. Or you could imagine a piece of biographical/archival research, or an interview with an author, to expose
some mid-way point between his or her intention, his or her actual accomplishment, and what you think. Or you
could imagine writing a parody or an imitation, the success of which would depend on a complicated piece of
analysis that goes entirely unsaid.
And you can probably see already why we won't be reading Shakespeare or Emily Dickinson for this class.
Instead, we will look at a mixture of horror, science fiction, and fantasy writers-that is, authors whose stories exist
not just as independent entities, but also as self-conscious members of a larger group of stories, conventions, and
traditions. These conventions will be useful not only as a source of analysis, but also as organizing principles for
our own fictional or meta-fictional responses. I have prepared a long list of writers, living and dead: Edgar Allen
Poe, HP Lovecraft, Theodore Sturgeon, Terry Bisson, Philip K. Dick, Samuel R. Delaney, Octavia Butler, Angela
Carter, Gene Wolfe, Kelly Link, Lucius Shepard, Connie Willis. In the event, I will probably choose four names
from this list.
Format: discussion/seminar. This is a writing-intensive seminar, and we will be writing intensively: numerous
small sketches, and at least four longer essays, of at least five pages each.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 12 (expected: 12). Preference given to first-year students.

ENGL 144(F) Whodunit? The Ethnic Detective Novel and its Permutations (Same as American
Studies 144) (W)
The detective or mystery novel has long been a staple of American popular culture and a reliable companion on
tedious journeys. The pleasure that many derive from it is, oddly enough, formed by a deeply paradoxical nature of
the genre: the surprise of the final revelation combined with the predictability of its narrative form and devices,
including stock figures and the detective "hero." Yet this very predictability has also allowed writers to use this
genre to achieve different effects, to tell other stories, and sometimes to subvert the form of the genre itself. In this
class, we will read and discuss works by various American ethnic writers--some who are well-established in this
genre while others take more experimental approaches. What does this genre allow the writers to achieve? How
do the elements of the genre appear and/or shift in the different texts, and to what effects? Texts for this class will
include, among others: selected works by Chester Himes and Walter Mosley, Sherman Alexie's Indian Killer, and
Ishmael Reed's Mumbo Jumbo.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: active in-class participation, four short papers, one longer paper (5-7
pages) on a detective novel of your choice (can be chosen from or beyond the course readings).
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference given to first-year students.

ENGL 145(S) Reading and Writing Science Fiction (W)
This course will explore some of the themes and techniques of modern science fiction by examining a range of
published stories, while at the same time making some new stories of our own. Writers of fiction and non-fiction
often watch each other with suspicion, as if from opposing sides of an obvious frontier. Though the goals of both
English
­ 155 ­
forms of writing--the disciplined articulation of brainy thoughts and mighty feelings--are similar, there is a ten-
dency in both camps to think their methods different and exclusive. The conceit of this class is to imagine that
constructing a plot and constructing an argument, say, are complementary skills, and that the tricks and techniques
of one type of writing can profitably be applied to the other. With this in mind, the class is made of two strands
twisted together--a creative writing workshop and a course in critical analysis. There will be short weekly assign-
ments in both types of writing, as well as two larger projects: an original science fiction short story and a critical
essay. Assigned readings will include stories and essays by Terry Bisson, Octavia Butler, Rachel Pollack, Samuel
R. Delaney, Karen Joy Fowler, Carol Emshwiller, and John Crowley.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: active participation in class and a minimum of 20 pages of writing,
both critical and creative.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 12 (expected: 12). Preference given to first-year students.

paper, you will be experimenting with other kinds of writing as well. There is no required text, but at least occa-
sionally you will also be asked to read professional work, looking for inspiration and stuff you can steal.
Format: discussion/workshop. There will be weekly writing assignments, short essays that we will then examine
in class. I will make every effort to preserve your anonymity. In addition, there will be at least one extended proj-
ect.

ENGL 207T(F) Hollywood Directors: Hawks, Lubitsch, and Sturges (W)
Mainstream narrative cinema as we know it today was shaped during Hollywood's "Golden Age," the 1930's and
1940's, when Hollywood set the stylistic and narrative norms that have dominated cinema ever since. Working in
many narrative genres, and forging distinctive styles despite the industrial methods of the studio system, the best
Hollywood directors, such as Howard Hawks, Ernst Lubitsch, and Preston Sturges, were able to produce an asto-
nishing number of great films within a short span of time, which won the spectator over not by the sensational
visual stunts so common today, but by using superb writing and deft cinematography to spin out engaging narra-
tives. Despite their light touch, these films are deceptively thoughtful about social, psychological, and ethical prob-
lems. In this tutorial course, intended primarily for sophomores who have already taken an introductory course in
cinema, we will study a range of films by Hawks, Lubitsch, and Sturges--primarily comedies, but also gangster
films, Westerns, films noirs, and perhaps musicals--taking advantage of each director's distinctive style and social
and moral vision to find common strains of thought among diverse works. Topics to be discussed will include
sexuality and gender relations, class mobility, distinctively American forms of ambition and heroism, World War
II and the Depression, thievery and con games. Critical essays on individual films, as well as accounts of film
genres and of the socio-historical backgrounds of the period, will be assigned, along with films such as Scarface,
Bringing Up Baby, The Big Sleep, Red River, Trouble in Paradise, Ninotchka, To Be or Not To Be, The Lady Eve,
The Palm Beach Story, and Sullivan's Travels. A week's assignment, apart from writing, will normally comprise
English
­ 156 ­
one film screening and one or two essays.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: After a week in which we will meet as a group to become acquainted with some of
these films and with approaches to analyzing them, students will meet with the instructor in pairs for one hour each
week during the rest of the semester. They will write a 5- to 6-page paper every other week (five in all), and com-
ment on their partners' papers in alternate weeks. Emphasis will be placed on developing skills not only in reading,
viewing, and interpretation, but also in constructing critical arguments and responding to them in written and oral
critiques.
Prerequisite: a 100-level English course (except English 150), and English 203 ("Reading Films") or 204 ("The
Feature Film"), or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Preference given to sophomores,

ENGL 208T(F) Poetry (W)
What do poems do? How do poems work and play? How do poems challenge and reward attentive scrutiny?
What does close, sustained reading enable us to think, feel, and say about a poem? To encourage subtler, richer
responses to poetry, this tutorial considers a single great poem per week, such as John Keats's Ode to a Nightin-
gale, William Butler Yeats's Sailing to Byzantium, and Adrienne Rich's Diving into the Wreck. Students will
memorize 12 lines of a half a dozen poems. The purposes of the course are to develop reading and interpretive
skills, and to construct critical arguments, considering complicating perspectives, and responding to competing
viewpoints in written and oral critiques.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: Students will meet with the instructor in pairs for at least an hour each week; they
will write a 5-page paper every other week (five in all), and comment on their partners' papers in alternate weeks.

ENGL 210(S) American Modernism (Same as American Studies 210)
"Modernism" in literature refers to texts from the second half of the nineteenth through the first half of the twen-
tieth century; our course will center on prose in and around the 1920s. The central issue is their self-referentiality
and their extra-referentiality: books acutely aware of their own status as language nevertheless aspire to describe,
or even save, the world beyond words--modernism posits an aestheticism that can seem redemptive. Thus a con-
cern of the course will be the relation of modernism and modernity: the new world that needs saving. The Ameri-
can version of modernism will in addition have the challenge of producing out of the difficulties of self-conscious
fiction a redemption that suits a democracy. Prose writers of the course will include Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Faul-
kner, Stein, Toomer, and Cather, and perhaps others.
Format: discussion. Requirements: three papers, one 4-6 pages and one 6-8 pages.

ENGL 220(F) Introduction to African American Writing (Same as Africana Studies 220 and
American Studies 220)
Toni Morrison has described her writing as guided by a musician's imperative always to hold something in re-
serve, to leave her audience wanting something more. It's a simple idea, but a strange one--that a reader's desire
might be fulfilled only by its increase, that its satisfaction requires that it is never enough. African American writ-
ing, in all its richness and variety, moves between never enough and something more; this course will introduce
just a few of the historical experiences, intellectual currents, cultural resources, thematic preoccupations, and for-
mal strategies encountered in this writing, and consider how and to what ends African American literary tradi-
tion(s) have been organized, in critical and polemical ways, by individual writers and scholars, and by artistic and
political movements. We'll forego the perspective of a grand overview, diving right in instead, and we won't nec-
essarily always reach for the best-known titles by the most famous authors. In any case, by the end of the course,
you should be prepared to have more left to read than you did at the beginning.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: frequent short writing assignments, a midterm essay exam, and a final

ENGL 238(S) American Literature since 1945: Racial Formations and Transformations (Same as
American Studies 238)
Sociologist Howard Winant has argued that World War II heralded a significant "break" in racial order: that is, it
signaled the beginning of marked shifts in how people--and states--perceived, thought about, and managed race
and racial inequality. Subsequent decades in the United States witnessed the end of segregation, passage of Civil
Rights, liberalization of immigration policies, and the rise of "multicultural" awareness and curriculum in social,
political, and academic arenas. These landmark events and shifts contributed to a narrative of racial progress as the
dominant "story" of post-war America. However, as Winant cautions, the "break" was not absolute, nor did it put
an end to all racial hierarchies. Following this argument, we will consider and discuss how literary and cultural
texts reflect, produce, and/or complicate the narrative of progress (racial and otherwise) that has often character-

GATEWAY COURSES
200-level "Gateway" courses are designed for first- and second-year students contemplating the
major or intending to pursue more advanced work in the department; these courses focus on analyti-
cal writing skills while introducing students to critical and historical approaches that will prove
fruitful in later courses. (Note: a Gateway course can fulfill a Period or Criticism requirement as
well as a Gateway requirement. Students contemplating the English major are strongly urged to
take a Gateway course by the end of Sophomore year.)
ENGL 218(F,S) Forms of Violence (Gateway) (W)
"It seems that the appetite for pictures showing bodies in pain is almost as keen as the desire for ones that show
bodies naked." When Susan Sontag made this claim she was referring to paintings and photographs. She could
just as well have been talking about poetry or drama. In this course we will consider stories, plays and movies that
take up, in one way or another, the problem of aestheticized cruelty. We will ask how art might help us to under-
stand various forms of violence--domestic, random, state-sponsored--and how violence may help us to under-
stand art. Works to be studied will include: Oedipus, The Bacchae, Othello, John Ford's The Searchers, Orson
Welles' A Touch of Evil, and David Russell's Three Kings. We will also read stories and novels by Eudora Welty,
Raymond Carver, Alice Munro, and J.M. Coetzee.
Format: seminar/discussion. Requirements: five short essays, including one revision.
Prerequisite: a 100-level English course, except 150. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference given to ad-
vanced first-year students, sophomores, and English majors who have yet to take a Gateway.
This course is part of the Critical Reasoning and Analytical Skills initiative.

ENGL 225(S) Romanticism and Modernism (Gateway) (W)
In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, literature written in English participated in two international aesthetic
movements, Romanticism and Modernism, respectively. While Modernism is often thought to mark a decisive
break with Romanticism--in part because both movements presented themselves as "new," a radical departure
from what had gone before--there are important continuities and affinities as well as breaches between the two
movements. This course will investigate the nature of Romanticism and Modernism, and the relation between
them. We will study major works from each period, including polemics, poetry, novels, and short stories. Our
Romantic writers will be primarily British, and will include Wordsworth, Coleridge, Percy and Mary Shelley;
Modernist writers will include a more international cast of characters: Wilde, the French Symbolist poets, along
with Pound, Stein, Williams, and several Harlem Renaissance writers. We will explore each movement's engage-
ment with a range of topics and issues: for example, the subjective experience of time and memory; the nature of
symbolization and the role of "feeling" in art; the relation of the individual mind to social life; the conflicted appeal
for the artist of "common" language and experience, on the one hand, and avant-garde forms of expression, on the
other. Our broader aim will be to invite potential English majors to think critically about the principles that underlie
the ordering of literary history into aesthetic movements and "periods."
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: four or five short essays, including at least one revision.
Prerequisite: a 100-level English course, except 150. Enrollment limit: 19 per section (expected: 19 per section).

ENGL 230(F) Introduction to Literary Theory (Same as Comparative Literature 240) (Gateway)
(W)
In this course we will debate the nature of literary meaning and the relationship of literature to the political. In the
first half of the course we read Paul De Man, Stanley Fish, and other critics as we explore questions such as, What
determines the meaning of a text? Can an interpretation of a literary work be deemed true or false? In the second
half of the course, we will read works by Frantz Fanon, Michel Foucault, and other authors as we investigate the
role of art in the construction and transformation of political subjectivities. The emphasis will be on exploring and
defending arguments on the issues in productive discussion and frequent short papers.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: several short papers amounting to 20 pages of writing and an in-class
presentation.
Prerequisite: a 100-level English course, except 150. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference given to first-
year students, sophomores, English majors who have yet to take a Gateway, and potential Comparative Literature

ENGL 233(S) Great Big Books (Same as Comparative Literature 283) (Gateway) (W)
Some of the greatest novels are really, really long--so long that they are too seldom read and taught. This course
takes time to enjoy the special pleasures of novels of epic scope: the opportunity to immerse oneself in a wide and
teeming fictional world; to focus sustained attention on the changeable fortunes of characters and societies over a
long span of time; to appreciate the detailed grounding of lives in their social environment and historical moment;
to experience the leisurely and urgent rhythms, with their elaborate patterning of build-ups and climaxes, that are
possible in such works. We will read but two novels, both preoccupied with the disruption and evolution of lives
and loves at moments of historic upheaval: War and Peace (1869), Leo Tolstoy's epic of the Napoleonic Wars, and
Parade's End (1924-28), Ford Madox Ford's modernist masterpiece about World War I and its traumatic impact
on English social life. Set a century apart, the novels are distinguished by vivid and scrupulous representation of
English
­ 159 ­
their respective wars, by their shrewd accounts of political and social pressures informing the crises, and by their
insight into the struggles of those whose lives are engulfed in global crisis. Tolstoy's and Ford's approaches to
fictional representation, however, provide intriguing contrasts: one favors the lucidity of classic realism, the other
the challenges of modernist innovation; one deploys a single multiplot novel, the other a tetralogy of shorter novels
developing a single plot. We will discuss the differing strategies and effects of these two approaches, as well as the
more general difficulties of reading and interpreting long fiction.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: four short essays and two brief revision exercises.
Prerequisite: a 100-level English course, except 150. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected 19). Preference to first- and

ENGL 237(S) Gender and Desire 1200-1600 (Same as Comparative Literature 237 and Women's
and Gender Studies 237) (Gateway) (W)
The celebration of "courtly love" by medieval and Renaissance writers institutionalized the notion of the desiring
male subject and the desired female object that continues to reverberate in contemporary culture. But early writers
do not always, or even usually, endorse these positions uncritically, and even works that elevate heterosexual love
devote surprisingly large spaces for other kinds of desire. What does it mean, for example, that the fountain of
Narcissus occupies the center of the garden of courtly love in the Romance of the Rose? That despite the Lover's
proclaimed desire to "possess" the Rose, it is the male God of Love he kisses on the mouth? Shakespeare's com-
edies end famously with triple and quadruple marriages, but how should we read the cross-dressing and gender
confusion that occupy so much of the plots beforehand? As we explore these and other issues, we will supplement
our literary readings with theoretical texts drawn from medieval and Renaissance treatises as well as contempo-
rary feminist, psychoanalytic, and queer theory. The goal of the course is to sharpen critical reading and writing
skills across a broad range of literary forms and historical, cultural and aesthetic values.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: class participation, four or five papers of varying lengths including
one revision, and occasional oral reports.

ENGL 257(F) The Personal Essay (Gateway) (W)
The personal essay as a literary form has been the site of some of the most inventive and beautiful writing of recent
decades; it is also a form with a long history. In this course we will trace the history of the form beginning with
essays by Michel de Montaigne, continuing through the eighteenth, nineteenth and twentieth centuries (Samuel
Johnson, Henry David Thoreau, Virginia Woolf, George Orwell, James Baldwin, James Agee, Truman Capote,
Hunter S. Thompson), and moving into the present. Of contemporary work we will focus primarily on American
essayists including Joan Didion, Annie Dillard, Harry Crews, Nicholson Baker, John Edgar Wideman, Alice
Walker, David Foster Wallace, Geoff Dyer, Anne Carson. As this list of names suggests, we will explore the wide
range of writing described by the term "personal essay": literary journalism, creative nonfiction, memoir and the
lyric essay. Emphasis will be on developing literary critical skills and powers of persuasive interpretive argument,
but students will also be asked to try their hands at writing creative nonfiction following the models we have read.
Peer editing and revision will be built into the structure of the course.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based upon class participation and writing (approximately 20 pages total).
Prerequisite: 100-level English course. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference given to first-year students,
sophomores, potential English majors who have not yet taken a Gateway.

ENGL 258(F) Poetry and the City (Gateway) (W)
In this course we will consider poems generated out of the experiences of urban life. The city provides for poets a
vivid mental and imaginative landscape in which to consider the relation of vice and squalor to glamour; the nature
of anonymity and distinction; and the pressure of myriad bodies on individual consciousness. We will explore
ways in which the poet's role in the body politic emerges in representations of the city as a site both of civilized
values and/or struggles for power marked by guile and betrayal. Taking into account the ways in which cities have
been transformed over time by changing social and economic conditions, we will consider such issues as what the
New York of the 1950s has to do with the London of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, and why
poetry as a genre might be particularly suited to representing the shifting aspects of urban life. Poets will include
Dante, Pope, Swift, Blake, Wordsworth, Whitman, Baudelaire, Arnold, Yeats, Crane, Moore, Auden, Hughes,
Bishop, Ginsberg, Baraka, and Ashbery. We will also draw on essays by Simmel, Benjamin, Williams, and Canet-
ti, photographs by Hines, Weegee, and Abbott; the blues, as sung by Holliday and Vaughan; and films such as Man
with a Movie Camera, Rear Window, and Breathless.
Format: discussion/ seminar. Requirements: four or five short essays, including at least one revision.

ENGL 264(S) Epic and Mock-Epic (Gateway) (W)
This gateway course begins with three masterpieces of world literature, Homer's Iliad and Odyssey and Milton's
Paradise Lost. We will examine metamorphoses of the epic genre from classical antiquity to modernity, its charac-
teristic attributes, traditional elements, and radical transformations. A key development is the rise of mock-epic,
such as Pope's The Rape of the Lock, Byron's Don Juan, Joyce's Ulysses, and Eliot's The Waste Land. Since
"epic" usually means long and demanding, some of these texts will be read selectively, stressing attentive reading
rather than exhaustive coverage.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: six analytic papers, roughly every other week, ranging from two to

ENGL 265(S) Topics in American Literature: Tradition, Context and Beyond (Gateway) (W)
This course will explore three approaches to the concept of "American Literature." First, we will consider a group
of texts in chronological order that share a preoccupation with the seductive powers of rhetoric. We will explore
how colonial-era sermons, eighteenth-century political discourse, and nineteenth-century abolitionist literature
constitute a literary tradition concentrated on the power of language to join persons together into a common cause.
Second, we will look at stories by Henry James, Edith Wharton, and Charles Chesnutt, all written in the late nine-
teenth century, and explore how that particular time inflected the authors' realism. Third, we will look at a model
of American literature that is bound neither by nation nor by historical era, considering connections between Em-
erson and the British writer Thomas Carlyle, and between Thoreau and the Bhagavad Gita. As we gather from
these three course sections a sense of the richness of concerns and practices in American literature, we will also
inquire into the stakes of each mode of organizing the study of a "national literature." What beliefs about the rela-
tionship of literature to nation lie beneath different approaches to American literature? What effects do our choices
about conceptualizing American literature have on our sense of America today?
Format: seminar/discussion. Requirements: three 4-page papers and one 5-page final paper

A study of the Canterbury Tales in its literary, linguistic, and historical contexts. The goals of the course are to

perhaps its greatest comic writer. Combination lecture and discussion.

ENGL 306(F) The Medieval Reader
In the Confessions, Augustine describes watching a man reading quietly to himself. The sight, so familiar to us,
shocks him. In this course we will study some of the major works of the Middle Ages, including Dante's Inferno,
Boccaccio's Decameron and Chaucer's Canterbury Tales. We will discuss the conflicting, often self-contradictory
claims that writers in this period made for the importance of literature and the anxieties that new types of fic-
tion--about sex, about God, about the plague--generated. We will consider medieval theories of interpretation
and ask what it meant to read, or misread, before books were commonplace.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: class attendance and participation, three essays totaling 20-25 pages.

ENGL 311(S) Theorizing Shakespeare (Same as Theatre 352 and Women's and Gender Studies

For complex reasons, Shakespeare has always revealed as much about those who speculate on him as the specula-
tors have revealed about him. In this course, we will engage a few plays in considerable depth: Merchant of Venice,
King Lear, Hamlet, Winter's Tale. But we will also use these works as a means to engage some of the most com-
pelling trends in recent critical thought, including cultural theory and post-Marxist analysis, Political Theology,
deconstruction and rhetorical theory, psychoanalytic thought and theories of gender and sexuality. In some
instances, we will look at applied criticism, in others we will simply place a theoretical work along side a play and
see what they have to say to each other--what, for instance, would a Shakespearean reading of Jacques Lacan
look like?
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: active class participation and 20 pages of writing in the form of two

ENGL 320T(S) Marlowe and Shakespeare (W)
In 1586, at the age of twenty-three, Christopher Marlowe wrote Tamburlaine the Great. Over the next six years-
probably while moonlighting as a government spy-he went on to produce some of the strangest and also most
influential works of English drama. Then in 1593, Marlowe was murdered, stabbed through the eye in a tavern
brawl. It is often said that Marlowe's early death, no less than his early success, made the work of Shakespeare
possible. In this tutorial we will read Marlowe's Edward II, the first popular history play in English, and Shake-
speare's Richard II; The Jew of Malta and The Merchant of Venice; Doctor Faustus and Macbeth. We will look at
ways in which Marlovian preoccupations--with lurid violence, with debasement, with self-invention--resurface
in Shakespeare, in new forms. In the process we will also take up more general questions of literary influence:
What do writers borrow from each other? And how does the knowledge of indebtedness--shared to varying de-
grees with an audience--affect the meaning and impact of their work? Critical readings will include essays by
Harry Levin, Harold Bloom and Stephen Greenblatt.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: Students will meet with the instructor in pairs for an hour each week; they will
write a 5- to 7-page paper every other week (five in all), and comment on their partners' papers in alternate weeks.
Emphasis will be placed on developing skills not only in reading and interpretation, but also in constructing critical
arguments and responding to them.

ENGL 321(S) Samuel Johnson and the Literary Tradition
Johnson has been exceptionally influential not only because he was a distinguished writer of poems, essays, criti-
cism, and biographies, but also because he was the first true historian of English literature, the first who sought to
define its "tradition." We will read Johnson's own works and Boswell's Life of Johnson to discover Johnson's
talents, tastes, and standards as an artist, as a moral and literary critic, and as a man. We next will use Johnson's
Preface to Shakespeare and Lives of the English Poets to examine how this great intelligence assessed writers
from the Renaissance through the eighteenth century. While reading his commentary on Shakespeare and his criti-
cal biographies of Milton, Dryden, Pope, Swift, and Gray, we will analyze selected works by these writers so as to
evaluate Johnson's views and to sharpen our understanding of the relationships between his standards and our
own.

ENGL 322T(S) Novel Arguments (W)
What does it mean to say that a novel has an argument-that, in other words, it advocates certain beliefs and offers
reasons in support of them? We will examine this central question through close reading of European and Ameri-
can nineteenth-century novels by authors including Charles Dickens, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Gustave Flaubert,
and Samuel Richardson. We will inquire into theoretical concerns about the meanings of fiction, among them: In
what sense can fiction persuade? Are particular beliefs or principles "argued" by the form of the novel, even
against an author's conscious wishes? To explore these questions, we will also read critical works exemplifying
differing answers to the question of how the novel possesses arguments about issues such as class, industry, slav-
ery, and consumer culture.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: Students will meet with the instructor in pairs for one hour each week. They will
alternate between writing 5- to 7-page papers and commentaries on their partner's papers.

ENGL 325T(S) Thinking Through Middlemarch (W)
George Eliot is often called the most intellectual of English novelists. As the first English translater of Strauss and
Feuerbach, editor of the Westminster Review, partner of the philosopher George Henry Lewes, and friend of Her-
bert Spencer, Charles Darwin, and others, Eliot was abreast of the main intellectual currents of her day. Eliot's
fiction doesn't just reflect these currents, it participates actively in them. As a result, Middlemarch, her most ac-
complished novel, has an intellectual depth and complexity almost unrivalled in English fiction. We will spend the
first two weeks, seminar-style, reading and discussing Middlemarch together. Then, moving into tutorial mode,
we will reread it, focusing on one of its eight books per week, alongside relevant critical, philosophical, scientific
and historical works, ranging from Eliot's contemporaries to the present day.

ENGL 326T(S) Inscrutable Evil, or the Transformative Horror Film (W)
"Monsters are meaning machines," the critic Judith Halberstam pointed out, and any number of critics have
spotted the etymological connection between the noun monster and the verb demonstrate: to show, to reveal. Hor-
ror has been the most durable of film genres and possibly the one that's had the most radical effect in terms of
transforming the medium as a whole. Because of its transgressive nature, it has always attracted a lot of attention,
giving its most famous texts enormous cultural reach, and allowing them to become part of ongoing cultural con-
versations on what defines evil, what constitutes normality, what should remain hidden. Whatever the monster
obscures or illuminates about a given culture, the monster's inscrutability speaks to anxieties about those blind-
nesses a culture might have about itself. This course will consider a common type of horror film--the kind in
which the unspeakable is seen as at least potentially invisible beneath the quotidian--as a way of conceptualizing
an instability of increasing social interest: how the rational gives way to--and perhaps might always have
masked--the frenzied and the monstrous; how, as Freud sought to demonstrate in his essay "The Uncanny," the
familiar and the disturbingly unfamiliar can be seen to somehow coincide. To a secondary extent, the course will
be a study of the features and formal properties of the horror genre itself, and a consideration of its history and
influence, with an emphasis on stylistic innovations and thematic preoccupations. Films to be studied will include
John Robertson's Doctor Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Henri-Georges Clouzot's Diabolique, Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho,
David Cronenberg's The Fly, Juan Carlos Fresnadillo's 28 Weeks Later, and David Fincher's Zodiac.

ENGL 329(F) U.S. Wars in Asia and their Legacies (Same as American Studies 329)
The rise of U.S. as a global power in 20th century has been inaugurated and marked perhaps most prominently
through its wars in Asia--in the Philippines, Pacific Islands, Korea, Vietnam, etc. These wars have left profound
impact and legacy in American political and cultural landscapes, littering them--figuratively speaking, of
course--with remnants and excesses of war. And while wars themselves have been theorized as traumatic experi-
ences that resist representation, they have also been, paradoxically, immensely generative of numerous literary and
cultural narratives. This course examines texts that engage with these cultural legacies of U.S. wars in Asia. Rather
than asking how literary texts represent war and experience of war, we will ask how they respond to, produce
and/or problematize the multiple crises and narratives generated through the experience and history of wars in
Asia. In addition to the literary texts that we will read (works by Chester Himes, Tim O'Brien, Joan Didion, Gra-
ham Greene, among others), there will also be a fair amount of secondary readings that will provide additional
historical and theoretical frameworks.

ENGL 332(F) Colonial Subjects (D)
For almost 150 years--from the late seventeenth through the early nineteenth centuries--dramatizations of Aphra
Behn's Oronooko, the fictional account of a slave revolt in Surinam, were among the most popular offerings on the
London stage; by the late 18th century the title role was commonly played by black actors, some of whom had
themselves been slaves, and whose other roles would have ranged from Othello to the villainous "Obi, or Three-
Fingered Jack." The same period saw the consolidation of modern botanical and zoological classificatory systems,
the emergence of the social sciences (political economy, anthropology, sociology), and the birth of the modern
museum. What these phenomena have in common are a complex relation to British colonial expansion and impe-
rial rule, which produced not just the subjection of non-British people, but also, new "subjects" of representation
and knowledge. This course will examine a rich array of texts and visual materials that suggest the disruptive and
transformative effects Britain's imperial projects had on ways of seeing and knowing, both within and outside the
metropolis. Materials will include Behn's Oroonoko and 18th and 19th century London stage adaptations of the
novel, along with a modern adaptation by Nigerian writer Biyi Bandele (performed for a London audience in
1999); travel narratives, including the journals and anthropological, botanical, and zoological images from the
voyages of Thomas Cook; poetry of Phyllis Wheatley, William Blake, and Samuel Taylor Coleridge; autobiogra-
phies and polemics by James Gronniosaw, Ottobah Cuguano, and Olaudah Equiano; Defoe's Robinson Crusoe
and Derek Walcott's Pantomime. We will also read critical and theoretical material on colonialism and empire.
This course is part of the Exploring Diversity Initiative; it investigates how attention to the context of colonial
power relations reconfigures our understanding of disciplinary knowledge.
Format: seminar/discussion. Requirements: attendance, active participation, and three 5- to 10-page essays.

ENGL 333(F) The Nineteenth-Century British Novel
Imagine this: a form of art and entertainment that purports to be able to represent everything--intimate, even inac-
cessible human thoughts and feelings, love, class, the city, shopping, sexuality, bureaucracy, social bonds, industri-
alization, nationalism, even modernity itself. In this course we will try to understand the scope of the nineteenth-
century British novel's jaw-dropping representational aspirations: its claim to comprehend in its pages both the
dizzying complexity of new social, political, and economic structures, as well as delineate in finest detail the tex-
ture of individual minds and lives. We will pay attention to the fictional modes by which apparently intractable
social problems are resolved, through a sleight of hand act we seem never to tire of, in the realm of romantic love.
And while we might think of the novel as an Empire of the Little, endlessly occupied with giving significance to
the smallest acts of ordinary human life, we will think about the broader historical and social conditions the novel
both represents in its pages, and is a crucial not-so-silent partner in promoting and contesting. We will also interest
ourselves in the kind of under-the-counter work the Victorian novel does on behalf of British empire, as well as
empire's own behind-the-scenes work for the novel. Since so many of these stories of everyday life seem as famil-
iar to us as everyday life, we will work hard to maintain what is strange and specific about the nineteenth century
even as we recognize within these works the birth of so much that is modern in our own culture. Likely authors
include: Austen, C. Brontë, Thackeray, Dickens, Eliot, Collins, Wilde, Hardy, Conrad.
Format: seminar/discussion. Requirements: three essays, totaling 20-25 pages, class attendance and productive
participation.
Prerequisite: 100-level English course or permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 25 (expected: 20). Prefer-
ence given to English majors.

ENGL 338(S) Literature of the American Renaissance (Same as American Studies 338)
The 1840s and 50s are known as "the American Renaissance," a watershed in American literary history which
includes Thoreau's Walden and Melville's Moby-Dick, Emerson's essays and Hawthorne's fiction. It also includes
major abolitionist writings by Frederick Douglass and Harriet Beecher Stowe, Poe's grotesque tales, and the
groundbreaking poetry of Walt Whitman and Emily Dickinson. Thus, to study the American Renaissance is to
have the pleasure of exploring an inordinately rich period of literary history, and the challenge of negotiating and
explaining the links between works that have importantly distinct relationships to the literary culture and national
politics of the time. These writers do, however, share more broadly in a historical shift in the construction of pri-
vate life: the nuclear family, the discipline of psychology, and the idea that one's emotions are a form of essential
personal property all emerged into their modern form in the nineteenth century. As part of this historical shift,
literature of the American Renaissance constitutes a complex investigation into the life of the emotions, the con-
cept of personal experience, and the representation of intimate human relationships. As we move through fiction
by Hawthorne, Melville, Stowe, and Harriet Wilson, the poetry of Whitman and Dickinson, and the essay and
autobiography of Emerson, Thoreau, and Douglass, we will explore throughout how these authors deploy emo-
tion, how they conceive of emotion's relationship to the individual person and to the culture at large, and how they
variously dramatize the effective leverage of relationships, including heterosexual romantic relationships, relation-
English
­ 164 ­
ships of slaves to their owners, and masculine relationships both homosocial and homosexual. We will explore this
essential period of American literature, then, by inquiring into the ways these authors figure intimacy, emotion,
and experience, as a venue to explore more broadly the formations of literary work and its interventions into the
culture of a nation heading toward Civil War.

ENGL 343T(F) Whitman and Dickinson in Context (W)
In this tutorial, we will read closely the works of two of the most influential and fascinating poets in the U.S., Walt
Whitman and Emily Dickinson. In addition to studying in depth their poems and other writings--in Whitman's
case, his essays; in Dickinson's, her letters-we will delve into some of the major critical debates surrounding their
work, both individually and when compared to one another. For example, Whitman is often viewed as perhaps the
most public nineteenth-century American poet, whereas Dickinson is regarded as perhaps the most "private." We
will interrogate this assumption, exploring how each poet represents publicity and privacy in his/her work, as well
as their efforts to "perform" and/or reform the American self. We will also examine how each poet engages ques-
tions of gender and sexuality, as well as contemporary debates surrounding such issues as abolition/slavery,
women's suffrage, temperance, and territorial expansion. Finally, we will explore Whitman and Dickinson's rela-
tion to significant literary and philosophical movements of the period, including transcendentalism and the culture
of sentiment. Throughout the course, emphasis will be on analyzing and generating interpretations of Whitman
and Dickinson's works, constructing critical arguments, formulating cogent written critiques, and carrying on an
oral debate about a variety of interpretations. Students will meet with the instructor in pairs for an hour each week.
They will alternate between writing 5- to 7-page papers and commentaries on their partner's papers.
Format: tutorial. Students will be evaluated on their written work, their oral presentations of that work, their analy-
ses of their colleague's work, and on a final, comprehensive essay that will address the themes engaged in the

ENGL 347(S) Henry James
This course will be devoted to the work of Henry James, whose brilliant, demanding innovations of prose style
and acute psychological and ethical explorations mark the shift from the nineteenth-century to the modern novel.
James writes about what it meant for American and European societies around the turn of the century to be mutu-
ally exposed to, and by, one another. In so doing, he raises questions about what it means to be civilized, to be
smart, and to be rich. We will consider how the drama of consciousness is played out in his characters' struggles
with love and conscience, and in his own preoccupation with capturing stylistically the narrative logic of the pas-
sions. We will read the novellas Daisy Miller, The Beast in the Jungle, and The Turn of the Screw; the novels
Portrait of a Lady, The Bostonians, What Maisie Knew, and The Ambassadors; and assorted critical writings.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: one 5- to 7-page and one 8- to 10-page paper.

ENGL 354(F) Contemporary American Poetry
What happened to American poetry after all the great modernists--Frost, Stevens, Williams. Moore, Pound,
etc.--completed their work? The answer would have to be: many different things. This course will look at some of
them. We'll begin by reading four undeniably important individual volumes, books that both took our poetry in
new directions and laid down challenges that affect any poet writing today. These collections are: The Lost Son by
Theodore Roethke, Life Studies by Robert Lowell, Geography III by Elizabeth Bishop, and 77 Dream Songs by
John Berryman. (Reading individual collections will also allow us to talk about how poets construct their books--
how the arrangement may change the effect of individual poems, how the books themselves build and unfold--
and so we'll avoid one of the dangers of anthologies, where we're more likely to encounter a selection of greatest
hits.) Following these first four books, we're read another four collections published more recently, books by poets
who are still producing their most exciting work. Likely poets to be considered are Tony Hoagland, Marie Howe,
English

Dean Young, and Louise Gluck. Finally, we will spend some time on very recent individual poems from current
publications.
Format: seminar/discussion. Requirements: participation in class discussions, short responses to each book, one

ENGL 355T(F) Fanaticism (W)
Eighteenth- and nineteenth-century writers of literature and political philosophy repudiate fanaticism--over and
over again. Whether as a religious, political or amorous posture, fanaticism is universally decried and never
avowed. But what is fanaticism, and why should it be considered such a threat, particularly during a period that for
the most part embraced an enlightened secular rationalism? In this course, we will explore these questions by
considering literary texts that dramatize fanaticism in light of accounts by such philosophers and historians as
Kant, Rousseau, Hobbes, Hume, Burke, Carlyle, Mill, William James, and Adorno. Literary readings will be
drawn from works by Swift, Wordsworth, Dickens, Eliot, Balzac, and Henry James. We will also look at drawings
and engravings by Hogarth and Goya. While some of these works oppose to fanaticism a capacity for sympathy,
self-examination, and political flexibility, others ascribe it to the self-contradictory tenets of nineteenth-century
literary realism and political liberalism. Since fanaticism has recently had considerable political currency, we will
also consider some contemporary accounts, by Walter Laqueur and others, which reanimate the debates and con-
cerns of the course.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: students will meet with the instructor in pairs for an hour each week, will write a
5-page paper every other week (five altogether), and comment on their partners' papers in alternate weeks. Em-
phasis will be placed on developing skills not only in reading and interpretation, but also in constructing critical
arguments and responding to them in written and oral critiques.

ENGL 358(S) Eroding Witness: Aesthetics, Knowledge, and Racial Perception (Same as Africana
Studies 358 and American Studies 358)
To say that the operation of racism requires making "race" visible is only to state the obvious. How this happens--
how the members of a society are trained to perceive specific traits and to connect them with racial identifica-
tions--may be somewhat more complex, even if it is taken for granted, as it generally is. Yet it is also obvious that
racism imposes limitations on perception--rendering some people "invisible," or "voiceless," or indistinguishable
from each other. Rather than thinking of these limits as defects, perhaps they may be understood as productive--as
the enabling constraints within which a system of racist perception develops.
In this course, we will consider how such systems of perception have been challenged in African American liter-
ary traditions. This has sometimes been construed as a paradox of invisibility and hypervisibility, or as a tension
between oral and print culture, or between music and writing. We'll engage it more broadly, situating literary texts
within black cultural practices that routinely invoke multiple artistic media at once, pressing against their material
limits in a strategy Nathaniel Mackey has termed "eroding witness." For if racism depends on a training of percep-
tion, the most powerful challenges to this training do not proclaim a disingenuous "colorblindness"; rather, they
draw on visionary political and cultural traditions that improvise what Fred Moten calls "the ensemble of the
senses." Assigned readings may include such writers and critics as W.E.B. Du Bois, Alain Locke, Richard Wright,
Zora Neale Hurston, Audre Lorde, and Brent Hayes Edwards. We'll also extend our analysis in comparative di-
rections through individual and collaborative research, on topics related to African American visual art, music, and
film, and/or other literary and intellectual traditions.

ENGL 360(F) Joyce's Ulysses
This course will explore in depth the demanding and exhilarating work widely regarded as the most important
novel of the twentieth century, James Joyce's Ulysses, which both dismantled the traditional novel and revitalized
the genre by opening up new possibilities for fiction. We will discuss the ways in which compelling issues of
character and theme (e.g., questions of heroism and betrayal, oedipal dynamics, sexuality and the politics of gen-
der, civic engagement and artistic isolation, British imperialism and Irish nationalism), are placed in counterpoint
with patterns drawn from myth, theology, philosophy, and other literature, and will consider the convergence of
such themes in an unorthodox form of comedy. In assessing Ulysses as the outstanding paradigm of modernist
fiction, we will be equally attentive to its radical and often funny innovations of structure, style, and narrative
perspective. In addition to Joyce's novel, readings will include its epic precursor, Homer's Odyssey, as well as
biographical and critical essays. (Students unfamiliar with Joyce's short novel A Portrait of the Artist as a Young
Man, which introduces characters later followed in Ulysses, are urged to read it in advance of the course.)

standing and narration of the world. Topics include: media recycling and culture jamming; the loss of referentiali-
ty; changing thresholds of evidence; and strategies for responding to the global media archive. Experience with

ENGL 401(S) Shakespeare, Fools, and Folly
This is an advanced research course for students who wish to conduct independent research. One of Shakespeare's
most vexed subjects is the nature and effects of folly, ranging from tragic error to humorous clowning. Fools of
many sorts figure prominently throughout Shakespeare's plays, especially in comedies such as As You Like It and
Twelfth Night, but also in tragedies such as Othello and King Lear, histories such as Henry the Fourth, and ro-
mances such as The Tempest. Some of Shakespeare's greatest characters, like Hamlet and Falstaff, play the fool.
Focusing on the language and forms of folly, our reading will also draw upon history, tradition, and critical theories
to better understand clowns, fools, madness, and play.
Format: seminar, with substantial independent research. Requirements: regular presentations in seminar, and a
term paper of 20 pages, planned with the instructor and revised. Evaluation based on participation and written

ENGL 404(F) Auteur Cinema and the Very Long Film (Same as Comparative Literature 324)
This course will focus on six master works by six major film directors: Michelangelo Antonioni's L'Avventura;
Bernardo Bertolucci's The Last Emperor; Ingmar Bergman's Fanny and Alexander; Francis Ford Coppola's
Apocalypse Now!; Federico Fellini's 8 1/2; and Akira Kurosawa's The Seven Samurai. These films were not
always well received: the audience to L'Avventura at Cannes yelled "Cut!" in exasperation with Antonioni's
desultory editing; Pauline Kael regarded both Fanny and Alexander and The Last Emperor as far inferior to Berg-
man's and Bertolucci's youthful efforts, arguing that both had betrayed their former intellectual rigor with a new
sentimentality; Fellini was roundly criticized for narcissism and egotism in casting the heartthrob Marcello Mas-
troianni as himself and devoting such a long film to his personal creative blockage; and Coppola's Apocalypse
Now! was perceived as a disaster in terms of its budget, its prolonged shooting schedule in a jungle environment,
and its devastating impact on the health of its cast and crew. Only The Seven Samurai seems to have been
recognized immediately as a masterpiece. All of these films are self-reflexive works, representing both the
distinctive personalities of their directors and their individual stylistic and thematic concerns--what makes them
examples of auteur cinema. During the first half of the course, we will meet to discuss these films individually
together with selected readings. At the same time students will be assigned one of these directors to research for a
long paper and oral presentation during the second half of the course.

ENGL 430(S) Hitchcock and Psychoanalytic Theory
While Alfred Hitchcock is best known as the creator of many of Hollywood's most entertaining and enduringly
popular movies, his films have also inspired a large body of impressively searching theoretical and critical work,
particularly in the field of psychoanalytic film criticism. In this seminar, intended primarily for upperclassmen
who have already taken an introductory course in cinema as well as at least one upper-level English course, we
will use several of Hitchcock's films as the staging ground for explorations of psychoanalytic theory and its appli-
cability to popular culture. We will not be concerned with applying psychoanalytic ideas to Hitchcock's life. Rath-
er, we will explore the ways in which psychoanalytic models might illuminate the psychology and behavior of his
characters, the narrative structures of his films, and the nature and dynamics of a spectator's engagement with the
films. Topics will include sadism and masochism, voyeurism, the uncanny, fetishism, incest and oedipal conflict,
repression, and the strange itineraries of desire. No prior knowledge of psychoanalytic theory is necessary; this
course is meant to serve in part as an introduction to Freudian theory. After a basic theoretical foundation has been
laid, readings will focus on particular psychoanalytic concepts and phenomena which have special relevance to a
given film. A week's assignment will normally comprise one screening and a couple of essays: for the most part,
theoretical writings by Freud, but also including some contemporary feminist, queer, and film theory and criticism
by such authors as John Berger, Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, Laura Mulvey, Tania Modleski, and Stephen Heath.
Films to be studied will include Rebecca, Strangers on a Train, Notorious, Spellbound, Shadow of a Doubt, Rear
Window, Vertigo, and Psycho. During the course of the semester, students will write two papers of medium length.
These papers will be analyzed in part through tutorial or colloquium sessions; at the end of the semester they will
be combined and extended in a long final paper.
Format: mostly discussion/seminar, with occasional tutorial and/or colloquium sessions. Requirements: active
participation in discussions; one or two short bibliographic assignments; two 6-page papers and occasional short
assessments of other students' papers; and one long (15- to 20-page) final paper, which will incorporate revised
versions of the shorter papers written earlier.

CONCENTRATION IN ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
The Environmental Studies Program, within the liberal arts mission of Williams College, provides students
with an opportunity to explore how humans interact with the environment, including physical, biological, philo-
sophical, and social elements. The program is designed so that students will understand the complexity of issues
and perspectives and to appreciate that most environmental issues lack distinct disciplinary boundaries. Our goal is
to aid students in becoming well-informed, environmentally-literate citizens of the planet who have the capacity to
become active participants in the local and global community. To this end, the program is designed to develop
abilities to think in interdisciplinary ways and to use synthetic approaches in solving problems while incorporating
the knowledge and experiences gained from majoring in other departments at the College.
The concentration in Environmental Studies allows students to pursue an interdisciplinary study of the environ-
ment by taking elective courses in the natural sciences, the social sciences, and the humanities and the arts. The
purpose of the program is to provide the tools and ideas needed to engage constructively with the environmental
and social issues brought about by changes in population, economic activity, and values. Environmental contro-
versies typically call upon citizens and organizations to grasp complex, uncertain science, contending human val-
ues, and ethical choices--in short, to grapple with matters for which the liberal arts are a necessary but not suffi-
Environmental Studies

cient preparation. Environmental Studies accordingly includes courses in natural sciences, social sciences, hu-
manities, and the arts, in order to equip students with the broad educational background needed to analyze com-
plex environmental matters and to fashion pragmatic, feasible solutions.
The program is administered by the Center for Environmental Studies (CES), located in Kellogg House.
Founded in 1967, CES was one of the first environmental studies programs at a liberal arts college. In addition to
the academic program, CES is the focus of a varied set of activities in which students lead and participate, often
with other members of the Williams community. The Matt Cole Memorial Library at Kellogg House holds a sub-
stantial collection of books, periodicals, unpublished documents, maps, and electronic media. Kellogg House also
houses a Geographic Information Systems laboratory as well as study and meeting facilities available to students
and student groups. The Center administers the Hopkins Memorial Forest, a 2500-acre natural area northwest of
campus, where field-study sites, a laboratory, and passive-recreation opportunities may be found in all seasons.
CES also operates an environmental analysis laboratory at the Science Center.
The Environmental Studies Program has three overlapping components:
 The concentration in Environmental Studies, which consists of a set of seven courses.
 The Four Places goal. (See below.)
 Honors in Environmental Studies; a senior thesis is encouraged but not required.
Concentration Requirements
Seven courses are required: four are core courses to be taken by all students earning the concentration; three are
distribution courses to be selected from the lists below.
Core courses
101 Humans and the Biosphere
203 Ecology
302 Environmental Planning and Design Workshop
402 Senior Seminar
The core courses are intended to be taken in sequence, although there is some flexibility allowed. Environmen-
tal Studies (ENVI) 101 is a broad introduction to the field, emphasizing the humanities and social sciences. ENVI
203 is a course in ecology (offered in Biology) that provides a unified conceptual approach to the behavior of
living things in the natural world. ENVI 302 puts teams of students to work on planning projects of immediate
importance in the Berkshires. ENVI 402, the senior seminar, is an opportunity for concentrators majoring in a
wide variety of disciplines to draw together their educational experiences and provide a personal accounting of
how they understand the interdisciplinary character of environmental studies and its connections to their future
lives and careers. The core course structure affords students freedom to explore and to specialize in diverse fields
of study, while sustaining a focus on environmental questions throughout their time at Williams.
An interdisciplinary course emphasizing field science, ENVI 102 (Introduction to Environmental Science), is
strongly recommended for all students interested in the concentration.
Distribution Courses
In order to earn the concentration a student must take one course from each of the following three groups.
Courses may be counted both toward the concentration in Environmental Studies and toward a disciplinary major.

Variations from the requirements of the concentration must be approved in writing by the director of the pro-
gram. Students are urged to consult with program faculty and the director as soon as they develop an interest in
the concentration or if they intend to participate in study away opportunities.
In addition to courses fulfilling the concentration requirements, the following electives and related electives are
offered:
Environmental Studies 397, 398 Independent Study of Environmental Problems
Environmental Studies 493-W31-494 Senior Research and Thesis
Winter study courses play an important role in the program, offering opportunities to experiment in fields unfa-
miliar to the student, and for interdisciplinary topics to be developed by faculty working alone and in teams. Stu-
dents are urged to review each year's winter study offerings bearing in mind their interests in the environment.
Rationale for Course Numbering
The numbering sequence of the four required courses reflects the order in which they should be taken, although
Environmental Studies 302 may be taken in the senior or sophomore year if a student is away junior year. Cross-
listed courses are assigned the same number as the departmental number whenever possible.
Four Places--A Goal
The human place in natural landscapes is geographic, and learning about particular places is an essential part of
environmental studies. By the time each student in Environmental Studies graduates, she or he should have devel-
oped intellectual insight into and personal experience of four places: "Home"; "Here"--the Berkshires;
"There"--an alien place; and "The World"--a global perspective. For practical purposes, "There" is a place
where the geography is unusual in the student's experience (e.g., developing country, inner city, arctic), so are the
socioeconomic circumstances (for example, per capita income might be a small fraction of a year's tuition at Wil-
liams), and the language is not standard English. Although this goal is not a requirement for the concentration, it is
a significant aspect of the program, and CES resources are aimed in part at enabling all students to meet this goal.
For example, students are encouraged to pursue summer internships in their "Home" communities, or to do se-
mester or winter study courses at locations outside the temperate zones ("There"); field courses in natural science
or history courses emphasizing New England can deepen familiarity with "Here." Students concentrating in Envi-
ronmental Studies should plan winter study courses and summer work or study experiences with the Four Places
goal in mind, particularly the experiences "There" and at "Home." Courses not in the list of electives for the con-
centration may be considered as substitutes, on a case-by-case basis, if they also meet the Four Places goal in a
way not otherwise available in the program. Students should see the program director for further information.
Environmental Stuides
­ 172 ­
Honors in Environmental Studies
A student earns honors in Environmental Studies by successfully completing a rigorous, original independent
research project under the supervision of two or more members of the faculty, including at least one member of the
CES faculty. The research project should be reported and defended both in a thesis and orally. A student may
undertake an honors thesis and submit it to both his or her major department and Environmental Studies; petitions
for a joint honors project should be approved by the department chair and the director of the program no later than
the beginning of the student's senior year. Students who pursue honors in Environmental Studies alone should
enroll in Environmental Studies 493-W31-494, Senior Research and Thesis, in addition to completing the require-
ments for the concentration.
Because most research requires sustained field, laboratory, or library work that is difficult to combine with con-
ventional coursework, students are strongly encouraged to spend the summer before senior year doing honors
research. Funds to support student research are available from restricted endowments of the Center, and an open
competition is held each spring, to allocate the limited resources. Some departments also provide limited support
for summer thesis research. Students and their faculty sponsors should plan the thesis with the possibility of sum-
mer research in mind.
Honors in Environmental Studies will be awarded on the basis of the academic rigor, interdisciplinary synthe-
sis, independence, and originality demonstrated by the student and in the completed thesis.
STUDY ABROAD
The Program in Environmental Studies encourages its concentrators to study abroad if feasible, and there are a
variety of study abroad programs that include courses and experiential learning about the environment. Students
should speak to the chair of the program as early as possible in making their plans in order to confirm what courses
abroad will be eligible for credit as an elective course in the concentration. Students may not use study abroad
classes to fulfill any of the program's core course requirements.
ENVI 101(F) Humans and the Biosphere: An Introduction to Environmental Studies
This course introduces environmental studies as an interdisciplinary field drawing from the natural and social
sciences, as well as the arts and humanities. By the end of the semester, students should be able to recognize and
investigate the causes, consequences and responses to humanity's impact on the environment. This interdisciplin-
ary understanding is indispensable to developing sustainable societies that promote the well­being of people, ani-
mals and their habitats.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation is based on tests, a final exam, and active participation in class.
No enrollment limit.
Satisfies one semester of the Division II requirement.
Satisfies a required core course for the Environmental Studies concentration.
Hour: 9:55-11:10 TR Conference: TBA LYNN
ENVI 102(S) Introduction to Environmental Science
The field of environmental science considers physical, chemical, and biological interactions in an integrated ap-
proach to complex environmental systems. This course introduces students to multidisciplinary scientific methods
used to assess and interpret human impacts on the environment. Through hands-on study of several local sites, we
probe five global themes: the carbon cycle and climate change; acid deposition; toxic metals; water quality; and
waste treatment. Discussions of case studies from other parts of the world illustrate the global analogues of these
local studies. Following these group projects, students design and complete independent projects in subjects of
particular interest to them.
Format: two 75-minute workshop/discussion sessions, and one 4-hour field/laboratory session each week. Evalu-
ation is based on reports of field and laboratory projects, participation in discussion, and an independent research
project.
Enrollment limit: 24 (expected: 24). Preference given to first-year students. This course is an introductory science
seminar, designed for students who have a strong interest in Environmental Science. Satisfies one semester of the
Division III requirement. This course also satisfies "The Natural World" requirement for the Environmental Stud-
ies concentration.

ENVI 230(F) Nature and Politics in the Himalayan Region
The Himalayan Mountain region stretches over an arc of 2,400 km, including territories of at least seven nation-
states. Today, the region holds the largest remnant expanse of forests and other wildernesses in the Indian sub-con-
tinent, and it is a major global biodiversity hot-spot. About one-sixth of the world's population lives in the drainage
basins of the Himalayan glaciers and rivers. The mountains and rivers often serve as national borders, creating
lines of contestation. The region's biological and water "resources" are also subjects of dispute and contestation,
with the interested parties including hundreds of millions of people downstream. All these forces combine to make
the Himalayan region one of growing interest to international markets and politics, as well as regional and global
conservation agendas. The course will introduce students to the political ecology of these influences, with an em-
phasis on how they present and manifest themselves on the ground. The course will follow a discussion format.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: multiple 5- to 8-page papers, plus occasional assignments based on
readings. One long paper may be substituted for several short papers, with the permission of the instructor.
Prerequisites: Environmental Studies 101 or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 20 (expected: 15).

sive species. We will then examine competing notions of biodiversity conservation: why, where, what, who de-
Environmental Studies
­ 174 ­
cides, and how best to conserve? What is the relationship between neo-liberal globalization and current conserva-
tion strategies? Are calls for increased conservation measures a result of economic-induced ecological degrada-
tion, or another form of development in line with neo-liberal paradigms of international donors (intergovernmen-
tal, NGOs, corporations)? Are rapidly expanding protected areas in developing countries the new colonialism
driven by a globalization of western environmentalisms? What is the relationship between western science and
traditional ecological knowledge regarding causes and solutions for biodiversity conservation? We will then ex-
amine the role of alternatives challenging conventional notions of conservation, such as bioregionalism, commu-
nity-based strategies, participatory management, radical ecology and others.

ENVI 302(F) Environmental Planning Workshop
This interdisciplinary course introduces the theories, methodologies, and legal framework of environmental plan-
ning and provides students with experience in the planning process through project work in the Berkshire region.
The first part of the course introduces the students to planning literature through analysis and discussion of case
studies. In the second section of the course students apply their skills to the study of an actual planning problem.
Small teams of students, working in conjunction with a client in the community, research and propose solutions to
a local environmental planning problem. The project work draws on students' academic training, extracurricular
activities, and applies interdisciplinary knowledge and methodologies. The course culminates in public presenta-
tions of each team's planning study. This course also includes field trips and computer labs.
Format: discussion/project lab. Requirements: midterm exam, short written exercises, class presentations, public
presentations, final group report.

ENVI 306(F) Interpreting Nature: Meaning and Method in Environmental Studies
This course exposes students to the theory and practice of qualitative research. It is a `way of knowing' that is
strikingly different yet complementary to the quantitative approaches familiar to the natural and social sciences.
We will examine a range of qualitative theories and methods, explore case studies that emphasize environmental
and global issues, and learn how to identify, collect and analyze qualitative data. Through methods that interpret
human thought and action, as well as natural and humanized landscapes, qualitative research helps us apprehend
the meaning of humanity's relationship with animals and nature.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation is based on tests, a research paper (in lieu of a final exam), and active par-

FIRST-YEAR RESIDENTIAL SEMINAR
The First-Year Residential Seminar is a program designed to help students explore new ways of integrating
their social and intellectual lives. Students who participate live together in the same residential unit, and take the
seminar together during the fall semester. Enrollment in the seminar is restricted to students in the program. The
seminar explores topics and issues that can be expected to promote lively discussions both in and out of class. It
may be team-taught and may contain interdisciplinary subject matter.
All entering first-year students have the opportunity to express interest in participating ; if more students are
interested than there are spaces available, selection is done randomly. Participants must commit themselves to
taking FRS 101.
FRS 101(F) Interpreting Human Experience (W)
How we make sense of the world, and of our lives, depends to a considerable degree on the intellectual methodol-
ogies we apply to the task of interpretation. Freud, for instance, saw selfhood and perception as fundamentally
determined by the structures of the psyche itself; Marx, by contrast, argued that our sense of reality is conditioned
primarily by our material and social circumstances; more recently, historian of science Thomas Kuhn has empha-
sized that the underlying assumptions which shape the very questions we pose as thinkers significantly influence
and limit what data, and thus what reality, we are most likely to observe. This course aims to provide a foundation-
al experience for the liberal arts education, by engaging with key religious, political, literary, anthropological, phil-
osophical and psychoanalytic texts with a view to complicating our sense of the purposes and possibilities of intel-
lectual life and confronting the challenges of epistemology. Readings will include works by Plato, John Stuart
Mill, Marx, E.M. Forster, Freud, Rousseau, Brecht, Dangarembga, and extracts from the Bible and the Qur'an. In
keeping with the aims of the FRS program, the course is intended to foster productive connections between what
we discuss and debate in class and your broader experiences as students. The course will invite and promote inter-
disciplinary connections between core ways of seeing and interpreting the world, with a strong emphasis on im-
proving your critical skills.
Format: seminar. Requirements: regular short writing assignments designed to hone your reading skills; four pa-
pers ranging from 3-5 pages; and active contribution to discussion.
Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Enrollment limited to FRS students.
Satisfies one semester of the Division I requirement.

FRS 103(F) Perspectives on Sex
This course explores the biological and social factors that shape sex, sexual orientation, and sex behaviors. We will
begin by examining the biological processes underlying mammalian sexual differentiation and explore how these
developmental processes alter anatomy and brain organization. We will then consider how these biological under-
pinnings influence sexual orientation, gender identity, and sex behaviors. During the semester, we will evaluate
multiple methodologies used to assess human sex behavior, and discuss the ways in which research with other
species can inform our understanding of human sex behavior. We will also investigate how social factors across
the lifespan influence sex behavior. This course is not a substitute for Psychology 101 and does not satisfy the
prerequisite for upper-level psychology courses.
Format: seminar. Requirements: position papers and critiques, presentations, active contribution to discussion, and
final paper.

MAJOR
The Geosciences major is designed (1) to provide an understanding of the physical and biological evolution of
our planet and its interacting global systems, (2) to help us learn to live in harmony with our environment, and (3)
to appreciate our place within the vastness of Earth history. Forces within the Earth are responsible for the develop-
ment of mountain ranges and ocean basins. Waves, running water, and glaciers have shaped the surface of the
Earth, providing the landscapes we see today. Fossils encased in sedimentary rocks supply evidence for the evolu-
tion of life and help to record the history of the Earth.
Students who graduate with a major in Geosciences from Williams can enter several different fields of geosci-
ence or can use their background in other careers. Students who have continued in the geosciences are involved
today, especially after graduate training, in environmental fields ranging from hydrology to earthquake prediction,
in the petroleum and mining industries, federal and state geological surveys, geological consulting firms, and
teaching and research in universities, colleges, and secondary schools. Graduates who have entered business or
law have also found many applications for their geoscience background. Other graduates now in fields as diverse
as art and medicine pursue their interest in the out-of-doors with a deeper appreciation for the natural world around
them.
The Geosciences major sequence includes, after any 100-level course, five designated advanced courses, and
three elective courses.
Sequence Courses (required of majors)
201 Geomorphology
202 Mineralogy and Geochemistry
301 Structural Geology
302 Sedimentology
401 Stratigraphy
Elective courses may be clustered to provide concentrations in selected fields. Suggested groupings are listed
below as guidelines for course selections, but other groups are possible according to the interests of the students.
Departmental advisors are given for the different fields of Geosciences.
I Environmental Geoscience. For students interested in surface processes and the application of geology to
environmental problems such as land use planning, resource planning, environmental impact analysis, and envi-
ronmental law. Such students should also consider enrolling in the coordinate program of the Center for Environ-
mental Studies.
103 Global Warming and Natural Disasters
104 Oceanography
206 Renewable Energy and the Sustainable Campus
214 Remote Sensing and Geographic Information Systems
215 Climate Changes
(Students interested in Environmental Geosciences should consult with Professor Dethier or Cook.)
II Oceanography, Stratigraphy and Sedimentation. For students interested in the study of modern and ancient
sedimentary environments and the marine organisms that inhabited them.
101 Biodiversity in Geologic Time
104 Oceanography
206 Renewable Energy and the Sustainable Campus
212 Invertebrate Paleobiology
(Students interested in Oceanography, Stratigraphy, and Sedimentation should consult with Professors M.
Johnson or Cox.)
III The Solid Earth. For students interested in plate tectonics, the processes active within the Earth, the origin
and deformation of rocks and minerals, and mineral exploration.
102 An Unfinished Planet
105 Geology Outdoors
303 Igneous and Metamorphic Petrology
(Students interested in The Solid Earth should consult with Professors Wobus or Karabinos.)
With the consent of the department, certain courses at the 200 level or higher in biology, chemistry, mathemat-
ics and statistics, or physics may be substituted for elective courses in the major. Credit may be granted in the
Geosciences major for American Maritime Studies 211/Geosciences 210 (Oceanographic Processes) or Ameri-
can Maritime Studies 311/Biology 231 (Marine Ecology) taken at Mystic Seaport.
Students considering graduate work in geosciences should also take courses in the allied sciences and mathe-
matics in addition to the requirements of the Geosciences major. The selection of outside courses will depend on
the field in which a student intends to specialize. Most geoscience graduate schools require a year of chemistry and
mathematics through 105. For those going into Environmental Geoscience, courses in computer science or statis-
tics are recommended. For those considering Oceanography, Stratigraphy, and Sedimentation, Biology 102 and
Biology 203 are suggested. For students entering Solid-Earth fields, Physics 131 and 132 are recommended.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN GEOSCIENCES
In order to be recommended for the degree with honors, a student is expected to have completed at least two
semesters and a winter study project (031) of independent research culminating in a thesis which demonstrates
Geosciences
­ 178 ­
outstanding achievement of an original and innovative nature. The principal considerations in admitting a student
to a program of independent research are mastery of fundamental material and skills, ability to pursue independent
study successfully, and demonstrated student interest and motivation.
Further advice on the major can be obtained from the department chair.
STUDY ABROAD
Students planning on studying abroad should meet as early as possible with the Department Chair to plan
study-abroad courses and to discuss how potential courses might be used in the Geosciences major. In recent years
students have found that courses offered by universities in New Zealand, particularly the University of Otago,
provide an excellent complement to courses offered at Williams. Courses offered at Norwegian Technical Univer-
sities and at several universities in the United Kingdom have also been accepted as part of the Geosciences major.
Many other study-abroad programs, however, do not usually offer courses that are acceptable substitutes for
courses required by the Williams Geoscience major.
GEOS 101(F) Biodiversity in Geologic Time (Same as Environmental Studies 105)
Is planet Earth now undergoing the most severe mass extinction of species ever to have occurred during its 4.5-bil-
lion-year history? By some calculations, the expanding population of a single species is responsible for the demise
of 74 species per day. This provocative question is addressed by way of the rock and fossil record as it relates to
changes in biodiversity through deep geologic time before the appearance of Homo sapiens only 250,000 years
ago. Long before human interaction, nature conducted its own experiments on the complex relationship between
evolving life and changes in the physical world. This course examines ways in which wandering continents, shift-
ing ocean basins, the rise and fall of mountains, the wax and wane of ice sheets, fluctuating sea level, and even
crashing asteroids all shaped major changes in global biodiversity. Particular attention is drawn to the half dozen
most extensive mass extinctions and what factors may have triggered them. Equal consideration is given to how
the development of new ecosystems forever altered the physical world. How and when did the earliest microbes
oxygenate the atmosphere? Do the earliest multicellular animals from the late Precambrian portray an architectur-
al experiment doomed to failure? What factors contributed to the explosive rise in biodiversity at the start of the
Cambrian Period? What explanation is there for the sudden appearance of vertebrates? How and when did plants
colonize the land? What caused the demise of the dinosaurs? Is the present dominance of mammals an accident of
nature? The answers to these and other questions are elusive, but our wise stewardship of the planet and its present
biodiversity may depend on our understanding of the past. Concepts of plate tectonics and island biogeography are
applied to many aspects of the puzzle.
Format: lecture; one laboratory per week (some involving field work); plus one all-day field trip to the Helderberg
Plateau and Catskill Mountains of New York. Evaluation will be based on weekly quizzes and lab work, a mid-
term exam, and a final exam.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 35 (expected: 20).
Hour: 10:00-10:50 MWF Lab: 1-3 M,T M. JOHNSON
GEOS 102(S) An Unfinished Planet
The Earth is a work-in-progress, an evolving planet whose vital signs--as expressed by earthquakes, volcanic
eruptions, and shifting plates--are still strong. In a geological time frame, nothing on Earth is permanent: ocean
basins open and close, mountains rise and fall, continental masses accrete and separate. There is a message here
for all who live, for an infinitesimally brief time, on the moving surface of the globe. This course uses the plate
tectonics model--one of the fundamental scientific accomplishments of this century--to interpret the processes
and products of a changing Earth. The emphasis will be on mountain systems (on land and beneath the oceans) as
expressions of plate interactions. Specific topics include the rocks and structures of modern and ancient mountain
belts, the patterns of global seismicity and volcanism, the nature of the Earth's interior, the changing configurations
of continents and ocean basins through time, and, in some detail, the formation of the Appalachian Mountain sys-
tem and the geological assembly of New England. Readings will be from a physical geology textbook and prima-
ry source supplement, selected writings of John McPhee, and references about the geology of the Northeast.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; lab (several involving field work), two hours per week; one required all-day
field trip during the last week of the semester to the Connecticut Valley and the highlands of western Massachu-
setts. Evaluation will be based on two hour-tests, weekly lab work, and a scheduled final exam.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 40 (expected: 40). Preference to first- and second-year students.
Hour: 10:00-10:50 MWF Lab: 1-3 W,R WOBUS
GEOS 103(F) Global Warming and Natural Disasters (Same as Environmental Studies 103)
The destruction caused by recent hurricanes such as Katrina, devastation of prolonged drought in the African Sa-
hel, catastrophic flooding and mudslides in Indonesia and sea level encroachment on the Alaska coast are visible
examples of natural disasters that may be modulated by climate change. Reports from the World Bank conclude
that global climate change, together with environmental degradation and urbanization, has the potential to increase
the severity and impact of natural disasters. In this course we globally examine geological and climatological pro-
cesses that "set up" natural disasters such as hurricanes, floods, landslides, droughts, extreme temperatures, and
coastal surges, as well as the processes that condition availability of water resources. We study in detail the causes
and anticipated consequences of human alteration of climate and its impact on the spectrum of natural hazards and
resources. During laboratory sessions we use local field sites and computer models to analyze recent disasters/haz-
ards and options for mitigating future impacts and study trends in weather and climate.
Format: lectures, 3 hours per week; laboratory, 2 hours per week. Evaluation based on written reports from labora-
tories, two hour exams and a final exam.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 24 (expected 24). Preference to first- and second-year students.
Hour: 11:00-11:50 MWF Lab: 1-3 M,W COOK and DETHIER
GEOS 104(S) Oceanography (Same as Environmental Studies 104 and Maritime Studies 104)
In this integrated introduction to the oceans, we will examine formation and history of the ocean basins; the com-
position and origin of seawater; currents, tides, and waves; ocean-atmosphere interactions; oceans and climate;
Geosciences
­ 179 ­
deep marine environments; coastal processes; productivity in the oceans; and marine resources. Coastal oceanog-
raphy will be investigated on an all-day field trip to Williams@Sea: the Williams-Mystic Program in Connecticut.
Format: lecture/discussion, three hours per week; laboratory, two hours per week in alternate weeks/one all-day
field trip. Evaluation will be based on two hour exams, lab work, participation in the field trip, and a final exam.
Enrollment limit: 60 (expected: 60). Preference given to first-year students.
This course may not be taken pass-fail. Students who have taken Geosciences 210/MAST 211 (at Williams-Mystic)
may not take Geosciences 104 for credit.
Hour: 11:00-11:50 MWF Lab: 1-3 M,T COX
GEOS 105(F) Geology Outdoors (W)
An introduction to geology through student field projects. The mountains, lakes, rivers, and valleys of the Wil-
liamstown area provide unusual opportunities for learning geology in the field. Student projects will include the
study of streams as active agents of erosion and deposition, the effects of glaciation on the New England land-
scape, and the history of mountain building in the Appalachians. Following several group projects introducing the
techniques of field geology, students will pursue independent projects on subjects of particular interest to them.
This course departs from the standard science course format with three lectures and a required lab each week.
Instead, emphasis is placed on learning through active participation in field projects and presentation of results
through high quality writing. The class will meet two afternoons each week from 1:00 to 3:45 p.m. There will be
two all day field trips. This course is designed for students who have a serious interest in geology or other natural
and environmental sciences, the outdoors, and writing.
Format: discussion/field laboratory, six hours per week. Evaluation will be based on participation in field work and
discussions, five 8-page papers based on field projects, and an oral presentation of independent projects. Students
will use detailed comments on their papers to improve their writing style in successive assignments.
No prerequisites; no previous knowledge of geology required. Open only to first-year students. Enrollment limit:
10 (expected:10).
Hour: 1:10-3:50 TF KARABINOS
GEOS 110T(S) Galapagos Islands Field Geology and Biology (W)
Islands are attractive places for field studies because they represent discrete territories isolated from the rest of the
world but associated with larger surrounding patterns of climate, ocean currents, and regional geology linked to
plate tectonics. The scale of many islands is appropriate for a close examination of the relationship between geolo-
gy and biology under conditions akin to laboratory studies in which the number of experimental variables is limit-
ed. The first half of this course is devoted to topics on the geology, tectonics, paleontology, biology, and biogeogra-
phy of the Galapagos Islands in preparation for a one-week field excursion during Spring Break. Topics covered
start with contributions based on original texts by Charles Darwin and James Dana on the biology and geology of
islands in the Pacific basin. This provides the historical foundation for a review of geological processes, evolution,
and island biogeography based on recent scientific literature. Particular attention is devoted to questions regarding
the stimulation of speciation in the context of tectonically active areas. After Spring Break, sessions cover other
"archipelagos" including the Hawaiian Islands, the islands in the Gulf of California, lakes of the East African rift
zone and the Galapagos deep-sea rift zone. Each represents a distinct geological and tectonic domain but with
related biological themes. Students are responsible for six papers. Four will be normal tutorial assignments (6-8
pages in length), but the final paper prior to Spring Break entails preparation of a guidebook assignment on the
Galapagos Islands. The final course assignment is submission of a potential research topic appropriate for an inde-
pendent-study or honors project in an island setting.
Format: tutorial in joint session with both instructors. Evaluation will be based on six written papers, six oral pre-
sentations, weekly participation in discussions, and a guidebook presentation during Spring Break in the Galapa-
gos Islands.
Prerequisite: any 100-level Geosciences course. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Preference given to first-year
and sophomore students.
Special note: Thanks to the generosity of Joseph Lintz ('42), students will only be responsible for $500 of their
travel and lodging expenses. The rest will be covered by the Freeman Foote Field Trip Fund for the Sciences.
Hour: 9:00-9:50 MWF M. JOHNSON and KARABINOS
GEOS 201(F) Geomorphology (Same as Environmental Studies 205)
This course is designed for geosciences majors and for environmental studies students interested in surficial geo-
logic processes and their importance in shaping the physical environment. The course emphasizes the nature and
rates of constructional, weathering, and erosional processes and the influence of climatic, tectonic, and volcanic
forces on landform evolution. Labs focus on field measurements of hydrologic and geomorphic processes in the
Williamstown area as well as on the analysis of topographic maps and stereo air photos.
Format: lecture/discussion, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours per week/student projects; weekend field
trip to the White Mountains. Evaluation will be based on two hour exams, a project, and lab work.
Prerequisites: any 100-level Geosciences course or consent of the instructor. No enrollment limit (expected: 15).

GEOS 202(S) Mineralogy and Geochemistry
This course progresses from hand-specimen morphology and crystallography through element distribution and
crystal chemistry to the phase relations, compositional variation, and mineral associations within major rock-
forming mineral systems. Laboratory work includes the determination of crystal symmetry; mineral separation;
the principles and applications of optical emission spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction and x-ray fluorescence analysis;
the use of the petrographic microscope; and the identification of important minerals in hand specimen and thin
section.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours per week; independent study of minerals in hand

GEOS 206(S) Renewable Energy and the Sustainable Campus (Same as Environmental Studies
206)
Rising oil and electricity costs disrupt the economy and help fuel global insecurity. Clearer understanding of how
fossil-fuel consumption contributes to global climate change is increasing demand for renewable sources of ener-
gy and for more sustainable campus environments. What sources of energy will supply Williams College and
nearby areas in the twenty-first century? How will campus buildings, old and new, continue to be attractive spaces
while making far more efficient use of heat and light? This course is a practical introduction to renewable sources
of energy, including conservation, and to their application to the campus environment. Topics covered include:
biological sources of energy (biomass, biogas, liquid fuels), wind energy, geothermal and solar energy, energy
efficiency and the environmental impacts of using renewable energy. Lectures, field trips and individual projects
emphasize examples from the campus and nearby area.
Format: seminar, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on an hour exam, class participation that includes
a seminar presentation, and a research project that investigates some aspect of campus energy use and greenhouse-
gas emissions.

GEOS 214(S) Remote Sensing and Geographic Information Systems (Same as Environmental
Studies 214)
Remote sensing involves the collection and processing of data from satellite and airborne sensors to yield environ-
mental information about the Earth's surface and lower atmosphere. Remote sensing enhances regional mapping
of rock types and faults and analysis of vegetation cover and land-use changes over time. A Geographic Informa-
tion System (GIS) links satellite-based environmental measurements with spatial data such as topography, trans-
portation networks, and political boundaries, allowing display and quantitative analysis at the same scale using the
same geographic reference. This course covers the principles and practice of remote-data capture and geographic
rectification using a Global Positioning System (GPS), as well as the concepts of Remote Sensing, including linear
and non-linear image enhancements, convolution filtering, principle components analysis, and classification. Prin-
ciples of GIS include display and classification, spatial buffers, and logical overlays. Weekly labs focus on practi-
cal applications of these techniques to data from Hopkins Memorial Forest, the Berkshire region, and other areas
of North America.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, weekly.
Prerequisites: at least one introductory course in Biology, Environmental Studies, or Geosciences. Enrollment lim-

GEOS 215(S) Climate Changes (Same as Environmental Studies 215) (Q)
In recent years, there has been a growing public and scientific interest in the Earth's climate and its variability. This
interest reflects both concern over future climate changes that may result from anthropogenic increases in atmo-
spheric greenhouse gases and growing recognition of the economic impact of "natural" climate variability (for
example, El Niño events), especially in the developing world. Efforts to understand the Earth's climate system and
predict future climate changes require both study of parameters controlling present day climate and detailed stud-
ies of climate changes in the past. In this course, we will review the processes that control the Earth's climate, like
insolation, distribution of heat, ocean circulation, and the greenhouse effect. At the same time, we will review the
geological record of climate changes in the past, examining their causes, positive and negative feedback effects,
and indicators of the stability or instability of the climate system.
Format: lecture/ laboratory/discussion, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on weekly problems (25%),
two hour exams (50%), and a final project (25%) where students will collect, analyze, and interpret data. Weekly
laboratory exercises will emphasize developing problem solving skills and using quantitative analyses to assess if
a given explanation is possible and reasonable. These exercises will include developing and applying numerical
models of the carbon cycle and basic radiative balance models.
Prerequisites: 100-level course in Geoscience, Biology, Chemistry, or Physics or permission of instructor. Enroll-
ment limit: 20 (expected: 20). Preference to Geoscience majors.

GEOS 218T(F) The Carbon Cycle and Climate (Same as Environmental Studies 218T) (W)
Carbon dioxide is the most important atmospheric greenhouse gas, and human activities are adding carbon to the
atmosphere at unprecedented rates. Yet only half of the carbon we emit each year remains in the atmosphere be-
cause biological, geological, and chemical processes continually cycle carbon from the atmosphere to the ocean,
to land plants and soils, and to sediments. The workings of the carbon cycle are at the center of many controversies
Geosciences
­ 181 ­
surrounding the causes of past climate changes and the outcome of future global warming. How was the earth's
climate steered by past changes in the carbon cycle, billions and millions of years ago? Will natural processes
continue to take up such a high percentage of carbon emissions as emissions continue and climate changes? Can
and should we coax natural systems to take up even more carbon? How might carbon emissions be reduced on the
scale of the Williams campus? We will explore these issues through readings of current journal articles and reports.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: The class will meet weekly for a one-hour orientation to the topic, and students
will meet in pairs for one hour each week with the instructor. Each student will orally present a written paper every
other week for criticism during the tutorial session. Evaluation will be based on the five papers and each student's
effectiveness as a critic.
Prerequisites: one introductory course in Biology, Chemistry, or Geosciences or one course cross-listed in the En-
vironmental Studies program. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Preference given to sophomores and juniors.

GEOS 301(F) Structural Geology (Q)
The structure of the Earth's crust is constantly changing and the rocks making up the crust must deform to accom-
modate these changes. Rock deformation occurs over many scales ranging from individual mineral grains to
mountain belts. This course deals with the geometric description of structures, stress and strain analysis, deforma-
tion mechanisms in rocks, and the large scale forces responsible for crustal deformation. The laboratories cover
geologic maps and cross sections, folds and faults, stereonet analysis, field techniques, strain, and stress.
Format: lecture/discussion, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on
weekly laboratory exercises, problem sets, a midterm exam, and a final exam. Many of the laboratories and prob-
lem sets use geometry, algebra, and several projection techniques to solve common problems in structural geolo-
gy.
Prerequisites: Geosciences 101, 102, 103, or 105 or permission of instructor. No enrollment limit (expected: 12).

GEOS 302(S) Sedimentology (W)
The composition and architecture of sediments and sedimentary rocks preserve information about the rocks that
were eroded to form them, the fluids and forces that transported them, the mechanisms by which they were depos-
ited, and the processes by which they were lithified. This course will provide an introduction to the principles of
sedimentology, including sedimentary petrology, fluid mechanics, bedform analysis, and facies architecture.
Format: lecture/discussion, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours per week; two half-day and one all-day
field trip. Evaluation will be based on laboratory work, writing assignments, an hour exam, and a final exam. Ten
written critiques (each 350-400 words) of specific assigned papers from the sedimentological literature are de-
signed to teach clear written expression and careful analytical reading. Papers will be thoroughly edited for style,
grammar and syntax. Students will improve their writing by integrating editorial comments into successive papers.
Each student will compile his/her papers as a growing body of work, and each new paper will be read and edited in
the context of the previous submissions.

GEOS 401(F) Stratigraphy
Study of the composition, sequence, and correlation of layered sedimentary rocks is traditionally applied to geo-
logic mapping and the reconstruction of ancient environments. Through the use of various time scales, stratigra-
phy is the unifier of historical geology while also at the heart of conceptual debates over the uniformism or episod-
icity of geological processes. During the first half of the course, emphasis will be placed on the various methods of
correlation based on physical means and the use of fossils. The second half of the course will focus on plate migra-
tions and the relationships between climate and depositional environments as a model for the broad scale inter-
pretation of sedimentary sequences. This part of the course will be conducted as a seminar, with students responsi-
ble for topics on the paleogeographic linkage of climate-sensitive facies and natural resources. As a final project,
students working individually or in pairs will present a detailed analysis of North-American stratigraphic relation-
ships during a specific interval of Cambrian to Cretaceous time. In sequence, these class reports will provide high-
lights of the geologic history of the North-American continent through Paleozoic and Mesozoic time.
Format: lecture, three hours a week; one three-hour lab per week during the first half of the course (including field
problems); independent projects during the second half of the course; one major field trip. Evaluation will be based

LANGUAGE STUDY
The department provides language instruction to enable the student to acquire all four linguistic skills: under-
standing, speaking, reading, and writing. German 101-W-102 stresses communicative competence and covers
German grammar in full. German 103 combines a review of grammar with extensive practice in reading and con-
versation. German 104 aims to develop facility in speaking, writing, and reading. German 111-112 offers an alter-
native introduction to German with a focus on reading competence. German 201 emphasizes accuracy and idiom-
atic expression in speaking and writing. German 202 combines advanced language study with the examination of
topics in German-speaking cultures. Students who have studied German in secondary school should take the
placement test given during First Days in September to determine which course to take.
STUDY ABROAD
The department strongly encourages students who wish to attain fluency in German to spend a semester or year
studying in Germany or Austria, either independently or in one of several approved foreign study programs. Ger-
man 104 or the equivalent is the minimum requirement for junior-year abroad programs sponsored by American
institutions. Students who wish to enroll directly in a German-speaking university should complete at least 201 or
the equivalent. In any case, all students considering study-abroad should discuss their language preparation with a
member of the department.
LITERATURE IN TRANSLATION
The department regularly offers courses on German literature in translation for students who have little or no
knowledge of German, but who wish to become acquainted with the major achievements in German literary and
intellectual history.
ADVANCED STUDIES
The department offers a variety of advanced courses for students who wish to investigate German literature,
thought, and culture in the original. German 202 is given each year and is recommended as preparation for upper-
level courses.
THE CERTIFICATE IN GERMAN
To enhance a student's educational and professional profiles, the department offers the Certificate in German. It
requires seven courses--three fewer than the major--and is especially appropriate for students who begin study
of the language at Williams.
Students who enter Williams with previous training in German may substitute more advanced courses for the
100-level courses; they can also be exempted from up to two of the required courses.
The student must achieve proficiency at the level of a B in German 104 or the equivalent.
Appropriate elective courses can usually be found among the offerings of German, Art History, History, Music,
Philosophy, Political Science, and Theatre.

THE MAJOR
The German major offers students an interdisciplinary approach to German intellectual and cultural history by
combining courses in German language and literature with courses in History, Philosophy, Music, and other ap-
propriate fields.
For students who start German at Williams, the major requires a minimum of ten courses: German 101-102,
103, 104, 201 and 202; two 300-level German courses; and two electives from either German courses numbered
above 202 or appropriate offerings in other departments.
For students who have acquired intermediate or greater proficiency in the language before coming to Williams,
the minimum requirement is nine courses: German 202; two 300-level German courses; and six other courses
selected from German courses numbered above 102 and appropriate offerings in other departments.

is particularly appropriate for students majoring in fields in which the ability to read primary and secondary texts in
German can be crucial, such as Art History, Classics, Comparative Literature, History, Music, Philosophy, Politi-
cal Science, and Theatre. In the first semester students learn the elements of grammar and acquire a core vocabu-
lary. In the second semester, while covering advanced grammatical topics, they practice reading in a variety of
textual genres in the humanities and social sciences. They also learn how to work with dictionaries, encyclopedias,
and other reference works, in both printed and online forms. By the end of the course they will have a solid founda-
tion for building proficiency in German, whether through self-study or further course work. Credit granted only on
successful completion of 112.

GERM 202(S) Voices from the Edge: Minority Culture in Contemporary Germany
Recent literature, films, television shows, music, and websites attest to the increasing multiculturalism of the Ger-
man-speaking countries. In this course we work with cultural products that have been created to give voice to
various minority cultures in Germany, such as Turkish-German, Afro-German, Jewish, and gay cultures. Among
the questions we will ask are: How are minority cultures represented? Who created this representation (i.e., is this a
self-representation)? Is it empowering for the subject? Although we will focus primarily on cultural productions
since 2000, we will also learn the history of each group's presence in German-speaking countries, an important
context for current debates. Conducted in German; Readings in German.

Although the first image that comes to mind may be a woman in a black hat, riding a broomstick, the word "witch"
has had many meanings over its several hundred years of history. In this course we trace the development of the
witch, from Scandinavian mythology to the Spanish Inquisition, from the Salem Witch Trials to The Wizard of Oz.
Because the vast majority of witches have been women, this course is informed by a feminist perspective. We will
examine representations of the female witch in a variety of cultural productions, and we will consider what hap-
pens when women take back the word. Materials will include historical texts, myths, fairy tales, literature, and
film. Taught in English.

From Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, whose quintessentially Enlightenment Nathan der Weise centers around all too
familiar religious conflicts, to E.T.A. Hoffmann, whose "Sandman" formed the centerpiece of Freud's essay on
the uncanny--and not forgetting Goethe's Faust--German literature from 1750-1830 has informed a good deal of
20th-century thinking. This course will explore this amazing explosion of insight and creativity through the close
reading of some of its most prominent literary and theoretical texts, including many of the following: Kant, Les-
sing, Goethe, Novalis, Kleist, Hoffman, Eichendorff, Günderrode, Brentano, and B. von Arnim. Readings and
discussion will be in German for tutorial pairs who speak German, in English for those who don't.

GENERAL STATEMENT OF GOALS
The History department seeks to cultivate a critical understanding and awareness of the past and the develop-
ment of our students' intellectual, analytical, and rhetorical abilities. In pursuit of the first objective, through its
curricular offerings the department seeks both to expose students to the richness, diversity, and complexities of
human history over long periods of time and in different geographic regions and to provide students with the op-
portunity to explore aspects of the past in depth. At the same time, the department endeavors to develop students'
ability to think historically and to foster in them an appreciation of the contested nature and the value of historical
knowledge by confronting them with the variety of ways in which historians have approached and interpreted the
past, engaging them in issues that provoke historical debate, and familiarizing them with the nature and uses of
historical evidence. By engaging students in the critical study of the past, finally, the department seeks to develop
their ability to formulate historically informed analyses and their analytical and rhetorical skills.
COURSE NUMBERS
The course numbering system used by the History Department reflects the different types and objectives of
courses offered at each level. The different course levels are distinguished less by degree of difficulty than by the
purposes that the courses at each level are intended to serve and the background knowledge they presume.
First-Year Seminars and Tutorials (102-199): These writing-intensive courses give students an opportunity
to explore an exciting historical topic in-depth, learn about the discipline of history, and improve their re-
search and writing skills. Because these courses emphasize the acquisition of skills required for the ad-
vanced study of History, they are ideal for students contemplating a major in History.
Each 100-level seminar is normally limited to nineteen students and focuses both on training in research
skills (such as using the library, navigating on-line resources, formulating a research question and develop-
ing a research agenda, and learning how to use different types of evidence) and on the acquisition of read-
ing skills (such as how to interpret different kinds of historical writing and the arguments historians make).
These seminars especially emphasize the importance of writing and include varied assignments that stress
the mechanics of writing and revision and focus on issues of argumentation, documentation, and style.
Enrollment preference in 100-level seminars is normally given to first-year students and then to sopho-
mores.
Each 100-level tutorial stresses the importance of interpreting historical evidence and evaluating the argu-
ments made by historians and likewise fulfills the writing-intensive requirement. Enrollment in these
History
­ 186 ­
courses is limited to ten students, each of whom is expected to write five or six interpretive essays and
present five or six oral critiques of another student's work. First-year students and sophomores will normal-
ly be given equal enrollment preference in 100-level tutorials, although first-year students will not normal-
ly be permitted to enroll in a tutorial during the first semester.
Introductory Survey Courses (202-299): These courses are open to all students and are intended to provide
a basic understanding of the history of peoples, countries, and geographic regions over relatively long
time-spans. Most of all, they will provide students with the background necessary for more advanced study
in history at the 300 and 400 level. They are offered in either small or large formats, depending on the
individual course.
Junior Seminars (301): Junior seminars explore the nature and practice of history, are required for the de-
gree in History, and are normally restricted to junior History majors. Although these seminars vary in topic
and approach, each focuses on the discipline of history itself--on the debates over how to approach the
past, on questions of the status of different kinds of evidence and how to use it, on the purpose of the study
of history. Focusing on questions of methodology, epistemology, and historiography, these courses ask:
What kind of knowledge do historians claim to produce? What does it mean to study the past? How do
historians approach the project of studying the past? Each year several junior seminars will be offered.
Students who plan to study abroad during their junior year may take their Junior Seminar in the spring
semester of their sophomore year, and those planning to be away for the whole of their junior year are
strongly encouraged to do so.
Advanced Electives (302-396): These advanced, topical courses are more specialized in focus than are the
introductory survey courses (202-299) and are intended to follow such courses. Enrollment is often limit-
ed. Because these courses may presume some background knowledge, the instructor may recommend that
students enroll in an appropriate introductory course before registering for an advanced elective.
Advanced Seminars (402-479): These are advanced courses normally limited in enrollment to fifteen stu-
dents. Each seminar will investigate a topic in depth and will require students to engage in research that
leads to a substantial piece of historical writing. All History majors are required to complete either an ad-
vanced seminar (402-479) or a tutorial (480-492). Instructors may recommend prior coursework in the
area of the seminar. Preference is given to senior History majors, followed by junior History majors.
Advanced Tutorials (480-492): These are advanced reading and writing courses that offer an in-depth analysis of
a topic in tutorial format. Tutorials are limited in enrollment to ten students and preference is given to senior
History majors. All History majors are required to complete either an advanced seminar (402-479) or a tutorial
(480-492). Instructors may recommend prior coursework in the area of the tutorial. The writing of five or six
essays and the oral presentation of five or six critiques of another student's essays are central to tutorials.
Within each of these levels, courses are further divided by geographical area:
Africa and the Middle East 102-111 202-211 302-311 402-411
Asia 112-121 212-221 312-321 412-421
Europe and Russia 122-141 222-241 322-341 422-441

Transnational/Comparative 192-199 292-299 388-396 472-479
ADVISING
Both majors and non-majors are encouraged to talk at any time with the department chair, the department ad-
ministrative assistant, or any other member of the department about the History major.
All incoming majors will choose a faculty advisor in the spring of their sophomore year. All majors must meet
with their advisor in the beginning of the fall semester, to develop their Concentration (see below), and at the time
of the spring semester registration period in order to have their courses and plans for the History major approved.
Students who are interested in the senior honors program or graduate school should contact the faculty director of
the Honors Program. Prospective study abroad students should contact the department's administrative assistant.
THE MAJOR
The major consists of at least nine semester courses as follows:
Required Courses in the Major
One Junior Seminar (History 301)
At least one Advanced Seminar (History 402-479) or Tutorial (History 480-492)
Elective Courses
Seven (or more) additional semester courses in History, at least one to be chosen from among three of the fol-
lowing groups:
Group A: The History of Africa
Group B: The History of Asia
Group C: The History of Europe and Russia
Group D: The History of Latin America and the Caribbean
History
­ 187 ­
Group E: The History of the Middle East
Group F: The History of the United States and Canada
In addition, students must take at least one course dealing with the premodern period (designated Group G in
the catalog); this may be one of the courses used to fulfill the group requirement (Groups A-F).
A single course can meet the requirement for no more than one of Groups A through F.
Concentration in the Major
All students are required to adopt a concentration within the History major. Students are responsible for design-
ing their own concentration, in consultation with a faculty advisor, in the fall semester of their Junior year. Each
student's concentration will be formally approved by the Department's Curriculum Committee. A concentration
will consist of at least three courses linked by common themes, geography, or time period; only one of those
courses can be a 100-level seminar while at least one must be a 300- or 400-level course. Courses in the concentra-
tion may be used to fulfill the group requirements. In the Concentration Proposal, the student must list a minimum
total of six courses that could satisfy the requirements of the concentration, from which they can select three to
fulfill the concentration requirement (recognizing that not all courses are offered every year); courses taken abroad
may be included in the concentration with the approval of the chair.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN HISTORY
The History Department offers a thesis route to the degree with honors in History. This involves a ten-course
major as well as an independent WSP. Students wishing to undertake independent research or considering gradu-
ate study are encouraged to participate in the thesis program and honors seminar.
Application to enter the honors program should be made by spring registration in the junior year and should be
based on a solid record of work of honors caliber, normally defined as maintaining at least a B+ average in courses
taken for the major. Students who intend to write an honors thesis must submit a proposal to the History Depart-
ment at this time. Students who will be away during the spring semester of their junior year should make arrange-
ments to apply before leaving. Normally, it is the responsibility of the individual student to procure the agreement
of a member of the department to act as his or her thesis advisor, and the student must therefore consult with a
member of the department about a thesis topic and a possible thesis advisor prior to submitting a proposal to the
department. A student who is uncertain of which member of the department might be an appropriate advisor, or
who otherwise is unable to find an advisor, should contact the chair of the honors committee. An honors thesis
proposal must be signed by a member of the History Department. Normally, the thesis topic should be related to
course work which the student has previously done. Students should be aware, however, that while the department
will try to accommodate all students who qualify to pursue honors, particular topics may be deemed unfeasible
and students may have to revise their topics accordingly. Final admission to the honors program will depend on the
department's assessment of the qualifications of the student and the feasibility of the project.
Once the student has been notified of admission to the honors program, he or she should register for History
493, Senior Honors Thesis Research Seminar, in the fall semester, for History 031 during winter study, and for
History 494, Senior Honors Thesis Writing Seminar, in the spring. In addition to doing the research for and writing
a thesis of approximately 75-100 pages, students will attend special presentations under the History Department's
Class of 1960 Scholars Program.
During the fall, students should work regularly on their research and consult frequently with their advisors.
Throughout the semester, honors candidates will also present written progress reports for group discussion to the
seminar (History 493). Performance in the seminar will be evaluated on the basis of class participation and com-
pleted written work and will determine if a student will continue in the thesis program. For students proceeding to
History 031 and History 494, performance in the fall semester will figure into the thesis grade calculated at the end
of the year.
Students who are deemed to be making satisfactory progress on their research and writing at this point will be
allowed to continue with the thesis. They will devote the entire winter study period to thesis work. They should
conclude their research during winter study and complete at least one chapter of their thesis for submission to their
advisor before the end of winter study. At the end of winter study, the honors committee will formally consult with
advisors and make recommendations to the department concerning which students should be allowed to proceed
with the thesis. During the early weeks of the second semester, students will present a draft chapter of their thesis to
the honors seminar.
Completed theses will be due in mid-April, after which each student will prepare and make a short oral presen-
tation of his or her thesis for delivery at the departmental Honors Colloquium. Another student who has read the
thesis will then offer a critique of it, after which the two faculty readers of the thesis will offer their own comments
and questions. Finally, there will be a general discussion of the thesis by students and other members of the depart-
ment.
LANGUAGE
Study of a foreign language is basic to the understanding of other cultures. Particularly those students who
might wish to do graduate work in History are encouraged to enroll in language courses at Williams.
STUDY ABROAD
The History Department considers immersion in and familiarity with a foreign culture not only to be valuable in
themselves, but also to provide an important way of understanding the past. Students who major in History there-
fore are encouraged to study a foreign language and to consider studying abroad during their junior year. History
courses taken as part of a study abroad program that is recognized by the college normally can be used to satisfy
departmental distribution and general requirements, up to a maximum of three courses (this limit does not apply to
tutorials taken as part of the Williams-Exeter Program; no courses taken abroad, even at Oxford, can be used to
satisfy the junior seminar and advanced seminar/tutorial requirements). Students who plan to study abroad during
their junior year may take their Junior Seminar in the spring semester of their sophomore year, and those planning
to be away the whole of their junior year are strongly encouraged to do so.
History
­ 188 ­
Students interested in studying abroad during their junior year should discuss their plans with a member of the
department as well as with the department's administrative assistant. Approval of departmental credit for courses
taken abroad normally must be obtained from the chair or from the administrative assistant prior to the commence-
ment of the study abroad program.
COURSES
FIRST-YEAR SEMINARS AND TUTORIALS (102-199)
These writing-intensive courses give students an opportunity to explore an exciting historical topic in-
depth, learn about the discipline of history, and improve their research and writing skills. Because these
courses emphasize the acquisition of skills required for the advanced study of History, they are ideal for
students contemplating a major in History.
Each 100-level seminar is normally limited to nineteen students and focuses both on training in research
skills (such as using the library, navigating on-line resources, formulating a research question and develop-
ing a research agenda, and learning how to use different types of evidence) and on the acquisition of read-
ing skills (such as how to interpret different kinds of historical writing and the arguments historians make).
These seminars especially emphasize the importance of writing and include varied assignments that stress
the mechanics of writing and revision and focus on issues of argumentation, documentation, and style.
Enrollment preference in 100-level seminars is normally given to first-year students and then to sopho-
mores.
Each 100-level tutorial stresses the importance of interpreting historical evidence and evaluating the argu-
ments made by historians and likewise fulfills the writing-intensive requirement. Enrollment in these
courses is limited to ten students, each of whom is expected to write five or six interpretive essays and
present five or six oral critiques of another student's work. First-year students and sophomores will normal-
ly be given equal enrollment preference in 100-level tutorials, although first-year students will not normal-
ly be permitted to enroll in a tutorial during the first semester.
Because first-year seminars and tutorials serve as an introduction to the study of history, only one course of
each type may count toward the History major; these courses can also be used to meet the department's
group and concentration requirements.
FIRST-YEAR SEMINARS AND TUTORIALS: Africa and the Middle East (102-111)
HIST 103(F) The City in Africa: Nairobi and Johannesburg (Same as Africana Studies 103) (W)
Accra, Nairobi, and Johannesburg are three major African cities with very different origins. In each of these cities
African, Asian, Arabic, and European cultures have converged and intermingled in complicated ways that give
rise to hybrid cultures, economies, and politics. This seminar will trace the development of these cities from the
19th century to the present. The experience of various groups of city dwellers will be our main focus, as well as the
development of the cities' physical infrastructure like transportation, housing, trade, and labor networks. More
importantly, though, we will explore the underworld of these cities and will, with the inquisitiveness of a voyeur,
the zeal of a private investigator, and the sensibility of a historian, examine ways in which class, race ethnicity,
nationality, politics, and gender have influenced the structural growth of these cities and the experiences of their
inhabitants. Students will also get a chance to read about the various artistic movements in these cities over the last
century, focusing especially on music, theater, and street performances. Students should emerge from this course
with a greater awareness of African urban life and with a deepened understanding of colonial and postcolonial
societies in Africa and elsewhere in the so-called Third World.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class attendance and participation, five short papers, and a final re-
search paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference will be given to first-year students, and then

HIST 119(S) The Japanese Empire (W)
The largest non-Western empire of modern times, Japan extended its reach to Taiwan, Korea, China, Sakhalin,
Southeast Asia, and the South Pacific. This course explores the many contentious political, economic, social, and
cultural questions that arise from Japan's imperial project. We will ask what drove imperialist expansion; how the
Japanese ruled; who won and lost in economic relations; what various aspects of life were like in the empire; how
to understand the dynamics between Japanese settlers and the colonized; what effects empire building had at home
in Japan; how to explain the nature of wartime conquests; and what legacies Japanese imperialism and empire left
in their wake. Throughout the semester, we will make a point of examining these issues from various standpoints,
and we will also read theoretical works that place the Japanese empire in a comparative context. Course materials
will include political documents, intellectual treatises, films, memoirs, and literature.

HIST 127(F) The Expansion of Europe (W)
This course investigates the expansion of European power and influence over much of the rest of the world from
the late Middle Ages to the mid-nineteenth century--the early period of European Imperialism. Specific topics
will vary, but include the development and initial expansion of medieval and Renaissance Europe, the discovery
and conquest of the New World, the struggle with Islam for command of the seas, the establishment of European
influence in the East and Far East, the slave trade, the invasion of North America, and the initial steps toward
hegemony in the Middle East and Africa. Students will investigate the ways in which individual personality,
religiosity, greed, critical first contacts, and cultural misunderstandings and prejudices combined with important
aspects of the Military, Scientific, and early Industrial Revolutions to establish European hegemony on a world-
wide scale during this early period of European Imperialism.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on five short written exercises and one research paper.

HIST 128T(S) Conquistadors in the New World (W)
The Spanish conquest of the Americas happened with astonishing rapidity. Christopher Columbus entered the
Caribbean in 1492; Hernando Cortes completed the conquest of the Aztecs of central Mexico in 1521; Francisco
Pizarro triumphantly entered the Inca capital Cuzco, in Peru, in 1545. Other conquistadors pushed north to the
Carolinas and California, south to the Tierra del Fuego and the River Plate, and across the Amazonian basin to the
Atlantic. "We came," wrote the conquistador Bernal Diaz del Castillo, "to serve God, and our King, and to get
rich." Their deeds were legendary, their courage, daring, and endurance remarkable. They were also notoriously
quarrelsome, greedy, and cruel. Before their onslaught the major civilizations of the new world crumbled--de-
stroyed or changed beyond recognition. Rarely in history have so few conquered so many so quickly. The con-
quest of the New World has both excited and appalled the human imagination for more than five centuries. Many
questions about the event remain to be answered or are still capable of provoking controversy, questions that will
be addressed in this tutorial: Who exactly were the conquistadors? What motivated them? How did their self-per-
petuating conquistador system originate and operate? What meaning did they themselves assign to their actions?
How could they justify their many, misdeeds? How did they develop their sense of the Other? Why did often
inspired resistance by indigenous peoples and regimes ultimately fail? Was conquest somehow preordained?
Could it have failed? What mixture of human agency, culture, technology, religion, nature, and biology can best
explain the results of this encounter between the conquistador and Amerindian worlds?
Format: tutorial. Students will meet in weekly one-hour sessions with a student tutorial partner and the instructor,
one presenting a paper, the other offering a critique.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Preference will be given to sophomores and to second-se-

HIST 136(S) Before the Deluge: Paris and Berlin in the Interwar Years (W)
Paris and Berlin were the two poles of Europe in the 1920s, rival capital cities of two historically hostile nations
that had only just put an end to the carnage of World War I. Paris was the grande dame; Berlin the upstart. In the
1920s, these two pulsating metropolises became the sites of political and cultural movements that would leave a
lasting imprint on European society until the present day. This course focuses on the politics, society, and culture of
these two cities in their heyday in the 1920s. We will also consider their fate in the 1930s, first as depression set in,
and then as the Nazis came to power. Devoting half the semester to Paris and the other half to Berlin, we will
examine a range of parallel topics in both contexts, including the impact of World War I, the growing popularity of
right-wing political movements and the increase in political violence, shifting gender norms and sexual mores, and
new developments in the realms of art, film, theatre, cabaret, and literature.

HIST 141(F) Modernism, Leisure, and Subjectivity in Fin-de-Siècle Russia (W)
This course introduces students to the artistic movements, everyday life, and socio-cultural upheavals of urban
Russia in the fin-de-siècle (1881 to 1914). The fast-paced, consumer-oriented modern city, with its celebrities,
fashions, and technological wonders, gripped the imagination of imperial Russia's urban denizens. The inhabitants
of St. Petersburg and Moscow, conscious of living in a new era, embraced and grappled with the Modern Age as
journalists, impresarios, and artists narrated and interpreted it. We will explore the ways revolution and war, indus-
trialization, the commercialization of culture, and new sensibilities about the self and identity were reflected in
modernist art and thought, literature, and autobiographical writings. We also will look closely at the realms of elite
entertainment and popular amusement in an attempt to relate consumer culture to notions of gender and sexuality,
the redefinition of status and privilege, and concepts of leisure. Historians have offered competing explanations of
how and why the rapid social, economic and cultural changes of this period contributed to the fall of the Russian
monarchy and the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917. Our primary goal will be to use sources to assess their arguments
and, hopefully, make our own. Texts include: historical scholarship, literary works, philosophical and sociological
writings, music, visual art, and film.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class participation, several short essays, and a final research paper.

HIST 147(F) Women and Men in Twentieth-Century Latin America (Same as Women's and
Gender Studies 147) (W)
The twentieth century saw massive transformations in virtually all realms of Latin American societies. Notions
about the roles of men and women, however, displayed less obvious changes: machismo, stereotypes would have
us believe, remains very much in force. Using a variety of texts--including literary fiction, videos, photography,
and anthropological and historical studies--we will evaluate the consequences of such dominant visions--as well
as the inadequacies of analyses based on them. Besides looking at machismo and its corollaries, we will explore
how such codes have faced alternative readings by women and men and the challenges of subversive gender iden-
tities and sexualities. Topics will include the modernization of patriarchal relations, domestic violence and men's
real and attempted control over "their" women, the repercussions of women's changing participation in the indus-
trializing and globalized economies of the late-twentieth century, the problematic relationship between women's
movements and progressive and revolutionary politics, and the links between racial/ethnic identities and gender
roles.

For more than a century, the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution has served as the principal touchstone for
legal debates over the meaning of equality and freedom in the United States. This course explores the origins of the
14th Amendment in the years immediately following the Civil War, and examines the evolution of that amend-
ment's meaning in the century that followed. Central themes in this course include the contested interpretations of
"due process," "privileges and immunities," "equal protection," and "life, liberty or property"; the rise, fall, and
rebirth of substantive due process; and the battles over incorporating the Bill of Rights into the 14th Amendment.
We will pay particular attention to how debates over the 14th Amendment have shaped and been shaped by the
changing meanings of racial and gender equality, and how the 14th Amendment has transformed the promise and
experience of American citizenship.

In a nation long committed to democratic principles, dynasties of any sort are bound to seem anomalous. Yet in six
different instances members of the same family have held or aspired to hold the highest office in the land, the
Presidency of the United States. Our purpose will be to analyze three of those families: the Adamses, the Roose-
velts, and the Kennedys. In particular, we will focus on the paths they took to power, their performance as political
leaders, and the legacies they left behind. Throughout the semester we will also be exploring what differences

HIST 162(F) "New Worlds for All": European-Indian Encounters in Colonial North America (W)
This course focuses on the interactions between Indians and Europeans in the contexts of Spanish, French, Dutch,
and British exploration and colonization of North America. Drawing upon our critical reading of secondary and
primary sources, we will explore the political, economic, social, and cultural transformations visited upon both
Indian and Euro-American societies as a result of European attempts to control vast North American territories
from the Saint Lawrence valley to Florida and from the Lower Mississippi valley to California. Because of the
large scope of our inquiry we will proceed both chronologically and thematically. Our themes will include: Indian
resistance and adaptation to European invasions and evangelizing efforts; diplomacy, warfare, and the evolution of
North American geopolitics; Frontier exchange economies and the transformation of material cultures; the trans-
formation and construction of colonial identities (Euro-American and Indian concepts of "self," the racialization
of Euro-American perceptions of Indians and Indians' perceptions of Europeans). Over the course of the semester,
students will write several response papers based on secondary readings to help them assess how historians have
addressed these themes. These papers will serve as the basis for our discussion of the methodologies, theories, and
sources historians use to reconstruct the history of European-Indian encounters. Short response papers will also
familiarize students with some of the most important historiographical debates of colonial North American history
and will help them conceptualize and write an original research paper based upon a combination of primary and
secondary sources.

reading a number of key books in the field, and then we will turn to the College library's extensive holdings of
microfilm records dealing with both agricultural and industrial slavery. In consultation with the instructor, each
student will select the records of a slave-manned plantation or industrial site for careful and detailed study. The
most important piece of work in the seminar will be a research paper that each student will prepare using the

quences. The second section discusses the ways in which the rising tide of African nationalism, in the form of
labor strikes and guerrilla wars, ushered out colonialism. The third section examines the postcolonial states, focus-
ing on the politics of development, recent civil wars in countries like Rwanda, and the growing AIDS epidemics.

ery of oil, radical religious groups, and war and peace. Throughout the course these significant changes will be
evaluated in light of their impact on the lives of a variety of individuals in the region and especially how they have
grappled differently with increasing Western political and economic domination. This course is part of the Explor-
ing Diversity Initiative because it compares the differences and similarities between different cultures and societies
in the Middle East and the various ways they have responded to one another in the past.

HIST 210(F) The Ottoman Empire
The history of the Ottoman Turks, who played an important role in the early modern history and much of the
modern history of both Europe and the Middle East, has traditionally been divided into three periods, one of
growth (1300-1566); one of stasis, at last externally (1566-1699); and one of decline (1699-1923). This survey
covers in detail the first two of these periods, the first a time of almost uninterrupted growth from the origins of the
state around 1300 as a tiny principality in northwest Asia Minor to the end of the reign of Süleyman the Magnifi-
cent (1566). By then the Ottomans were the "the Terror of the World," having built an empire embracing much of
southeast Europe, the Black Sea, the greater part of the Islamic Middle East and much of North Africa. An impor-
tant focus will be the development of the uniquely Ottoman state institutions which served as an impetus and
support to this growth and enabled the successful governing of a multiethnic, multifaith, polyglot empire. The
deterioration of these institutions was an important feature of the second period, leading to the internal weakening
of the state which became apparent at the Ottoman defeat in the second siege of Vienna (1683), this to be followed
by the first significant loss of territory at the end of the century. The course of the final two centuries, when the
empire became "the Sick Man of Europe," will be sketched more briefly.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, two short papers, quizzes and a self-

The ascension of powerful warlords in the late 1500s brought to an end a century of constant warfare and laid the
foundation for the Tokugawa bakufu, the military government headed by the Tokugawa shogun that would rule
Japan for almost three hundred years. This course will introduce students to the extraordinary changes of the years
between the establishment of the Tokugawa bakufu in 1603 and its collapse in 1868, an era characterized by rela-
tive peace and stability, periods of economic growth as well as stagnation, the growth of cities and towns, the
flourishing of urban culture, and the decline of the samurai. We will focus on the political and social history of
early modern Japan, including topics such as the establishment of the Tokugawa order, the nature of the political
system, urbanization, popular culture, rural life, gender and sexuality, class and status, religion, and the fall of the
Tokugawa bakufu. Assigned materials will include government documents, literature, and films.

A modernizing revolution, the construction and collapse of an empire, devastating defeat in a World War, occupa-

ence. This course will examine the main themes of modern Japanese history with a focus on how various "ordi-
nary people" have lived through the extraordinary changes of the past century and a half. Through the perspectives
of ordinary people, from a young girl working in a cotton textile factory in the 1920s to a salaryman in the post-

HIST 223(F) Roman History (Same as Classics 223)
The study of Roman history involves questions central to the development of Western institutions, religion, and
modes of thought. Scholars have looked to Rome both for actual antecedents of European cultural development
and for paradigmatic scenes illustrating what they felt were cultural universals. Yet Roman history also encom-
passes the most far-reaching experience of diverse cultures, beliefs, and practices known in the Western tradition
until perhaps contemporary times. A close analysis of Roman history on its own terms shows the complex and
fascinating results of an ambitious, self-confident nation's encounter both with unexpected events and crises at
home, and with other peoples. As this course addresses the history of Rome from its mythologized beginnings
through the reign of the emperor Constantine, it will place special emphasis on the impressive Roman ability to
turn the unexpected into a rich source of cultural development, as well as the complex tendency later to interpret
such ad hoc responses as predestined and inevitable. The Romans also provide a vivid portrait of the relationship
between power and self-confidence on the one hand, and violence and ultimate disregard for dissent and
difference on the other. Readings for this course will concentrate on a wide variety of original sources, and there
will be a strong emphasis on the problems of historical interpretation.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on weekly brief in-class response papers, one 8- to 10-page

HIST 225(S) The Middle Ages (Same as Religion 216)
This course explores the development of European and Mediterranean civilizations during the thousand-year
period known as the "Middle Ages." At the beginning of this period the Romans ruled a massive empire that
stretched from Britain to north Africa and from Spain to Iraq. A millennium later, this classical and pagan world
had broken apart into three successor civilizations: medieval Europe, the Byzantine empire, and the Islamic world.
This course investigates how this momentous transformation occurred. We will examine such topics as relations
between Romans and "barbarians," the spread of Christianity and Islam, the development of kingdoms and em-
pires, the Vikings and crusades, saints and religious reformers, art and architecture, cities and trade, the persecution
of Jews and heretics, as well as the Black Death and Italian Renaissance.

HIST 228(S) Europe in the Twentieth Century
This course introduces students to the history of Europe from before the First World to the present. During this
period Europe witnessed two world wars, the largest pandemic in recorded history, numerous civil conflicts, the
fall of capitalist colonial empires, and the rise and fall of a communist empire. Through a combination of films,
artistic works, philosophical interventions, and historical texts, we will look at what made the last century both the
most violent and the most productive in Europe's history. By discussing various possible ways of organizing twen-
tieth-century European history (the Cold War, decolonization, expanded suffrage, scientific progress, etc), we will
develop a variety of lenses through which we can read assigned works and grasp both the contours and complexity
of Europe's past.

HIST 230(S) Modern European Jewish History, 1789-1948 (Same as Jewish Studies 230)
What does it mean to be a Jew? The vexed question of Jewish identity emerged at the end of the eighteenth century
in Europe and has dominated Jewish history throughout the modern period. Although Jewish emancipation and
citizenship followed different paths in France and the German states, in both cases Jews were confronted by un-
precedented opportunities for integration into non-Jewish society and unprecedented challenges to Jewish com-
munal life. This course will introduce students to the major social, cultural, religious, and political transformations
that shaped the lives of Europe's Jews from the outbreak of the French Revolution to the aftermath of World War
II. We will explore such topics as emancipation, Jewish diversity, the rise of religious denominations within Juda-
ism, competing political ideologies, Jewish-gentile relations, the role of Jewish women, Jewish responses to Na-
zism, and the situation of Jews in the immediate postwar period. In addition to broad historical treatments, course

HIST 243(F) Modern Latin America, 1822 to the Present
This course will examine salient issues in the history of the independent nations of Latin America. The first section
of the course will focus on the turbulent formation of nation-states over the course of the nineteenth century. In this
regard the course will analyze the social and economic changes of the period up to World War I and the
possibilities they offered for both political order and disorder. Key topics addressed will include caudillismo, the
role of the Church in politics, economic dependency and development, and the place of indigenous and African
Latin-American peoples in new nations. The second section will move us to questions in twentieth-century Latin-
American history, including industrialization and urbanization; the emergence of workers' and women's move-
ments and the rise of mass politics; militarism, democracy, and authoritarian governments; the influence of the
U.S. in the region; and the construction of cultural modernism in these "Third World" societies. Here and
throughout the course we will strive for an understanding of how social conflicts shaped and were shaped by eco-
nomic and political forces.

nic Caribbean nations from the slave colonies of the not-so-distant past. We will show that though they may be
picturesque vacation destinations, the islands of the Caribbean have played a central role in the history of the At-
lantic world for the last 500 years. In particular, the course focuses on the moments when leaders and residents of
these islands were in contact with each other and how they imagined those relationships. This means that readings
will explore topics of migration, moments of political alliances, as well as periods of social disturbance. Sources
will include speeches, song lyrics, films, testimonios, and other historical documents that shed light on the history
of Caribbean nations. The course has three sections: the early history of the Caribbean, leading up to the Haitian
Revolution; nineteenth-century developments, including slave emancipation and early nationalist and indepen-
dence movements; and the twentieth century, which pays particular attention to how Caribbean peoples have acted
on their understandings of those two prior periods.

From its foundation in 1776 to the beginning of World War I in 1914, the United States developed a complex of
ideas for understanding--and methods for securing--its place in the world. During this period, the nation's diplo-
macy went through several phases as it made the transition from a young republic struggling to conduct its diplo-
macy, to an expansionist power in the first half of the nineteenth century, to an emerging world power in the after-
math of the Civil War, and then to an imperialist power after the Spanish-American War. Amidst these events, U.S.
statesmen and citizens constantly debated the country's proper diplomatic role and struggled to construct and
propagate a unique American ideology, as well as an advantageous geo-strategic position, on the global stage.
Debates about foreign relations were imbued with questions of race, nation, independence, religion, economy, law,
gender, and geographic expansion; indeed, defining U.S. foreign relations was a means of defining the nation it-
self. Through a variety of primary sources and scholarly books and articles, this course will examine U.S. relations
with external powers as well as the interactions that occurred between U.S. domestic and foreign policy during this
period.

HIST 263(S) The United States and the World, 1914 to the Present (Same as Leadership Studies
263)
World War I altered the world's geostrategic balance and ushered in a new era for U.S. foreign relations. The self-
identified isolationist power would emerge as a hegemon, no longer able or content to rely upon its geographic
position to protect it from global entanglement. Some have called this the "Wilsonian Century," as Woodrow Wil-
son led the charge to involve the United States in a new international order. This new order did not materialize
immediately after the Treaty of Versailles in 1919, especially as the world descended into economic depression.
During and after World War II, though, the U.S. adopted activist methods of spreading self-determination, democ-
racy, and capitalist models of development and free trade around the world. This became all the more critical as
European empires disintegrated and decolonizing countries looked to the adversarial superpowers, the United
States and the Soviet Union, for competing models of development and modern forms of government. Through a
variety of primary sources and scholarly books and articles, this course will explore U.S. relations with the world
from World War I to the current war in Iraq. In addition to official U.S. policy, the course will examine America's
economic, cultural, and ideological impact abroad. It will also consider how international events have shaped
American society and culture and, in turn, how domestic factors have influenced American foreign policy.

Americans in colonial America and the United States. Economically, culturally, and politically, African Ameri-
cans had a profound effect on the historical landscape of this nation. The experience of slavery necessarily domi-
nates this history and it is the contours and nuances of slavery that give this course its focus. We will explore the
influence of African culture on early America, the role of gender in the American slave labor system, the develop-
ment of racial classification in North America, and the cultural and intellectual significance of the abolitionist
movement. Our readings will include primary sources and secondary literature. Class meetings will combine lec-

meanings of freedom, equality, and rights; the intersection of ideology and activism; the disconnection between
local and national perspectives. Additionally, the course explores the political nature and development of African-
American protest traditions, giving particular attention to the rise of Jim Crow, the franchise, black institutional

Modern Era (Same as Africana Studies 292)
This class offers an overview of the African presence in and influence on European politics and culture since their
appearance as slaves in the sixteenth century. Despite such inauspicious beginnings, Africans played an important
role in the abolitionist movements in England and France in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and chal-
lenged European imperialism in Africa at the end of the century. During the twentieth century, pan-africanism,
Négritude, decolonization and the non-aligned movement developed in Europe's major capitals, where African
and African-American artists and musicians interacted in novel ways to put Europe on the forefront of develop-
ments in modern art, literature, jazz and world music. Since World War II, widespread immigration of Africans--
particularly North Africans and West Indians of African descent--to Europe has deeply changed the character of
European societies. From Hottentot Venus to Josephine Baker, from Mary Prince to Ayaan Hirsi Ali, this course
will use the writings of intellectuals and leaders like Senghor, Fanon, and C.L.R. James--as well as film, music,
and literature--to explore the ways in which Africans have transformed Europe in the modern era.

JUNIOR SEMINARS (301)
Junior seminars explore the nature and practice of history, are required for the degree in History, and are nor-
mally restricted to junior History majors. Although these seminars vary in topic and approach, each focuses on the
discipline of history itself--on the debates over how to approach the past, on questions of the status of different
kinds of evidence and how to use it, on the purpose of the study of history. Focusing on questions of methodology,
epistemology, and historiography, these courses ask: What kind of knowledge do historians claim to produce?
What does it mean to study the past? How do historians approach the project of studying the past? Each year
several junior seminars will be offered. Students who plan to study abroad during their junior year may take their
Junior Seminar in the spring semester of their sophomore year, and those planning to be away for the whole of
their junior year are strongly encouraged to do so.
HIST 301A(F) Approaching the Past: History, Theory, Practice
This course will explore how the discipline of `History' has come to assume its present form and how a number of
historians since the 1820s have understood their craft. We will begin by discussing the work of three great nine-
teenth-century historians (Macaulay, Marx, and Ranke) who believed that historical "truth" existed and could,
with skill, be deciphered. Next we will explore the philosophy and practice of the cultural and social historians of
the 1960s/1970s, comparing and contrasting it with that of their nineteenth-century predecessors. We will then
consider the work of those recent theorists who have tried to refute historians' claims to be able to capture the
"truth" of the past, focusing on the state of the field in the wake of challenges posed to its epistemological founda-
tions by "post-modernism." We will conclude with an assessment of the state of the discipline today. In general,
we will be less concerned with "the past" than with what historians do with "the past." Consequently, we will
focus primarily on those abstract, philosophical assumptions that have informed the practice of history.
Format: discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, a 250-word position statement ("What is His-
tory?"), two 9- to 11-page interpretive essays, and a take-home final exam.

HIST 301C(F) Approaching the Past: Practices of Modern History
What is history? What is it that historians do? In this course, students will explore questions of how and why we
historians practice our craft. The first section of the course will examine how historians come to know, think about,
and understand the past. Issues of the nature of historical "truth," objectivity and bias, types of sources, and uses of
theory will be discussed. Next, we will address the ways in which historians write about the past, considering the
influence of postmodernism on historical narratives, and historical film. Finally, we will examine the uses of histo-
ry, including ethical and moral ramifications of our work, history education, and the construction of historical
memory. The class will meet once a week, and each session will focus on some theoretical material as well as
readings that concretely illustrate the methodological issues at stake. These readings will be drawn from a broad
range of topics, such as the Great Depression, the Pacific War, the Holocaust, and the assassination of JFK.

Championing reason and challenging religious views of the past, the Philosophes linked the new secular study of
man and his society to a view of historical progress. Some have argued that the very nature of the historical disci-
pline is Eurocentric, based as it is on Western concepts of reason, science, and historical evolution which privilege
European history at the expense of its non-Western counterparts. In this course, we will study some of the impor-
tant spokesmen for historical progress (Voltaire, Condorcet, Marx, von Ranke) as well as some of their important
critics. The first half of the course will survey the history of the historical profession from the Enlightenment to the
present. In the second half of the course, we will read some of the great works of history which have attempted to
explain the rise of the west, grappling with how and to what extent these interpretations are Eurocentric.
Format: discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, two 10- to 12-page papers, and a final exam.
Restricted to History majors.

HIST 301E(S) Approaching the Past: Three Historians of the Dark Ages
This History 301 seminar investigates the nature of History through the three most important historical writers of
the so-called European Dark Ages: Gregory of Tours (d. 594), a Gallo-Roman aristocrat and bishop who chroni-
cled the bloody feuds of the early Frankish kings and queens; the Venerable Bede (d. 735), a Benedictine monk
History
­ 198 ­
who famously narrated the conversion of Anglo-Saxon England from paganism to Christianity; and Einhard (d.
840), the biographer of the great emperor Charlemagne. For each of these early medieval authors, we will seek to
understand not only how he conceived of and wrote about the past, but also how modern historians have tried to
use his surviving writings as evidence to construct their own historical arguments and narratives. In this way, our
examination of three historians of the Dark Ages will become an exploration into historical methodology, historio-
graphy, epistemology, and the limits of historical knowledge.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class participation, short weekly response papers, and several longer
papers.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20 (expected: 20). Restricted to History majors.

HIST 332(S) The Revolutionary Tradition in France, 1789-1871
This course provides an examination of the uneven development of a revolutionary tradition in France. We will
follow the attempts to define, deny, foreclose, and revise the Revolution from its explosion in 1789 through the
foundation of the Third Republic. A strong historiographic focus will direct our attention to the gendered nature of
the revolutionary project; the tension between liberty and equality that runs throughout French history; and the
plausibility of competing social, political, and cultural interpretations of the Revolution.

HIST 339(F) A Call to Arms: Philosophies of Violence in Twentieth-Century Europe
Europe's twentieth century began at the tail end of the longest sustained peace in memory, yet ended as the most
bloody hundred years in human history. How did European thinkers justify, criticize, and comprehend their soci-
ety's descent into violence? What does the long European debate over the political uses of terror tell us about our
own "war on terror?" This course explores the debates over the legitimacy of political violence with one eye open
to the origins of our contemporary situation and the aspiration to address the ethics of political violence. Using
primary texts by European philosophers, artists, novelists, and militants in conjunction with secondary historical
works and films, we will explore the evolving justifications and critiques of proletarian violence and revolutionary
terror, fascist and anti-fascist violence, sometimes bloody anti-colonial struggles, and anti-authoritarian student
movements.
Format: primarily discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, two historiographic essays of 10-15

diversity of American Indian historical experiences and Indian peoples' role in shaping the political, economic,
and cultural history of the United States and Canada remain unexplored. In this course, we will examine the
historical significance of North American Indian actions and experiences from the "pre-Columbian" era to the
present. Our approach will be both chronological and thematic and will pay close attention to the methods scholars
have used to reconstruct American Indian perspectives. Our themes will include: Indian resistance and adaptation
to European colonial invasions and evangelizing efforts; diplomacy, warfare, and the evolution of North American
geopolitics; the transformation of Euro-American and Indian material cultures; the construction and transforma-
tion of colonial and national identities; Indian responses to Euro-American uses and abuses of "Indianness"; and
Indian resistance against U.S. and Canadian policies of assimilation and dispossession.

States. We will begin with three units designed to introduce the theoretical and methodological literature (one each
on gender, sexuality, and race), and then devote the rest of our sessions to analyzing a series of specific historical
topics examining the ways that race, sexuality, and gender have been imagined, policed, legislated, experienced,
and performed in modern U.S. History. Topics to be explored include the development of and challenges to cate-
gories of race, sex, and gender; laws and cultural norms regarding sex and relationships; racial and sexual violence
and organized resistance; and historical debates about family, immigration, work, and reproduction.

Franklin D. Roosevelt was elected to the presidency an unprecedented four times. During his years in office, both
the United States and the world were dramatically transformed. This course will explore how and why, with an
emphasis on Roosevelt's specific role in these transformations. It will focus first on the Great Depression and the
ensuing New Deal, which created the modern American economy, government and presidency. It will then turn to
the origins and course of World War II, during which the United States emerged as a global superpower. Readings
will include both primary and conflicting secondary accounts.

the course, we shall look at subjects like the foreign and domestic slave trade, patterns of work and treatment, the
nature of the master-slave relationship, resistance and rebellion, and slave cultural, social, and family life. The
second half of the course will concentrate on the influence of the institution of slavery on the mind, social structure,
and economy of the Old South, and slavery's impact on Southern politics and the decision for secession in
1860-61.

HIST 372(S) The Rise of American Business
An examination of the complex process that saw business enterprise move from a marginal position in the largely

American attempts at industrialization, the business careers of John D. Rockefeller and Andrew Carnegie, and the
growth, since 1900, of multidivisional corporations like DuPont and General Motors. Readings will include his-

HIST 374(S) American Medical History
This course will cover major themes in American medical history and historiography from the colonial period
through the twentieth century. Every aspect of American "medicine" underwent tremendous transition during the
period we will study. Medical education, the medical profession, and notions about cures and care changed funda-
mentally, as did ideas about the nature of illness itself. Our course of study, in addition to charting ways in which
the practice of medicine in America has developed, will make an equal effort to understand how medicine has
changed and affected American society. Topics that we will investigate include cholera, TB, and childbirth in
American society, as well as other medical phenomena.

A little more than a hundred years ago, African Americans were disfranchised. Indeed, most black people could
not vote until the last quarter of the 20th century. And yet, at the beginning of the 21st century, a black man
mounted a significant campaign for the presidency of the United States. This course investigates the history of
African American ideology and activism regarding the vote, office holding, public policy, and party politics.
Course themes include: the 14th and 15th Amendments, disfranchisement, women's suffrage, court challenges,
the civil rights movement, political ideologies, and candidacies in the post-reform era.

The Supreme Court decision Brown v. Board of Education (1954) ended an era of black activism that used the
courts to overturn exclusionary practices of American education, opening a new civil rights era that introduced
new strategies and tactics of protest. This course introduces students to the themes and issues of the black freedom
movement as it transpired after 1954 and continued into the 1980s in the United States. Focusing on African
Americans' demands for the rights and responsibilities of citizenship, and placing their perspectives at the center,
the course will follow a chronological format that covers the architecture of racial segregation and the culture of
Jim Crow and examines the persistence of activism and resistance. Finally, the course will follow the many itera-
tions of the freedom movement, including direct action, black power, and coalition building.

ued, what characterized it, how its foci changed over time, and how and why it ended. We will pay particular
attention to the ideological, diplomatic, technological, and military competitions that marked the bipolar Soviet-
American rivalry. We will also explore the collapse of the European imperial order and the resulting process of
Third World decolonization, which was a major factor in shaping, perpetuating, and arguably ending the Cold
War. Sources for the course will include primary documents, scholarly books and articles on a variety of interna-

The Vietnam War, the longest Americans have known, still haunts us. But the passage of time, the accumulation of
documentation, and an impressive body of scholarship make it possible to confront the ghosts of that painful con-
flict with ever greater detachment and confidence. This course is guided above all by a concern with setting the
Vietnam War in a broad context. The course will trace origins--for Vietnamese patriots and peasants going back
to the nineteenth century and earlier and for American cold warriors beginning with the immediate post-1945
period. The course will also encompass a wide range of groups--from the leaders in Washington, Saigon, Hanoi,
and Beijing who directed the conflict, to the soldiers who fought it, to the non-combatants who lived with its con-
sequences. The course will finally follow the war's legacies for each of the countries involved.
Format: lecture/discussion. Readings will consist of primary sources, oral history, and fiction--as well as conven-
tional historical accounts, averaging about a hundred pages a week over the term. Evaluation will be based on two

HIST 395(S) Fashioning Bodies: Dress, Consumption, and Gender from the Renaissance to the
Present (Same as Women and Gender Studies 395)
This course explores costume and fashion as vehicles for the (re)creation and expression of gender, class, and
sexual identities in Europe and the United States. We will begin by looking at the relationship between fashion and
the political and economic power of the courts of early modern Europe. Revolutionary ideologies will be linked to
sartorial politics, consumption of clothing to colonization, and changes in the style of clothing to shifting social
norms. As our focus turns to the fashion industry in the twentieth century, when mass-produced clothing increased
the possibility for reflexivity and imaginative play in dress, we will relate representations of the dressed body to the
formation of diverse cultural communities, beauty ideals, and status hierarchies, examining both the normative
and subversive potential of fashion. The course considers work in the fields of art history, cultural history, sociolo-
gy and anthropology, feminist theory, and fashion journalism to ask questions such as: What are the origins of
consumer societies? When, why, and how were fashion and consumption feminized? Is clothing a language?
What cultural, political and social meanings do certain forms of dress generate? What is the relationship between
prevalent understandings of the body and fashion? How is clothing used to stigmatize or differentiate individuals
and communities? Topics include: the origins of uniforms and sportswear, eroticism and androgyny in fashion, the
cultural politics of ethnic" clothing, and the relationship between the fashion industry and cinema.

War." The First World War shattered a long century of near-total peace on the continent, profoundly changed so-
cial and political relations in all combatant countries, and shifted the balance of global power toward the emerging
United States. In retrospect, the war opened the floodgates of modern history, creating space for decolonization,
communism, fascism, welfare-state liberalism, suffrage movements, and the final demise of continental monar-
chies. This seminar will explore the ways that individuals and groups in the belligerent nations experienced the
war asking, in the process, whose experiences "count" in the historiography of the war and looking at the ways in
which historians access the varieties of social experience. Students should take from this course a basic factual
knowledge of the origins, trajectory, and afterlives of the First World War, a sense of how the experience of the war
differed by national and social identity, an idea of the debates that animate the historical discussions of the war, and
an ability to work with sources in order to engage with those debates.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class participation, two short papers or bibliographic assignments,
and a research paper of approximately 25 pages.
Enrollment limit: 15 (expected: 10-15). Preference given to junior and senior History majors with some familiari-
ty with modern European history.

HIST 439(S) Personality, Society, and Identity in Nineteenth- and Early Twentieth-Century Russian
Thought
This seminar studies the movements and themes of Russian thought from the Enlightenment to 1917, situating
works of Russian philosophy and literature, when appropriate, within the broader context of Western intellectual
traditions. We will explore how ideas about human nature and society inspired and gave meaning to political re-
form, terrorism, and revolution in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and ponder their relevance in Rus-
sia today. The course covers themes such as the individual and society, morality and love, and time and eschatolo-
gy, as well as topics like: the problem of national identity, conservatism and radicalism, the forging of the intelli-
gentsia" tradition, the commercialization of culture, and revolutionary language in 1917. Readings include texts
by Pushkin, Belinsky, Dostoevsky, Herzen, Tolstoy, Solvyov, Berdiaev, as well as modernist works (Bely, Blok,
Ivanov) and Marxist writings (Plekhanov, Bogdanov, Lenin). We also will read secondary historical literature,
watch films, and listen to music in order to gain a deeper understanding of the cultural environment in which our
primary sources were written and the ways social ideals and types were disseminated.
Format: seminar. Knowledge of Russian is NOT a prerequisite for this course. Evaluation will be based on class
participation, several oral presentations and short preliminary writing assignments, and a final research paper.
No prerequisites. No enrollment limit (expected 5-9). Preference will be given to History and Russian Studies ma-
jors.

HIST 452(F) Women in America, 1603-1865 (Same as Women's and Gender Studies 452)
Women have always been mothers, wives and daughters; and through much of their history in North America,
their relationship to the state has been mediated through men. Their labor, be it in the household, as free wage
laborers, farm hands, or slaves, was important both to the development of the American market economy and to
the ideology and rhetoric of nationhood. This seminar will explore the significance of the experiences of American
women from the colonial era through the Civil War. We will address the impact of slavery on all American
women, the role of women during the nineteenth-century period of intense urbanization and industrialization, and
the ways in which literacy and artistic culture shaped the way American women portrayed their own lives.
History
­ 204 ­
Throughout the semester we will read primary documents, both as a class and individually. One goal for students
is the ability to read sources critically and to evaluate the role of literacy and writing itself in women's history. Our
inquiry will encompass women in New England, the South and the Hispanic Southwest. As we study works of
history, we will also read twentieth-century feminist and race theory to understand the connections between prac-
tice and theory, between narrative and argument.
Format: seminar. Requirements include a research paper (20-25 pages), based on reading and analysis of a set of
primary sources, a literature review, class participation, and an informal reading journal.

An examination of one of the most turbulent periods in American history, with special emphasis on the changing
status of Afro-Americans during the era. During the war years, we shall study both the war itself and homefront
conditions: military, naval, political, economic, and especially social aspects will be examined in some detail. Our
study of Reconstruction will concentrate on the evolution of federal policy toward the Southern states and the
workings out of that policy in the South, particularly as it relates to the freedmen.

HIST 457(S) Gender, Law, and Politics in U.S. History (Same as Women's and Gender Studies

This seminar explores the legal history of the United States as a gendered system. It examines how women have
shaped the meanings of American citizenship through pursuit of political rights and obligations such as suffrage,
jury duty, and military service; how those political struggles have varied across race, religion, and class; and how
the legal system has shaped gender relations for both women and men through regulation of such issues as mar-
riage, divorce, work, reproduction, and the family. While we will read some court cases, the focus of the seminar is
on the broader relationship between law and society. Readings will address not only the history of statutory law,
and of the lawsuits and trials testing those laws, but also the social history of the impact of the law and the political
history of efforts to change laws.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on an extensive (20-25 page) research paper that makes use of primary
and secondary sources, brief papers on the weekly readings, and class participation.

HIST 459(S) Jim Crow (Same as Africana Studies 459)
Between the years 1896 and 1954 the United States instituted a set of laws, rules, and customs designed to segre-
gate African Americans - and with the sanction of the courts, the Congress, and the President. Jim Crow, as this
system was known, impressed the cultural, social, political, and economic conditions in ways that assured racial
discrimination. Considering the Jim Crow era as a specific time period, this course engages broad themes of histo-
ry: the importance of context and perspective, the place of historiography in shaping questions, critiquing sources,
and making arguments, and the dynamics of race, gender, and power. From both sides of the color line - white and
black - the course explores law, cultural production, community and institutional development, and the roles of
violence, media, and personal experience in sustaining this new racial world. Finally, the course examines the
system's inherent paradox: colliding ideologies about human rights and freedom.

HIST 460(F) U.S. Foreign Relations: Nationalism, Empire, and Hegemony (Same as Leadership
Studies 460)
The abrupt end of the Cold War, followed by the discovery of globalization and then the upheaval of the post-9/11
period, has had a powerfully disruptive effect on U.S. policy. It has also given historians pause to rethink their
understanding of the U.S. role in the world. In the search for fresh interpretations and frameworks, three concepts
have come to loom large in their work: nationalism, empire, and hegemony. This course explores how these con-
cepts might illuminate the path of U.S. foreign relations over the last century, how they might situate the American
experience in a global and comparative context, and how they might help frame a research project based substan-
tially on primary materials.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on participation in discussions, several short warm-up papers, and a
20-25 page research paper.
Prerequisite: some familiarity with U.S. history in the twentieth century or the history of international relations.

HIST 481T(S) The American Revolution, 1763-1798: Meanings and Interpretations (W)
During the second half of the eighteenth century, the political, social, and demographic landscape of eastern North
America underwent dramatic transformations. If many of the characters and events marking the transition of the
region from a cluster of thirteen colonies to the first republic of the western hemisphere are quite familiar to most
Americans, the movement to independence and the creation of the United States have been the subject of complex
and sometimes contentious historical interpretations. This tutorial will explore the ideological, economic, political,
and cultural causes and consequences of the American Revolution, from the emergence of increasing tensions
between Great Britain and its North American colonies to the attempts of the United States government to limit
political expression and immigration in the new nation. Through the close reading of some of the most significant
scholarship of the period, we will seek to understand how a multitude of historical actors of varied social, econom-
ic, religious, and ethnic backgrounds made and shaped the famous political, military, and constitutional struggles
of the Revolutionary Era. By the end of this tutorial, students will have engaged and debated some of the most
important historiographical assessments of the Revolutionary Era. In their final assignment, students will be
equipped to provide an erudite and personal answer to the most important question of all: How revolutionary was
the Revolution?
Format: tutorial. Requirements: once a week for about an hour, student will meet with the instructor in pairs. Dur-
ing our sessions, students will alternatively present orally or critique a written essay of seven double-spaced pages
on a topic assigned by the instructor. At the end of the semester, students will be asked to write a final paper assess-
ing the revolutionary nature of the American Revolution.

HIST 482T(S) Fictions of African-American History (W)
This course examines the form and function of African-American historical narratives with attention to written
texts pertaining to the enslavement and freedom of African Americans during the nineteenth and early twentieth
century. The lack of documentary material pertaining to this history has made the task of reading and interpreting
African American experience particularly challenging. By crossing generic and disciplinary boundaries, students
will take up the task of reading African-American history while attending to the difficulties such a task raises. To
do so, we will read both historical and fictional narratives that raise explicitly the problems of writing African-
American history.
In the first part of the course, we will discuss selected texts (fiction, narrative, and historiography) from the ante-
bellum era in order to schematize the literature of slavery. In the second half of the course, we will take up the
discourse of freedom that followed the Emancipation Proclamation. Readings will include works by Booker T.
Washington, James Weldon Johnson, Charles Chesnutt, Harriet Wilson, Paul Laurence Dunbar, Sutton Griggs. In
addition, we will read historiography on African American slavery, freedom, and urbanization.

HIST 487T(F) The Second World War: Origins, Course, Outcomes, and Meaning (W)
1991 marked the fiftieth anniversaries of the Nazi invasion of Russia and the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.
Though war had come to Europe as early as 1939, when Germany invaded Poland, after 1941 the war became a
truly global conflict of unprecedented extent, ferocity, and destructiveness. As late as 1943 it still appeared that the
Axis powers might win the war. But, by the end of the 1945, the bombed-out ruins of Germany and Japan were
occupied by the Allies, who were preparing to put the surviving Axis leaders and generals on trial for war crimes.
This tutorial will concentrate on a number of important questions and issues which arise from a study of World
War II. What were the origins of this central event of the twentieth century? How and why did the war begin? Why
did the war take the course it did? What were the most crucial or decisive episodes or events? How did the Allies
win? Why did the Axis lose? Could the outcome have been different?
Many of the topics examined will also have to deal with important questions of human responsibility and with the
moral or ethical dimensions of the war. Why did France, Britain, and the Soviet Union not stop Hitler earlier? Who
was to blame for the fall of France and the Pearl Harbor fiasco? Why did the Allies adopt a policy of extensive
firebombing of civilian targets? How could the Holocaust have happened? Could it have been stopped? Did the
Atomic bomb have to be dropped? Were the war crime trials justified?
By the end of the tutorial, students will have become thoroughly familiar with the general course the war followed
as well as acquiring in-depth knowledge of the most decisive and important aspects of the conflict. Students will
also have grappled with the task of systematically assessing what combinations of material and human factors can
best explain the outcomes of the major turning points of the war. Students will also have dealt with the problem of
assessing the moral and ethical responsibility of those persons, organizations, and institutions involved in the war.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: each student will write and present orally an essay of approximately seven double-
spaced pages every other week on a topic assigned by the instructor. Students not presenting an essay have the
responsibility of critiquing the work of their colleague. The tutorial will culminate in a final written exercise.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Open to all.

HIST 489T(F) The Rise and Fall of the Ottomans and the Emergence of Modern Turkey (W)
This tutorial is designed to provide an in-depth look at some of the major topics in Turkish history and historiogra-
phy, including the origins of the Ottomans; the factors which drove and enabled their almost uninterrupted growth
from a small Anatolian principality to empire; the features of Ottoman government and society which under-
pinned the empire's longevity; the question of how to define the concept of Ottoman "decline" and to identify the
steps by which "the Terror of the World" of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries became "the Sick Man of
Europe" in the nineteenth; the nature and effectiveness of the Ottomans' attempts, often under pressure from the
West, to reform themselves; the emergence of Greece and modern states in the Balkans; and the collapse of the
empire just after the First World War. Attention will also be paid to the background to the emergence of the modern
nation state of the Republic of Turkey and its early years under Mustafa Kemal Ataturk.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: 6- to 7-page essay every other week and in-class oral critique every other week

HIST 491T(S) Political Islam: Past, Present, Future (D) (W)
Why have Islamist movements become so powerful in the last 30 years? What are their real political goals? Is
political Islam a rejection of modernity, a reaction to Western culture, or an ideology aimed at specific political
objectives? Does the rise of political Islam herald an inevitable "clash of civilizations" with the West, or can Islam
and the West peacefully co-exist? Questions such as these have become increasingly urgent since September 11.
This course will examine the emergence, development, and substantive content of Islamist political movements in
the twentieth century. The tutorial focuses upon the emergence of Islamist movements within distinctive political,
economic, social and cultural conditions in the Middle East. It will juxtapose analytical readings on specific states
or aspects of the Islamic trend with the writings of Islamists and other primary sources. We will look both at Islam-
ist movements active in single states, the wider phenomenon of transnational Islamist politics, and the theoretical
and philosophical issues raised by the rise of Islamist movements, to consider both similarities and diversity in
Islamic politics. The object of the course is to understand Islamist movements on their own terms, and to be able to
make informed judgments about the future of international politics. Because of its comparative approach and its
concerns with power and privilege this course is part of the Exploring Diversity Initiative.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: 5- to 7-page essays or 2-page critiques due each week and a final report (3-4
pages) at the end of the semester.

HIST 492T(S) Revolutionary Thought in Latin America (W) (D)
Throughout Latin America revolution has been a focus of political and social thought --as well as political orga-
nizing and armed initiatives --since the late eighteenth century and continues to be so, albeit in changed form,
today. This course will examine the trajectory of various types of revolutionary theory in Latin America, from the
anti-colonial and anti--white thought behind massive Andean uprisings in the 1780s to efforts to win national
sovereignty and to construct socialist or other revolutionary states in modern Mexico, Guatemala, Cuba, and Nica-
ragua, and, more recently, to put more racially-, ethnically-, and gender-oriented notions of social justice into
place. We will work to measure the impact of revolutionary thought as well as to tease out the internal tensions in
the utopian ideals that revolutionaries have implicitly or explicitly pursued. We will also weigh the impact of more
strictly intellectual currents and of geopolitical concerns on the evolution of Latin American ideas of revolution.
This course will fulfill the requirements of the Exploring Diversity Initiative by comparing and analyzing diver-
gent theorizations of history and society, as well as the contexts in which such theories emerged and to which we
might or might not choose to apply them. A central aim of the course will be to compare the formation of revolu-
tionary initiatives across national and chronological boundaries.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: students will meet with the instructor in pairs for an hour each week. Each student
will write and present a 5- to 7- page essay every other week on the readings assigned for that week. In alternate
weeks, students will be responsible for offering an oral critique of the work of their partner. Evaluation will be

This seminar is a colloquium for the writers of honors theses. Although each student's major work for the fall will
be the writing of a thesis in consultation with an individual advisor, students will gather for occasional meetings in
order to present and critique each other's proposals and drafts and to discuss common problems in research and the
design of a long analytical essay. Evaluation will be based on class participation and completed written work, and
will determine if a student will continue in the thesis program. For students proceeding to W31 and HIST 494,
performance in fall semester will figure into the thesis grade calculated at the end of the year. The quality of a
student's performance in the colloquium segment of History 493, as well as his or her performance in all aspects of

HISTORY OF SCIENCE
(Div. II & III, see course descriptions)
Chair, Professor DONALD deB. BEAVER
A major in the History of Science is not offered, but the occasional Contract Major in it or a related interdisci-
plinary field is possible. Courses in the History of Science are designed primarily to complement and strengthen
work in other major fields. Although any of the courses may be taken separately, studying related courses in other
departments will enhance their value, because by nature, History of Science is interdisciplinary.
The following will serve as examples: the 101 course is an introduction to science and technology studies, and
concentrates on key aspects of contemporary science and technology relevant to many issues of living in a techno-
logical society. Scientific Revolutions (HSCI 224) deals with the emergence of modern science in the 1600s and
1700s, and with subsequent revolutions in scientific thought; as such it complements courses related to modern
European history. History of Science 240 traces the influential role of science and invention in the shaping of
American culture, and complements offerings in American Studies and American History. HSCI 320, an histori-
cal overview of the ideas, practice, and organization of medicine, provides context for related coursework in His-
tory, Philosophy, and the Premed Program.
HSCI 101(S) Science, Technology, and Human Values (Same as Science and Technology Studies
101)
A study of the natures and roles of science and technology in today's society, and of the problems which technical
advances pose for human values. An introduction to science-technology studies. Topics include: scientific creativ-
ity, the Two Cultures, the norms and values of science, the Manhattan Project and Big Science, the ethics and
social responsibility of science, appropriate technology, technology assessment, and various problems which
spring from dependencies engendered by living in a technological society, e.g., computers and privacy, automa-
tion and dehumanization, biomedical engineering.
Format: seminar. Requirements: two or three short exercises, two papers (3-5 pages and 5-7 pages), and two hour
exams.

HSCI 224(S) Scientific Revolutions: 1543-1927 (Same as History 294)
How much does science create the sensibilities and values of the modern world? How much, if any, technical
detail is it necessary to know in order to understand the difference between propaganda and fact? This course
investigates four major changes of world view, associated with Copernicus (1543); Newton (1687); Darwin
(1859); and Planck (1900) and Einstein (1905). It also treats briefly the emergence of modern cosmogony, geolo-
gy, and chemistry as additional reorganizations of belief about our origins, our past, and our material structure. We
first acquire a basic familiarity with the scientific use and meaning of the new paradigms, as they emerged in
historical context. We then ask how those ideas fit together to form a new framework, and ask what their trans-
scientific legacy has been, that is, how they have affected ideas and values in other sciences, other fields or
thought, and in society. Knowledge of high-school algebra is presupposed.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on five problem sets, four short papers (3-5 pages), and two

HSCI 240(F) Technology and Science in American Culture (Same as History 295)
Although technologically dependent, the American colonies slowly built a network of native scientists and
inventors whose skills helped shape the United States' response to the Industrial Revolution. The interaction of
science, technology, and society in the nineteenth century did much to form American identity: the machine in the
garden, through the "American System of Manufactures" helped America rise to technological prominence; the
professionalization and specialization of science and engineering led to their becoming vital national resources.
Understanding these developments, as well as the heroic age of American invention (1865-1914), forms the focus
of this course: how science and technology have helped shape modern American life.
Format: seminar. Requirements: class discussion, six short reports (2-3 pages), and two hour exams.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15. Open to first-year students.
Satisfies one semester of the Division II requirement.

Advisory Committee: Professors: DARROW, JUST, ZIMMERBERG**. Associate Professor: CRUZ.
Assistant Professor: HAMMERSCHLAG.
This program is designed to facilitate and promote innovations in curricular offerings in relation both to inter-
disciplinary conceptual focus and experimental pedagogical form. It provides support for faculty and student ef-
forts to develop a curriculum that creatively responds to intellectual needs and modes of teaching/learning that
currently fall outside the conventional pattern.
EXPR 245(S) (Re)presenting Sex: Shakespeare on Page and Stage (Same as Theatre 245)
This experimental course approaches the question of how sex and sexual identity are portrayed in Shakespeare
from two different directions-close reading focused on the page and acting centered on the stage. These two criti-
cal modes-reading the text versus performing the script-are often treated in compartmentalized fashion as separate,
even incompatible activities. Our goal is to take up the challenge of bringing the two perspectives together within
the framework of a single, integrated course. The teaching method is to bridge the gap between the two modes not
by magically dissolving, but by actively engaging, the tensions between them. For example, no performance can
include all the possible interpretations; performance decisions raise questions about what alternatives have been
left out. Similarly, when all interpretive possibilities are held in imaginative suspension, the specifics of bodily
movement and face-to-face interaction whose meanings emerge when enacted are lost.
We propose to put the two orientations in a productive and innovative dialogue that enables students to experience
the tension from both sides, to articulate the opportunities and limits of each side, and to combine their respective
Interdisciplinary Studies

strengths.
The mix of assignments (papers and scene work) will vary depending on whether students designate themselves
as primarily "scholars" or "actors," but some overlap will be built in to ensure that "scholars" gain understanding
of acting and "actors" gain access to scholarship. All students will be expected to demonstrate versatility in tra-
versing the full spectrum from interpretation through reading to interpretation through performance.
The specific topic that will bring these theoretical issues into focus is the matter of sex and sexual identity, as
illuminated through the analysis of language, psychology, and theatrical embodiment. Six plays will be studied in
depth: The Merchant of Venice, Twelfth Night, Othello, King Lear, Antony and Cleopatra, and The Winter's Tale.
Format: lecture/discussion,with additional periods set aside for scene presentation. Evaluation will be based on
several short papers, plus a final exam. All students will take the final: "scholar" students will have rigorous expec-
tations in the writing of papers; "actor" students will have intensive (graded) performance expectations.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15-20 (expected: 15). Preference if over-enrolled: permission of instructors.
Students wishing to enroll as Acting Students should consult with instructors.
Satisfies one semester of the Division I requirement.

EXPR 309(F) Exploring Creativity (Same as ArtS 309, Mathematics 309, Music 309 and

This course centers on the creative process involved in generating original ideas, theories, and artistic works. Here,
in three-week blocks, we will explore intensively the creativity involved in studio art, philosophy, music, and
mathematics by attempting to produce original works in each of these areas of study. Our focus will be more on the
creative process rather than the final products. Students will be encouraged to take risks, experiment, push their
imaginations beyond their limits, and explore consequences of failed attempts. Questions with which we will
struggle include: What constitutes art, music, philosophy, and mathematics? How can we judge the quality and
aesthetics within these areas? What are the similarities and differences in the act of creating within these seemingly
disparate contexts? Can we become more creative by intent?
Format: Primarily student led discussions and hands-on "studio" work. Evaluation will be based on presentations,
participation, short papers, and projects.
Prerequisites: permission of the instructor. As this course is designed to be an exploration into unfamiliar intellec-
tual worlds, students with expertise in one or perhaps two of the areas (art, music, philosophy, and mathematics)
are especially encouraged to participate. Enrollment limit: 12 (expected: 12). Preference will be given to juniors
and senior majors of at least one of these areas.
Satisfies one semester of the Division I, II or III requirement. Each student may choose the division for which he or
she wishes credit. Does not count toward the art major.

INTR 150(S) Dimensions of Public Health
Public health is concerned with protecting and improving health at the level of a community or population. Al-
though individual behavior is an essential element of public health, collective, rather than individual, outcomes are
the focus of public health study. The field of public health relies on contributions from multiple disciplines, includ-
ing economics, philosophy, biology, sociology and political science, among others. In this course we will survey
the field of public health, introducing students to core concepts and methods that highlight the interrelationship of
individual and social choice with environmental and biological factors in producing health outcomes at the popu-
lation level. We will develop these concepts and methods within the context of signal cases and public health
crises, both historical and contemporary, including, for example, the Chicago cholera epidemic, malaria control/
eradication efforts, HIV, and women's reproductive health. Throughout our study of these cases, we will focus on
key questions at the heart of public health. For example, what is effective public health policy and how can we
measure its effectiveness? How do we reconcile competing moral and economic claims in shaping such policy?
How do our fundamental beliefs and understanding of mortality determine our approach to public health deci-
sions? How are these decisions made?
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based upon three 5-page papers, one 10-page paper, and the quality
of contributions to class discussion.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 25 (expected: 20). Preference given to first-year students and sophomores.

INTR 230(F) Prelude to Revolt: The Life and Work of Martha Graham
The revolutionary dance work of Martha Graham (1894-1991) has been compared to the artistic innovations of
Picasso and the musical genius of Stravinsky. The study of Graham's development within the American cultural
climate over the last decade, including her influence on the dancers and actors she trained, and her collaborations
with musicians and artists, informs our understanding of the modern performance culture of today.
This course will be comprised of two elements: 1) Historic Evolution: An overview of modern dance from its
roots in 1900 to the present, we will focus on the development of Graham's dance theory from her days with
Denishawn to her later years, while also studying the work of her contemporaries, and her influence on artists who
studied with her. 2) Dance Technique: an intensive introduction to major principles of the Graham Technique as a
tool for the development of the performer in any medium. Required reading: Time and the Dancing Image by
Deborah Jowitt (1988); Spaces of the Mind, Robert Tracy (2004); Martha: The Life and Work of Martha Graham
by Agnes de Mille (1991). Videos on reserve.
Format: studio and seminar. Evaluation for the course will be based on completion and quality of each of the re-
quirements, including term paper, performance critique paper, weekly journal, practicum exam, discussion of
reading and video assignments, and active participation in studio exercises.
Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 15). Preference given to students with some experience with dance/theatre.

INTR 252(F) The Human Image: Photographing People and Their Stories (Same as ArtS 252)
The single most photographed subject is the human form. The motivations and strategies for imaging faces and
bodies, both individual and aggregate, are as varied as the subjects themselves. In this course, we will examine
some of the many approaches used to photograph people. We'll start by exploring self-portraiture, and progress to
photographing others--both familiars and strangers, in the studio and in less controlled environments. We'll end
with a consideration of "documentary" photography and other visual narratives. In each case, we'll examine our
reasons for making an image, and the methods available for achieving these goals. Thus, the class will have a
significant technical component, dealing with the creative use of camera controls, the properties and uses of light,
and digital capture and processing. We will also examine the conceptual and scientific bases for how we perceive
and evaluate images. Students will initially use school-supplied digital cameras, and later have the option of using
film. Lab fee: $100-150.
Format: Studio/lecture. Requirements: Students will be expected a) to photograph extensively outside of sched-
uled class hours b) to participate in class discussion and in both oral and written critique, c) to present one paper,
and d) to exhibit their work at the end of the semester.
Prerequisites: Students from all disciplines are welcome. Previous photography experience is desirable, but not
essential. Students are strongly encouraged to contact the instructor if they have questions about course require-
ments. Enrollment limit: 12 (expected: 12). Preference to upper class students.

INTERNATIONAL STUDIES
(Div. II)
Chair, Professor WILLIAM R. DARROW
Advisory Committee: Professors: D. GOLLIN, CAPRIO, CASSIDAY, CRANE, DARROW, KUBLER,
MAHON, MUTONGI, A. V. SWAMY. Associate Professors: BANTA, BERNHARDSSON. Visiting
Professor: KISAMBA-MUGERWA.
In this era of cultural, technological and economic globalization and also of pressing international crises includ-
ing environmental degradation, poverty and underdevelopment, terrorism and pandemics, knowledge of the world
beyond the United States is an essential part of the liberal education that is the goal of the Williams experience.
Both within and outside the classroom the College provides a rich array of opportunities to pursue that goal. The
International Studies Program is designed to increase awareness of those opportunities and to provide a centraliz-
ing mechanism to encourage gaining such knowledge with perspectives that are cross disciplinary and compara-
tive.
The program administers a number of tracks that provide students with the opportunity to pursue study of one
area of the world or theme as a way of complementing the work they have done in their majors. Students will be
expected to take courses in at least two departments to fulfill the requirements of a track. In addition to completing
International Studies 101, they will be expected to do five courses in a track including an approved senior exercise.
Students may not count a course toward more than one track in the program. They may pursue two tracks but will
need to meet the course requirements for each track with a full complement of courses.
TRACKS
Tracks are of two kinds. The first type focuses either on a particular region of the world or a contact zone where
several cultural traditions encounter each other. The second type is organized thematically and will explore a cul-
tural, political, economic or technological issue globally. Each track will be administered by faculty teaching in
that track in consultation with the steering committee. Each track may set an additional requirement of a level of
language competency for its concentrators. Each track may also require one of the elective courses to be compara-
tive, i.e. course that might not cover material directly dealing with their area, but would enrich the student's experi-
ence with tools for comparative inquiry. At present the program consists of the following tracks:
Area Tracks Thematic Tracks
African Studies Borders, Exile and Diaspora Studies
East Asian Studies Economic Development Studies
Latin American Studies Global Health
Middle Eastern Studies
Russian and Eurasian Studies
South and Southeast Asia Studies
To complete a track, students must take a section of International Studies 101, complete five additional ap-
proved courses within the track, attend the weekly International Studies colloquium and complete a senior exer-
cise. Credit for work done on study abroad will likely provide one or more of the electives for many concentrators.
International Studies 101
All students wishing to pursue the program should take a section of International Studies 101 early in their
careers. These courses will usually be team taught. The topics and regions covered will vary and be selective, but
all will be designed to place cultural, political, economic and technological issues in conversation with one another
to illustrate the necessity of having a broad range of disciplinary tools available to pursue an individual track. On
occasion students may petition to substitute a course equivalent in scope to International Studies 101 to
meet this requirement.
Study Abroad and Internships
Study abroad and/or overseas internships are an essential component of International Studies. The program in
coordination with the Study Abroad Advisor and the Office of Career Counseling will advise students on opportu-
nities in these areas. One or more courses completed on an approved study abroad program can be counted toward
the five elective courses requirement.
Colloquium
Concentrators will be expected to attend fifteen sessions of the International Studies colloquia in their senior
year, and are urged to do so throughout their careers at Williams. We hope that it will become a regular event for all
concentrators. The colloquium meets weekly at the Center for Foreign Languages and Cultures and is designed to
feature faculty, students, CDE fellows and outside speakers addressing issues of wide interest to those in Interna-
tional Studies.
Senior Exercise
All concentrators must also complete a senior exercise. This will be a substantial piece of writing (20-25 pages)
that would allow a student to draw together both their disciplinary skills and expertise in a particular area. It might
be work done either in the context of a senior capstone course in a relevant department or in the context of a shared
seminar sponsored by the International Studies program. In both cases it would culminate in a public presentation
by each concentrator of his/her work in class or in the context of the International Studies Colloquium.
Honors
A candidate for honors in International Studies must maintain at least a B+ average in the concentration and be
admitted to candidacy by the program faculty. An honors candidate must complete her/his project in a semester
International Studies
­ 212 ­
(and Winter Study). An honors candidate will prepare a forty page thesis or its equivalent while enrolled in the
senior thesis course, 491 or 492 (and Winter Study). This course will be in addition to the courses required to fulfill
the concentration.
A student wishing to become a candidate for honors in International Studies should secure a faculty sponsor
and inform the program chair in writing before spring registration of her/his junior year.

INST 101(F) Asia and the World (Same as Asian Studies 201 and Political Science 100)
Asia looms large in contemporary world politics: Japan is gradually assuming an expanded regional national secu-
rity role; The People's Republic of China is emerging as a multifaceted Great Power; India is challenged by rising
ethno-nationalism. This course will explore both the historical background and current dynamics of political and
economic issues in these three countries, drawing on themes of imperialism, nationalism, and globalization. It is an
introductory class and, therefore, no prior coursework in political science or Asian studies is necessary.
Format: predominately lecture. Requirements: two short papers and a final exam.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 60 (expected: 60).

INST 101(S) The Greater Game? Central Asia and its Neighbors Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow
(Same as History 216 and Religion 236)
The collapse of the Soviet Union, the recognition of untapped mineral wealth, and Islamic resurgence have all led
to an increased focus on Central Asia and its neighbors, Russia, China, the Middle East. This course will be an
introduction to the Caucasus, the Central Asian Republics, Xinjiang and Mongolia and the interests of their neigh-
bors, including now the United States in those areas. This will be a lecture course that will introduce the salient
themes and issues that are necessary for understanding these areas. The course will inevitably be deeply compara-
tive focusing on themes of "the clash of civilizations," the construction of national identities, notions of ethnicity
and the treatment of ethnic minorities, resurgent religious movements, and the relation of state and civil society.
This course will also function as an introduction to doing social scientific research on these areas and special atten-
tion will be devoted to the preparation of a research paper.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: weekly responses, three short essays (4-6 pages), and one research pa-
per (12-15 pages).
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 30 (expected: 15). Preference given to first-year students and sophomores.
Hour: 1:10-2:25 MR DARROW
INST 201(S) Agriculture and Development Strategy (Same as Economics 212, Environmental
Studies 212 and Economics 512)
This course examines the role of agriculture in the development process, and the effects of government policy on
the agricultural sector. We will focus on smallholder agriculture in Africa, and we will particularly examine the
role of agricultural development in poverty alleviation and food security. Among other topics to be considered will
be land tenure arrangements and their impact on land, forest, and water management; the role of commercializa-
tion; and the impacts of trade and globalization.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: multiple 5- to 8-page papers, plus occasional assignments based on
readings. One long paper may be substituted for the short paper.
Prerequisites: This class will use the language of economics, but there is no formal prerequisite. Enrollment limit:
19 (expected: 12-14). Preference given to International Studies concentrators.

another context. This will be a shared team taught research seminar that will culminate in the completion of a final
research paper (20-25 pages). The seminar will meet jointly for the first four weeks to explore issues in the field of
International Studies. This will be followed by four weeks of individual research developed in consultation with
appropriate faculty followed in the last four weeks by the presentation of that research.
Satisfies one semester of Division II requirement.

JEWISH STUDIES (Div. II)
Chair, Professor STEVEN GERRARD
Advisory Committee: Professor: GERRARD. Associate Professor: S. FOX*. Assistant Professors: DE-
KEL*, GARBARINI**, HAMMERSCHLAG.
THE PROGRAM IN JEWISH STUDIES
Jewish Studies is an interdisciplinary field that encompasses the texts, history, languages, philosophy, and cul-
ture of Jews and Judaism as they have changed over three millennia and throughout the world. The program offers
courses in multiple disciplines including but not limited to Religion, Classics, History, Philosophy, Anthropology,
Sociology, and Comparative Literature. Across these disciplines, the program examines topics such as religious
belief and practice, textual interpretation, the development of Zionism, life in the Diaspora, the historicization and
memorialization of the Holocaust, and historical, political and philosophical questions surrounding Jewish identi-
ty. Investigating the foundations and development of these various Jewish topics, as well as their interaction with
and influence on other traditions, provides an opportunity to explore the continuities and diversity of Jewish life
and thought. Students will gain exposure to a common body of knowledge and scholarly approaches through
which to engage in their own rich and varied intellectual explorations of Jewish and related topics.
CONCENTRATION IN JEWISH STUDIES
The concentration in Jewish Studies requires five courses with at least two different prefixes: one gateway
course, two core courses, one elective, and one capstone course.

Overseas Studies
Studying in Israel is highly recommended for students interested in Jewish Studies. Many students have spent a
semester or year at Hebrew University. With the approval of the Jewish Studies program chair, students may count
a study-abroad program towards on core requirement.
Funding
The Bronfman Fund for Judaic Studies was established in 1980 by Edgar M. Bronfman '50, Samuel Bronfman
II '75, and Matthew Bronfman '80. The Bronfman Fund provides opportunities for the Williams community to
learn about Jewish history and culture, both within the College's formal curriculum and through the planning of
major events on Jewish themes.
The Morris Wiener and Stephen R. Wiener '56 Fund for Jewish Studies was established in 1997 through the
estate of Stephen R. Wiener '56. The Wiener gifts have provided an endowment to support a faculty position in
modern Jewish thought, and are used to underwrite an annual lecture, forum or event relevant to contemporary
Jewish life.

Latina/o Studies is an interdisciplinary and comparative field of study that explores the histories and experi-
ences of Latinas and Latinos in the United States. Latinas and Latinos include peoples who come from or whose
ancestors come from Latin America and the Spanish-speaking Caribbean. The program seeks to cover the widest
range of experiences, encompassing Mexican-Americans, Puerto Ricans, Cubans, and Dominicans, as well as
more recent migrations from a wide variety of Central and South American countries. Courses, most of which use
a comparative approach, seek to provide students with the tools to continue their work in areas of their particular
interest. Focusing on a diverse group with a long history in the United States, which is also one of the fastest grow-
ing populations in the contemporary era, provides an opportunity to explore complex dynamics globally and with-
in the context of the United States. The program examines topics such as the political and economic causes of
migration, the impact of globalization, economic incorporation, racialization, the formation and reformulations of
identities and communities, the uses of urban spaces, inter-ethnic relations, artistic expression, aesthetics, and visu-
al and popular culture.

THE CONCENTRATION
The concentration in Latina/o Studies requires five courses. Students are required to take the introductory
course (LATS 105), one 400-level Latina/o Studies seminar, and three electives. Two electives must be core elec-
tives, and one elective can be a related course in Comparative Race and Ethnic Studies or in Countries of Origin
and Transnationalism. The three electives must include two different areas of study, and at least one elective must
be at the 300 or 400 level. Additional courses may be approved by the Chair. Students, especially those consider-
ing graduate work or professional careers in the field, are encouraged to enroll in Spanish language courses at
Williams.

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS
Honors in Latina/o Studies may be granted to concentrators after an approved candidate completes an honors
project, delivers a public presentation of the work, and is awarded an honors grade by her/his advisor and two other
faculty readers. In consultation with the advisor and the chair, faculty readers may be from outside the Latina/o
Studies Program.
The honors project will be completed over one semester plus winter study. It may consist of a conventional
research thesis of 40-70 pages or of other forms of presentation (e.g., video, art, theater). It may also combine a
shorter research thesis with another medium.
To be accepted as a candidate for honors in Latina/o Studies, a student must meet these criteria:
1) Submit and earn approval of a project proposal in April of the junior year. The proposal should be no lon-
ger than 5 pages and should lay out the project's aim and methodology, identify the student's advisor for
the work, and include evidence of competence in the necessary media for projects that include non-thesis
forms.
2) Achieve a grade point average of at least 3.33 in LATS courses at the time of application.
Students admitted to the honors program must submit a 5-8 page revised proposal, with an annotated bibliogra-
phy, by the second week of classes in the fall semester of her/his senior year. They should register either for LATS
493 in the fall semester and LATS 031 in Winter Study, or for LATS 031 in Winter Study and LATS 494 in the
spring semester. These courses will be in addition to the 5 courses that make up the regular concentration.
STUDY ABROAD
Study abroad and other off-campus programs offer excellent opportunities for students to build on, and expand,
the intellectual interests they develop as part of the Latina/o Studies concentration. Through their connections to
various institutions in the U.S. and other nations, Latina/o Studies faculty can help place students in U.S. border-
lands programs as well as programs in Mexico, Cuba, and other "countries of origin." Any student seeking to
include courses as part of a concentration in Latina/o Studies should feel free to contact the Program chair or other
faculty. A maximum of 1 course taken away from Williams can count (as an elective) toward the completion of the
concentration.
LATS 105(F) Latina/o Identities: Constructions, Contestations, and Expressions
What, or who, is a Hispanic or Latina/o? At present, individuals living in the United States who are classified as
such number approximately 40 million, constituting the country's largest "minority" group. In this course, we will
study the interdisciplinary field that has emerged in response to this growing population, as we focus on the com-
plex nature of "identity." Viewing identities as historically and socially constructed, we begin with a brief assess-
ment of how racial, ethnic, class, and gendered identities take shape in the Hispanic Caribbean and Latin America.
We then examine the impact of (im)migration and the rearticulation of identities in the United States, as we
compare each group's unique history, settlement patterns, and transnational activity. Identity is also a contested
terrain. As immigrants and migrants arrive, the United States' policymakers, the media, and others seek to define
the "newcomers" along with long-term Latina/o citizens. At the same time, Latinas/os rearticulate, live, assert, and
express their own sense of identity. In this light, we conclude the course with an exploration of these diverse ex-
pressions as they relate to questions of class, race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, and national origins.
Format: discussion. Evaluation to be based on student participation and several short papers (1-5 pages) through-
out the semester.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 25 (expected: 20-25). Preference given to Latina/o Studies concentrators.

LATS 220(F) Introduction to Urban Studies: Shaping and Living the City (Same as American

Generally, cities have been described either as vibrant commercial and cultural centers or as violent and decaying
urban slums. In an effort to begin to think more critically about cities, this course introduces important topics in the
interdisciplinary field of Urban Studies. Specifically, we will discuss concepts and theories used to examine the
peoples and structures that make up cities: In what ways do socio-cultural, economic, and political factors affect
urban life and development? How are cities planned and used by various stakeholders (politicians, developers,
businesses, and residents)? How do people make meaning of the places they inhabit? We will pay particular atten-
tion to the roles of race, ethnicity, class, and gender in understanding and interpreting urban communities. Texts

LATS 230(F) Approaching Performance Studies (Same as Theatre 230 and Women and Gender

Theatre, music, dance, performance art, community activism, public gatherings, sports, eating, and rituals all fall
under the rubric of "performance." Performance studies is an interdisciplinary field that explores these types of
live, embodied activities as cultural acts and as theoretical paradigms. This course is an introduction to perfor-
mance studies and to its theoretical bases in anthropology, dramatic theory, poststructuralism, psychoanalytic
theory, folklore, cultural studies, philosophy, feminist theory, and queer theory. We will devote particular attention
to performances that reflect the complexity and diversity of race and ethnicity in the United States. In addition to
reading and discussing theory, we will study local live and recorded performances. This course combines theory
and practice in order to understand performance as a critical space. On the practical level, students are expected to
attend three workshops with Professor Omar Sangare to experiment with their body, voice, and the stage. These
workshops will provide the foundation for students' final performance. This course also serves as the introduction
course for the Performance Studies Program.
Format: discussion. Requirements: several short writing assignments, attendance at live performances and work-
shops, final essay and final performance.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15 (expected: 10). Preference to Latina/o Studies concentrators, and to Art and

This course is dedicated to the historical and practical study of four central forms of popular AfroLatina/o dance:
Capoeira, a Brazilian martial art; Rumba, a Cuban popular dance and music event; Bomba, a traditional Puerto
Rican dance; and Comparsa, a choreographed music ensemble that participates in carnivals. For each genre, stu-
dents will do historical and ethnographic readings, and write a short essay. These will serve as the basis for dance
workshops, which will be lead by guest dancers and choreographers. We will engage with dance practice as a site
of knowledge transmitted via movement, gesture, dance, and music. The goal of this course is for students to learn
and to integrate the history of each genre via embodiment; in other words, to understand the history of the body's
motion and gesture. The course includes a fieldtrip(s) to New York City and the learning of basic rhythms. The
course culminates in a public Carnival, drawing on students' final research on Cuban, Puerto Rican and Domini-
can comparsa traditions.
Format: discussion, workshops, field trip. Evaluation will be based on class participation and workshop atten-
dance, 3 short essays, and the final choreography and short essay on comparsa characters.

centrators, Performance Studies students, and Theatre majors.

This course explores contemporary (1970's to the present) Latin American theatre and performance within,
against, and after contexts of State terror and neo-colonialism. We analyze how Latin American playwrights, the-
ater collectives, solo performance artists and social actors use theater and performance as oppositional tools. For
instance, how do theater collectives intervene in public space? How do political actors construct alternative civil
societies? How does electronic theater propose more egalitarian political imaginaries? We will study the perfor-
mance of politics and the politics of performance, the convergence of actors with spectators, and the blurring of
borders between the public and the private spheres.

LATS 331(F) Sound and Movement in the Afro-Latin Diaspora (Same as Africana Studies 331,
American Studies 331, Theatre 331, and Women and Gender Studies 331)
This course examines various Afro-descendant cultures through music and dance. We focus on Cuba, Brazil,
Puerto Rico and the United States. Through the theoretical and practical study of commercial and grassroots music
and dance production, we unpack how performance may re-articulate and challenge ascribed race and gender
roles. The first part of the semester establishes fundamental methodological and theoretical frameworks, such as
Taylor's epistemology and ontology of performance, Ortiz's transculturation, and Bahktin's carnivalesque inver-
sion. These theories will help us understand that while music and dance are site specific practices, they also serve
historically as representational terrains that narrate the Nation and its races. Through dance workshops, New York
City fieldtrips, and ethnographic experience, we will explore how music and dance contest such ideological for-
mulations. The second part of the semester concentrates on the United States and on how these expressive practic-
es function within the diaspora. For instance, how does rumba or salsa simultaneously reinforce and/or decon-
struct U.S. Latina/o identity in relationship to class, race, gender, and a shared history of colonization and neo-
colonialism? Can Hip-Hop serve as a theoretical ground to question the stability of the Nation, gender, race and
sexuality?
Format: discussion. Requirements: two oral presentations, one short essay, one midterm paper, one final paper,
two fieldtrips to New York City, and participation in a dance workshop. Enrollment limit: 12 (expected: 10).
Hour: 11:20-12:35 TR JOTTAR
LATS 332(S) Latinos and Education: The Politics of Schooling, Language, and Latino Studies
(Same as American Studies 332) (W) (D)
Schools have often become the focal point for debates over the relationship between cultural identity, intellectual
abilities, and the production of knowledge. What should be taught, who should be taught, and how they should be
taught frame the politics of schooling. Language has often taken center stage in these debates. This course ex-
amines the effects of educational policies and practices on the development of Latina/o students and communities.
We will also consider how these students and communities have resourcefully carved out spaces and made de-
mands to meet their educational needs. Topics include school desegregation, bilingual education, student walk-
outs and sit-ins, as well as the origins and advancement of Chicano Studies, Puerto Rican Studies, and more re-
cently Latino Studies programs on college campuses. Students will critically engage the major themes of the
course in two essays as they also engage each other in the form of peer-reviews and other in-class writing work-
shop exercises. This course explores the experiences and expressions of racially and culturally diverse Latinas and
Latinos, focusing on the myriad ways in which they confront, negotiate, and at times challenge dominant U.S.
hierarchies of race, culture, gender and class.
Format: discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, writing workshop participation (and related
assignments), group presentations, and two essays (12-15 pages).
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 12). Preference given to Latina/o Studies concentrators.

LATS 405(S) Home and Belonging: Comparative Explorations of Displacements, Relocations,
and Place-Making (Same as American Studies 405) (W) (D)
The metaphor of "home" and idea of "belonging" bring insight to theories and investigations centered on commu-
nity building and identity formation within and across national borders. These constructions give us an indication
of what people value, what is worth fighting for, as well as what is considered expendable. Our objective in this
course is to interrogate constructions of home and belonging by studying how individuals, communities, and na-
tions are transformed by experiences of dislocation, migration, and renewed place-making. What are the ways a
sense of belonging shapes these identities and the investments made in these formations? Working with ethnogra-
phy, history, memoir, literature, critical essays, and documentary film, we will consider the personal and political
uses and meanings of memory, nostalgia, and imagination in "rooting" migrating subjects in place and time.
Among the many case studies we will examine are the politics of homeland among Cuban-Americans, Native
American and West Indian festive forms, and place-claiming and racial sincerity among African Americans. This
course explores the experiences and expressions of racialized populations in the United States, focusing on the
myriad ways in which they confront, negotiate, and at times challenge dominant U.S. hierarchies of race, culture,
gender and class.

Leadership Studies focuses on the universal phenomenon of leadership in human groups. Leadership Studies
asks what leadership means within a wide variety of social contexts-whether in a family, a team, a theatre compa-
ny, a philanthropy, a university, a multinational corporation, or a nation state waging war. It seeks to understand the
dynamics of the relationships between leaders and followers. It studies authority, power, and influence. It seeks to
grasp the bases of legitimacy that leaders claim, and followers grant, in all of these relationships.
Through a wide range of courses in the social sciences and the humanities, a number of questions are addressed
through the curriculum. How have men and women defined leadership and what are the bases of leaders' legiti-
Leadership Studies
­ 223 ­
macy in different historical contexts? How do leaders in different contexts emerge? Through tradition, charisma,
or legal sanction? How do different types of leaders exercise and maintain their domination? What are the distinc-
tive habits of mind of leaders in different historical contexts? What are the moral dilemmas that leaders in different
contexts face? What are the typical challenges to established leadership in different historical contexts? How does
one analyze the experiences of leaders in widely disparate contexts to generate systematic comparative under-
standings of why history judges some leaders great and others failures. How and why do these evaluations about
the efficacy of leaders shift over time?
To meet the requirements of the concentration, students must complete one of the two sequences outlined be-
low (6 courses total).

LEAD 125(F) Power, Leadership and Legitimacy: An Introduction to Leadership Studies (Same
as Political Science 125)
Leadership has long been a central concept in the study of politics. Philosophers from Plato to Machiavelli have
struggled with the question of what qualities and methods are necessary for effective leadership. Social scientists
throughout the twentieth century have struggled to refine and advance hypotheses about leadership in the areas of
economics, psychology, and sociology. Nevertheless, despite all of this impressive intellectual effort, the study of
leadership remains a contested field of study precisely because universal answers to the major questions in leader-
ship studies have proven to be elusive. This course is designed to introduce students to many of the central issues

LEAD 295(F) Leadership and Management
What are the differences between effective leaders and effective managers of complex organizations, or are they

namics or interdependencies between these elements? Finally, are there important distinctions between the factors
required for success by leaders/managers in different domains, in different cultures, or of different genders? In this
course, we will wrestle with these questions by examining both successful and unsuccessful leadership and man-
agement of complex organizations in a number of domains, potentially including business, non-profit, higher
education, government agencies, and others. Our primary means of doing so will be through case studies, supple-
mented by readings from several noted leadership and management thinkers.
Format: seminar. Course requirements will include active class participation, several brief (1 page or less) re-
sponse papers, a short midterm paper, and a longer final paper, which develops and analyzes a case of the student's

LEGAL STUDIES (Div. II)
Chair, Professor LAWRENCE KAPLAN
Advisory Committee: Professors: JACKALL, JUST, KAPLAN, KASSIN**, NOLAN, SHANKS*. As-
sistant Professor: SINIAWER. Visiting Assistant Professor: A. HIRSCH§§.
Legal Studies is an interdisciplinary program designed to give students a background and frameworks for un-
derstanding the law as a means of regulating human behavior and resolving disputes among individuals, groups,
and governments. Emanating from a liberal arts tradition, and not specifically aimed at preparing students for law
school, this program provides the tools needed to think and argue critically about how laws work, how they
evolved in the course of history and in different parts of the world, how they are enforced, and how they affect our
everyday lives.
The courses in this program address a wide range of subjects, including the philosophical, moral, historical,
social, and political underpinnings of law; the U.S. Constitution; law enforcement and other aspects of criminal
justice; methods of scientific proof; psychological influences on evidence, trials, and decision-making; cultural
perspectives and non-western legal traditions; and the use of law to regulate environmental policy. Courses are
taught by faculty in the Sciences, Social Sciences, and Humanities, whose work centers on legal processes, and by
visiting professors from various law schools.
THE CONCENTRATION
The concentration in legal studies consists of six courses, including an interdisciplinary introductory course,
four electives taken from at least two departments, and a senior seminar on a contemporary topic in the law. Elec-
tives may vary from year to year according to course offerings. In addition, the program offers local, alumni, and
professional contacts for summer and WSP internships in a wide range of government and private law-related
settings.
STUDY ABROAD
Students who choose to study abroad should consult with the Program Chair to insure that they can complete
the requirements. Studying abroad may provide exciting opportunities to learn about legal traditions and systems
other than those of the United States. Students should check with the Chair to be sure that courses taken abroad
will be counted toward completion of the Program.
REQUIRED COURSES
LGST 101(S) Processes of Adjudication
How are disputes resolved within social systems? Focusing on this question, this team-taught interdisciplinary
course presents different perspectives on trials and other methods of adjudicating crimes, settling matters of public
policy, and resolving civil disputes among individuals, groups, governments, and organizations. Topics to be ad-
dressed include: the historical and Constitutional basis for the operation of the American court system and for
juries and jury trials; methods of gathering and evaluating evidence; the role of forensic science and technology;
alternative means of adjudication as seen in the function of administrative agencies; adjudication of disputes
across international boundaries; adversarial, inquisitorial, and consensus-building approaches to dispute resolution
used in past and non-western cultures.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on two exams, a 10- to 15-page paper, and class participation.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 40 (expected: 40). Preference to first-years and sophomores who are consid-
ering a concentration in Legal Studies.
This is an interdisciplinary course to be team-taught by faculty, from a variety of departments.
Hour: 8:30-9:45 TR HIRSCH
LGST 401(S) Senior Seminar: The Legal Palette
The great jurist Oliver Wendell Holmes claimed that people trained in law rarely appreciate art: works of genius
would elude lawyers and judges because "their very novelty would make them repulsive." As Holmes implies, in
crucial respects law and art are opposites. Most significantly, the legal system aims at stability and reinforcement
of social norms whereas at least some art seeks to destabilize and challenge prevailing norms. What happens when
these worlds collide? This course explores several legal battles involving art that raise profound questions. Are
judges and juries equipped to determine the purpose or value of art? Do artists need the protection of society or
does society need protection from artists? The most crucial question, from the standpoint of this course, concerns
the capacity of our legal system to strike an appropriate balance between preserving the social fabric and accom-
modating change. Does the inherent conservatism of the law inevitably impede the kind of free expression neces-
sary for a thriving democracy?
Format: seminar. Requirements: active class participation, several short papers, and a substantially longer final
paper.
Prerequisites: Legal Studies 101 and at least two Legal Studies electives, or permission of the instructor. Enroll-
ment limit: 25 (expected: 20-25). Preference will be given, in order of seniority, to students for whom this course
completes the Legal Studies concentration.

LINGUISTICS (Div. I)
Coordinator, Assistant Professor: NATHAN SANDERS
Assistant Professor: SANDERS. Mellon Post-Doctoral Fellow: HAUGEN.
Courses in linguistics enable students to explore language from a variety of perspectives: the internal workings
of language as a system of communication, the physical means by which speech is produced, the role of language
in society, the history of language groups and specific languages, and the applicability of scientific knowledge
about language to various human endeavors.
Linguistics offers neither a major nor a concentration, but its courses provide a solid grounding in formal lin-
guistics and complement study in several other disciplines: Anthropology, Philosophy, Computer Science,
Psychology, Cognitive Science, Sociology, English, Comparative Literature, and all the foreign languages.
Some departments and programs also count courses in linguistics towards credit for their majors or concentra-
tions. In particular, Anthropology majors can receive major credit for Linguistics 100, Asian Studies majors may
take linguistics courses to fulfill their three course qualification, German majors may receive major credit for a
linguistics course with the special permission of the department chair, and Cognitive Science concentrators can
take Linguistics 100 and 220 as electives.
Knowledge of foreign languages is helpful but not required for introductory linguistics courses.
LING 100(F) Introduction to Linguistics (Same as Anthropology 107)
This course provides a general introduction to the scientific study of language by means of systematic exploration
of the inherent similarities and surprising differences across human languages. Using actual data from real lan-
guages, students will learn the basic methodology, important results, and major theoretical debates from various
subfields of linguistics, including phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, language change, and
sociolinguistics. Additional topics may include sign languages, language acquisition, the politics of language, and
animal communication.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: participation in discussions, weekly homework, one or two midterm
exams, and a final exam.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 40 (expected: 40). Preference given to students needing the course to satisfy
prerequisites for future courses or to fulfill requirements for a major or concentration; such students should con-
tact the instructor in advance to guarantee placement in the course.
Hour: 1:10-2:25 MR SANDERS
LING 200(F) The Nature of Human Language (Same as Anthropology 208)
This course approaches the study of language as fundamental to the study of human nature itself. Questions to be
addressed include: What properties of language inform our understanding of ourselves as a species? How might
human language be fundamentally different from other animal communication systems? How did language
evolve? Did linguistic complexity emerge gradually over time, or did the capacity for complex language develop
suddenly? Is there a Universal Grammar shared by all humans? How is language instantiated in the human mind/
brain?
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: participation in discussions, occasional homework assignments, one or
two midterm exams, and a final exam, report, or project.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit:20 (expected: 20).
Hour: 11:20-12:35 TR HAUGEN
LING 210(S) Articulatory and Acoustic Phonetics
In this course, students will learn to recognize, produce, describe, transcribe, and analyze speech sounds from
languages all over the world. We will explore the basic physics behind the way we produce speech sounds, the
acoustic properties of speech as a sound wave, and how these combine to create common patterns across lan-
Linguistics
­ 227 ­
guages. Throughout the course, students will learn the International Phonetic Alphabet (a standardized system for
phonetic transcription) and mathematical and computer techniques for rigorous phonetic analysis.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: participation in discussions, weekly homework, frequent quizzes, a
midterm exam, and a final project.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 40 (expected: 40). Preference given to students needing the course to satisfy
prerequisites for future courses or to fulfill requirements for a major or concentration; such students should con-
tact the instructor in advance to guarantee placement in the course.
Hour: 1:10-2:25 MR SANDERS
LING 220(S) The Syntactic Structure of English (Same as English 224) (W)
This course is an introduction to a rigorous, scientific approach to language study. No previous training in linguis-
tics is assumed, and no reading is required for the course. A better understanding of the underlying structure of
English and of language in general will proceed by way of class discussion and homework problems. These dis-
cussions and problems will involve students in observation and analysis of linguistic data through construction,
testing, and revision of syntactic theories. The homework will require time and careful attention and will usually
be rather challenging.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: participation in discussions and 30-40 pages of writing in the form of
weekly homework, alternating between essays and short answer problem sets.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 15).

MARITIME STUDIES
Chair, Associate Professor RÓNADH COX
Advisory Committee: Professor: ART*. Associate Professor: COX**. Assistant Professors: GILBERT,
TING. Associate Deans: GERRY, TOOMAJIAN.
The oceans cover almost three-quarters of the globe, and understanding them is of increasing importance in this
era of climate change, sea-level rise, fisheries crises, and the internationalization of the high seas. We encourage
students to investigate our WaterWorld from a variety of perspectives. Maritime Studies is an interdisciplinary,
cross-divisional program that examines the literature, history, policy issues, and science of the ocean. Candidates
for the concentration in Maritime Studies must complete a minimum of seven courses: the interdisciplinary
introductory course (Geosciences 104 Oceanography), four intermediate core courses (at Williams-Mystic), an
elective, and the senior seminar.
Students who have completed other study-away programs that emphasize marine studies should consult with
the program chair about the possibility of completing the Maritime Studies concentration.
REQUIRED COURSES:
Introductory course:
Maritime Studies 104(S) Oceanography
Core courses (Williams-Mystic at Mystic Seaport):
Maritime Studies 231(F,S) Literature of the Sea
Maritime Studies 311(F,S) Marine Ecology
Maritime Studies 351(F,S) Marine Policy
Maritime Studies 352(F,S) America and the Sea, 1600-Present1
(NOTE: Students who take Maritime Studies 211 Oceanographic Processes at Mystic can substitute an
extra elective in lieu of Geosciences 104)
Senior seminar:
Maritime Studies 402(F) Syntheses: Senior Seminar
ELECTIVE COURSES:
Elective courses are listed based on either a clear maritime statement in the course description or broad practi-
cal/theoretical applicability to maritime studies. Concentrators will take a minimum of one course from the list
below. If concentrators find other courses in the catalog that they believe meet the requirements for a MAST elec-
tive, they may bring them to the attention of the chair.

HONORS PROGRAM IN MARITIME STUDIES
Candidates for honors in Maritime Studies will complete a thesis in their senior year. The project will involve
original research (archive, museum, field, or laboratory) followed by on-campus analysis and writeup of results.
This could be either a one-semester project, or a full year (two semesters plus winter study). In either case, data
collection during the summer before the senior year may be necessary. In some cases, the thesis project may be a
continuation and expansion of the student's Williams-Mystic research project. Honors will be awarded if the thesis
shows a high degree of scholarship, originality, and intellectual insight.

MAJOR
The major in Mathematics is designed to meet two goals: to introduce some of the central ideas in a variety of
areas of mathematics and statistics, and to develop problem-solving ability by teaching students to combine cre-
ative thinking with rigorous reasoning.
Students are urged to consult with the department faculty on choosing courses appropriate to an individualized
program of study.
REQUIREMENTS (nine courses plus colloquium)
Calculus (two courses)
Mathematics 104 Calculus II or an equivalent high school course
Mathematics 105 or 106 Multivariable Calculus
Except in unusual circumstances, students planning to major in mathematics should complete the
calculus sequence (Mathematics 103, 104, 105/106) before the end of the sophomore year, at the
latest.
Applied/Discrete Mathematics/Statistics (one course)
Mathematics 209 Differential Equations and Vector Calculus or
Mathematics 210 Mathematical Methods for Scientists (Same as Physics 210) or
Mathematics 251 Discrete Mathematics or
Statistics 201 Statistics and Data Analysis or
Statistics 231 Statistical Design of Experiments or
a more advanced elective in discrete or applied mathematics or statistics, with prior departmental ap-
proval: Mathematics 305, 306, 315, 361, 375, 433, 452, or any Statistics course 300 or above or an
appropriate course from another department as listed in the notes below.
Notes: Mathematics 251 is required in Computer Science, and Mathematics 209 is recommended in
other sciences, but double majors should understand that no course may count toward both majors.
Core Courses (three courses)
Mathematics 211 Linear Algebra
Mathematics 301 Real Analysis or Mathematics 305 Applied Real Analysis
Mathematics 312 Abstract Algebra or Mathematics 315 Groups and Characters or Mathematics
317 Applied Abstract Algebra
Completion (three courses plus colloquium)
The Senior Major Course is any 400-level course taken in the senior year. In exceptional circumstances,
with the prior permission of the department, a student may be allowed to satisfy the Senior Major Course
requirement in the junior year, provided that the student has completed three 300-level mathematics
courses before enrolling in the Senior Major Course (if it is a statistics seminar, one of the 300-level courses
may be replaced by Statistics 231).
Two electives from courses numbered 300 and above or Statistics 231.
Weekly participation as a senior in the Mathematics Colloquium, in which all senior majors present talks
on mathematical or statistical topics of their choice.
Mathematics and Statistics

NOTES
In some cases, an appropriate course from another department may be substituted for one of the electives, with
prior permission of the Mathematics and Statistics Department. In any case, at least eight courses must be taken in
mathematics and statistics at Williams. These can, with prior permission, include courses taken away. Students
with transfer credit should contact the department about special arrangements.
APPLIED MATHEMATICS OR OTHER SCIENCES
Students interested in applied mathematics or other sciences should consider Mathematics 209, 210, 251, 305,
306, 315, 323, 342, 354, 361, 433, or Statistics 201, 231, 346, 442, and additional appropriate courses from outside
Mathematics and Statistics, including possibilities such as Chemistry 301, Computer Science 256, Computer Sci-
ence 361, Economics 255, Physics 201, Physics 202, Physics 210 or more advanced physics courses. Students
interested in economics should consult the Economics Department.
BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Students interested in careers in business or finance should consider Mathematics 373, as well as courses in
statistics and related areas such as Statistics 101, 201, 231, 331, 344, 346, 442, 443. Since these courses address
different needs, students should consult with the instructors to determine which seem to be most appropriate for
individuals.
ENGINEERING
Students interested in engineering should consider the courses for applied mathematics immediately above,
with Mathematics 209 and 305 especially recommended. Williams has exchange and joint programs with good
engineering schools. Interested students should consult the section on engineering near the beginning of the Bulle-
tin and the Williams pre-engineering advisor for further information.
GRADUATE SCHOOL IN MATHEMATICS
Students interested in continuing their study of mathematics in graduate school should take Mathematics 301
and 312. Mathematics 302 and 324 are strongly recommended. Many of the 400-level courses would be useful,
particularly ones that involve algebra and analysis. Honors theses are encouraged. Reading knowledge of a for-
eign language (French, German, or Russian) is helpful.
STATISTICS AND ACTUARIAL SCIENCE
Students interested in statistics or actuarial science should consider Mathematics 341, Statistics 201, 331, 346,
442 and Economics 255. Additionally, students should consider taking some number of the actuarial exams given
by the Society of Actuaries, which can constitute part of an honors program in actuarial studies (see section on
honors below).
TEACHING
Students interested in teaching mathematics at the elementary or secondary school level should consider Math-
ematics 285, 313, 325, 381, Statistics 201 and practice as a tutor or teaching assistant. Winter study courses that
provide a teaching practicum are also highly recommended.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN MATHEMATICS/STATISTICS
The degree with honors in Mathematics/Statistics is awarded to the student who has demonstrated outstanding
intellectual achievement in a program of study which extends beyond the requirements of the major. The principal
considerations for recommending a student for the degree with honors will be: Mastery of core material and skills,
breadth and, particularly, depth of knowledge beyond the core material, ability to pursue independent study of
mathematics or statistics, originality in methods of investigation, and, where appropriate, creativity in research.
An honors program normally consists of two semesters and a WSP (031) of independent research, culminating
in a thesis and a presentation. Under certain circumstances, the honors work can consist of coordinated study in-
volving a regular course and one semester plus a WSP (030) of independent study, culminating in a "minithesis"
and a presentation. At least one semester should be in addition to the major requirements.
An honors program in actuarial studies requires significant achievement on four appropriate examinations of
the Society of Actuaries and giving a second colloquium talk. Written work is a possible component.
Highest honors will be reserved for the rare student who has displayed exceptional ability, achievement or orig-
inality. Such a student usually will have written a thesis, or pursued actuarial honors and written a minithesis. An
outstanding student who writes a minithesis, or pursues actuarial honors and writes a paper, might also be consid-
ered.
Prospective honors students are urged to consult with their departmental advisor at the time of registration in the
spring of the sophomore or at the beginning of the junior year to arrange a program of study that could lead to the
degree with honors. By the time of registration during spring of the junior year, the student must have requested a
faculty member to be honors advisor and must have obtained the department's approval of formal admission to the
honors program. Such approval depends on both the record and the promise of the applicant. It is conditional on
continuing progress.
The recommendation for honors is usually announced at the end of the spring term. Participation in the honors
program does not guarantee a recommendation for honors. The decision is based not only on successful comple-
tion of the honors program but also on the merit of the student's overall record in mathematics. If the student com-
pletes the program during the fall or winter study, the decision may be announced at the beginning of the spring
term, conditional on continuing merit.
ADVANCED PLACEMENT
The Mathematics and Statistics Department attempts to place each student who elects a mathematics course in
that course best suited to the student's preparation and goals. The suggested placement in an appropriate calculus
course is determined by the results of the Advanced Placement Examination (AB or BC) if the student took one,
and any additional available information. A student who receives a 3, 4, or 5 on the BC examination is ordinarily
Mathematics and Statistics
­ 232 ­
placed in Mathematics 106. A student who receives a 4 or 5 on the AB examination is ordinarily placed in Mathe-
matics 105. A student who receives a 1 or 2 on the BC examination or a 2 or 3 on the AB examination is ordinarily
placed in Mathematics 104. Students who have had calculus in high school, whether or not they took the Ad-
vanced Placement Examination, are barred from Mathematics 103 unless they obtain permission from the instruc-
tor. A student who receives a 4 or 5 on the Statistics AP examination should consult the department for placement.
In any event, students registering for mathematics and statistics courses are urged to consult with members of the
department concerning appropriate courses and placement. In general, students are encouraged to enroll in the
most advanced course for which they are qualified: it is much easier to drop back than to jump forward. The de-
partment reserves the right to refuse registration in any course for which the student is determined to be over-pre-
pared.
GENERAL REMARKS
Divisional Requirements
All mathematics and statistics courses may be used to satisfy the Division III requirement.
Alternate Year Courses
Core courses Mathematics 301, 305, 312, and 315 are normally offered every year. Other 300-level courses
may be offered in alternate years. Senior seminars (400-level courses) are normally offered every two to four
years. Students should check with the department before planning far into the future.
Course Admission
Courses are normally open to all students meeting the prerequisites. Students with questions about the level at
which courses are conducted are invited to consult members of the department.
Course Descriptions
Descriptions of the courses in Statistics follow the descriptions of Mathematics courses.
Courses Open on a Pass/Fail Basis
Students taking a mathematics or statistics course on a pass/fail basis must meet all the requirements set for
students taking the course on a graded basis.
With the permission of the department, any course offered by the department may be taken on a pass/fail basis.
Permission will not be given to mathematics majors to meet any of the requirements of the major or honors degree
on this basis. However, with the permission of the department, courses taken in the department beyond those re-
quirements may be taken on a pass/fail basis.
Study Abroad
Programs like the "Budapest Semester in Mathematics" are recommended for majors who wish to focus on
mathematics away. The department, though, normally accommodates students who select other study away pro-
grams. Majors typically take their core courses (analysis and algebra) at Williams, and sometimes select courses
away which (with prior approval) count as 300-level mathematics or statistics electives. The department offers its
core courses in both the fall and the spring to allow students to spend more easily a semester away.
Graduate School Requirements
An increasing number of graduate and professional schools require mathematics and statistics as a prerequisite
to admission or to attaining their degree. Students interested in graduate or professional training in business, medi-
cine, economics, or psychology are advised to find out the requirements in those fields early in their college ca-
reers.
MATHEMATICS COURSES
STATISTICS COURSE LISTINGS FOLLOW THE MATHEMATICS COURSE LISTINGS.
NOTE: Course Numbers--The first digit of the three-digit label for each course roughly denotes
the difficulty level of the course. The middle digit denotes the field (0=calculus/analysis, 1=alge-
bra/number theory, 2=geometry/topology, 3=applied, 4=probability, 5=discrete, 6=computation,
7,8=miscellaneous). The last digit occasionally indicates the level within a field, but most often
simply distinguishes amongst the courses in the field. In particular, for example, Math 211 is not
"easier" than Math 251; they are simply different mathematical fields (algebra vs. discrete).
There are three types of 300-level courses. There are the core courses: Math 301, 305, 312, 315,
317. There are the "precore" courses, which do not have the core courses as prerequisites. These
include Math 313, 316, 327 and others. Finally there are those courses that have a core course
as a prerequisite, such as Math 302.
MATH 101T(F) Mathematical Analysis with Descriptive Statistics
This course is intended to develop quantitative skills for non-science majors. We will cover basic algebra from an
applied point of view, including working with formulas and solving for unknowns. We will investigate a variety of
ways to model real-world problems. For example, how many handshakes away are you from the president and
how is that related to a transportation network? We will cover basic finance, including loans and annuities. Finally,
we will also cover descriptive statistics, including data analysis, computing with mean/median/variance, data dis-
play and contingency tables.
Format: tutorial/computer lab. Evaluation will be based primarily on homework, quizzes and/or exams, and com-
puter projects.
Prerequisites: placement by a Quantitative Studies Counselor. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10).

MATH 102(F) Precalculus
This course prepares students for Mathematics 103, first semester calculus. The course begins with a brief review
of algebra followed by a thorough treatment of algebraic, logarithmic, and trigonometric functions from a graphi-
cal, analytical and applied point of view.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on homework, quizzes, and/or exams.
Prerequisites: placement by a Quantitative Studies Counselor or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: (ex-
pected: 15).
Hour: 9:00-9:50 MWF PEDERSEN
MATH 103(F,S) Calculus I (Q)
Calculus permits the computation of velocities and other instantaneous rates of change by a limiting process called
differentiation. The same process also solves "max-min" problems: how to maximize profit or minimize pollution.
A second limiting process, called integration, permits the computation of areas and accumulations of income or
medicines. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus provides a useful and surprising link between the two pro-
cesses. Subtopics include trigonometry, exponential growth, and logarithms. This is an introductory course for
students who have not seen calculus before. Students who have previously taken a calculus course may not enroll
in Mathematics 103 without the permission of instructor.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on homework, quizzes, and/or exams.
Prerequisites: Mathematics 102 (or demonstrated proficiency on a diagnostic test; see Mathematics 101). No en-
rollment limit (expected: 30).

11:00-11:50 MWF Second Semester: PACELLI
MATH 104(F,S) Calculus II (Q)
Mastery of calculus requires understanding how integration computes areas and business profit and acquiring a
stock of techniques. Further methods solve equations involving derivatives ("differential equations") for popula-
tion growth or pollution levels. Exponential and logarithmic functions and trigonometric and inverse functions
play an important role. This course is the right starting point for students who have seen derivatives, but not neces-
sarily integrals, before. Students who have received the equivalent of advanced placement of AB 4 or BC 3 may
not enroll in Mathematics 104 without the permission of instructor. Students who have higher advanced placement
must enroll in Mathematics 105 or above.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on homework, quizzes, and/or exams.
Prerequisites: Mathematics 103 or equivalent. No enrollment limit (expected: 30).

8:30-9:45 TR Second Semester: BEAVER
MATH 105(F,S) Multivariable Calculus (Q)
Applications of calculus in mathematics, science, economics, psychology, the social sciences, involve several
variables. This course extends calculus to several variables: vectors, partial derivatives, multiple integrals. There is
also a unit on infinite series, sometimes with applications to differential equations. This course is the right starting
point for students who have seen differentiation and integration before. Students with the equivalent of advanced
placement of AB 4, BC 3 or above should enroll in Mathematics 105.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on homework, quizzes, and/or exams.
Prerequisites: Mathematics 104 or equivalent, such as satisfactory performance on an Advanced Placement Ex-
amination. No enrollment limit (expected: 45).
Hour: 9:00-9:50 MWF, 10:00-10:50 MWF, 11:00-11:50 MWF First Semester: DEVADOSS
9:00-9:50 MWF 10:00-10:50 MWF Second Semester: LOOK
MATH 106(F) Multivariable Calculus (Q)
Applications of calculus in mathematics, science, economics, psychology, the social sciences, involve several
variables. This course extends calculus to several variables: vectors, partial derivatives and multiple integrals. The
goal of the course is Stokes Theorem, a deep and profound generalization of the Fundamental Theorem of Calcu-
lus. The difference between this course and Mathematics 105 is that Mathematics 105 covers infinite series instead
of Stokes Theorem. Students with the equivalent of BC 3 or higher should enroll in Mathematics 106, as well as
students who have taken the equivalent of an integral calculus and who have already been exposed to infinite
series. For further clarification as to whether or not Mathematics 105 or Mathematics 106 is appropriate, please
consult a member of the math/stat department. Mathematics 106 satisfies any Mathematics 105 prerequisite.
Credit will not be given for both Mathematics 105 and Mathematics 106.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on homework, quizzes, and/or exams.

MATH 175(F) Mathematical Politics: Voting, Power, and Conflict (Same as INTR 160) (Q)
Who should have won the 2000 Presidential Election? Do any two senators really have equal power in passing
legislation? How can marital assets be divided fairly? While these questions are of interest to many social scien-
tists, a mathematical perspective can offer a quantitative analysis of issues like these and more. In this course, we
will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of various types of voting systems and show that, in fact, any such
system is flawed. We will also examine a quantitative definition of power and the principles behind fair division.
Along the way, we will enhance the critical reasoning skills necessary to tackle any type of problem mathematical
or otherwise.

MATH 209(S) Differential Equations and Vector Calculus (Q)
Historically, much beautiful mathematics has arisen from attempts to explain heat flow, chemical reactions, bio-
logical processes, or magnetic fields. A few ingenious techniques solve a surprisingly large fraction of the associ-
ated ordinary and partial differential equations. The mystical Pythagorean fascination with ratios and harmonics is
vindicated and applied in Fourier series and integrals. Integrating vectorfields over surfaces applies equally to
blood flow, gravity, and differential geometry.

MATH 211(F,S) Linear Algebra (Q)
Many social, political, economic, biological, and physical phenomena can be described, at least approximately, by
linear relations. In the study of systems of linear equations one may ask: When does a solution exist? When is it
unique? How does one find it? How can one interpret it geometrically? This course develops the theoretical struc-
ture underlying answers to these and other questions and includes the study of matrices, vector spaces, linear inde-
pendence and bases, linear transformations, determinants and inner products. Course work is balanced between
theoretical and computational, with attention to improving mathematical style and sophistication.

MATH 301(F) Real Analysis (Q)
Real analysis is the theory behind calculus. It is based on a precise understanding of the real numbers, elementary
topology, and limits. Topologically, nice sets are either closed (contain their limit points) or open (complement
closed). You also need limits to define continuity, derivatives, integrals, and to understand sequences of functions.

The calculus of complex-valued functions turns out to have unexpected simplicity and power. As an example of
simplicity, every complex-differentiable function is automatically infinitely differentiable. As examples of power,
the so-called "residue calculus" permits the computation of "impossible" integrals, and "conformal mapping" re-
duces physical problems on very general domains to problems on the round disc. The easiest proof of the Funda-
mental Theorem of Algebra, not to mention the first proof of the Prime Number Theorem, used complex analysis.

lus" include geodesics, harmonic functions, minimal surfaces, Hamilton's action and Lagrange's equations, opti-
mal economic strategies, nonEuclidean geometry, and general relativity.

Algebra gives us the tools to solve equations. Sets such as the integers or real numbers have special properties
which make algebra work or not work according to the circumstances. In this course, we generalize algebraic
processes and the sets upon which they operate in order to better understand, theoretically, when equations can and
cannot be solved. We define and study the abstract algebraic structures called groups, rings and fields, as well as
the concepts of factor group, quotient ring, homomorphism, isomorphism, and various types of field extensions.

Living in the early decades of the information age, we find ourselves depending more and more on codes that
protect messages against either noise or eavesdropping. We begin this course by studying the history of this sub-
ject, including, for example, the story of the enigma code from World War II. We then examine some of the most
important codes currently being used to protect information, including linear codes, which in addition to being
mathematically elegant are the most practical codes for error correction, and the RSA public key cryptographic
scheme, popular nowadays for internet applications. Looking ahead by a decade or more, we show how a "quan-
tum computer" could crack any RSA code in short order, and how quantum cryptographic devices will achieve
security through the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.
Evaluation will be based on homework sets and exams.

MATH 324T(S) Topology (Q)
Topology is the study of when one geometric object can be continuously deformed and twisted into another object.
Determining when two objects are topologically the same is incredibly difficult and is still the subject of a tremen-
dous amount of research, including current work on the Poincare Conjecture, one of the million-dollar millen-
nium-prize problems. The first part of the course on "Point-set Topology" establishes a framework based on "open
sets" for studying continuity and compactness in very general spaces. The second part on "Homotopy Theory"
develops refined methods for determining when objects are the same. We will prove for example that you cannot
twist a basketball into a doughnut.

MATH 433(F) Mathematical Modeling and Control Theory (Q)
Mathematical modeling is concerned with translating a natural phenomenon into a mathematical form. In this
abstract form the underlying principles of the phenomenon can be carefully examined and real-world behavior can
be interpreted in terms of mathematical shapes. The models we investigate include feedback phenomena, phase
locked oscillators, multiple population dynamics, reaction-diffusion equations, shock waves, morphogenesis, and
the spread of pollution, forest fires, and diseases. Often the natural phenomenon has some aspect we can
control--such as how much pollution, electric charge, or chemotherapeutic agent we put into a river, circuit, or
cancer patient. We will investigate how to operate such controls in order to achieve a specific goal or optimize
some interpretation of performance. We will employ tools from the fields of differential equations and dynamical
systems. The course is intended for students in the mathematical, physical, and chemical sciences, as well as for
students who are seriously interested in the mathematical aspects of physiology, economics, geology, biology, and
environmental studies.

STATISTICS COURSES
STAT 101(F,S) Elementary Statistics and Data Analysis (Q)
It is nearly impossible to live in the world today without being inundated with data. Even the most popular news-
papers feature statistics to catch the eye of the passerby, and sports broadcasters overwhelm the listener with ar-
cane statistics. How do we learn to recognize dishonest or even unintentionally distorted representations of quanti-
tative information? How are we to reconcile two medical studies with seemingly contradictory conclusions? How
many observations do we need in order to make a decision? It is the purpose of this course to develop an appreci-
ation for and an understanding of the interpretation of data. We will become familiar with the standard tools of
statistical inference including the t-test, the analysis of variance, and regression, as well as exploratory data tech-
niques. Applications will come from the real world that we all live in.

STAT 201(F,S) Statistics and Data Analysis (Q)
Statistics can be viewed as the art (science?) of turning data into information. Real world decision-making, wheth-

prematurely asked the merits of a case by Dr. Watson, snapped back, "Data, data, data! I can't make bricks without
clay." In this course, we will study the basic methods by which statisticians attempt to extract information from
data. These will include many of the standard tools of statistical inference such as the t-test, analysis of variance
and linear regression as well as exploratory and graphical data analysis techniques.

What does statistics have to do with designing and carrying out experiments? The answer is, surprisingly perhaps,
a great deal. In this tutorial, we will study how to design an experiment in order to obtain the most information
from it in the fewest number of observations. The efficient design of experiments is important not only in the
sciences: it has been credited for helping Japanese industry achieve its success. The examples from this course will
be primarily from the students area of interest. Students will be paired by area of interest and previous statistical
experience. The culmination of the course will be a project where each student designs, carries out, analyzes, and
presents an experiment of interest to him or her.

STAT 440(S) Categorical Data Analysis (Q)
This course focuses on methods for analyzing categorical response data. In contrast to continuous data, categorical
data consist of observations classified into two or more categories. Traditional tools of statistical data analysis are
not designed to handle such data and pose inappropriate assumptions. We will develop methods specifically de-
signed to address the discrete nature of the observations and consider applications to the social sciences (e.g., is
there a gender difference in the belief in life after death) the biological/medical sciences (e.g., does the probability
of a severe side effects increase with the dosage of a drug) and economics. All methods are extensions of tradition-
al ANOVA and regression models to categorical data.

ing, score reading, melodic and harmonic dictation, and keyboard proficiency, throughout their entire Williams
career.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN MUSIC
Three routes provide the opportunity for honors or highest honors consideration in the Music major:
a. Composition: A Composition thesis must include one major work completed during the senior year, a
portfolio of smaller works completed during the junior and senior years, and a 10- to 15-page discussion of
the student's work or analysis of a major 20th Century work.
b. Performance: A Performance thesis must include an honors recital given during the spring of the senior
year and a 15- to 20-page discussion of one or more of the works performed. The student's general perfor-
mance career will also be considered in determining honors.
c. History, Theory and Analysis, or Ethnomusicology: A written Historical, Theoretical/Analytical, or Ethno-
musicological thesis between 65 and 80 pages in length and an oral presentation based on the thesis is
required. A written thesis should offer new insights based on original research.
In order for a thesis proposal to be approved a student must have at least a 3.3 GPA in Music courses (this GPA
must be maintained in order to receive honors), and must have demonstrated outstanding ability and experience
through coursework and performance in the proposed thesis area. Students are encouraged to seek the advice of
their potential thesis advisor early in the junior year and no later than the first month of the second semester. A 1 to
2 page proposal written in consultation with the faculty advisor must be received by the Music chair by the end of
spring break.
Honors candidates must enroll in Music 493(F)-W31-494(S) during their senior year. A student who is highly
qualified for honors work, but is unable to pursue a year-long project for compelling reasons, may petition the
department for permission to pursue a WS/one-semester thesis. The standards for evaluating such a thesis remain
the same. Completed thesis is due by April 1.
LESSONS
Courses involving individual vocal or instrumental instruction involve extra fees which are subsidized by the
department. (See Music 251-258 and Studies in the Musical Art 325, 326, 427, 428). For further information
check the Music Department webpage and contact the Department of Music.
STUDY ABROAD
Music majors considering study abroad should meet with the department chair well in advance in order to de-
termine whether it will be possible to complete the requirements for the major. Study abroad courses are not ac-
cepted as substitutes for the specific required major courses. However, they may qualify as electives toward the
major if approved by the department.

MUS 101(F) Listening to Music: An Introduction
Intended for non-major students with little or no formal training.
When you listen to music--on the radio, on your Ipod, at a concert--how much do you really hear? This course
has two goals: to refine listening skills, thus increasing the student's understanding and enjoyment of music, while
at the same time providing a survey of the major composers and musical styles of the Western classical repertory
to be encountered in concert halls today. Students will be introduced to music from the Baroque, Classical, Ro-
mantic, and Modern periods, including works by composers such as Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Brahms, Mahler,
and Stravinsky. Genres to be covered include the symphony, chamber music, opera, song, and choral music. At-
tendance at selected concerts on campus required.
Evaluation will be based on two quizzes, a midterm and final exam, and two concert reports.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 40 (expected: 30).

MUS 102(F) Fundamentals of Music (W)
This course seeks to define and describe the fundamental nature of music in Western society. Through a variety of
exercises and projects, students will develop an understanding of basic musical rudiments such as pitch, scales,
triads, rhythm, meter, and notation materials that form the foundation of Western art and popular musics. By the
end of the course, students will have begun the study of basic four-part harmony. In addition, students will explore
various topics such as philosophies of music (including aesthetics), music cognition and perception, popular mu-
sics, and acoustics, and their relationships to defining the "fundamentals" of music. Students will be expected to
complete weekly argumentative papers reacting to the various philosophical readings; as the semester progresses,
these reaction papers will increase in both length and depth, in preparation for a final project of each student's
choice. Students will receive frequent and detailed critiques (either in the form of written comments or verbal
discussions) of each writing assignment. The course has a musicianship component: students attend a musician-
ship lab (sight-singing, dictation, and keyboard skills) in addition to lectures.
Format: two weekly lectures and a weekly lab meeting. Evaluation will be based on quizzes/exams, weekly
reaction papers, a final research project, and a final exam.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15 (expected: 10). Preference given to students with music-reading proficiency.
Hour: 11:20-12:35 TR Labs: 9-9:50 W, 10-10:50 W BODNER (lecture); BODNER (labs)
MUS 103(F) Music Theory and Musicianship I
Music 103 and 104 are designed for potential majors and for students with strong instrumental or vocal back-
grounds. Although there is no prerequisite for Music 103, students are expected to have some knowledge of musi-
cal rudiments, reading proficiency in at least one clef, and ideally have some comfort reading both bass and treble
clefs. A short diagnostic exam will be administered at the first class meeting of Music 103 to assess students' skills
and background, and determine if a student requires any additional remedial work to complement and fortify
course work during the early weeks of the semester. Students with a strong background in music theory may take a
placement exam during First Days to see whether they can pass out of one or both semesters. Music 103 and 104
are required for the music major.
Music 103 presents the materials, structures and procedures of tonal music, with an emphasis on the harmonic and
contrapuntal practice of the baroque and classical periods (ca. 1650-1825).
Music 103 explores triadic harmony, voice leading, and counterpoint with an emphasis on the chorale style of J.S.
Bach and his predecessors. Keyboard harmony and figured bass exercises, sight singing, dictation, analysis of
repertoire, written exercises and emulation projects will develop both an intellectual and an aural understanding of
music of the period. Projects include the harmonization of chorale melodies, the arrangement of classical period
minuets and the composition of a dice game minuet.
Format: lecture two days a week; a conference meeting one day a week; ear training/musicianship skills lab meet-
ing twice a week. Evaluation will be based on weekly written work, written and keyboard quizzes, and midyear
and final projects. Must be taken as a graded course.
Enrollment limit: 15 per section (expected: 15). Preference to potential majors, and those with strongest musician-
ship skills.

MUS 104(S) Music Theory and Musicianship I
Music 104 continues the practical musicianship work of Music 103, while expanding the scope of harmonic topics
to include seventh chords and chromatic harmony. Music 104 further explores the transformation of chorale har-
mony in contrapuntal works of the eighteenth century. Projects include the composition and performance of pre-
ludes, fugues and organ chorale preludes on baroque models.
Format: lecture two days a week; a conference meeting one day a week; ear training/keyboard skills lab meeting
twice a week. Evaluation will be based on weekly written work, written and keyboard quizzes, and midyear and
final projects. Must be taken as a graded course.

or simply attend the first class meeting. (Successful completion of Music 101 automatically qualifies the student
for Music 106 through 141.)
MUS 106(S) Opera
An introduction to the history of opera, from the genre's birth c. 1600 to the present. At various points in its
400-year development, opera has been considered the highest synthesis of the arts, a vehicle for the social elite, or
a form of popular entertainment. Opera's position in European cultural history will be a primary focus of our inqui-
ry. We will also study the intriguing relationship between text and music, aspects of performance and production,
and the artistic and social conventions of the operatic world. The multidimensional nature of opera invites a variety
of analytical and critical perspectives, including those of music analysis, literary studies, feminist interpretations,
and political and sociological approaches. Works to be considered include operas by Monteverdi, Lully, Charpent-
ier, Handel, Gluck, Mozart, Rossini, Donizetti, Verdi, Wagner, Bizet, Puccini, Strauss, Berg, Britten, and Glass.
This course may involve a trip to the Metropolitan Opera.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on a midterm, a brief paper, an 8-page paper, and a final
exam.

MUS 108(S) The Concerto
More than any other instrumental genre in music, the concerto by its nature tells stories. As in opera, the concerto
focuses on a protagonist, usually a single soloist; the interest of the work lies in the dynamic musical interplay
between that individual and the larger ensemble. This course will explore the development of the concerto, from
its origins in 17th-century Italy through the 20th century. We will focus on the musical means by which composers
of the Baroque, Classical, Romantic, and Modern periods, working in a wide variety of styles, created compelling
musical narratives. We will also consider the cultural contexts within which concerti are composed and performed,
giving particular attention to the persona of the virtuoso as exemplified by such figures as Bach, Mozart, Beetho-
ven, Clara Schumann, Liszt, Paganini, Horowitz, and Marta Argerich. Works to be studied will include several
concerti to be performed on campus by the Berkshire Symphony with professional and student soloists.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on short quizzes and papers, a midterm and a final exam, and
attendance and participation.

MUS 115(F) Introduction to Twentieth-Century Music
Twentieth-century Euro-American art music involved a persistent exploration of the limits of musical possibility.
Encounters with this music often challenge our ears and musical minds and require us to reconsider fundamental
conceptions of music itself. Throughout the course, we will investigate in what ways the basic elements of music
(e.g., harmonic organization, rhythm, timbre, instrumentation and performance conventions) were extended and
revolutionized. Topics and styles to be discussed include: atonality, expressionism, twelve-tone techniques, neo-
classicism, electronic and computer music, stochastic music, minimalism, and neoromanticism. We will also
consider the music of this century in relation to contemporary developments in the other arts and to popular musi-
cal styles. The syllabus will include works by such composers as Debussy, Mahler, Stravinsky, Schoenberg, Web-
ern, Bartók, Weill, Milhaud, Shostakovich, Ives, Copland, Babbitt, Stockhausen, Messiaen, Boulez, Berio, Cage,
Górecki, Glass, Gubaidulina, and Tower.

MUS 117(S) Mozart
This course will examine the extraordinary life and musical genius of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Through
guided listening, students will gain appreciation of Mozart's classical compositional style and its timeless appeal.
The class will explore Mozart's pivotal position as a musician in Viennese society; his strange combination of
bawdy behavior and sublime artistry; his relationship with his domineering father, as well as with Haydn, Beetho-
ven, and Salieri; and the myths about Mozart that have sprung up in the two centuries since his death.
Evaluation will be based on class participation, listening quizzes, two short papers, a midterm exam, and a final
exam.

MUS 121(S) Brahms in Context
In popular culture, Johannes Brahms is known especially as the composer of a well-known lullaby, as a gruff-
looking bearded figure, and as the last of "The Three Bs" (the other two being Bach and Beethoven). Beneath the
beard, however, Brahms (1833-97) was a complicated man whose personal challenges, along with the rich social
and cultural environments in which he worked, played important roles in shaping the diverse musical repertory he
produced. This course is a broad introduction to Brahms's life and works, with an emphasis on how the music
relates to issues of biography, psychology, and trends in music history, aesthetics, politics, religion, literature, and
the visual arts. Students will be exposed to many of Brahms's most important works, including symphonies, con-
certos, chamber works, piano pieces, songs, the famous German Requiem and, of course, the lullaby.

Why does an opera singer sound different from a rock singer? Why can't one convincingly sing in the style of the
other? And why is the former granted a higher status and the latter a wider audience? This course examines the
physiological and acoustical properties of singing and explores the varieties of singing style and function including
Western classical, jazz, pop and gospel as well as less familiar approaches such as overtone singing, yodeling and
belting. The historical development of singing styles will be considered as will the meaning making of specific
vocal qualities. Students will learn the basics of several singing styles.

This course takes the piano, its repertory, and its performers as focal points for a social history of Western music,
treating the piano as a locus around which issues of gender, class and race are played out in nineteenth century and
twentieth century musical life. In addition to exploring "serious" works by composers such as Mozart and Beetho-
ven, we will consider parlor music and music by crowd-pleasing virtuosi such as Liszt and Gottschalk. We will
also consider a broad range of classical and popular performers, ranging from Clara Schumann, Vladimir Horo-
witz, Artur Rubinstein and Glenn Gould through Art Tatum and Liberace. Other topics will include the "cult of the
virtuoso," Jane Campion's 1993 film The Piano, and musical nationalism as reflected in music for the piano.

Many of the songs we hear on the radio derive their appeal, in part, from the interest of the narratives conveyed by
their lyrics. Even without lyrics, however, music itself can compellingly depict characters, emotions, settings, or
events in order to relate tales of love, tragic loss, conflict, heroism and victory, transcendence, comedy, adventure,

and the exotic. This course explores the various musical means through which composers of the past several cen-
turies have sought to convey such stories in both texted and untexted genres including the sixteenth-century mad-
rigal; opera; the concerto and the symphony; nineteenth-century song cycles, solo piano works, and tone-poems;
ballet and film scores; and jazz and rock 'n roll.

MUS 201(F) Music Theory and Musicianship II
Music 201 continues to greater degrees the study of music techniques from the common practice period by means
of analysis, composition, written exercises, sightsinging, keyboard application and dictation. We will expand our
understanding of chromaticism. We will learn how chromaticism is used as a voice-leading tool, and how it partic-
ipates in music events at deeper levels of the structure. We will learn about innovations that occurred from the early
19th century through the beginning of the 20th century and will trace the origins for these new harmonic tenden-
cies. We will also learn how composers create larger formal structures.
Format: two lecture meetings and two skills lab meetings per week. Final grading will be based on homework,
theory quizzes, analysis papers, compositional projects, a final exam, class attendance, preparation and participa-
tion, and on the results of the lab portion of the class (sight singing, ear training, and keyboard harmony).

MUS 207(F) Music in History I: Antiquity--1750
This course explores 1000 years of music-making in Western European culture, beginning with the philosophical
and theoretical origins of that music in ancient Greece and extending to the life and music of J.S. Bach. Topics
covered will include how the sound of music changed over a millennium; the different functions it served and how
genres developed to serve these functions; the lives of the men and women who composed, performed, and wrote
about music; and how the changing notation and theory of music related to its practice over the centuries. At the
same time, the course provides an introduction to the modern study of music history, sampling a broad range of
recent scholarship reflecting an array of critical approaches to the study of early music in our own day.
Format: three meetings per week; field trip(s) may be required. Evaluation will be based on class participation,
written assignments, midterm and final exams.

MUS 212(F) Jazz Theory and Improvisation I (Same as Africana Studies 212)
The theory and application of basic techniques in jazz improvisation including blues forms, swing, bebop, modal-
ly based composition, Afro-Cuban, etc. Appropriate for students with skill on their instrument and some basic
theoretical knowledge. Knowledge of all key signatures, major/minor keys and modes, intervals, triads and basic
seventh chords and their functions within keys. Students should be able to play and demonstrate these concepts on
their instruments--competence on an instrument is essential (vocalists will be encouraged to study the piano).
Pianists and guitarists should be able to sight read chords on a jazz lead sheet. Sight reading will be a regular part of
our daily studies. Alternates between lecture style exposition of theoretical topics and a master class where stu-
dents will perform and be evaluated on pieces they arrange for a student group.
In addition to the development of skills, written work consists of assignments (e.g., harmonic analysis and exer-
cises in transposition and transcription), a transcription project (e.g., of a recorded solo or a composition) and recit-
al.
Evaluation will be based on weekly homework, a midterm, a transcription project and the class performance, as
well as improvement as measured in weekly class performance.
Prerequisites: Music 103 and/or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 15. Course cannot be taken pass/fail.

oped previously. Students will deal with more complex theoretical and performance issues, such as modal inter-
change and minor key harmony, use of symmetric scales, commonly-used reharmonizations of the blues and "I
Got Rhythm" chord progressions, and Coltrane's "Three Tonic" harmonic system.
The format is the same as for Music 212, with two weekly meetings, alternating between theory and performance
sessions, and including a final recital.
Requirements: two transcription projects and two original compositions (one based on pre-existing "Coltrane"
chord changes), as well as a midterm and participation in a recital at the end of the semester.

MUS 235(F) African Rhythm, African Sensibility (Same as Africana Studies 235) (D)
This course has three goals. The first is to immerse students in African music, encouraging them to learn to play
and understand this music from an insider's perspective. The second goal is to deepen that understanding by
introducing students to the work of scholars who have contributed to a theoretical understanding of African music.
The final goal is to broaden that understanding by comparing and contrasting certain features of African music
with comparable ones in European and African-American musical traditions.
The course will investigate these topics through class discussions, papers, and reading, listening, and viewing as-
signments. Students will be musically immersed in African music through their participation in labs/rehearsals
with the Zambezi Marimba Band (Tuesdays and Thursdays 4-6:30 PM) where they will learn to perform Zimbab-
wean marimba and mbira music with Prof. Brown and with Cosmas Magaya and Beauler Dyoko, masters of the
Zimbabwean mbira dza vadzimu (the mbira of the ancestor spirits). This material will be performed in a concert
with Kusika and the Zambezi Marimba Band on a date to be announced. Other African, African-American, and
European music will be discussed, analyzed, or performed informally in class.
This course fits the Educational Diversity Initiative in that it immerses students in another culture and gives them
the tools with which to understand that culture from the inside. It also encourages students to reflect critically upon
their insider's perspective and to develop a more theoretical understanding of that perspective. Finally, this course
fits EDI's emphasis on the Comparative Study of Cultures and Societies by encouraging students to compare and
contrast specific aspects of African and non-African music cultures.
Format: discussion/performance. Evaluation: performance 30%; participation in class 20%; papers 50%.
Prerequisites: an intermediate level of performance ability in music or dance. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10).

MUS 245T(S) Music Analysis: Music with Text (W)
The course explores the ways in which musical structure interacts with, can comment upon, and can influence
one's reading of a text set to music, and similarly, how texts set to music can exert influence upon and guide one's
understanding of the musical structure. Using scenes from Mozart operas and selected songs of the 19th and 20th
centuries (by Schubert, Schumann, Brahms and Schoenberg), the course will examine the bearing specific aspects
of a text (voice, person, time, alliteration, meter, and so forth) have upon the musical domain, and conversely, how
musical structures have the ability to project or allegorize actions in the text. We will observe the often amazing
ways composers of texted music use the tonal system to create musical desires--desires that may be fulfilled,
withheld, delayed, redirected, and so forth, in ways that enhance, or enact the desires of characters in a drama or
Music
­ 247 ­
poem. In addition to the specific issues involving texted and dramatic works, the course will introduce certain
techniques and insights of linear analysis--one of the most profound developments in tonal analysis during the
last century. Analysis assignments, based on the student's close study of texted musical works, will offer the op-
portunity to apply these techniques. The course will also confront the difficult issue of writing about music and will
help students define and clearly express ideas about music.
Format: tutorial. Students will attend one weekly group lecture and one weekly tutorial meeting. Grades will be
based on five analysis essays/presentations and five critiques of another student's analyses.
Prerequisites: Music 104. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Preference to those with the most theory back-

400-LEVEL COURSES
MUS 402(S) Senior Seminar in Music: Music and Language
This seminar, the culminating course in the major, will focus on a classic subject of musical inquiry: the relation-
ship between music and language. Is music itself a language? Does joining words to music impart power to the
words or provide signification to the music? How should text be set to music? These questions have intrigued
composers, philosophers, and linguists throughout history and across the globe. Our work in this seminar will
involve both the analysis of specific vocal styles and the critical interpretation of historical and contemporary theo-
ries of music and language. We will investigate such topics as: polytextuality in the fourteenth-century motet; stile
rappresentativo and Italian humanism; symbolic language in Bach; Rousseau's theory of music as ideal language;
rhetoric and the Classical style; detached texts in nineteenth-century instrumental music and musical analysis; mu-
sical narration in nineteenth-century opera; traditions of Buddhist chant; Qur'anic recitation as non-music; experi-
mental vocal techniques in the twentieth-century; the ballads of Cole Porter; Dylan's bardic style; the voice and
technology.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on papers, presentations, and class participation.

Neuroscience is a rapidly growing interdisciplinary field concerned with understanding the relationship be-
tween brain, mind, and behavior. The interdisciplinary nature of the field is apparent when surveying those who
call themselves neuroscientists. Among these are anatomists, physiologists, chemists, psychologists, philoso-
phers, computer scientists, linguists, and ethologists. The areas that neuroscience addresses are equally diverse and
range from physiological and molecular studies of single neurons, to investigations of how systems of neurons
produce phenomena such as vision and movement, to the study of the neural basis of complex cognitive phenome-
na such as memory, language, and consciousness. Applications of neuroscience research are rapidly growing and
include the development of drugs to treat neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkin-
son's disease, the development of noninvasive techniques for imaging the human brain such as PET scans and
MRI, and the development of methods for repair of the damaged human brain such as the use of brain explants.
Combining this wide range of disciplines, areas of research, and application for the study of a single remarkably
complex organ--the brain--requires a unique interdisciplinary approach. The Neuroscience Program is designed
to provide students with the opportunity to explore this approach.
THE PROGRAM
The program in neuroscience consists of five courses including an introductory course, three electives, and a
senior course. In addition, students are required to take two courses, Biology 101 and Psychology 101, as part of
the program.
Neuroscience (Neuroscience 201) is the basic course and provides the background for other neuroscience
courses. Ideally, this will be taken in the sophomore year. Either Biology 101 or Psychology 101 serves as the
prerequisite. Electives are designed to provide in-depth coverage including laboratory experience in specific areas
of neuroscience. At least one elective course is required in Biology (Group A) and one in Psychology (Group B).
The third elective course may also come from Group A or Group B, or may be selected from other neuroscience
related courses upon approval of the advisory committee. Topics in Neuroscience (Neuroscience 401) is designed
to provide an integrative culminating experience. Students take this course in the senior year.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN NEUROSCIENCE
The degree with honors in Neuroscience provides students with the opportunity to undertake an original re-
search project under the supervision of one or more of the Neuroscience faculty. In addition to completing the
requirements of the Neuroscience Program, candidates for an honors degree must enroll in Neuroscience
493-W31-494 and write a thesis based on an original research project. Presentation of a thesis, however, should
not be interpreted as a guarantee of a degree with honors. Students interested in pursuing a degree with honors
should contact the Neuroscience Advisory Committee in the spring of their junior year.

NSCI 401(S) Topics in Neuroscience
Neuroscientists explore issues inherent in the study of brain and behavior. The overall objective of this seminar is
to create a culminating senior experience in which previous course work in specific areas in the Neuroscience
Program can be brought to bear in a synthetic, interdisciplinary approach to understanding complex problems. The
specific goals for students in this seminar are (1) to evaluate original research and critically examine the experi-
mental evidence for theoretical issues, and (2) to gain an understanding of this discipline through group work and
oral presentations. Topics and instructional formats will vary somewhat from year to year, but in all cases the
course will emphasize an integrative approach in which students will be asked to consider topics from a range of
perspectives including molecular, cellular, systems, behavioral and clinical neuroscience. Previous topics have
included autism, depression, alcoholism, stress, neurogenesis, novel neuromodulators, retrograde messengers, and
synaptic plasticity.
Format: student-led discussions and presentations, three hours a week. Evaluation will be based on presentations,
participation in class discussion, and a term paper.
Prerequisites: open only to seniors in the Neuroscience program. Enrollment limit: 24 (expected: 18).
This course is required of all senior students in the Neuroscience program.
Hour: 1:10-3:50 W MARVIN
NSCI 493(F)-W31-494(S) Senior Thesis
Independent research for two semesters and a winter study under the guidance of one or more neuroscience
faculty. After reviewing the literature in a specialized field of neuroscience, students design and conduct an orig-
inal research project, the results of which are reported in a thesis. Senior thesis work is supervised by the faculty
participating in the program.
PERFORMANCE STUDIES

The Performance Studies Program provides an opportunity to inhabit an intellectual place where the making of
artistic and cultural meaning intersects with critical reflection on those processes. The program has as its primary
goal the bringing together of those students and faculty engaged in the creative arts, i.e., studio art, creative writing,
dance, film and video, music, and theater with those departments that reflect in part on those activities, e.g., An-
thropology and Sociology, Art History, Classics, Comparative Literature, English, History, Music, Philosophy,
Psychology, Legal Studies, Religion and Theatre. Central concepts and interactions to Performance Studies are:
action, the body, presence, ritual, representation, race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, politics, history and transcultural
experience.
Performance Studies strongly suggests that interested students take the introductory course (LATS 230) and
two of several recommended upper-level courses (AFR 305, AFR 400, ARTH 408, ARTH 461, LATS 330, LATS
331, LATS 375, WNY 310, or WNY 311).
Currently, the Program's status is as a program without a concentration. However, students can petition and
obtain a Performance Studies Contract Mayor. Students are encouraged to do five things: 1) take the introductory
course, which in 2008-09 is (LATS 230) Approaching Performance Studies; 2) take two advanced courses which
utilizes critical theory in relation to performance, such as (AFR 305) The Hip-Hop Generation; LATS (LATS 330)
The Aesthetics of Resistance; (LATS 331) Sound and Movement in the Afro-Latin Diaspora; (LATS 375) Perfor-
mance and Its Traces; (WNY 310) Art, Space and the City; (WNY 311) Imagining New York City; (AFR 400)
Race, Gender, Space; (ARTH 408) Contemporary Performance Art History: Space, Time, Action; (ARTH 461)
Writing About Bodies; 3) try different artistic media, both in the curriculum and beyond; 4) produce projects that
are a combination of art and performance with critical thinking about that process; and 5) prepare a portfolio of
their work.
As a senior year project, the Performance Studies Program strongly recommends the assembling of a senior
portfolio. Preparation of the portfolio should normally begin in the second semester of the junior year. It will be
done under the supervision of a member of the advisory faculty and will be submitted in the spring of the senior
year. What we suggest is that portfolios should draw on at least four projects or productions. They should show
critical self-reflection on the creative processes, a comparison of the artistic media employed and also demonstrate
performance criticism on the work of others.

PHILOSOPHY (Div. II)
Chair, Professor JANA SAWICKI
Professors: GERRARD, SAWICKI, WHITE**. Associate Professors: CRUZ, DUDLEY, MLADENOV-
IC. Assistant Professors: BARRY, MCPARTLAND. Harry C. Payne Distinguished Visiting Professor
in Liberal Arts: AL-ASM. Visiting Assistant Professor: J. PEDRONI.
To engage in philosophy is to ask a variety of questions about the world and our place in it. What can we know?
What should we do? What may we hope? What makes human beings human? These questions, in various forms,
and others like them are not inventions of philosophers; on the contrary, they occur to most people simply as they
live their lives. Many of us ask them as children, but later either ignore them, or accept answers we can live with.
Philosophers, however, seek to keep such questions open, and to address them through reasoned discussion and
argument, instead of accepting answers to them based on opinion or prejudice.
The program in philosophy is designed to aid students in thinking about these issues, by acquainting them with
influential work in the field, past and present, and by training them to grapple with these issues themselves. The
program emphasizes training in clear, critical thinking and in effective writing. Philosophy courses center around
class discussions and the writing of interpretive and critical essays.
MAJOR
Philosophy is a discipline with a long and intricate history, a history that remains an integral part of the disci-
pline. In this way, it differs dramatically from the natural sciences: for example, although no contemporary physi-
cists or biologists embrace Aristotle's physics or biology, among philosophers there continue to be champions of
Aristotle's metaphysics and of his ethics. Because of the richness and continuing importance of the history of phi-
losophy, the program is designed to give majors a historical background that will acquaint them with a wide vari-
ety of approaches in philosophical issues, and will provide them with a basis for evaluating and contributing to
contemporary debates.
A total of nine courses is required for the major in Philosophy. Students should begin with Philosophy 101 and
102, in either order; both are required for the major. These courses provide introductions to historical figures and
themes that continue to be influential in many contemporary discussions in the two major areas of philosophical
inquiry, i.e., practical inquiry into issues of ethics and politics, and theoretical inquiry into issues of knowledge,
Philosophy
­ 252 ­
belief, understanding, and reality. The final required course is the Senior Seminar, Philosophy 401. Each student
selects the six electives that complete the major. The exposure to figures and topics in 101 and 102 provides stu-
dents with some basis for choice, but optimal shaping of an individual curriculum requires in addition consultation
with faculty members and other students.
Generally speaking, as students progress from 100- to 300-level courses, there will be decreasing breadth and
increasing depth. In addition, writing assignments become longer, and students assume increasing responsibility
for identifying and developing the topics of their essays. Finally, students in 300-level courses are often required to
assume responsibility for making oral presentations or guiding significant parts of class discussions.
Students considering graduate study in philosophy are strongly urged to develop reading competence in Ger-
man, French, or Greek before graduation.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN PHILOSOPHY
The degree with honors in Philosophy is awarded to the student who has demonstrated outstanding achieve-
ment in a program of study that extends beyond the requirements of the major. The extension beyond major re-
quirements may take the form either of independent work culminating in a senior essay or thesis (the independent-
study route) or of additional course work (the directed-study route). Candidates must have GPAs of 3.6 or higher in
their courses in philosophy at the end of the junior and senior years. Juniors interested in pursuing honors should so
inform the Department Chair no later than mid-April.
The independent-study route to honors requires the completion and defense of either a senior essay produced in
the fall semester plus winter study period (maximum 40 pages) or a year-long senior thesis (maximum 75 pages).
Plans for either essay or thesis (including a brief proposal and bibliography, worked out in consultation with an
advisor) must be submitted to the department in April of the junior year. A recommendation for graduation with
honors will be made on the basis of the thoroughness, independence, and originality of the student's work.
The directed-study route to honors requires the completion of two courses in philosophy in addition to the nine
required for the major. Candidates taking this route must also submit to the department revised copies of two term
papers (10 pages or longer) written for philosophy courses they have taken; each student will be assigned an advis-
er to help guide the process of revision. A recommendation for graduation with honors will be made on the basis of
the scope of the student's course work, the quality of the student's participation in Philosophy 401, and the thor-
oughness, independence, and originality reflected in the submitted papers.
PHIL 101(F,S) Introduction to Moral and Political Philosophy (W)
Throughout the history of Western philosophy, there have been debates concerning how human beings should
live: What should we do both with our lives as wholes and in specific problematic situations? The debates have
addressed us both as individuals and as members of political communities. This course aims to aid us in respond-
ing to these debates, and in living our lives, on the basis of reasoned conclusions rather than from unrecognized
presuppositions. The course concentrates on Plato's Republic, the most influential ethical and political text within
Western philosophy, but we assess the Republic in light of elaborations and criticisms that have developed over the
past 2500 years, in works by Aristotle, Kant, and Mill.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: class discussion, frequent short papers (totaling 20-30 pages).
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 per section (expected: 19 per section). Preference given to first-year stu-
dents and sophomores.

PHIL 102(F,S) Introduction to Metaphysics and Epistemology (W)
Metaphysics and epistemology are the two core pursuits of theoretical philosophy (as opposed to practical philos-
ophy, the focus of Philosophy 101). Metaphysics is concerned with the ultimate character of reality. The metaphy-
sician seeks to develop knowledge (as opposed to mere opinion or belief) of all things natural, human, and divine.
She asks, for example: Are we free, or are our acts determined? Is there a God? If so, what must God be like?
Epistemology is concerned with how we determine the difference between knowledge and mere opinion. The
epistemologist thus asks: What does it mean truly to know something? How can we acquire such genuine knowl-
edge? Answers to these epistemological questions are essential if we are to have any confidence in the methods
and results of our metaphysical investigations. This course will emphasize the established historical classics that
provide the basis for understanding contemporary work on metaphysics and epistemological issues; we will con-
sider, among others, the work of Descartes, Hume, and Kant.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: class discussion, frequent short papers (totaling 20-30 pages).

PHIL 103(S) Logic and Language (Q)
Logic is the study of reasoning and argument. More particularly, it concerns itself with the difference between
good and bad reasoning, between strong and weak arguments. We all examine the virtues and vices of good argu-
ments in both informal and formal systems. The goals of this course are to improve the critical thinking of the
students, to introduce them to sentential and predicate logic, to familiarize them with enough formal logic to en-
able them to read some of the great works of philosophy, which use formal logic (such as Wittgenstein's Tracta-
tus), and to examine some of the connections between logic and philosophy.
Requirements: a midterm, a final, frequent homework and problems sets.

PHIL 202(S) Philosophy of Language and Philosophy of Mind (W)
This course is designed to introduce students to twentieth-century philosophy by focusing on two of its premier
research areas, language and mind. Each of these topics been studied independently of the other, with the philoso-
phy of language dominating the first half of the century and the philosophy of mind surging in the second half.
Research on language and mind have also enjoyed a fruitful liaison, as much of the technical apparatus of the
philosophy of language has been used to illuminate the mind. The other side of this coin is that language is some-
thing that minds achieve, and some prominent theories of linguistic meaning have emphasized psychological ele-
ments of language use. The course will begin with the work of Frege, Russell, and Wittgenstein, and end with the
work of Putnam, Dennett, Fodor and Churchland. The course is intended to prepare students for more advanced
research on either language or mind. At the same time, the course aims to offer an overview of the methods and
intellectual style of analytic philosophy. Thus, it will also serve as preparation for advanced work in epistemology,
philosophy of science, metaphysics, and ethics. The syllabus can be found at: http://www.williams.edu/philoso-
phy/fourth_layer/faculty_pages/jcruz/courses/lang&mind.html.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: short writing assignments each week, and two longer papers.

PHIL 209(F) Philosophy of Science
It is a generally held belief, in our times and culture, that science is the best source of our knowledge of the world,
and of ourselves. The aim of this course is to examine the origins, grounds, and nature of this belief. We will ana-
lyze and discuss various accounts of scientific method, structure and justification of scientific theories, scientific
choice, change, and the idea that scientific knowledge is progressive. The course will begin with the "received
view" of scientific theories, methods, and knowledge, advanced by logical positivists, which assumes the objec-
tivity and the rationality of science. We will then discuss philosophies of science that emerged out of various criti-
cisms of this view-especially those of Popper, Lakatos, Kuhn and Feyerabend-and the challenges to the assump-
tions of scientific objectivity and rationality their works provoked. This discussion will naturally lead us to the
relativist and social-constructivist views developed within contemporary science studies. Finally, we will analyze
the current debate about the cognitive credentials of science and the proper approach to the study of science, which
came to be known as "the science wars."
Requirements: frequent short assignments, class presentation, class participation, and a longer (5-7 pages) term
paper.

PHIL 213T(F) Biomedical Ethics (W)
Much like the construction of medical knowledge itself, it is from specific cases that general principles of biomedi-
cal ethics arise and are systematized into a theoretical framework, and it is to cases they must return, if they are to
be both useful and comprehensible to those making decisions within the biomedical context. In this tutorial we
will exploit this characteristic of biomedical ethics by using a case-based approach to examining core concepts of
the field. The first portion of the course will be devoted to developing and understanding four moral principles
which have come to be accepted as canonical: respect for autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice.
The remainder of the course will consider key concepts at the core of medical ethics and central issues for the field,
such as privacy and confidentiality, the distinction between killing and "letting die," therapy vs. research, and en-
hancement vs. therapy. To this end, each week we will (1) read philosophical material focused on one principle or
concept, and (2) consider in detail one bioethics case in which the principle or concept has special application or
relevance. In some weeks, students will be asked to choose from a small set which case they would like to address;
in others the case will be assigned. Students will meet with the professor in pairs for approximately one hour per
week, writing and presenting 5- to 7-page essays every other week, and commenting orally on partners' essays in
alternate weeks.
Format: tutorial. Evaluations will be based on written work, on oral presentations of that work, and on oral cri-
tiques.

ophy majors and students committed to taking the tutorial.

PHIL 220T(S) Immortality and the Soul in Ancient and Medieval Thought (Same as Religion
282T) (W)
According to a 2003 poll, 84% of Americans believe that the soul survives death. Ideas about immortality and the
soul have a long history, and have been at the center some of the major philosophical and religious traditions of
Philosophy
­ 254 ­
Western culture. The central aim of this course is to examine how some central figures in these traditions think
about immortality and the soul. In addition, we will discuss some of the philosophical difficulties that come to the
fore when thinking about these issues. Is the immortality of human persons even coherent? What would it mean
for an individual to survive her own death? Does belief in the indestructibility of the human soul have ethical
implications? What evidence is there for the existence, let alone immortality, of the soul?
Format: tutorial. Requirements: students will be expected to write a short paper every other week, and to give a
presentation based on their papers. They will also be expected to write a final paper. We will pay close attention to
revising papers in light of peer and instructor feedback. We will also work on critically reading and evaluating texts
in the history of philosophy. Readings for the class may include: Homer, Plato, Aristotle, Fragments from the Sto-
ics and Pre-Socratics, Plotinus, Origen, Tertullian, Augustine, Moses Maimonides, Ibn Sina, Averroes, and Aqui-
nas.

PHIL 235T(F) Morality and Partiality: Loyalty, Friendship, Patriotism (W)
The aim of this tutorial is to critically examine the nature, importance, and ethical value of personal attachments
and loyalties. Loyalty is frequently expected by family, friends and lovers, and demanded by institutions, religious
and political communities, as well as by the state. A person incapable of loyalty is often characterized as fickle,
cold, self-serving and sometimes even pathological. However, the status of loyalty as a virtue has always been
suspect: it has been argued that it is incompatible with impartiality, fairness and equality, and claimed that it is
always exclusionary. So, some relationships with other people -- such as friendships, familial ties, love, patriotism
-- seem to be ethically desirable, central to the quality of our lives, and yet prima facie in tension with the widely
held belief that morality requires impartiality and equal treatment of all human beings. Are we ever justified in
having more concern, and doing more, for our friends, family, community or nation? Does morality require that
we always subordinate our personal relationships to universal principles? Is patriotism incompatible with cosmo-
politanism, and if so, which of the two should we value? If loyalty is a virtue, what are the proper limits of its
cultivation and expression? Philosophical literature on this topic will include Plato and Aristotle on friendship and
civic virtues (supplemented by secondary literature), contemporary discussion of the moral value of personal rela-
tionships (B. Williams, A. Rorty, D. Velleman, L.A. Bloom, P. Railton) as well as texts on nationalism, patriotism,
cosmopolitanism and universal human rights written by contemporary philosophers, sociologists and political the-
orists (M. Nussbaum, R. Rorty, K.A. Appiah, S. Nathanson, I. Primoratz).

PHIL 272T(F) Free Will and Responsibility (W)
In moral and legal decisions we hold people responsible for their deliberate actions. This practice seems justified
as long as people are free to make the choices that they do. But which criteria must a decision meet in order to
qualify as free? Clearly, a free decision must not be the result of external coercion. But must the decision also be
free from any outside influence at all? If so then freedom may seem impossible, for we are all deeply influenced by
external factors ranging from the general laws of nature to specific features of our genetic endowment and social
environment including religion, political ideology, and advertising. These affect not only our particular choices but
also, more fundamentally, who we are and what we value. Since it is undeniable that we are pervasively influenced
by such forces, the real question is whether, and how, free choice is possible amidst all of these influences. In this
course we will examine the best-known recent philosophical attempts to make sense of the nature of free will and
responsibility. Since these issues have a direct bearing on which theory of legal punishment we should accept, we
will also examine influential theories of punishment. Our focus will be on works by contemporary authors.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: students meet with the instructor in pairs for roughly an hour each week; each
student will write a 5- to 6-page paper every other week (6 in all) and comment on his or her tutorial partner's

PHIL 280(F) Frege, Russell, and the Early Wittgenstein
The last line of Ludwig Wittgenstein's Tractatus famously reads: "Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be
silent." Are there things that cannot be put into words? What are the limits of language? What is the nature of
language? How do logic and language relate? We will examine these (and other questions) in the context of the
great philosophical revolution at the beginning of the last century: the linguistic turn and the birth of analytic phi-
losophy. We will see how a focus on language affects our understanding of many traditional philosophical ques-
tions, ranging from epistemology and metaphysics to aesthetics and ethics. Our texts will include Gottlob Frege,
The Foundations of Arithmetic, Bertrand Russell, Principles of Mathematics, and Ludwig Wittgenstein, Tractatus
Logico-Philosophicus.

You will see that if the barber does not shave himself, then by condition (a) he does shave himself. And, if the
barber does shave himself, then by condition (b) he does not shave himself. Thus, the barber shaves himself if and
only if he does not shave himself. See if you can figure out why this is sometimes called a paradox, and then ask
yourself what this has to do with our opening questions.
Format: seminar. Requirements: two short papers (5 pages) and one longer final paper (12-15 pages).

PHIL 290(S) The Philosophy and Economics of Higher Education (Same as Economics 214 and
INTR 290) (W)
Students compete ferociously for the opportunity to pay large sums of money for the privilege of attending Wil-
liams College. The value of the educational experience they receive is usually taken to be self-evident. Less ob-
vious, however, are the nature of education, and the factors that determine how much it costs, who has access to it,
and how successful it is.
This interdisciplinary seminar will explore both the philosophy and the economics of higher education. Which
purposes can and should college serve? Which curricular and extra-curricular programs best accomplish those
purposes? How can we measure and evaluate the effects of policies concerning college admission, pricing, and
financial aid? How can we assess and enhance educational productivity?
Students will read and discuss texts in the philosophy of education, while also learning to apply economic theory
and econometric techniques to the analysis of educational issues.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: Evaluation will be based upon the writing and revision of three 8-page
papers, as well as the quality of contributions to class discussion.
Prerequisites: Economics 110 and at least one philosophy course. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference

PHIL 301(S) Textual Meaning and Interpretation (Same as Linguistics 330) (W)
Early philosophy of language focused on meaning of assertions, denials and descriptions. However, this approach
is too narrow, since people use language to do a myriad of things: to ask, demand, promise, praise, blame, threaten,
command, insinuate, evoke, express feelings, and sometimes just to play. The philosophical study of what we do
in language, and how we understand one another, is called pragmatics; within the analytic tradition, the main phil-
osophical contributions to the study of pragmatics in language came from Peirce, Wittgenstein, Austen, Grice and
Searle. Other philosophers and literary theorists have used some of their ideas recently to throw light on the nature
of textual meaning and the interpretation of literary texts. We shall first explore the salient features of the pragmatic
approaches to language, paying special attention to Austin's notion of illocutionary force and Grice's notion of
non-natural meaning. We will then examine how these notions may be exploited in the consideration of various
long-standing issues in the theory of literary interpretation. We will discuss the importance of specific genre con-
ventions and broader contextual matters to the interpretation of literary texts (along the lines suggested by Quentin
Skinner); the possibility of using intention to rule out mistaken and arrive at acceptable interpretations, if not a
single correct interpretation (a possibility denied by such relativists as Stanley Fish); the use and meaning of meta-
phors; and the host of questions surrounding the "intentional fallacy" (the alleged result of invoking authorial
intention to determine textual meaning).
Format: seminar. Requirements: class participation, 10 short weekly response papers, and 2 longer (5-7 page) pa-
pers.

PHIL 304T(S) Authenticity: From Rousseau to Poststructuralism (W)
The eighteenth-century aesthetician Edward Young once asked: "Born originals, how comes it to pass we die cop-
ies?" In the same century, Jean-Jacques Rousseau answers this question about the origins of authenticity by chart-
ing the individual's "fall" into society; that is, into artifice, hypocrisy, vanity, and conformism. This tutorial begins
with Rousseau's reflections on authentic individuality as they are developed in several of his works. We then trace
the idea of authenticity (as an aesthetic and ethical category) in both literary and philosophical texts associated
with romanticism, existentialism, Marxian critical theory, and the self-analysis of the psychoanalytic tradition. We
conclude with recent challenges to the coherence, viability, and value of the ideal of authenticity as it applies not
only to individuality, but also to group identities and "artifacts". Themes and questions investigated include the
following: (1) Must "authenticity" refer to some notion of an innate core or deep self? Are there other terms in
which we can imagine "being ourselves"?; (2) Can one adopt authenticity as a project? ;(3) Does being authentic
require that one defy social conventions in favor of the "natural" or "instinctual"? Is it compatible with adopting
conventional roles or forms of selfhood, with belonging to a community, with being "civilized" or with an artful
self-styling?; (4) What impact do the rise of bourgeois society, the machine age, consumerism, and mass media
have on the possibilities for authenticity?; (5) Is the voice and style of authenticity necessarily simple, direct, and
sincere? ; (6) Are particular versions of the ideal of authenticity either gender- or racially-inflected?
Students will work with partners. Each student will write and present orally an essay of 5-6 pages every other
week on an assigned topic in the reading for that week. Students not presenting an essay will offer critiques of their
partner's essay.
Format: tutorial. Evaluation will be based on written work, oral presentation of essays, and critiques.

PHIL 308(S) Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations
Bertrand Russell claimed that Ludwig Wittgenstein was "perhaps the most perfect example I have ever known of
genius as traditionally conceived--passionate, profound, intense, and dominating." Wittgenstein's two master-
pieces, the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus and the Philosophical Investigations, stand like opposing poles around
which schools of twentieth-century analytic philosophy revolve. The Wittgenstein of the Tractatus is known as the
"earlier Wittgenstein," the Wittgenstein of the Investigations is known as the "later Wittgenstein." This course is
an intensive, line-by-line study of the Investigations--one of the greatest (and thus, one of the most controversial)
books in the history of philosophy. Aside from its overwhelming influence on late-twentieth-century philosophy
and intellectual culture, any book which contains the remark, "if a lion could talk, we could not understand him,"
deserves serious attention.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: one short midterm paper (5-7 pages) and one longer final paper (12-15
pages).
Prerequisites: Philosophy 102. Philosophy 202 or another course in analytic philosophy highly recommended.

PHIL 310(S) Evil
What is evil, and why does it exist? Can nature be evil, or is all evil attributable to the freely willed actions of
human beings? Is evil compatible with God, or is it a powerful argument for atheism? Can evil be understood, or is
it necessarily incomprehensible? These persistent and perplexing questions, which arise from the suffering of
people in every time and place, have drawn the sustained attention of the greatest thinkers in the Western philo-
sophical tradition. This course will examine some of the most important and influential responses to the problems
that the existence of evil poses. We will begin with Leibniz, who coined the term "theodicy" to name the project of
defending God from the charge that a truly perfect being could not have created a world that contains evil. Other
authors to be considered may include: Rousseau, Kant, Hegel, Marx, Voltaire, Hume, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche,
Freud, Camus, and Arendt. In the course of our reflections we will discuss some of the events that make evil not
merely an intellectual challenge, but also an immediate and pressing practical concern, including Auschwitz, 9/11,
and Hurricane Katrina.
Format: discussion. Requirements: several short assignments, final research paper, attendance, and participation.

PHIL 330(F) Plato (Same as Classics 330) (W)
Plato is one of the most important and influential thinkers in the history of the western tradition. His depiction of
the trial and death of Socrates is one of the classics of western literature, and his views on ethics and politics con-
tinue to occupy a central place in our discussions 2400 years after they were written. It is, in fact, quite difficult to
get through any course of study in the liberal arts without some familiarity with Plato. Nevertheless, comparatively
few people realize that the views we commonly think of as "Platonic" represent only one strand in Plato's thought.
For example, we commonly attribute to Plato a theory of the Forms on the basis of his claims in the so-called
"middle dialogues" (mainly Republic, Phaedo, and Symposium). However, in his philosophically more sophisti-
cated and notoriously difficult later dialogues (such as the Parmenides, Philebus, Sophist and Statesman), Plato
engages in radical criticism and revision of his earlier views. In this course, we will spend the first third of the
semester attempting to understand the metaphysics and epistemology in Plato's middle dialogues. We will spend
the balance of the semester coming to grips with Plato's arguments in the later dialogues. We will read several
complete dialogues in translation, and will also read a wide variety of secondary source material.
Format: lecture/discussion. This class will be a roughly equal mixture of lectures, student presentations, and semi-
nar discussion. Requirements: students will be expected to prepare a seminar presentation, to write several focused
short analytical pieces, and to write a 15- to 20-page term paper in multiple drafts.
Prerequisites: Philosophy 101, Philosophy 102 or permission of instructor. (A prior course in logic will be ex-
tremely helpful, but is not necessary.) Enrollment limit: 15 (expected: 15). Preference given to upper-level philoso-
phy and classics majors. This course is part of the Critical Reasoning and Analytical Skills initiative.

PHIL 331(S) Contemporary Epistemology (W)
Epistemology is one of the core areas of philosophical reflection. In this course, we will study the literature in
contemporary philosophy on the nature of knowledge and rational belief. Epistemologists seek answers to the
following kinds of questions:
--When is it rational to have a particular belief?
--What is knowledge (as opposed to mere opinion)?
--In order to be justified in holding a belief, must someone know (or believe) that she is justified in holding that
belief?
--What, if anything, justifies our scientific knowledge?
These questions are typically asked within a framework where the overarching goal is attaining truth and avoiding
falsity. Beyond this common ground, however, epistemologists are much divided. Some maintain that these issues
are solely the provinces of philosophy, using traditional a priori methods. Others maintain that these questions will
only yield to methods that incorporate our broader insight into the nature of the world including, perhaps, feminist
thought or science. Both stances face severe difficulties. Further, even where there is agreement as to the proper
way of answering epistemological questions, there is a stunning variety of possible answers to each question. The
syllabus can be found at: http://www.williams.edu/philosophy/fourth_layer/faculty_pages/jcruz/courses/episty.html
Format: seminar. Requirements: short writing assignments each week, and a final paper written in several drafts.
Prerequisites: Philosophy 102 or permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 5-12). Preference

PHIL 335(S) Contemporary Metaethics (W)
We often speak as if moral judgments can be true or false, well-reasoned or not. But how should objectivity in this
domain be understood? Is moral objectivity like scientific objectivity, assuming we have a clear sense of what that
Philosophy
­ 258 ­
involves? If not, should that concern us? Are there other models for understanding moral objectivity besides sci-
ence? While answers to such questions are implicit in historically important accounts of morality, these issues
became the topic of explicit, sustained debate in the twentieth century. Our focus will be on the most recent and
sophisticated work in this area. We will examine several different approaches in depth, including realism,
constructivism, expressivism, and skepticism. Readings will include works by Moore, Stevenson, Harman,
Mackie, Railton, Boyd, Blackburn, Williams, McDowell, Korsgaard, and Nagel.
Format: seminar. Requirements: final paper, several shorter assignments, attendance and participation.
Prerequisites: Philosophy 101 required; one 200- or 300-level Philosophy course is recommended. Enrollment

PHIL 350T(S) Beauty (W)
Until modernity, there was widespread agreement among philosophers that beauty is the fundamental aesthetic
value, that beauty is real, and that beauty is present in nature as well as in works of art. Since the 17th century, these
traditional views have weakened. Increasingly many artistic and aesthetic values have been distinguished from
beauty (these include sublimity and ugliness), all such values are often deemed to be subjective--"in the eye of the
beholder"--and many philosophers restrict aesthetic values to works of art (or only to experiences of works of
art). This tutorial is devoted to an examination of these and related issues: among aesthetic and artistic values, what
status should we accord to beauty? To what degree, if any, is beauty (and are, perhaps, other aesthetic values)
matters of fact rather than merely of opinion? Is there aesthetic value only in--or is there aesthetic experience only
of--works of art? Is there no beauty in nature, or in experiences of nature?
Format: tutorial. Requirements/Method of Evaluation: students will meet as paired. Each week, on the basis of
assigned readings, one student in each pair will write and present a paper of 6-8 pages, the other student will re-
spond, and the two will discuss both issues addressed in the paper and other issues from the readings. Criteria for
evaluation are quality of papers, quality of presentations, quality of responses, and quality of discussions.
Prerequisites: Philosophy 101 or 102 or permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Prefer-
ence given to actual and potential philosophy majors.

PHIL 401(F) Senior Seminar: Truth and Rationality
Humans take pride in being rational animals: we define ourselves, in no small part, by our capacity to offer and
evaluate reasons in support of our theoretical and practical commitments. The attempt to justify our beliefs and
practices makes us concerned with the truth. What we should think and how we should live depend upon what is
true about the world and ourselves. But what is the truth, and how can we know it? What are the criteria of rational
belief and action? These questions, which have defined philosophy since its inception, remain central to, and hotly
contested within, every area of philosophical inquiry. This seminar will begin with some of the best and most
influential contemporary work on truth and rationality. Students will then have the opportunity to pursue the par-
ticular aspects of these general themes that are of greatest interest to them. Students will be responsible for presen-
tations on the assigned readings, and for the development of a final paper involving independent research.

The instructional Physical Education Program at Williams is an integral part of the student's total educational
experience. As a part of the liberal arts concept, the program develops the mind-body relationship, which is depen-
dent upon the proper integration of physical and intellectual capacities. The main objective of the physical educa-
tion program is to develop in each student an appreciation of physical fitness and wellness, and to expose them to a
variety of activities that are suitable for lifetime participation.
Four credits of Physical Education represent one of the requirements for the College degree. There are five
physical education units during the year. In the fall academic semester, there are two six-week physical education
quarters. Winter Study is another unit, and there are two physical education quarters in the spring academic semes-
ter. Two different activities must be completed. Students may sigh up for PE classes online.
The following courses are offered at various times during the year. A schedule listing all courses offered is
issued to every student before each quarter and Winter Study. Classes may vary according to availability of
instructors and interest of students.

What is light? How does a transistor work? What is a black hole? Why are metals shiny? What is the wave/par-
ticle duality? There are people for whom questions like these are of more than passing interest; some of them
become Physics or Astrophysics majors. A physics student experiments with the phenomena by which the physi-
cal world is known and explores the mathematical techniques and theories that make sense of it. A Physics or
Astrophysics major serves as preparation for further work in physics, astrophysics, applied physics, other sciences,
engineering, medical research, science teaching and writing, and other careers involving insight into the funda-
mental principles of nature.
ASTROPHYSICS MAJOR
The Physics Department, in cooperation with the Astronomy Department, offers a major in astrophysics con-
sisting of (at least): 6 or 7 courses in Physics, 3 or 4 in Astronomy, and 1 in Mathematics. The core sequence of the
Astrophysics major is the same as the Physics major described below (except that Physics 302, although strongly
recommended, is not required). Students intending to pursue graduate study in astrophysics will need to take up-
per-level physics electives beyond the basic requirements for the major. Honors work in Astrophysics may be in
either physics or astronomy. Students majoring in Astrophysics are expected to consult early and often with facul-
ty from both departments in determining their course selections. The detailed description of the Astrophysics ma-
jor is given under "Astronomy," along with a description of the Astronomy major also offered by that department
(see page 94).
PHYSICS MAJOR
Introductory courses
Students considering a major in physics should take both physics and mathematics as first-year students. A
student normally begins with either Physics 131 or Physics 141:
Physics
­ 260 ­
1) Physics 131 Particles and Waves. This is designed as a first course in physics. It is suitable for students who
either have not had physics before or have had some physics but are not comfortable solving "word problems" that
require calculus.
2) Physics 141 Particles and Waves--Enriched. Students in this course should have solid backgrounds in sci-
ence and calculus, either from high school or college, including at least a year of high school physics.
The Department of Mathematics will place students in the appropriate introductory calculus course. The phys-
ics major sequence courses all make use of calculus at increasingly sophisticated levels. Therefore, students con-
sidering a Physics major should continue their mathematical preparation without interruption through the
introductory calculus sequence (Mathematics 103, 104, and 105 or 106). Students are encouraged to take Physics
210 as early as possible. Physics 210 is cross listed as Mathematics 210 for the benefit of those students who wish
to have the course listed with a MATH prefix.
Advanced Placement
Students with unusually strong backgrounds in calculus and physics may place out of Physics 141 and either: 1)
begin with the special seminar course Physics 151 in the fall (typically followed by Physics 210 in the spring), or
2) begin with Physics 142 in the spring (possibly along with Physics 210). Students may take either 151 or 142 but
not both. On rare occasions a student with an exceptional background will be offered the option of enrolling in
Physics 201.
Placement is based on AP scores, consultation with the department, and results of a placement exam adminis-
tered during First Days. The exam can also be taken later in the year by arrangement with the department chair.
The exam covers classical mechanics, basic wave phenomena, and includes some use of calculus techniques.
Requirements for the Major
A total of ten courses in physics and mathematics are required to complete the Physics major. Students who
place out of both Physics 141 and Physics 142 and begin their studies in Physics 201 are required to take a
total of nine courses.
Required Physics Sequence Courses
Physics 141 Particles and Waves--Enriched
or Physics 131 Particles and Waves
Physics 142 Foundations of Modern Physics
or Physics 151 Seminar in Modern Physics
Physics 201 Electricity and Magnetism
Physics 202 Waves and Optics
Physics 210 Mathematical Methods for Scientists
Physics 301 Quantum Physics
Physics 302 Statistical Physics
Required Mathematics Course
Mathematics 105 Multivariable Calculus or Mathematics 106 Multivariable Calculus
Students entering with Advanced Placement in mathematics may obtain credit toward the major for the equiva-
lent Mathematics 105 or 106 taken elsewhere.
At least two more physics or other approved courses must be taken, bringing the total number of courses for the
major to ten.
Options
1) Mathematics 104 may be counted if taken at Williams
2) Mathematics 209 may substitute for Physics 210.
3) Astronomy 111 may count in place of Physics 141 if a student places out of 141 (see "advanced place-
ment" above).
4) An additional Astronomy or Astrophysics course above the introductory level that is acceptable for the
astrophysics major may be counted.
5) Two approved Division III courses above the introductory level may be substituted for one Physics course.
Approval is on an individual basis at the discretion of the department chair.
6) Honors work is in addition to completion of the basic major so Physics 493 and 494 do not count towards
the ten courses in the major.
Preparation for Advanced Study
Students who may wish to do graduate work in physics, astrophysics, or engineering should elect courses in
both physics and mathematics beyond the minimum major requirements. The first-year graduate school curricu-
lum in physics usually includes courses in quantum mechanics, electromagnetic theory, and classical mechanics
that presuppose intermediate level study of these subjects as an undergraduate. Therefore, students planning grad-
uate work in physics should elect all of the following courses:
Physics 402T Applications of Quantum Mechanics
Physics 405T Electromagnetic Theory
Physics 411T Classical Mechanics
Advising
Both majors and non-majors are encouraged to consult with the department chair or course instructors about
course selections or other matters.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN PHYSICS
The degree with honors in Physics will be awarded on the basis of a senior thesis presenting the results of a
substantial experimental or theoretical investigation carried out under the direction of a faculty member in the
Physics
­ 261 ­
department. There is no rigid grade point average required for admission to the program or for the awarding of the
degree with honors, but it is normally expected that honors students will maintain at least a B average in physics
and mathematics. Students will normally apply for admission to the program early in the spring of their junior year
and during senior year these students will normally elect Physics 493, W31, and 494 in addition to the usual re-
quirements for the major. At the end of winter study, the department will decide whether the student will be ad-
mitted to honors candidacy. Both a written thesis and a colloquium presentation of the results are required. The
degree with honors will be awarded to those who meet these requirements with distinction. The degree withhigh-
est honors will be awarded to those who fulfill them with unusually high distinction.
Honors candidates will also be required to participate in departmental colloquium talks.
STUDY ABROAD
The physics community is international in scope and a career in physics (or a related field) can provide many
opportunities for travel and contact with individuals from outside the United States. The physics major at Williams
is a carefully structured four-year program designed to prepare students who are so inclined for graduate study at
leading research institutions. While it is possible to complete the major requirements in three years, such a major
will not usually not lead to further study in the field. With careful early planning on the part of a student, and close
consultation with the department chair, it is possible to complete a strong major and still study abroad provided the
foreign institution can provide courses which reasonably substitute or supplement those in the Williams major
program.
OPTIONS FOR NON-MAJORS
Many students want to take a self-contained and rigorous full-year survey of physics. For such students, the
most appropriate sequence will be either Physics 131 or Physics 141 followed by Physics 132, depending on the
student's background in science and mathematics (see Introductory Courses above). Either of these sequences
satisfies the physics requirement for medical school.
The department also offers one semester courses designed for non-majors. This year there are three such offer-
ings: Physics 107, 108 and Physics 109.
PHYS 107(F) Newton, Einstein, and Beyond (Q)
This course follows a quest to understand the nature of space, time, matter, and energy, one that continues to this
day. We will focus on two scientific theories that revolutionized our understanding of the physical world, Newto-
nian mechanics (developed in the late 17th century) and Einstein's special relativity (developed in the early 20th
century). As we explore these theories, we will pay special attention to the very different stories they tell about
space and time. We will conclude the semester by touching upon recent developments in cosmology, where ob-
servations have led to dramatic surprises about the make-up of our universe, and particle physics, where the Large
Hadron Collider experiment is poised to extend our understanding of nature to higher energies and shorter dis-
tances.
This course is intended for students whose primary interests lie outside of the natural sciences and mathematics.
The mathematics used will be algebra and trigonometry. Every student will have three meetings every week.
Some weeks the three meetings will be lectures (MWF 10-10:50), other weeks there will be two lectures (MF
10-10:50), and one conference section.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; problem-solving conference section, one hour per week. Evaluation will be
based on weekly problem sets, quizzes, two midterms, and a final exam, all with a significant quantitative compo-
nent (see the description of the QFR requirement).
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 100 (expected: 70). Preference given to students based on seniority.
Hour: 10:00-10:50 MF Conferences: 10-10:50 W; 1-1:50 T,R TUCKER-SMITH
PHYS 108(S) Energy Science and Technology (Same as Environmental Studies 108) (Q)
Energy use has skyrocketed in the United States and elsewhere in the world, causing significant economic and
political shifts, as well as concerns for the environment. This course will address the physics and technology of
energy generation, consumption, and conservation. It will cover a wide range of energy sources, including fossil
fuels, hydropower, solar energy, wind energy, and nuclear energy. We will discuss energy use in transportation,
manufacturing, building heating, and building lighting. Students will learn to compare the efficiencies and envi-
ronmental impacts of various energy sources and uses.
Format: lecture once a week plus weekly conference section. Evaluation will be based on weekly assignments,
quizzes, two hour tests, and a final project. All of these will be substantially quantitative.
No prerequisites. This course will make use of quantitative arguments and an acquaintance with high school phys-
ics and chemistry will prove helpful. Enrollment limit: 40 (expected: 30).
Hour: 1:10-2:25 M Conferences: 1:10-2:25 R, 2:35-3:50 R STRAIT
PHYS 109(S) Sound, Light, and Perception (Q)
Light and sound allow us to perceive the world around us, from appreciating music and art to learning the details
of atomic structure. Because of their importance in human experience, light and sound have long been the subject
of scientific inquiry. How are sound and light related? How do physiology and neural processing allow us to hear
and see the world around us? What are the origins of color and musical pitch? This course introduces the science
and technology of light and sound to students not majoring in physics. We will start with the origins of sound and
light as wave phenomena, and go on to topics including color, the optics of vision, the meaning of musical pitch
and tone, and the physical basis of hearing. We will also discuss some recent technological applications of light,
such as lasers and optical communications. The class will meet for two 75-minute periods each week for a variable
mixture of lecture, discussion, and hands-on, interactive experiments.
Format: lecture/lab/discussion. Each student will attend the Thursday lecture plus one conference section weekly.
Evaluation will be based on class participation, problem sets, in-class exams, oral presentations, and a final exam,
all with a quantitative component.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 40 (expected: 40).

PHYS 131(F) Particles and Waves (Q)
We focus first on the Newtonian mechanics of point particles: the relationship between velocity, acceleration, and
position; the puzzle of circular motion; forces; Newton's laws; energy and momentum; and gravitation. The phys-
ics of extended objects and of fluids also will be discussed briefly. We finally turn to the basic properties of waves,
such as interference and polarization, with emphasis on light waves. This course is intended for students who have
not studied physics before or who have had some physics, but are not comfortable solving "word problems" that
require calculus. Students who scored 4 or 5 on the AP Physics B exam or on the AP Physics C (mechanics) exam,
or 6 or 7 on the IB Physics HL exam may not take this course. These students and others with strong backgrounds
in the sciences are encouraged to consider taking Physics 141 instead. Physics 131 can lead to either Physics 132
(for students wanting a one-year survey of physics) or Physics 142 (for students considering a physics or astro-
physics major).
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours every other week. Evaluation will be based on week-
ly problem sets, hour tests, labs, and a final exam, all of which have a substantial quantitative component.
Prerequisites: Mathematics 103. No enrollment limit (expected: 60).
Hour: 11:00-11:50 MWF Lab: 1-4 M,T,W STRAIT
PHYS 132(S) Electromagnetism and the Physics of Matter (Q)
This course is intended as the second half of a one-year survey of physics. In the first half of the semester we will
focus on electromagnetic phenomena. We will introduce the concept of electric and magnetic fields, and study in
detail the way in which electrical circuits and circuit elements work. The deep connection between electric and
magnetic phenomena is highlighted in a discussion of Faraday's Law of Induction. In the second half of the se-
mester, we introduce several of the most central topics in twentieth-century physics. We will discuss Einstein's
theory of special relativity as well as aspects of quantum theory. We will end with a treatment of nuclear physics,
radioactivity, and uses of radiation.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours every other week. Evaluation will be based on week-
ly problem sets, labs, hour tests, and a final exam, all of which have a substantial quantitative component.
Prerequisites: Physics 131 or 141 or permission of instructor, and Mathematics 103. No enrollment limit (ex-
pected: 60).
Hour: 11:00-11:50 MWF Lab: 1-4 M,T,W STRAUCH
PHYS 141(F) Particles and Waves--Enriched (Q)
This course covers the same topics as Physics 131, but with a higher level of mathematical sophistication and
more emphasis on waves. It is intended for students with solid backgrounds in the sciences, either from high
school or college, who feel comfortable solving "word problems" that require calculus. Physics 141 can lead to
either Physics 132 (for students wanting a one-year survey of physics) or Physics 142 (for students considering a
physics or astrophysics major).
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours every other week/conference, one hour every other
week. Evaluation will be based on weekly problem sets, quizzes and hour tests, and labs, all of which have a
substantial quantitative component.
Prerequisites: high school physics and Mathematics 103 (or equivalent placement). No enrollment limit (expected:
50).

PHYS 142(S) Foundations of Modern Physics (Q)
The twentieth century was an extremely productive and exciting time for physics. Special relativity has extended
physics into the realm of high speeds and high energies. Quantum mechanics has successfully described phenom-
ena at small energies and small distance scales. Our understanding of atoms, molecules, and solids has developed
from a few revolutionary ideas into a sophisticated framework which today supports technologies that were uni-
magined in 1900. This course will introduce many important developments in physics, including special relativity,
Schrodinger's wave mechanics, the quantum mechanical understanding of the periodic table and the theory of
energy bands in solids.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours every other week/conference, one hour every other
week. Evaluation will be based on weekly homework, labs, two hour tests, and a final exam, all of which have a
substantial quantitative component.
Prerequisites: Physics 141 and Mathematics 103, or equivalent; students may not take both Physics 142 and Phys-
ics 151. Physics 131 may substitute for Physics 141 with the permission of instructor. No enrollment limit (ex-
pected:30).
Hour: 11:00-11:50 MWF Lab: 1-4 M,T WOOTTERS
PHYS 151(F) Seminar in Modern Physics (Q)
Why does a hot coal glow red rather than blue or green or some other color? Remarkably, this simple question
could not be answered before the year 1900, because the answer depends on a radical assumption introduced in
that year by Max Planck. His work on thermal radiation marked the beginning of a revolutionary era in the history
of physics that culminated in a new framework for our understanding of the physical world. Relativity, quantum
mechanics, and statistical physics are the pillars of the modern framework, and constitute the core of this course.
As we study this material, we will also be exploring the process of research in physics, partly by doing some ex-
periments of our own. We will discuss the interaction between experiment and theory, as well as the roles of sim-
plicity, elegance, and unity in the search for explanations. This is a small seminar designed for first-year students
who have placed out of Physics 141.
Format: lecture/discussion, three hours per week; laboratory, every other week. Evaluation will be based on class
participation, labs, weekly problem sets, an oral presentation, two hour-exams and a final exam, all of which have
a substantial quantitative component.

PHYS 201(F) Electricity and Magnetism (Q)
In this course, we study electromagnetic phenomena and their mathematical description. Topics include electro-
statics, magnetic fields, and electromagnetic induction, DC and AC circuits, and the electromagnetic properties of
matter. We also introduce Maxwell's equations, which express in remarkably succinct form the essence of the
theory.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based weekly quizzes,
problem sets, labs, two hour tests, and a final exam, all of which have a substantial quantitative component.

PHYS 202(S) Waves and Optics (Q)
Waves and oscillations characterize many different physical systems, including vibrating strings, springs, water
waves, sound waves, electromagnetic waves, and gravitational waves. Quantum mechanics even describes par-
ticles with wave functions. Despite these diverse settings waves exhibit several common characteristics, so that the
understanding of a few simple systems can provide insight into a wide array of phenomena. In this course we
begin with the study of oscillations of simple systems with only a few degrees of freedom. We then move on to
study transverse and longitudinal waves in continuous media in order to gain a general description of wave behav-
ior. The rest of the course focuses on electromagnetic waves and in particular on optical examples of wave phe-
nomena. In addition to well known optical effects such as interference and diffraction, we will study a number of
modern applications of optics such as short pulse lasers and optical communications. Throughout the course math-
ematical methods useful for higher-level physics will be introduced.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on problem sets,
labs, two one-hour tests, and a final exam, all of which have a substantial quantitative component.
Prerequisite: Physics 201. Co-requisite: Physics/Mathematics 210 or permission of instructor. No enrollment limit

Hour: 10:00-10:50 MWF Lab: 1-4 M,W LOPES
PHYS 210(S) Mathematical Methods for Scientists (Same as Mathematics 210) (Q)
This course covers a variety of mathematical methods used in the sciences, focusing particularly on the solution of
ordinary and partial differential equations. In addition to calling attention to certain special equations that arise
frequently in the study of waves and diffusion, we develop general techniques such as looking for series solutions
and, in the case of nonlinear equations, using phase portraits and linearizing around fixed points. We study some
simple numerical techniques for solving differential equations. A series of optional sessions in Mathematica will
be offered for students who are not already familiar with this computational tool.
Format: lecture, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on weekly problem sets and several in-class ex-
ams, all of which have a substantial quantitative component.
Prerequisites: Mathematics 105 or 106 and familiarity with Newtonian mechanics at the level of Physics 131. No
enrollment limit (expected: 20).
Hour: 9:55-11:10 TR TUCKER-SMITH
PHYS 301(F) Quantum Physics (Q)
This course serves as a one-semester introduction to the history, formalism, and phenomenology of quantum me-
chanics. We begin with a discussion of the historical origins of the quantum theory, and the Schroedinger wave
equation. The concepts of matter waves and wave-packets are introduced. Solutions to one-dimensional problems
will be treated prior to introducing the system which serves as a hallmark of the success of quantum theory, the
three-dimensional hydrogen atom. In the second half of the course, we will develop the important connection be-
tween the underlying mathematical formalism and the physical predictions of the quantum theory. We then go on
to apply this knowledge to several important problems within the realm of atomic and nuclear physics.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on weekly prob-
lem sets, labs, a midterm exam, and final exam, all of which have a substantial quantitative component.
Prerequisites: Physics 202 and Physics 210. No enrollment limit (expected:15).

PHYS 302(S) Statistical Physics (Q)
You understand the interactions among fundamental particles (Newton's and Coulomb's laws, the Schrodinger
equation, etc.) but how do these interactions determine the behavior of macroscopic objects, which are made up of
huge numbers of such particles? This is a rather critical question for understanding the world around us. In this
course we will develop the tools of statistical physics, which will allow us to predict the cooperative phenomena
that emerge in large ensembles of interacting particles. We will apply those tools to a wide variety of physical
questions, including the behavior of gasses, heat engines, magnets, and electrons in solids.
Format: lecture/discussion, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on
weekly problem sets, exams, and labs, all of which have a substantial quantitative component.

(Same as Mathematics 316) (Q)
Living in the early decades of the information age, we find ourselves depending more and more on codes that
protect messages against either noise or eavesdropping. We begin this course by studying the history of this sub-
Physics, Political Economy
­ 264 ­
ject, including, for example, the story of the enigma code from World War II. We then examine some of the most
important codes currently being used to protect information, including linear codes, which in addition to being
mathematically elegant are the most practical codes for error correction, and the RSA public key cryptographic
scheme, popular nowadays for internet applications. Looking ahead by a decade or more, we show how a "quan-
tum computer" could crack any RSA code in short order, and how quantum cryptographic devices will achieve
security through the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.
Evaluation will be based on homework sets and exams.

PHYS 402T(S) Applications of Quantum Mechanics (Q)
This course will explore a number of important topics in quantum mechanics such as perturbation theory and the
semiclassical interaction of atoms and radiation. Research or review articles from the physics literature will be
assigned to supplement standard texts and to help motivate discussion. Applications and examples will be taken
mostly from atomic physics with some discussion of precision measurements and fundamental symmetries.
The class as a whole will meet once a week for 50 minutes to discuss questions on the reading. Each student will
also be assigned to a tutorial meeting with the instructor and one or two other students, at which the students will
take turns presenting solutions to assigned problems. Written solutions to selected problems will be due a few days
later.

tors, numerical solutions, approximation methods, the calculus of variations, the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian re-
formulations of mechanics, rotating frames of reference (with emphasis on the implications for physics on the
Earth) and scattering cross sections. The carry over of ideas developed in the context of classical mechanics into
other areas of physics will be explored. The class as a whole will meet once per week for an introductory lecture/
discussion. A second tutorial meeting between the instructor and a pair of students will be scheduled later in the
week. Students will take turns working and discussing problems at the chalkboard. Written solutions will be due
later in the week.

The Political Economy major is designed to give students a grasp of the ways in which political and economic
forces interact in the shaping of public policy. The major includes substantial study of the central analytical ap-
proaches in both political science and economics and seeks to surmount the sometimes artificial barriers of spe-
Political Economy
­ 265 ­
cialization that may characterize either discipline taken by itself. In the junior and senior years a conscious merging
of the approaches in the two fields is undertaken in the three required Political Economy courses. (These courses
are designed by, and usually are taught jointly by, political scientists and economists.) Political Economy 301 ex-
amines major writings in political economy and analyzes economic liberalism and critiques of economic liberal-
ism in the context of current policy issues. Political Economy 401 examines interactions of international and do-
mestic forces in contemporary issues. Political Economy 402 asks students to research and make proposals in
policy areas of current importance. Background for these senior courses is acquired through courses in internation-
al economics, public finance, and domestic and international/comparative politics and policy.
Students in Political Economy 402 visit Washington, D.C. Sunday night through Wednesday of the first week
of spring vacation to conduct interviews relating to their Political Economy 402 group projects. This is a course
requirement and thus a requirement for the major.

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN POLITICAL ECONOMY
Due to the special demands of this interdisciplinary major, the only route to honors in Political Economy is the
thesis. Seniors may pursue the honors thesis course (Political Economy 493-W31) during the fall semester and
winter study period. The third course contributing to such an honors program would normally be an elective in
Political Science or Economics taken during the junior year. This course, which may be one of the required elec-
tives, must be closely related, indeed must prepare the ground for the honors thesis.
Juniors in the Political Economy major with at least a 3.5 GPA in the program may apply for the honors thesis
program by means of a written proposal submitted to the chair before spring registration. Written guidelines for
such proposals are available in the chair's office or on the program website. The proposal should have been dis-
cussed with at least two faculty members, and at least one faculty advisor from each discipline should be solicited
by the student prior to submission of the proposal.
Final decisions about admission to the honors program will be made in early summer, when spring grades be-
come available.
To achieve the degree with honors in Political Economy, the thesis must be completed by the end of winter
study period and be judged of honors quality by a committee consisting of the two advisors and a third reader. A
thesis judged to be of particular distinction will qualify its author for the degree with highest honors.
STUDY ABROAD
Despite the fact that Political Economy requires more courses than the typical major, plenty of Political Econo-
my majors go abroad. Since the most popular time to take POEC 301 is the fall of the junior year, if you're think-
ing of spending only one semester abroad, Spring is the better choice. But lots of students go away for the Fall or
Political Economy, Political Science
­ 266 ­
the whole year. Political Economy majors have often been overrepresented in Williams at Oxford. If you do go
abroad in the fall, you may take POEC 301 in your sophomore or senior years. The former is preferable (POEC
301 is not too hard for sophs) but the latter is more common, mainly because many people don't decide to become
POEC majors in time. You'll probably want to get some major credits when abroad. The easiest to get are upper-
level electives in political science and economics. Most programs for US students in Europe have a political sci-
ence course on the EU, which is a good fit. We recommend against taking econometrics abroad.
COURSE NUMBERING SYSTEM
The numbering system for courses offered and required in Political Economy is identical to the system outlined
on page 45.
POEC 253(F) Empirical Methods in Political Economy (Same as Economics 253) (Q)
(See under ECON 253 for full description.) SHORE-SHEPPARD
POEC 301(F) Economic Liberalism and Its Critics (Same as Economics 299 and Political Science
333)
Economic liberalism holds that, if left alone by government, people will make mutually beneficial transactions
with one another, leaving society better off. Its critics point to what they believe this position ignores or what it
wrongly assumes, and hence, how it would make bad policy. This course explores the relationship between poli-
tics and economics by surveying influential works of political economy. Its first part examines major thinkers in
relation to the historical development of capitalism in Western Europe and the United States: the classical liberal-
ism of Adam Smith, Karl Marx's revolutionary socialism, and the reformist ideas of John Stuart Mill, R. H.
Tawney, and John Maynard Keynes. The second part considers more recent writings that revise and critique liber-
alism from a variety of perspectives. The historical focus of the course permits you to appreciate the ongoing dia-
logue between classical and contemporary views of political economy, while classroom discussion involves fre-
quent reference to current public policy issues.
Format: discussion/lecture. Requirements: eight 2-page papers and a final exam.
Prerequisites: one course in Economics and either Political Science 201 or 203 or AP credit in American Politics
(or permission of instructor). Enrollment limit: 35 (expected: 32). Preference given to Political Economy majors
and sophomores intending a Political Economy major.

POEC 401(F) Contemporary Problems in Political Economy
This course examines contemporary problems in political economy at and across diverse spatial scales. Using
both Economics and Political Science methods of analysis, we will study the exercise of power and the accumula-
tion of wealth in the world today as well as central public policy debates around those processes. We begin with a
sweeping historical overview of the past century. Then we move through three course sections organized around
contemporary problems at three distinct scales: the global political economy, the United States political economy,
and comparative political economy with an emphasis on the advanced capitalist countries. The goal of this course
is both to build upon theoretical debates encountered in POEC 301 as well as to prepare students for the public
policy analysis they will do in POEC 402.
Format: seminar. Requirements: one 3- to 4-page book review; three 8- to 10-page papers.
Prerequisites: Economics 110 and 120; Political Science 202 or 204, or equivalent. Enrollment limit: 20 (expected:
15). Preference given to Political Economy majors. Required in the Political Economy major but open to non-ma-
jors.
Hour: 1:10-2:25 TF ROLLEIGH and PAUL
POEC 402(S) Political Economy of Public Policy Issues
The core of this course consists of analyses by student study groups of current issues of public policy. The student
groups investigate the interacting political and economic aspects of an issue, do extensive reading, conduct inter-
views in Washington (during spring recess) with public and private officials, write a major report on their findings
and recommendations, and defend it orally in a public session.
Students visit Washington, D.C. Sunday night through Wednesday of the first week of spring vacation to conduct
interviews relating to their group projects. This is a course requirement.
Format: seminar with student presentations.
Prerequisites: Economics 253 or 255; satisfaction of the U.S. Political Economy and Public Policy course require-
ment (see list of major requirements above), prior or concurrently.
Required in the major and open only to Political Economy majors.

Politics is most fundamentally about forging and maintaining community, about how we manage to craft a
common destiny guided by shared values. Communities need a way to reconcile conflicts of interest among their

members and to determine their group interest; they need to allocate power and to determine its just uses. Power
may be used wisely or foolishly, rightly or cruelly, but it is always there; it cannot be wished away. Political science
attends to the ways that social power is grasped, maintained, challenged, or justified. The contests over power and
the values that it should be used to further give politics its drama and pathos. The effort to understand politics aims
not only to describe and explain, but also to improve political life.
The Political Science major is structured to allow students either to participate in the established ways of study-
ing politics or to develop their own foci. To this end, the department offers two routes to completing the major,
each requiring nine courses. We invite students either to organize their major through the subfields that structure
the discipline of political science (American politics, international relations, political theory, and comparative poli-
tics), or to develop individual concentrations reflecting their particular interests, regardless of subfields.
MAJOR
SUBFIELD CONCENTRATION ROUTE: Upon declaring a major, students choose one subfield: American
politics, international relations, political theory, or comparative politics. The subfield concentration draws at least
four (4) of the nine courses from one subfield including the appropriate core course from 201-204, two electives of
the student's choice at the 200 or 300 level and the senior seminar (or an individual project) in the student's sub-
field. Students selecting political theory as their subfield concentration must take Political Science 231 or Political
Science 232 as one of their four subfield courses, in addition to taking Political Science 203 and prior to taking
Political Science 430. (A degree with honors in Political Science requires enrollment in the year-long senior thesis
seminar, which does not count toward the nine (9) major requirements.) With permission of the department chair,
students may take a senior seminar in a different subfield, providing they take a third elective in the subfield of
concentration. In addition, students must take courses in two subfields outside the subfield of concentration to
satisfy the breadth requirement (all courses at the 100 level and all methods courses also count toward the breadth
requirement). The faculty advisor and the department chair must approve the student plan.
INDIVIDUAL CONCENTRATION ROUTE: Alternatively, students may devise a concentration of their own.
In this event, the student prepares a curricular plan in consultation with a faculty advisor, explaining the nature of
the concentration and the courses the student will take. The individual concentration also requires nine (9) courses,
with at least five (5) thematically linked courses constituting the concentration. Of these five courses, four are
electives at the 200 or 300 level, including one from 201-204, and one is a senior seminar or individual project. In
addition, students pursuing an individual concentration must take at least two other courses that illustrate breadth
in political science. To complete the requirement, the student has his or her choice of any two other courses within
the Political Science Department. The faculty advisor and the department chair must approve the student plan.
ADVISEMENT
When a student chooses to major in Political Science (usually at the end of the sophomore year), he or she may
register with any Political Science faculty member at the designated time and places. The registering faculty mem-
ber will ask for preferences for a permanent faculty advisor and will assist undecided students in finding an advi-
sor. In all cases, students will be paired by the end of the sophomore year with an advisor who will continue with
them through graduation.
COURSE NUMBERING
The course numbering used by the Political Science Department reflects the format and specialization of a
course The 100-level courses are designed to address political topics from multiple subfield perspectives. The
200-level courses are divided between our core courses and our electives. The core courses, numbered from
201-204, serve as introductions both to the substance of the politics and the subfields organizing the study of poli-
tics. The introductory subfield course must be completed before the senior year. The 200-level elective courses
delve into political processes, problems and philosophies. 100-level and 200-level courses have no prerequisites.
300-level courses are more specialized and require prerequisites. 400-level courses are senior seminars offered for
students in the major; senior seminars also are open to juniors and to non-majors if space permits.
WINTER STUDY PROJECT
The department welcomes relevant WSP 99 proposals that can make important contributions to the student's
understanding of public affairs and politics. Majors, seniors, and students without previous WSP 99 experience
have preference.
THE JUNIOR YEAR ABROAD
A major in Political Science can be readily and usefully combined with study in a foreign country. No more
than one course taken per semester abroad in a program approved by the College may be counted toward the
requirements for a degree in Political Science.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE
The Political Science Department grants honors to candidates who, (1) complete the Senior Seminar, (2) re-
ceive at least a grade of 3.50 on a Senior Thesis (493-W31-494), and (3) have a minimum GPA of 3.5 in Political
Science.
To become a candidate for honors the student must (1) apply in the second semester of the junior year, (2)
submit a research proposal acceptable to the department's honors committee and for which an appropriate advisor
is available, and (3) have a minimum GPA of 3.5 in Political Science for the first six semesters. (Political Science
493-W31-494 DO NOT count toward the total of nine required of all majors.)
ADVANCED STUDY IN AMERICAN POLITICS
The Department of Political Science provides the opportunity for an unusually gifted student to engage in an
entire year's advanced research in American politics under singularly favorable conditions. Supported by income
derived from an endowment fund, the student, designated the Sentinels of the Republic Scholar (after the name of
the fund), receives a substantial research stipend to cover costs associated with the proposed project.

PSCI 120(F) America and the World After September 11
The terrorist attacks of September 11 and the war in Afghanistan raised fundamental questions about the past and
future course of American foreign policy. While virtually no one defended the terrorist attacks, many academics
argued that the root causes of September 11th were to be found in the flaws of the American approach to the world.
In this view, America is an arrogant, unilateralist country that ignores the views and perspectives of the rest of the
world community, relies far too much on its overwhelming military power, and often acts against its ideals and
values by supporting repressive and unpopular regimes. This course has three primary objectives. First, we will
assess important critiques of contemporary American foreign policy from both the left and right of the political
spectrum. Second, we will examine the historical and intellectual background of both supporters and critics of
American foreign policy in the post Vietnam War era. Third, in the aftermath of September 11 we will attempt to
answer the most important question of all for any analysis of American foreign policy: What is to be done? While
current issues of American foreign policy will be addressed in this class, potential students should note that its
primary focus is not on the technical/military elements of combating terrorism.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: assignments will include weekly response papers, two 5- to 7-page pa-

Begun as an experiment over 200 years ago, the United States has grown into a polity that is simultaneously
praised and condemned, critiqued and mythologized, modeled by others and remodeled itself. This course intro-
duces students to the dynamics and tensions that have animated the American political order and that have nur-
tured these conflicting assessments. Topics include the founding of the American system and the primary docu-
ments (the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the Federalist Papers), the primary institutions of
national government then and now (Congress, the Presidency, and the Supreme Court) and the politics of policy-
making in the United States. We study structures, processes, key events, and primary actors that have shaped
American political development. In investigating these topics, we explore questions such as these: How is power
allocated? What produces political change? Is there is a trade-off between democratic accountability and effective
governance? How are tensions between liberty and equality resolved? Do the institutions produce good policies,
and how do we define what is good?
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: two papers, one exam, and class participation.

PSCI 202(F,S) World Politics: An Introduction to International Relations
International politics differs from domestic politics in the absence of centralized, legitimate institutions. Anarchy
characterizes the world of sovereign states-there is no world government, nor agreement that one is desirable or
even possible. This lack of a common authority means that any dispute among countries is up to the countries
themselves to settle, by negotiating, appealing to shared norms, or using force. For this reason, while international
relations involves many of the same topics that consume domestic politics-ethnic antagonisms, spending on aid,
Political Science

war, national identity, inequality, weapons manufacture, finance, loans, pollution, migration-it shares few of the
same processes for dealing with them. This course covers problems central to international relations. It considers
the importance that this radical decentralization has for achieving values we hold, and examines processes that
might undermine or support the anarchical system in which we live.
Format: lecture. Requirements: midterm paper or exam, final exam, four short papers and class participation.

PSCI 203(F,S) Introduction to Political Theory
Is politics war by other means? Is it merely a practical way to meet our needs? Or is it, rather, the activity through
which citizens pursue justice and the good life? And what is justice? How can it be established and secured? What
are the powers and obligations of citizenship? Who should rule? Who decides? On what basis? Political theory
addresses questions such as these as it investigates the fundamental problems of how we can, do, and ought to live
together. The questions have sparked controversy since the origins of political thinking; the answers remain con-
troversial now. This course addresses the controversies, focusing on major works of ancient, modern, and contem-
porary theory by such authors as Plato, Aristotle, Machiavelli, Hobbes, Rousseau, Hegel, Mill, Marx, Nietzsche,
Arendt, Rawls, and Foucault. Themes may include authority, obligation, power, war, violence, freedom, justice,
equality, democracy, liberalism, capitalism, community, and pluralism, though the emphasis will vary from se-
mester to semester.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: two or three papers; some sections also have a final exam.

PSCI 204(F) Introduction to Comparative Politics
To the lay person comparative politics might be described as the study of the centralized, legitimate institutions of
domestic governance in countries around the world. In practice, this sub-discipline is motivated by attempts to
uncover the social, economic, political and cultural forces that in fact produce marked differences in both the de-
gree and form taken by institutions of domestic governance. For this reason, comparativists tend to ask: What are
states and how did they emerge as the dominant political unit? Why are some states weak while others are strong?
Why do some states become democratic while others remain authoritarian or totalitarian? Why have some democ-
racies endured yet others have collapsed or seem on the brink of collapse? By addressing each of these questions,
this course covers some of the issues central to the study of the politics of countries around the world.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: class participation, four response papers, take-home midterm exam,
and final exam.
No prerequisites. This is an introductory course, open to all, including first-year students.
Enrollment limit: 35 per section (expected 35). Preference given to first- and second-year students.

Conservative thinkers claim to be leading an intellectual transformation away from the tired nostrums of liberal-
ism. They see themselves as original, dynamic, serious. This course will read leading conservative political think-
ers with a view to identifying their central tenets, both negative and positive. What is it that they oppose and what
is it that they support? What, if anything, defines contemporary conservative thinking? Is it a coherent body of
thought, a doctrine, or a collection of disparate and conflicting thinkers? What is the relationship of thinkers who
emphasize the market, order, and traditional values?

PSCI 207(F) Political Elections
Elections in American politics are dynamic events in which many different groups struggle to gain control of polit-
ical institutions at the local, state, and federal levels. During the campaigns, candidates and their supporters move
across the land, appearing on television and radio, and through the printed press. Simultaneously, various organi-
zations and interest groups attempt to gain influence with the candidates and with public opinion by raising money,
making endorsements, running political appeals in the various media, and supplying activists to work for the can-
didates they favor. This course explores the factors that shape the outcome of political elections in America.
Among the factors we will consider are the state of the economy, international events, the role of political parties at
the state and national levels, the current partisan balance, ideology, media, special interests, money, candidates, the
"hot" issues of the moment and long enduring issues, campaign debates, and campaign polling and public opinion.
We will consider in detail the 2006 national mid-term elections both for Federal office (President, Senate and
House) and for state offices (governors, state legislators).

Constitutional Law II explores constraints imposed on governmental power by a system of civil rights. Areas ex-
amined include equal protection, due process, freedom of speech and religion. Within these and other broad doc-
trines, countless specific controversies arise. Those we address include abortion, same-sex marriage, affirmative
action, flag-burning, and the death penalty. Much of the reading consists of Supreme Court cases, but we will also
pay close attention to the broader context surrounding these cases. A recurring question is the relevance of the
Court's undemocratic nature. Should the Court see itself as a tribune of the powerless, which must restrain the
political branches or, alternatively, should it generally defer to the people's elected representatives? A closely re-
lated question involves the extent to which the Court should confine the rights it protects to those specifically listed
in the Constitution. Finally, to what extent do and should judges consult their moral or even political views, as
opposed to undertaking a more objective, apolitical or distinctly "judicial" analysis, in reaching decisions?

To study the presidency is to study human nature and personality, constitution and institution, strategy and contin-
gency. This course will examine the problems and paradoxes that attend the exercise of the most powerful political
office in the world's oldest democracy: Can an executive office be constructed with sufficient energy to govern
and also be democratically accountable? How much do we attribute the shaping of politics to the agency of the
individual in the office and to what extent are politics the result of structural, cultural, and institutional factors? Are
the politics of the presidency different in foreign and domestic policy? How are national security concerns bal-
anced with domestic priorities such as the protection of civil liberties? How is the office and purpose of the pres-
idency affected by an economic order predicated on private capital? Exploration of these questions will lead us to
examine topics such as presidential selection, the bases of presidential power, character and leadership issues, con-
gressional-executive relations, the media, and emergency powers. Attention will focus largely on the modern pres-
idency, though older historical examples will also be used to help us gain perspective on these problems.

as the United Nations help promote peace? Does the spread of nuclear weapons make the world a safer or more
dangerous place? How do terrorists use violence to realize their objectives and when is it effective? Can interven-
tion in civil wars prevent bloodshed and bring stability to failed states? How will "non-traditional threats" such as
environmental scarcity, migration, and climate change shape international security in the twenty-first century?

things we take for granted and make the familiar strange in order to look at the world with new eyes. Toward that
end, we begin with an overview of the recent history of globalization, setting the stage for the rest of the course by
answering the important question "How did we get here?" Then we progress to the empirical core of the course,
examining global trade, global finance and development. Along the way we focus on key issues of theoretical and
current political interest, including free trade and its myriad effects, the World Trade Organization, global money
politics, debt relief and financial crisis. We conclude the course with a close look at the potentially dangerous im-
balances of the global political economy.

(1694-1778), Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712-1778), Edmund Burke (1729-1797), Mary Wollstonecraft
(1759-1797), John Stuart Mill (1806-1873), and Karl Marx (1818-1883). We will look at the contexts in which
these thinkers wrote, and the political problems and events to which their writings were (in part) a response. Some
of the questions posed by these early thinkers are however still enormously important to politics today, and we will
also read these texts with these questions in mind: Are politicians obligated to act honorably and morally, or only
to secure the peace and keep office? What is human nature really like, outside of political society? Why should
people obey political authority anyway? Who gets to be a citizen, and why? What do citizens owe one another?
Should democratic states tolerate groups with highly unorthodox beliefs and practices, and if so, why? How did
social and political inequality come about? And does justice require an equitable distribution of power, and of
economic resources?

PSCI 233(F) Marx in Theory
"Philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways; the point is to change it." With these words, Karl
Marx staged a revolt against the philosophical conceits of his time and furnished the elements of a revolutionary
critique of capitalist power. This course provides an introduction to Marx and to the range and complexity of
theoretical work that travels under his name. Naturally, we will devote much of our energy to a systematic study of
Marx's own writings, from his early philosophical engagement with Hegel to his mature analysis of capitalism. In
an effort to reflect on the promises and limitations of Marx's ideas for contemporary political thinking, we will also
explore marxist theory in a variety of forms--humanist, dialectical, structuralist, feminist, analytical, psychoana-
lytic, and postmodern. Students can, therefore, expect to examine Marx's key concepts (alienation, ideology, his-
torical materialism, the division of labor and class conflict, the bourgeois state, commodity fetishism, crisis and
contradiction, critical theory and revolutionary praxis) and consider how these concepts have been developed,
refined, and reworked by later theorists. Additional thinkers will include, among others, Gramsci, Althusser, La-
clau, Zizek, and Negri. Reading assignments for each class will not exceed 40 pages, but these are difficult texts
and students should set aside sufficient time to read carefully.

Marx and Weber and a comparison of their modes of political analysis. It will engage the debate between them
about the source and nature of power. What is it, and where does it come from? Is it primarily "material" in content
or largely "ideal"? What does each think about the origins of capitalism, and what is at stake theoretically in their
respective interpretations? Second, the course will consider how Marx and Weber have influenced 20th century
thinking about the relationship between capitalism and modernity. Is modernity intimately linked with capitalism,
as Marx would argue, or is it separate from it, as Weber would have it? To get at this question, we will read Karl
Polanyi and Barrington Moore in this section. Third, the course will address Marxist and Weberian treatments of
states. What are they? Where do states come from? Do they originate in consent? In war? Are they autonomous
from or captured by social forces? In this section, we will read Charles Tilly, Theda Skocpol, Alfred Stephan, and
Karl Schmitter. Finally, the course will consider what Marx and Weber have to say about the nature and origins of
collective political identities (national, ethnic, cultural). What are they and where do they come from? Are they
artifacts of the economy, as Marxists suggest, or do they come from states and religions, as Weber has it? To en-
gage these questions, we will read Samuel Huntington, among others.

PSCI 265(S) The International Politics of East Asia
This course examines the political, economic, and cultural determinants of conflict and cooperation in East Asia.
Throughout the semester, we will examine three distinct but inter-related aspects of international relations in East
Asia: Security, economy, and culture by using some core concepts and theoretical arguments widely accepted in
the study of international relations. We will engage some of the central questions and issues in the current debate
on East Asia. Do East Asian countries seek for security and prosperity in a way fundamentally different from the
Western system? Is there a single best way to maintain regional order and cooperation across regions? Will a
strong China inevitably claim its traditional place under the Sun? Will Japan continue to live as a nation with enor-
mous economic power but no military means? What is the choice for South Korea between security alliance with
the United States and national reconciliation with the North? Will North Korea survive? What should be done to
dissuade the totalitarian regime in North Korea from acquiring nuclear capabilities and lead it to different paths
toward national survival? By the end of the semester, you will gain both a general perspective and substantive
knowledge on East Asia.

PSCI 310(F) Political Psychology (Same as Psychology 345)
Political psychology studies human nature to better understand the possibilities and limitations of politics. For
example, many political philosophers begin their political programs by asserting some foundational claims about
"human nature." These claims are then used to support their vision of politics. Claims about progress often pre-
sume that human nature will be improved by implementing a liberal political agenda. For example, the enlighten-
ment held that rationality would be strengthened by progress, thereby making democracy more viable. Those who
defend authoritarian regimes often do so by proclaiming that the general public is incapable of self-rule and must
accept rule by their betters. Many of these arguments turn on how rational people are and on their capacity for and
willingness to pursue justice for all people. We explore what psychology tells us about people as political citizens
and as leaders. The course pays special attention to the powerful, but surprising, roles that emotions play in all
aspects of politics. Central to politics is the general issue of judgment, and its more important variants, moral and
Political Science
­ 274 ­
political judgment. If we are to trust ourselves to rule ourselves, how well will we secure justice and liberty for one
and all among us? Political psychology is one of the very oldest disciplines (it can be dated at least back to the early
classic Greeks, among them Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle). The issue of citizen competence for self and collective
rule, then as now, was at the center of their attention. So, it shall be in this course.

most important scholars of international relations and nuclear strategy. During the 1960's and 1970's, as National
Security Advisor and later secretary of State, Kissinger was at the center of some of the important events of the
Cold War. This tutorial will examine Kissinger's thoughts on American policy and international relations as well

Political Science

darkness in other parts (much of Central and South America, Southeast Asia and nearly all of Africa). This pattern
of light and darkness depicts a vastly unequal global distribution of technology, urban infrastructure, capital accu-
mulation--in short, the global patterns of development and underdevelopment. These areas are connected through
commodity chains, capital mobility, migration, political authority and the natural environment. So why are some
areas light and other dark?
This course focuses on the global factors influencing development and underdevelopment, political-economic
connections across national borders, and the intersections of power, production and nature. We cover topics such
as theories of development and industrialization, urban-rural relations, urban bias in development policy, industrial
agriculture, global agricultural trade, food security and hunger, international development organizations (WTO,
World Bank, UNCTAD, Food and Agriculture Organization), peasant rebellions, `resource wars,' sustainable de-

Two converging realities create a political and intellectual problem: an evolving recognition of the vitality of pri-
vate sector supported community organization work; and the challenge that such organizations may have to as-
sume a larger role due to reductions in public agency support and declining participation among the poor and racial
minorities. In the United States these agencies-essentially NGOs-play important roles in communities and move-
ments, often modeling the very programs adopted by the government. Some, like the Highlander Center, have
near-mythical status in our memories about what it means to struggle for social change; others, including HARY-
OU, were critical in structuring thought about anti-poverty strategies. In recent years some like Teach for America
have plunged into the thick of the effort to keep public education a viable option. This tutorial examines the role of
non-profits and social justice work in the United States focusing on the non-profit as a type, governance and staff-
ing, fund-raising and persecution.

PSCI 332(S) Rethinking the Political
What is politics? The question has been an important part of political theory at least since Socrates and Plato. It has
taken on renewed significance in recent years, as theorists have sought to rethink the political in response to the
most disastrous of twentieth century political developments (genocide, totalitarianism, etc.), to the assorted identi-
ty-based struggles that have challenged prevailing political terms and arrangements, and to the transformations
wrought by the forces and processes of "globalization." In this seminar, we will engage some of the major attempts
at rethinking produced in the 20th and 21st centuries. Our readings will be drawn from such thinkers as Arendt,
Agamben, Benjamin, Brown, Connolly, Derrida, Fanon, Foucault, Gramsci, Habermas, Mouffe, Rancière, Rawls,
Strauss, Schmitt, and Wolin Throughout the semester, our goal will be to come to terms not only with the theoreti-
cal arguments but also the motivating problems: we will read the texts contextually, perhaps even symptomatical-
ly. Among the questions we will ask, then, are why there is such a preoccupation with the meaning of the political
and whether the theorists are evading or repressing the very circumstances that structure political outcomes and
possibilities.

PSCI 334(F) Theorizing Global Justice
One of the most important issues in political theory today is the problem of global justice. As the gap between rich
and poor nations increases and the changes associated with globalization render states' borders increasingly inef-
fectual, moral and political philosophers can arguably no longer confine their theories of justice to the safe space of
single liberal democratic polities, such as the United States. Looming human and environmental crises underscore
the need to look beyond one's borders when thinking about the goals of equality and well-being or flourishing, and
the duties we owe to others. This course takes up the main works in normative theorizing about global justice, and
also looks at the possibility of transnational institutions for justice, starting with Immanuel Kant and moving on to
such contemporary philosophers and political theorists as John Rawls, Thomas Pogge, Amartya Sen, Martha
Nussbaum, Onora O'Neill, Antonio Negri, Richard Rorty, Anthony Appiah, Ronald Dworkin, G.A. Cohen, Peter
Singer, Iris Young, and Michael Walzer.

PSCI 338(S) Critical Theory, Violence, and Sacrifice
In his preface to the Phenomenology of Spirit, Hegel describes the pursuit of self-consciousness as an experience
of unwonted pain, steady suffering, and the restless labor of negation. Beginning with Hegel's striking portrait of
the self coming to consciousness (what he calls "the pathway of despair"), this course examines the themes of
violence and sacrifice in modern critical theory. Why does self-consciousness call for such suffering, such pas-
sion? Is there pathos or pathology in this self? If critical reason is something distinct from religious faith, why does
it seem to mirror its movements at every turn? How have later thinkers sought to deepen, overturn, or repudiate
Hegel's account of subjectivity? Do these questions matter for political theory and, if so, how? We will pay partic-
ular attention to the theological remnants in critical theory, tracing the logics of sacrifice and salvation, the figures
of destruction and catastrophe, and the persistence of hope and despair in a variety of thinkers. More generally, we
will pose questions about the meaning of freedom and bondage, the relationship between politics and the passions,
the conventional opposition between "secular" reason and "religious" faith, and the specter of violence in critical
theory. Along with substantive readings from Hegel, our thinkers will include Kierkegaard, Marx, Nietzsche,
Freud, Bataille, Horkheimer, Adorno, Benjamin, Fanon, Foucault, Derrida, Kristeva, Habermas, and Butler.
Format: seminar. Requirements: class participation, one short paper (4-6 pages), a thesis statement and essay out-

course examines both the politics that produced white-black land disparities in Zimbabwe and the post-indepen-
dence politics that sustained the inequalities for close to two decades. The course also considers why the status quo
was broken in 1999-2000. What did Robert Mugabe hope to gain by acquiring and redistributing white-owned
farms? Did the policy unwittingly lead to the subsequent collapse of political and economic institutions?

produce these divergent outcomes. The course begins by addressing competing conceptions and approaches to
political economy. We then examine arguments that use the economy to explain differences in political outcomes
(the growth of parliaments, transitions to and from democracy, and the consolidation and collapse of autocracies)
and theories that focus on political institutions in explaining variation in economic outcomes (growth, reform,
inequality and welfare provision).

PSCI 410(S) Senior Seminar in American Politics: Interpretations of American Politics
Current assessments of the state of American politics vary widely. Though recent polls show that as many as 60
percent of Americans think that the country is headed down the wrong-track, it is not clear what that means. Critics
on the left worry that the United States is on an imperial quest, extorting resources from the global many for the
advantage of an elite few. Critics on the right worry that the U.S. has abandoned the traditions that made it strong
and has entered a period of moral decay. What are we to make of these different assessments? What do left and
right see when they survey the nation, and why is what they see so different? Any diagnosis of contemporary
maladies is premised on a vision of what a healthy functioning republic looks like. Our task in the seminar is to
uncover and interrogate those visions. We will do this by exploring different interpretations of American politics,
each with its own story of narrative tensions and possible resolutions. We will then leverage our investigation of
how different authors, and different traditions, understand the nation, as a whole, to help us assess contemporary
politics and come to our own conclusions about what animates it.
Format: seminar. Requirements: brief weekly writing assignments; two short essays; a 15-page research paper;

lobbies, moral appeals, or imperialist impulses? And are the problems with the invasion the result of American
mismanagement or the predictable effect of the invasion itself?

PSCI 420(F) Senior Seminar in International Relations: War in the Modern Age
International relations theory holds that war-making and the sovereign state are inextricably linked: war made
states, and states make war. Is this still true? This seminar examines the question of whether war remains the prov-

ince of the state by inquiring into apparently stable, and apparently altered, aspects of the contemporary use of
force. What are the causes of contemporary wars? Can wars ever be started justly? Who fights in wars and who
suffers? How do wars end? How has technology changed the face of modern warfare? Is war becoming obsolete?
This course will also consider whether classical theories are applicable to "new" wars such as guerilla wars, insur-
gencies, civil strife, and ethnic conflict.

PSCI 420/440(S) Senior Seminar in International Relations and Comparative Politics: The
Power of the Purse in International Politics (W)
US foreign policy faces money problems. First, it has to grapple with security issues having less to do with defense
against powerful enemy states and more with matters of internal politics in relatively weak states, often nominal
allies. Many prominent observers (Thomas Friedman on "petropolitics," for example) have pointed to the critical
role of public finance in determining the evolution and behavior of these states. Second, it faces the erosion of US
financial hegemony, as deficits continue while foreigners already own about half of US Treasury debt (and their
central banks hold most of that). These ideas connect to other, more general ones about the rise of the West, the
origins of the nation-state, and the channels of international economic power. In this course we look at historical
and contemporary connections between money and power, especially on the links between the ways states obtain
revenue oil rents, taxation, foreign aid, and credit--and the ways they act and evolve.
Format: lecture, discussion, and seminar. Requirements: a 4-page commentary and two 2-page responses based on
class readings, a short oral presentation, and a 20-page research paper.
Prerequisites: senior standing in political science major or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 15 (expected:

PSCI 430(F) Senior Seminar in Political Theory: Machiavelli
Niccolo Machiavelli, a Florentine diplomat and among the most infamous thinkers of the Renaissance period, has
been called the inaugural thinker of the modern world. Few figures in the western political tradition have been so
closely studied by theorists and practitioners alike and still fewer have been so hotly contested. In this course, we
will explore the enigmatic and scandalizing character of Machiavelli's political thought, guided by the following
questions: What can we learn from Machiavelli and how should we interpret his texts? Was he a teacher of politi-
cal evil, with The Prince as his gospel of diabolical cruelty and immoralism? Or is his "true" political thought to be
found in his less infamous, Discourses on Livy? Is Machiavelli an apologist for ruthless despotism or a republican
patriot? Does his work mark the origins of realpolitik, the study and practice of politics based primarily on practi-
cal considerations and independent of loftier considerations? Or is he primarily a partisan and a revolutionary
thinker, aspiring to craft new modes and orders for an otherwise enfeebled and weakened Italian state? Is he an
early advocate of ragion di stato? A realist? A utopian? A scientist of statecraft? A satirist and cynic? A misogy-
nist? An anti-philosopher? Are we all Machiavellians? Students can expect an intensive study of Machiavelli's
political writings (with emphasis on The Prince and The Discourses on Livy), as well as his comedic plays, poems,
short stories, and selected letters from his personal correspondence. In the process, we will also have occasion to
survey the wide range and diversity of interpretive methods in political theory, as Machiavelli appears to be the
single writer who distinctively "belongs" to political theory and it is over him that political theorists have fought.
We will look at commentaries from Ernst Cassier, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Antonio Gramsci, Louis Althusser,
Isaiah Berlin, Leo Strauss, Quentin Skinner, Sheldon Wolin, Hannah Pitkin, Mary Dietz, Victoria Kahn, and Anto-
nio Negri.
Format: seminar. Requirements: class discussion, oral presentation, one short essay (4-6 pages), a thesis statement

prospective proposal should contact the department chair for guidance.
PSCI 493(F)-W31-494(S) Senior Thesis
The senior major, having applied for and been accepted into the honors program during the second semester of the
junior year, will devote the senior year to researching and writing a substantial and original work of scholarship,
under the supervision of a faculty mentor to be assigned by the department. The final work will be submitted for
evaluation by a committee made up of the faculty supervisor and two additional readers to be chosen by the de-
partment, in consultation with the supervisor. Thesis writers will not only work with their advisors but will partici-
pate in a weekly honors seminar supervised by a faculty member in political science. The seminar (which is one
component of the 493-W31-494 designation and not a separate course) will provide a focused forum for the ex-
change of ideas among the honors students, who will regularly circulate sections of their theses-in-progress for
peer review and critique. The faculty seminar leader's primary role is one of coordination and guidance.

MAJOR
For the degree in Psychology, students must complete a minimum of nine courses as outlined below:
1) Psychology 101 Introductory Psychology
2) Psychology 201 Experimentation and Statistics
3) Three 200-level courses, with at least one from each of the following groups.
Group A Psychology 212 Neuroscience
Psychology 221 Cognitive Psychology
Psychology 222 Cognitive Science
Group B Psychology 232 Developmental Psychology
Psychology 242 Social Psychology
Psychology 252 Psychological Disorders
Psychology 272 Psychology of Education
Either Psychology 221 or 222, but not both, can count towards the three required 200-level courses.
4) Three 300-level courses from at least two of the areas listed below:
Area 1: Behavioral Neuroscience (courses with middle digit 1)
Area 2: Cognitive Psychology (courses with middle digit 2)
Area 3: Developmental Psychology (courses with middle digit 3)
Area 4: Social Psychology (courses with middle digit 4)
Area 5: Clinical Psychology (courses with middle digit 5)
Area 7: Educational Psychology (courses with middle digit 7)
At least one of these courses must be from among those carrying the format designation Empirical Lab
Course.
5) Psychology 401 Perspectives on Psychological Issues
Students who place out of Psychology 101 are still required to take nine courses to complete the major.
The department recommends that students take Psychology 201 in their sophomore year. The department re-
quires that 201 be completed by the end of the junior year.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN PSYCHOLOGY
Students who are candidates for honors need take only two 300-level courses from two different areas, but they
must enroll in Psychology 493-W31-494 and write a thesis based on original empirical work. Presentation of a
Psychology
­ 280 ­
thesis, however, should not be interpreted as a guarantee of a degree with honors. Guidelines for pursuing the
degree with honors are available from the department.
STUDY ABROAD
With some advance planning, studying abroad (especially for one semester) can easily be worked into the
psychology major. To facilitate this, we recommend that students:
1) meet with the Department Chair as soon as they decide that they are interested in studying abroad
2) take Psychology 201 (Experimentation and Statistics) in the sophomore year
3) think ahead to the 300-level courses they are interested in taking so that they can fulfill the 200-level pre-
requisites before they go away or, if possible, while they are away. In our experience, study abroad pro-
grams in the following places are most likely to offer psychology courses: England, Ireland, Scotland,
Spain, Australia, New Zealand, Hawaii, and Scandinavia. Students should procure the descriptions of the
psychology courses they are considering taking and bring them to their meeting with the Chair.
There are some costs to studying away, particularly for the year. This limits students' opportunities to choose
the particular 300-level courses they would like to take and they must sometimes settle for those that are open,
those which happen to be offered, or those for which they have the prerequisites, once they return in their senior
year. Many students who are keen on psychology begin doing research with professors during their junior year,
and for some this leads to an honors thesis in the senior year, summer research, etc. If you are going away for the
entire year and do not make such connections with a professor ahead of time (i.e., before you go), you may lose out
on some of these opportunities to deepen your involvement in the major on campus. On the other hand, studying
abroad can be an invaluable learning experience, so you need to think carefully, in consultation with your advisor
and/or the Department Chair, about the costs and benefits of it. Very occasionally, a student who just begins taking
psychology courses late in the sophomore year and wishes to go abroad for the year finds that he/she is not able to
do both, or is restricted in the choice of study-abroad programs.

This course introduces students to a broad range of theories and research on education. What models of teaching
work best, and for what purposes? How do we measure the success of various education practices? What is the
best way to describe the psychology processes by which children gain information and expertise? What accounts
for individual differences in learning, and how do teachers (and schools) address these individual needs? How do
social and economic factors shape teaching practices and the educational experiences of individual students? The
course will draw from a wide range of literature (research, theory, and first hand accounts) to consider key ques-
tions in the psychology of education. Upon completion of the course, students should be familiar with central
issues in pre-college education and know how educational research and the practice of teaching affect one another.

PSYC 322(F) Concepts: Mind, Brain, and Culture
Every time we see something as a kind of thing, every time that we decide that an object is a cup rather than a glass,
when we recognize a picture of a familiar face as a picture of ourselves, or even when we understand speech, we
are employing categories. Most categorization decisions are automatic and unconscious, and therefore have the
illusion of simplicity. The complexity of these decisions, however, becomes apparent when we attempt to build
machines to do what humans perform so effortlessly. What are the systems in place that allow us this extraordinary
ability to segment the world? Are they universal? How does conceptual knowledge differ across cultural groups?
How do concepts affect our perception? How do the categories of experts differ from the categories of novices?
Do children have the same kind of conceptual knowledge as adults? How are categories represented in the brain?
In this course, we explore various empirical findings from cognitive psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and an-
thropology that address these questions.
Format: Empirical Lab Course. Requirements: short papers, class presentation, and research paper.

PSYC 324T(S) Great Debates in Cognition
The field of cognition is filled with controversies about how the mind really works. For example, is there sufficient
evidence for a system in vision that can become aware of things without actually "seeing" them? Is it necessary to
assume that babies come into the world armed with innate linguistic knowledge? Are humans inherently rational?
Can we make inference about the mind using neuroimaging? These debates, and others that we will consider, help
fuel scientific discovery in cognition in interesting ways. In this class, we will consider some of these contempo-
rary debates, weigh evidence on both sides, and discuss the implications for what we know about the mind.

PSYC 331T(F) Risk and Resilience in Early Development
Children are often viewed as vulnerable members of our society, worthy of great care and protection. Paradoxical-
ly, equally commonplace is the perception that children are hearty and resilient individuals who more readily adapt
to change than adults. This contradiction is most evident during early development, when the remarkable plasticity
of the rapidly developing brain offers infants and young children an exquisite sensitivity to contextual forces, both
positive and negative. This tutorial explores the risk and protective factors, both within and outside of the young
child, that give rise to continuity and change in early development and focuses on the challenges of translating risk
and resilience research into programs that optimize development. Evidence drawn from theories of early experi-
ence and developmental psychopathology will frame our review of the literature on prenatal risk factors, including
teratogens and maternal stress; genetic influences, including gene-by-environment interactions; infant risk factors,
including medical fragility and temperament; caregiving risk factors, including maternal and paternal factors and
childcare settings; socioeconomic risk factors, including poverty; and child abuse and neglect. Tutorial assign-
ments will focus heavily on critical evaluation of the quality of the research and to the translation of the research to
applied programs.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: Students will meet in pairs with the instructor for one hour each week. Each week,
students will either compose a position paper based on the week's readings, or respond to the position paper of

PSYC 332(S) Cognitive Development
In this course we consider how mental abilities, such as language, memory, thinking and imagination develop
during the childhood years. We begin by asking how infants, who do not have language, make sense of their world
and how language, once acquired, changes the way children understand their world. We study how children re-
member events, both every day and traumatic, and how memory relates to narratives about the self. We examine
the development of thinking, reasoning, and imagination (e.g. pretend play, imaginary companions) and their in-
tersection with related topics, such as children's ability to distinguish between fantasy and reality. Throughout
these discussions, we consider the impact of biology (e.g. changes in the brain) and culture on cognition, as well as
the similarities and differences in the cognitive abilities of normally-developing children and children with devel-
opmental problems (e.g., autism).

This course will focus on the process of doing original, empirical social psychological research on specific topics
in the field. We will concentrate on two content areas of research: (1) stereotypes and prejudice, particularly as they
touch on issues concerning the academic achievement of women and people of color, and on the role of self-es-
teem in stereotyping and prejudice, and (2) interpersonal suspicion, including an examination of factors that might
reduce suspicion in interracial or cross-cultural dyads or groups. Students will research and critically analyze and
integrate the relevant literatures concerning these topics, and will design and conduct original research to test em-
pirically several hypotheses that emerge from these literatures. We will examine a variety of types of research
design and statistical techniques.

PSYC 372(F) Advanced Seminar in Teaching and Learning
This advanced seminar will give students an opportunity to connect theory to practice. Each student will have a
teaching placement in a local school, and participate in both peer and individual supervision. In addition, we will
read a range of texts that examine different approaches to teaching, as well as theory and research on the process of
education. What is the best way to teach? How do various theories of children and pedagogy translate into every-
day practices with students? Students will be encouraged to reflect and modify their own teaching practices as a
result of what we read as well as their supervision. Questions we will discuss include: What is the relationship
between educational goals and curriculum development? What is the relation between substance (knowledge,
skills, content) and the interpersonal dynamic inherent in a classroom setting? How do we assess teaching practic-
es, and the students' learning? What does it take to be an educated person?
Format: seminar. Requirements: This course involves a field placement, weekly readings, as well as seminar dis-
cussion, supervision, one essay and one final paper.

Public health seeks to understand, and also to protect and improve, health at the level of a community or popu-
lation. Communities make decisions and allocate resources that, intentionally or not, fundamentally shape human
life. For example, great reductions in sickness and early death have come from social interventions with relatively
low financial cost, such as physically separating drinking water from sewage, or distributing aspirin, condoms,
mosquito nets, vaccines or soap, or sharing new ideas about life's possibilities. The way a society is organized
affects the way that social and scientific knowledge is distributed within it; access to that knowledge shapes health
at the individual level. At its heart, the study of public health focuses on questions about relationships between
science and society, and between reality and possibility: what effective public health policy is and how we can
measure its effectiveness; what the relationship is, and ought to be, between research and policy; how we reconcile
important moral and economic claims, or balance other values that compete with maximizing health; what counts
as disease, over time and among cultures; how we think about cause and responsibility; what constitutes a healthy
environment; how our fundamental beliefs determine our approaches to health decisions; and how such decisions
ought to be made.
Public health draws on theory and applied research in the social sciences, natural sciences and humanities. Spe-
cialized subjects within public health include epidemiology, population history, environmental health, disease pre-
Public Health
­ 285 ­
vention, aging, biostatistics, reproductive and family health, health policy, health education, and the politics of
health-related research. A good foundation in the study of public health would include at least one course devoted
to the field as a whole and one course in statistics, supplemented by courses that provide grounding in demograph-
ic history and processes, decision-making, science and health, and humanistic and ethical dimensions of the field.
It also would include field experience. The advisory committee on public health suggests that the following cate-

MAJOR
The major in Religion is designed to perform two related functions: to expose the student to the methods and
issues involved in the study of religion as a universal phenomenon of psychological, sociological, and cultural/his-
torical dimensions; and to confront students with the beliefs, practices, and values of specific religions through a
study of particular religious traditions. It is a program that affords each student an opportunity to fashion his/her
own sequence of study within a prescribed basic pattern constructed to ensure both coherence and variety. It con-
sists of at least nine semester courses as follows:
Required sequence courses
Religion 101 Introduction to Religion
Two seminars, one that explores a central topic of contemporary critical inquiry in the study of religion (courses
numbered 270-299) and one that explores a body of theory in the study of religion (courses numbered
301-309)
Religion 402 Issues in the Study of Religion
Elective courses
Five additional courses in Religion are to be selected in such a way that at least one course is taken in both the
Western and non-Western traditions. Students will construct their sequence in consultation with departmental ad-
visors and subject to their approval. In order to achieve a deep coverage of a particular religious tradition or set of
related problems in the study of religion, students are urged to select three electives that together have some kind of
coherence, be it cultural, historical, or topical. Related courses from other departments or programs may be in-
cluded among the three courses, and the point of coherence can be the subject of research papers in the senior
seminar.
Students are advised to elect additional courses in related fields (e.g., psychology, sociology, anthropology, art,
history, philosophy) in order to gain a clearer understanding of the social and cultural contexts in which religions
appear.
For those who wish to go beyond the formally-listed courses into a more intensive study of a particular religious
tradition, methodological trend, or religious phenomenon (e.g., ritual, symbol-formation, mysticism, theology,
etc.), there is the opportunity to undertake independent study or, with the approval of the department, to pursue a
thesis project.
The value of the major in Religion derives from its fostering of a critical appreciation of the complex role
religion plays in every society, even those that consider themselves non-religious. The major makes one sensitive
to the role religion plays in shaping the terms of cultural discourse, of social attitudes and behavior, and of moral
reflection. But it also discloses the ways in which religion and its social effects represent the experience of individ-
ual persons and communities. In doing these things, the major further provides one with interdisciplinary analyti-
cal tools and cross-cultural experience and opens up new avenues for dealing with both the history of a society and
culture and the relationships between different societies and cultures. What one learns as a Religion major is there-
fore remarkably applicable to a wide range of other fields of study or professions.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN RELIGION
The degree with honors in Religion requires the above-mentioned nine courses and the preparation of a thesis
of 75+ pages with a grade of B+ or better. A thesis may combine revised work done in other courses with new
material prepared while enrolled either in Religion 493-W31 or Religion W31-494. Up to two-thirds of the work
in the thesis may be such revised work, but at least one-third must represent new work. The thesis must constitute a
coherent whole either by its organizing theme or by a focus on a particular religious tradition. Candidates will also
be expected to present the results of their thesis orally in a public presentation. Students who wish to be candidates
for honors in Religion will submit proposals and at least one paper that may be included in the thesis to the depart-
ment in the spring of their junior year. Students must normally have at least a 3.5 GPA in Religion to be considered
for the honors program.
The chair will serve as advisor to non-majors.
STUDY ABROAD
The Williams College Religion Department encourages potential majors to study abroad in order to enhance
their education and gain international perspectives on religious studies. There are many excellent study abroad
opportunities offering students a variety of possible experiences: among them cultural immersion, field work, in-
tensive language learning, independent study, participation in another educational system. Many of our majors
study in the Williams College Oxford Program, but our majors also regularly pursue a semester or year-long study
in other programs.
REL 101(F,S) Introduction to Religion
As an examination of the structure and dynamics of certain aspects of religious thought, action, and sensibility--
employing psychological, sociological, anthropological, and philosophical modes of inquiry--the course offers a
general exposure to basic methodological issues in the study of religion, and includes consideration of several
cross-cultural types of religious expression in non-literate and literate societies.

REL 203(F) Judaism: Innovation and Tradition (Same as Jewish Studies 101) (D)
What is the relationship between modern notions of Jewish identity, thought and practice and the Hebrew Bible?
How does the modern Reform movement link itself to the laws of the rabbinic sages? Are there consistent values
and ideals that mark Jewish moral thought throughout its history? What elements of the Jewish tradition have
enabled its elasticity and historic persistence? By providing an introduction to the traditions of Jewish thought and
practice through the ages, this course will take up these questions. Though the course's method of progression will
be primarily chronological, commencing with myths of Israel's beginnings and culminating with contemporary
debates over Jewish identity, we will additionally emphasize the strong ties between methods of Jewish thought
and practices and the surrounding cultural environments in which they developed. We will approach the tradition
not only with historical concerns, but with literary and philosophical aims as well. We will analyze the interpretive
strategies, theological presuppositions, and political aims that accompany the tradition both in its continuities and
its ruptures. Finally, we will consider the extent to which we can speak of Judaism under the category of religion,
considering as well the other categories that have been proposed for Judaism, Jews and Jewishness, such as nation,
people, race and ethnicity, and the motivations behind such designations. Texts will include the Hebrew Bible,
Holz (ed), Back to the Sources; Halbertal, People of the Book; Mendelssohn, Jerusalem; Hertzberg (ed), The Zion-
ist Idea; Levi, Survival in Auschwitz as well as excerpts and articles available in a course packet.

REL 213(F) Jews, Gentiles and Christians: Where and When Did Christianity Come From--And
Where Did It Go (Wrong)?
This course will seek to unravel the tangled web of issues surrounding the origins of Christianity. We will begin by
looking at the status of Jews and Judaism in the ancient Mediterranean world before the time of Jesus, i.e., rela-
tions between Jews and Gentiles before Christianity. We will then move to a study of the early gospels and Paul
and consider their place within first-century Judaism, i.e., should we think of them as Jews or Christians.
From that point on we will consider Jewish reactions to the Christian movement; versions of what came to known
as Jewish Christians, i.e., followers of Jesus who maintained full observance of the Mosaic laws; public debates
between Jews and Christians; and finally, the role of synagogues as mixed communities of Jews, Gentiles AND

REL 221(S) Post-Enlightenment Christian Thought
Christianity in the Western world has undergone numerous challenges since the early eighteenth century. Many
thinkers have turned inward, developing pietistic theologies compatible with the modern world, while others have
searched for an adequate expression of Christianity after the "Death of God." Another, remarkably resilient strand
has actively turned against the Enlightenment in ironic ways, appropriating modern technologies, for example,
while repudiating scientific discoveries that undermine their belief. This course will examine these issues, along
with a careful consideration of the way gender, identity, and community have come to play a powerful role in
contemporary expressions of Christian belief.

NORTH AMERICAN RELIGIONS
REL 225(S) Religions of North America (Same as American Studies 225)
Scholars have written much about the history of religion in North America, but the effort has been fraught with
many oversights. Recent scholarship has begun to take account of the fact that most religions in North America
either did not emerge from European sources, or have existed long before the arrival of Europeans. Indeed, many
religions have grown out of the American soil during the past several centuries-what some would call the product
of religious "cross-fertilization," and what others would deem as religious and cultural thievery, i.e. colonialism.
This course follows a modified historical trajectory, one that strives to allow the voices of forgotten "others" to
speak, bringing questions of colonialism, identity, and the importance of religious community to the forefront.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will consist of several short response papers, thoughtful interaction, a mid-

examine some significant utopian perspectives on the Americas, starting with Christopher Columbus' 1500 de-
scription of the "new world" and concluding with late twentieth-century utopias like Aztlán as employed by the
Chicana/o student movement in 1969.

THE ISLAMIC TRADITION
REL 230(F) Reading Reading: An Introduction to the Qur'an and Islam (Same as Comparative
Literature 260) (W)
One of the two most consequential texts in human history, the Qur'an is more conscious of itself as text and the
work of interpretation that is part of the life of a text. Because it is God's most important sign (and also because it is
Religion
­ 289 ­
relatively short) millions have memorized it and the art of Qur'anic recitation is one of the supreme Islamic per-
forming arts. Nevertheless it is primarily as a text that the Qur'an exists in itself and in the minds of Muslims. The
text of the Qur'an will thus be the focus of this course, reading it extensively, intensively and repeatedly through-
out the semester. We will attend to the structure and variety of styles and topics in the text and to the Qur'an's
understanding of itself in relation to other forms of literary expression. We will place the form and content in the
context of seventh century c.e. Arab society and attend to the life of the Prophet (PBUH) that provides one crucial
framework to the text. Through the lens of tafsir, Qur'anic commentary, we will also use the text to give an initial
survey of some of the main theological, philosophical, mystical and legal developments in the Islamic tradition.
Finally we will explore some of the aspects of the place of the text in the life of Muslims, including the develop-
ment of calligraphy and recitation.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: three essays (6-8 pages) based on class materials (at least one will have
a revision process). Students able to read the Arabic text may substitute work in a collateral reading group of the
Qur'an in Arabic for one of the essays.

REL 234(S) Shi'ism Ascendant?
One consequence, intended or not, of recent U.S. actions in the Middle East has been to inflame the Sunni/Shi'ite
division and raise fears of Shi'ite ascendancy. Sectarian conflict is, in fact, the exception rather than the rule in
Islamic history because Sunnis and Shi'a have in most places been separate and lived relatively peacefully togeth-
er where they intermixed. This is the fourth time in Islamic history when the specter of an ascendant Shi'ism has
occupied the Muslim community. Shi'ism has always been an alliance of the dispossessed and the intellectuals
(assuming the latter are not among the former) and functioned in Islam to provide a vocabulary of revolution, a
highly developed philosophy of religion, and a pietistic fervor in contrast to which Sunnism emerged. This course
will compare the three earlier putative episodes of Shi'ite ascendancy in the eighth, tenth and sixteenth centuries
C.E. and set these in conversation with contemporary developments. We will focus on the role of early Shi'ism as
the vocabulary of an alternative vision of the legitimacy of the Islamic state, the ideas of the imamate and martyr-
dom, the emergence of Isma'ili and Twelver versions of Shi'ism, the conversion of Safavid Iran to Shi'ism, the
Iranian revolution of 1979 and the scene in the post-Saddam Islamic world.

REL 236(S) The Greater Game? Central Asia and its Neighbors Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow
(Same as History 216 and International Studies 101)
The collapse of the Soviet Union, the recognition of untapped mineral wealth, and Islamic resurgence have all led
to an increased focus on Central Asia and its neighbors, Russia, China, the Middle East. This course will be an
introduction to the Caucasus, the Central Asian Republics, Xinjiang and Mongolia and the interests of their neigh-
bors, including now the United States in those areas. This will be a lecture course that will introduce the salient
themes and issues that are necessary for understanding these areas. The course will inevitably be deeply compara-
tive focusing on themes of "the clash of civilizations," the construction of national identities, notions of ethnicity
and the treatment of ethnic minorities, resurgent religious movements, and the relation of state and civil society.
This course will also function as an introduction to doing social scientific research on these areas and special atten-
tion will be devoted to the preparation of a research paper.

EAST ASIAN TRADITIONS
REL 250(S) Scholars, Saints and Immortals: The Religious Life in East Asia (Same as Asian
Studies 250) (D)
In East Asian cultures, as in the United States, popular conceptions of morality typically take their shape, not from
explicit rules, but from moral paragons--stylized figures that are said to embody a distinctive cluster of virtues.
For example, American Christians invoke not only Jesus, but also a pantheon of "secular saints" as diverse as
Martin Luther King Jr. and General Patton, George Washington and Cesar Chavez. This course will explore the
Religion
­ 290 ­
cultural functions of moral paragons (and heroes more generally) by introducing students to examples from Chi-
nese and Japanese history, ranging from Confucian articulations of the ideal scholar-bureaucrat to Buddhist con-
ceptions of the Bodhisattva to Taoist immortals. We will also interpret the top-down creation of new moral para-
gons by East Asian states, including the popularization of the samurai in interwar Japan and Mao Zedong's self-
presentation as the embodiment of China. National communities, after all, gain their coherence from the invoca-
tion of public lives as well as the repetition of founding myths and collective narratives. Readings will include
primary texts in translation by Chuang-tzu, Confucius, Shantideva and others. This course fulfills the Exploring
Diversity Initiative by providing students with tools for cross-cultural analysis of moral paragons, as part of how
societies manage difference and articulate hierarchies of privilege and power.

REL 256(S) Engendering Buddhism: How Women and Men Shape and Are Shaped by
Buddhism (Same as Anthropology 256 and Women's and Gender Studies 256) (W) (D)
This course looks at how gender has shaped Buddhism as well as how Buddhism has shaped gender. Most gener-
ally, it considers the myriad ways that Buddhist soteriology and practice produce the very gender differences they
purport to overcome. How have the Buddha and his far-flung disciples institutionalized gender differences in spite
of their putative goal of transcending duality? We examine the varying experiences of women and men in Bud-
dhist societies and literatures as a lens by which to analyze the pervasive operation of social and gender hierarchy.
Our analysis revolves around several interdependent themes. Finally we discuss how well feminist and American
revisions of Buddhism have transformed gender and other forms of difference. (1) How do female and male bod-
ies become the subject of a specific set of Buddhist gazes? What does Buddhist discourse say about the possibility
of gaining enlightenment in the female body? (2) How do gender divisions reflect deeper social divisions such as
class and race in Buddhist discourse? (3) How have feminist deconstructions of Buddhism transformed gender
and social hierarchies in the contemporary world? This course fulfills the Exploring Diversity Initiative by seeking
to theorize the ways that Buddhism has produced and reinscribed gender differences and social hierarchies.
Format: seminar. Requirements: 2 midterm papers, weekly Blackboard participation, final research papers, and

REL 286(F) (formerly 308) Shopping: Desire, Compulsion and Consumption
If the workplace was the essential site of modernity, then the shopping mall is the quintessential site of postmod-
ernity; the place where consumption trumps production and, it has been argued, our only remaining public space.
This course will focus on the experience of shopping, focusing on three themes. First we will explore the manufac-
turing of desire on which consumption must depend. We will critique the tired critiques of advertising and explore
in more depth the neurotic and erotic dimensions of the creation of desire for objects. We will then turn to some
comparative and historical analysis contrasting the experience of shopping in traditional bazaars and contempo-
rary malls, as well as exploring the history of consumerism from the eighteenth century through the current phe-
nomena of globalization. Finally, we will explore the place of shopping in our collective imaginations, attending
especially to the relation between the gendering of the shopping experience and expressions of contempt and out-
rage toward consumerism, with a special focus on the discourse on Christmas in American society.

REL 288(F) Embodied Mind: A Cross-Cultural Exploration (Same as Philosophy 288)
This course examines some of the central questions concerning the nature of the mind: the place of intentionality,
the role of emotions, the relation with the body, the nature of subjectivity, the scope of reflexivity, etc. In confront-
ing these questions, we do not proceed purely theoretically but consider the contributions of various observation-
based traditions, from Buddhist psychology and meditative practices to phenomenology to neurosciences. We be-
gin by examining some of the central concepts of Buddhist psychology, its treatment of the mind as a selfless
stream of consciousness, its examination of the variety of mental factors and its accounts of the relation between
cognition and affects. We also introduce the practice of meditation as a way to observe the mind and raise ques-
tions concerning the place of its study in the mind-sciences. We pursue this reflection by examining the views of
James, Husserl, Sartre and Merleau-Ponty, particularly as they concern the methods for the study of the mind and
the relation between intentionality, reflexivity and the body. In this way, we develop a rich array of analytical tools
and observational practices to further our understanding of the mind. But we also question the value of these tools,
which are based on first person approaches, by relating them to the third person studies of neurobiologists such as
Damasio. We come to appreciate the importance of considering the biology on which mental processes are based
and the light that this approach throws on the central questions of the course. We conclude by considering the
relation between first and third person studies of the mind, focusing on Varella's concept of the embodied mind as
a fruitful bridge between these different traditions.
Format: seminar. Requirements: attendance to a day-long introduction to the practice of meditation, regular prac-
tice of meditation, a class presentation and a research paper (15 pages).

REL 289T(S) (formerly 309) Exile, Homecoming and the Promised Land (Same as Comparative
Literature 309T and Jewish Studies 491T) (W) (D)
In terms of vocabulary and metaphor, the Jewish experience of exile pervades modern, western discourse on the
experience of being alienated, severed, and separated from one's national and natural homeland. Thus in this
course we will take the Jewish experience of exile (galut) as our point of departure for a broader discussion of
these themes as they relate to other diasporic communities. As a consequence of increased mobility, political insta-
bilities, economic insecurity and the proliferation of means of communication, the state of Diaspora increasingly
characterizes populations across the globe, from Africa, Asia, South America, and Europe. While we will not
focus specifically on these communities, one of our tasks will be to discover how the Jewish experience shapes the
discourse on exile and Diaspora that pervades modern discussions of displacement and emigration. We must fur-
ther consider what is at stake politically and philosophically in privileging the Jewish experience, especially given
the post-1948 community of Palestinian refugees. To illuminate this discussion we will draw on the literature of
the Jewish tradition from the Hebrew Bible and rabbis to Twentieth Century accounts and reflections of Franz
Kafka, Walter Benjamin and Emmanuel Levinas, as well as materials that reflect the voices of other refugee com-
munities. We will then move to examine the relationship of the notion of the homeland to that of the promised
land. We will consider the ambivalence in the nineteenth and twentieth century concerning discourse of blood and
soil, and the consequent possibility that exile and rootlessness could signal positively.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: meeting in pairs, each student will either write and present a paper or respond to
their partner's paper. Each student will write and present a 5-page paper on alternating weeks. On the weeks in
which the student is not presenting, she will be expected to write a 1- to 2-page critique/response to her classmate's
paper. The final assignment will be an 8- to 10-page paper that expands on an issue or question raised in class.

REL 290T(F) Explorations of the Afterlife (W)
From Heaven to Hell, Valhalla to Hades, the Fields of Aaru to the Land of Yellow Springs, all cultures have gener-

tutorial will guide students on an exploration of the topographies of these shadow-lands. In an effort to map the
continuities and discontinuities between these visions of the hereafter, we will consider them as reflections of ex-

REL 303(F) (formerly 280) The Turn to Religion in Post-Modern Thought (Same as Jewish Studies

As thinkers of the 20th century came to question the Enlightenment ideal of human self-sovereignty, both for its
intellectual and political consequences, many turned back to religious imagery and concepts in pursuit of alternate
modes of conceptualizing the human being. This course will examine some such endeavors in the fields of philos-
ophy, psychoanalysis and literature. While none of the texts we examine will be explicitly theological, all will, in
some form or another, make use of theological notions such as revelation, redemption, or sacrifice. In examining
these texts we will be asking some fundamental questions: What meaning do religious concepts have when emp-
tied of dogmatic content? How effective are these concepts when employed in the service of cultural critique?
How might such efforts reflect back on the theorizing and practice of religions in contemporary society? We will,
furthermore, analyze the very category of the post-modern by considering its relationship to the Enlightenment,
debating whether this relationship is one of continuity, rupture or both, and dissecting the critique that post-modern
philosophy's concern for religion is a sign of its nostalgic or reactionary nature. Readings will include Immanuel
Kant's Religion within the Limits of Reason alone, Friedrich Nietzsche's Twilight of the Idols, Jacques Lacan's
Feminine Sexuality, as well as essays by Luce Irigaray, Georges Bataille, Emmanuel Levinas, Jean-François Lyo-
tard and Jacques Derrida.

REL 307(S) Thinking Gods: Cognitive Theories of Religion
Although it is still in its infancy, the so-called "cognitive turn" has already become one of the most exciting con-
temporary developments in the study of religion. During the past twenty years, scholars influenced by cognitive
science have begun to formulate new models and challenge old assumptions about human religiosity and its rela-
tionship to the mind. In so doing, they have articulated theories about the evolutionary origins of religious con-
cepts, reassessed the role of memory and of counterintuitive explanations in the perpetuation of religious ideas,
and developed new concepts such as "theological incorrectness" and "systematic anthropomorphism." By ex-
amining the cutting-edge work produced by members of this movement on both sides of the Atlantic, this seminar
for advanced students will trace the historical roots of the cognitive turn and introduce some of its most important
recent products. Authors to be considered include Sigmund Freud, Ludwig Feuerbach, Jean-Pierre Dupuy, D. Ja-
son Slone, Pascal Boyer, Veikko Anttonen, Scott Atran, Richard Dawkins, Dan Sperber, and Ilkka Pyysiäinen.

FRENCH
MAJOR--French Language and Literature
The French major seeks to provide training in literary and cultural analysis and linguistic expression through
the study of selected texts from the French-speaking world. Emphasis is placed on the changes in form and subject
matter from the early modern period to the contemporary era.
The major consists of nine courses above the 105 level with optimally one course each from the following
areas:
1) Poetry and Poetics
2) Prose Narrative and Fiction
3) Theatre and Dramatic Literature
4) Thematics, Special Topics, Survey Courses
Students must also take a 400-level capstone seminar which may count toward any of the four re-
quired areas.
As RFLR 104 is a special course that replaces 105 and 106 for those students starting French at the 103 level,
104 will count towards the major as a substitute for RLFR 106.
Students entering the major program at the 109/110-level may, with the permission of the Department, choose
as part of their major program, one course in Art History, History, Philosophy, Comparative Literature or other
subjects that relate to and broaden their study of French. Students entering the major program at the 200-level may,
in some cases and with the permission of the Department, include two such courses in their major program.
Working with the major advisor, the student will formulate a curricular plan that will ensure balance and coher-
ence in courses taken. Such balance and coherence will be based on the above areas of literary and cultural inves-
tigation. Prospective majors should discuss their program with the major advisor by the end of their sophomore
year. This is especially imperative for students who are planning to spend a part or all of their junior year in France.
Inasmuch as all courses in French assume the active participation of each student in discussions conducted in
the foreign language, regular attendance at class meetings is expected.
MAJOR--French Studies
The major in French Studies is an interdisciplinary program that provides students with the opportunity to ac-
quire skills and knowledge embracing the cultural, historical, social, and political heritage of France and the Fran-
cophone world. The program allows for an individualized course of study involving work in several departments
and the opportunity to study abroad.
Students electing the French Studies major should register with the French Studies faculty advisor during their
sophomore year. At that time they should submit a feasibility plan that articulates their projected program.
The French Studies major consists of ten courses satisfying the following requirements:
1) at least two courses in French language and/or literature above the French 103 level;
2) a senior seminar;
3) Electives: The remaining courses needed to complete the major must be drawn from at least three different
departments and relate primarily to an aspect of the culture, history, society, and politics of France and the Franco-
phone world. These courses will be selected in consultation with members of the Department of Romance Lan-
guages. Appropriate electives might include:
History 331 The French and Haitian Revolutions
Religion 301 Psychology of Religion
All courses in French literature and language above the 103 level.
In addition, students should take at least two non-language courses that are taught in French.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN FRENCH
Honors candidates are required to have maintained a GPA of 3.5 in the major to qualify for submitting a thesis
proposal.
By May 15th of their junior year, candidates will have found a thesis advisor, and given the Department a three-
to five-page proposal and a preliminary bibliography. (In some cases, and upon consultation with the Department,
candidates will have the option to choose a second reader in addition to their primary advisor; for example, when
the thesis is interdisciplinary enough in nature that it requires the expertise of an additional reader).
This proposal will be discussed by the Department; by June 1st, the candidate will be informed whether he/she
can proceed with the thesis, and if so, what changes need to be made to the focus and scope of the project. The
summer before the senior year will be spent compiling a more detailed bibliography and reading.
Upon their return to Williams, candidates will devote to their theses two semesters of independent study (be-
yond the nine courses required for the major) and the winter study period of their senior year (493-W31-494). The
thesis will be written in French and will usually not be shorter than fifty pages. By the end of the Fall semester,
students will normally have a clear outline of the project, have done substantial research, and produced the draft of
at least the first half of the project. During January this draft will be suitably rewritten and edited with a view to a
final version, while the candidates will also begin work on remaining chapters.
Romance Languages
­ 294 ­
Candidates will submit what they have written to the department on the last day of Winter Study.
On the Tuesday of the first week of the spring semester candidates will make a presentation of the project at a
departmental colloquium in French. The thesis will be promptly discussed and evaluated to determine whether or
not the student should continue in the honors program. The second semester of independent thesis work will be
spent writing more chapters, as well as revising, rewriting, and polishing the project where necessary. The com-
pleted thesis in its final form will be due on April 25th. At the end of the Spring term, the student will present and
defend the final project before members of the Department and others by invitation. The grade will be awarded
once members of the Department have consulted after the defense.
THE CERTIFICATE IN FRENCH
The Certificate in French Language and Cultures consists of a sequence of seven courses for which the student
must earn a cumulative grade average of B or higher. In addition, the student must take a proficiency test and
achieve a score of "Advanced." The test will be administered by the department once a year during the month of
April to all students desirous of obtaining the Certificate. Those interested should express their intent to the chair of
the department by March 1 or earlier.
For students with no prior French background, the course sequence will consist of French 101-102,
French 103 and 104, and three courses in French above the 104 level, with at least one of these courses at the
200-level or higher taken at Williams. If the student starts out the sequence at French 103, in addition to the three
courses in French beyond the 104 level (including a 200-level course or higher), two electives may be taken in
other departments. One elective should be in French or Francophone cultural history (art, literature, drama, music)
and the other in French or Francophone intellectual, political or social history.
See French Studies Major description above for list of possible electives in other departments.
PLACEMENT
A placement test in French is administered at Williams at the opening of the fall semester. Incoming first-year
students who register for any French course above the 101-102 level must take this test, regardless of their pre-
vious preparation.
STUDY ABROAD
French majors are strongly advised to complete part of the requirements for the major by studying abroad either
during the academic year or the summer. Most American study-in-France programs require applicants to have
completed a fifth-semester, college-level French course (French 105, for example) before they go abroad. A spe-
cial affiliation with the Hamilton Junior Year in France program enables Williams students (who have completed
105) to participate in a comprehensive academic and cultural experience in a French-speaking environment. Cred-
it for up to four courses towards the major can be granted at the discretion of the Department: normally 2 major
credit for one semester and up to 4 major credits for a full year or two semesters. The final assignment of credit will
be authorized in consultation with the student's major advisor once the student has returned to Williams. Such
credits can only be determined by review of course format, course materials, and evidence of satisfactory academ-
ic performance. Students interested in studying abroad need to consult with faculty members in French by the
second semester of their first year. Early planning is essential. Because the academic quality of certain programs of
study in France may well be beneath the pedagogical standards normally associated with a Williams education,
students will receive major credit for only those programs recommended by the Department. Please consult a fac-
ulty member to find out which programs are acceptable. Normally, the Department does not administer proficien-
cy exams (for study abroad) to any student who has not completed a French course at Williams.

RLFR 104(S) Intermediate French II: Advanced Intermediate Studies in French Language and
Francophone Culture
As a continuation of French 103, this course explores the diverse cultural and political identities in the Franco-
phone world through short literary texts and film from France, Africa, the Caribbean and the Middle East while
building on linguistic skills in French. The course will provide an in-depth advanced review of grammar struc-
tures, but will emphasize the application of those structures in activities of composition, reading, oral presentation
and discussion. After successfully completing French 104, students may register for French 109. Conducted in
French.
Format: class meets three hours a week plus a fourth conference hour with French teaching associates. Require-
ments: class participation, short papers, oral class presentations, quizzes and exams.
Prerequisites: French 103. This course is primarily for continuing French 103 students. Students who have placed
at the advanced intermediate level on the placement exam should register for French 105. Enrollment Limit: 20
(expected: 20). If overenrolled, preference given to continuing 103 students and potential French majors.

RLFR 105(F) Advanced French: Linguistic and Cultural Intrigue in the Francophone World (I)
What mysterious set of connections brings together a young Québecoise graduate student, an 18th-century French
manuscript by the author of Dangerous Liaisons, a chameleon-like Parisian bent on tracking the young student, a
sinister French police inspector, and a suave Caribbean book collector with roots in two continents? Where is the
kaleidoscope of cultural signs leading us: the Zydeco culture of Louisiana and New Orleans, enigmatic Creole
proverbs such as "The green beans are not salted" and "Okra is not eaten with one finger", the dizzying shift of
international locales, and the autumnal radiance of Paris? We set out with Claire Plouffe and her young, somewhat
sinister admirer, Jean-Louis Royer, through a deepening international mystery set in a Francophone environment
and embracing the rich variety of cultural and linguistic experience that has helped shape the role of France in the
world. Against this backdrop, the course seeks to build on the writing, reading, and aural comprehension skills in
French developed at the elementary and intermediate levels (especially those of French 103). It will consist of a
continued review of fundamental grammar structures, but will emphasize the application and assimilation of those
structures in activities of composition, oral presentation, and discussion. Conducted in French.
Requirements: class participation, attendance, short papers, and five hour-long exams.
Prerequisites: French 101-102, 103, or examination placement. Enrollment limit: 20 (expected: 20).

RLFR 106(S) Advanced French: Linguistic and Cultural Intrigue in the Francophone World
(II)
The plot thickens as Claire Plouffe's quest takes her and Jean-Louis Royer to the lush tropical climes of Fort-de-
France in Martinique, to the relaxed multi-cultural setting of Sénégal and French West Africa, on to the homey
comforts of Geneva and Switzerland, the rustic, lavender-laden ambience of Provence and the South of France,
and finally, the vertiginous return to Quebec and the unraveling and resolution of the enigma. Now, the range of
cultural signs is even more disparate, from the disquieting confrontations with colonialism and racial injustice, the
aspirations of négritude, the animist spirituality of African culture, the linguistic and political independence of the
Suisse Romande, and the ancient sense of linguistic and cultural autonomy that has helped shape Provence's dis-
tinctiveness within the unity that is France. As the mystery reaches its dénouement, the unraveling leads to a series
of revelations that shed light on the tales of murder, treachery, betrayal, and purported forgery that have served as
the backdrop to Claire's long quest for the mysterious manuscript. This course continues the basic structure, goals
and methodology developed in RLFR 105. It assumes active familiarity with the French present, compound past,
imperfect, and subjunctive tenses, as well as with most of the basic irregular verbs. Its focus continues to highlight
writing, reading, and aural comprehension skills in the context of multi-cultural interpretation and grammar re-
view. Conducted in French.
Requirements: class participation, attendance, short papers, and five hour-long exams.
Prerequisites: French 101-102, 103, 105 or examination placement. Enrollment limit: 20 (expected: 20). Prefer-
ence given to students continuing from RLFR 105 and those admitted by placement.

LITERATURE COURSES
RLFR 109(F) Introduction to French Literature: Laughter and Despair
Through an organized web of obsessions, this course will introduce students to some seminal moments of French
literature and culture. In the face of human misery and futility, the writers selected respond in a multiplicity of
ways, ranging from despair to laughter. The course will gravitate around dialectically opposed though not exclu-
sive notions such as seriousness and frivolity (frivolous seriousness, serious frivolity), depth and superficiality,
being and appearance, the Court and the City. By establishing connections between the various genres and peri-
ods, the course will show how the reading of one text infects and enhances our understanding of another. Readings
will include: Villon, Du Bellay, Ronsard, Pascal, Molière, Perrault, Chateaubriand, Flaubert, and Maupassant
Conducted in French.

RLFR 111(F) Introduction to Francophone Studies (Same as Africana Studies 111) (D)
The Francophone world, stretching across Europe, Africa, the Middle East, Asia, the Caribbean and the Americas,
has often been described as a family joined by a shared language and condition born of colonial history. Through
fiction and film, this course will examine how writers and filmmakers from the Francophone world have ap-
proached the idea of their family both literally and metaphorically, using the idea of family to explore questions of
identity, origins, colonialism, resistance, nationhood and interconnectedness in a global community. This course
invites students to enter into critical engagement with cultural constructions of difference, colonial and post-colo-
nial constructions of subjectivity, culturally contested imaginations and treatment of gender and race, and the very
idea of the Francophone itself. Authors we will read include: Jean-Marie Adiaffi (Côte d'Ivoire), Henri Lopes
(Congo), Driss Chraibi (Morocco), Dany Laferriere (Haiti), Maryse Conde (Guadeloupe), Aime Cesaire (Marti-
nique), Assia Djebar (Algeria), and Linda Lê (Vietnam). Films studied include Moolaadé (Ousmane Sembène),

RLFR 210(S) Fantastic Spaces and Imaginary Places: Literary Text and Image in Late
Medieval and Early Modern France
When Aristotle speaks of Homer's powers of language, he describes the Poet's skill as a dimension of energy and
eye, the capacity to "represent everything as moving and living" and thus to be "graphic", to make the audience
actually see things through words. Medieval and Renaissance French writers based their literary projects on these
ancient theories of visualization and presentation. The result was a period of intense literary creativity that encom-
passes a kaleidoscope of issues converging both on poetics and painting as well as on concepts of architectural and
landscape design. This capacity to imagine is at the heart of writing about travel, exploration, discovery, spatial and
natural description, phantasmagoric quests, poetic "madness", and the contemplation of mind. The primary ve-
hicle through which we will examine these issues is the literary text and its supporting manuscript illuminations
and book illustrations: namely, selected texts from Guillaume de Lorris' and Jean de Meung's Roman de la Rose
and the allegory of love, Guillaume Du Bellay's Antiquités de Rome and Regrets, François Rabelais's grotesque
epic of Gargantua and Pantagruel, and Pierre de Ronsard's sonnet cycles on love and nature (Les Amours). We will
examine how these overarching literary issues intersect with parallel developments in the visual arts (Burgundy in
the 15th century, the Myth of the Golden Age, The School of Fontainebleau, Clouet), ecclesiastical and domestic
architecture, including the development of the château, landscape and garden design and its allegorical configura-
tions. Conducted in French.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: class participation, two 7-page papers, a midterm examination, and an
oral presentation.

be heard over the ringing of cell-phones. Old and new exist side by side, albeit sometimes very uncomfortably.

unequal modernization, unemployment, cultural change and cultural resistance. In this course, we will read short

RLFR 412(S) Senior Seminar: Desperate Housewives and Extreme Makeovers: Novel
Approaches to the Nineteenth-Century Novel (Same as Women's and Gender Studies 408)
In 1834, Balzac wrote that "Paris is a veritable ocean. Sound it: you will never know its depth." The same can be
said of the French nineteenth-century novel and its boundless ability to echo the historical past and reverberate in
the cultural present. Desperate housewives, sex in the city, queer eyes for straight guys, and extreme makeovers fill
the pages of the nineteenth-century novel. From the Romanticism of Stendhal and Hugo, and the Realism of Bal-
zac and Flaubert, to the Naturalism of Maupassant and Zola, the novel became an extraordinary forum for examin-
ing illicit sexuality, institutional misogyny, social injustice, criminal passions, revolutionary struggles, and Parisian
pleasures in nineteenth-century France. Characters such as the imprisoned housewife Emma Bovary, the reluctant
revolutionary Jean Valjean, the social-climbing lover Julien Sorel, the ambitious undergraduate Rastignac, the do-
mestically-abused Gervaise, and the man-eating courtesan Nana became synonymous with France's turbulent so-
cial and political landscape from the 1830s to the 1880s. And as recent film adaptations make clear, these charac-
ters continue to haunt our twenty-first century present. Reinterpreted by such contemporary actors as Gérard De-
pardieu, Isabelle Huppert, Uma Thurman, Claire Danes, and Jennifer Aniston, the nineteenth-century novel con-
tinues to sound out the scandalous and sensational depths of our own century. Readings to include novels by Bal-
zac, Stendhal, Hugo, Flaubert, Maupassant, and Zola. Films to include adaptations by Clément, Berri, August,
Arteta, Lelouch, and Chabrol. Conducted in French.
Format: seminar. Requirements: active class participation, two short papers, an oral presentation, and a final paper.
Prerequisites: French 109, 110, 111 or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 12 (expected: 10). Preference

SPANISH
The Spanish major consists of nine courses above the 103-104 level. These nine courses include 301, any 200
level or above (excluding RLSP 205 and RLSP 303), and 403. Spanish majors should note that RLSP 301 is only
offered in alternate years, and they are therefore required to plan their courses accordingly. One 200-level course
must be completed at Williams. Other courses, taken at overseas programs, may be used to satisfy the require-
ments of the major, with approval of the department. The Spanish faculty strongly suggests that students take 201
and 200 at some point in their studies, and especially recommends that they do so before rather than after studying
abroad.
The major seeks to provide training in literary analysis and linguistic expression, as well as an appreciation of
Hispanic civilization, through the study of the major writers of the Spanish-speaking world.
Students majoring in Spanish may replace one of their Spanish electives with a course in Comparative Litera-
ture, with one course in Latin-American Studies that is 200-level or higher, or with a course in Linguistics.
Inasmuch as all courses in Spanish assume the active participation of each student in discussions conducted in
the foreign language, regular attendance at class meetings is expected.
Courses numbered in the 100s are language courses, with 105 and 106 combining grammar and literature.
RLSP 200 and RLSP 201 focus on civilization and culture, while other 200-level classes serve as gateway courses
for literary study, in ascending order of difficulty; they are thus suitable for first-years and sophomores. Courses in
the 300s require both serious grounding in the study of literature and an advanced command of the language. The
400-level course offered annually is the senior seminar, serving as "capstone course" to the Spanish major.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN SPANISH
Candidates for a senior thesis must have maintained a 3.5 GPA in the major by the time of proposal submission.
Two alternative routes are available to those who wish to apply for the degree with honors.
The first of these involves the writing of a senior thesis. Honors candidates are required to have maintained a
GPA of 3.5 in the major to qualify for submitting a thesis proposal.
By May 15th of their junior year, candidates will have found a thesis advisor, and given the Department a three-
to five-page proposal and a preliminary bibliography. (In some cases, and upon consultation with the Department,
candidates will have the option to choose a second reader in addition to their primary advisor; for example, when
the thesis is interdisciplinary enough in nature that it requires the expertise of an additional reader).
This proposal will be discussed by the Department; by June 1st, the candidate will be informed whether he/she
can proceed with the thesis, and if so, what changes need to be made to the focus and scope of the project. The
summer before the senior year will be spent compiling a more detailed bibliography and reading.
Upon their return to Williams, candidates will devote to their theses two semesters of independent study (be-
yond the nine courses required for the major) and the winter study period of their senior year (493-W31-494). The
thesis will be written in Spanish and will usually not be shorter than fifty pages. By the end of the Fall semester,
students will normally have a clear outline of the project, have done substantial research, and produced the draft of
at least the first half of the project. During January this draft will be suitably rewritten and edited with a view to a
final version, while the candidates will also begin work on remaining chapters.
Candidates will submit what they have written to the department on the last day of Winter Study.
On the Tuesday of the first week of the spring semester candidates will make a presentation of the project at a
departmental colloquium in Spanish. The thesis will be promptly discussed and evaluated to determine whether or
not the student should continue in the honors program. The second semester of independent thesis work will be
spent writing more chapters, as well as revising, rewriting, and polishing the project where necessary. The com-
pleted thesis in its final form will be due on April 25th. At the end of the Spring term, the student will present and
defend the final project before members of the Department and others by invitation. The grade will be awarded
once members of the Department have consulted after the defense.
The second route is a group of three clearly related courses (offered by the Department of Romance Languages
or by other departments, such as History, Art, Philosophy, English, etc.), only one of which may be counted in the
nine courses comprising the major. One of the courses will be an Independent Study (plus senior year WSP 030) in
the spring of the senior year, at the end of which the student will write an essay that synthesizes the content of the
three related courses. Students may apply for this route by November 2 of the senior year.
Romance Languages

In the case of both routes to the degree with honors, the department's recommendation for graduation with
honors will be based on the originality and thoroughness of the finished project.
THE CERTIFICATE IN SPANISH
The Certificate in Spanish Language and Culture consists of a sequence of seven courses for which the student
must earn a cumulative grade average of B or higher. In addition, the student must take a proficiency test and
achieve a score of "Advanced." The test will be administered by the department once a year during the month of
April to all students desirous of obtaining the Certificate. Those so interested should express their intent to the chair
of the department by March 1 or earlier.
For students with no prior Spanish background, the course sequence will consist of Spanish 101-102, Spanish
103 and 104, and three courses in Spanish above the 104 level, with at least one of these courses at the 200-level or
higher taken at Williams. If the student starts out the sequence at Spanish 103, in addition to the three courses in
Spanish beyond the 104 level (including a 200-level course or higher), two electives may be taken in other depart-
ments. One elective should be in Spanish or Latin-American cultural history (art, literature, drama, music) and the
other in Spanish or Latin-American intellectual, political, or social history. Spanish 200, 201, or 208 can be
counted for the elective requirement.
Electives may be considered from a variety of departments and programs. However, students should consult
with the chair of Romance Languages before making any enrollment decisions.
PLACEMENT
A placement test in Spanish is administered at Williams at the opening of the fall semester. Incoming first-year
students who wish to register for any Spanish courses above the 101 level must take this test.
STUDY ABROAD
Spanish majors, as well as non-majors interested in further exposure to the language and the culture, are strong-
ly encouraged to include study in Spain or Latin America as part of their program at Williams. Through its special
ties with the Hamilton College Academic Year in Spain, the department offers a comprehensive linguistic and
cultural experience in a Spanish-speaking environment, for periods either of a semester or a year. Credit for up to
four courses can be granted at the discretion of the Department for study overseas. Students interested in study
abroad should consult with a member of the department at their earliest convenience.

Linguistically, culturally, and historically, the Iberian peninsula bears the traces of the past civilizations that once
inhabited the land. Iberians, Celts, Phoenicians, Greeks, Carthaginians, Romans, Visigoths, Arabs, and Jews have
all been instrumental in shaping the modern nation and the contributions of these groups are the starting point in
any understanding of Spain's rich cultural heritage and traditions. Cultural diversity in contemporary Spain reflects
at once the distinct autonomous regions which constitute the socio-political fabric of the country, such as Catalonia
and the Basque Country, and also patterns of migration both within and beyond the European Union. In this course
we will examine and consider Spain past and present. We will study periods of tolerance and cultural brilliance,
such as the co-existence of Arabs and Jews in Medieval Cordoba, as well as censorship and repression, brought
about by the institution of the Inquisition, for example, or during the Franco Regime. Materials will include repre-
sentative works from literature, art, architecture, music, and film. Secondary texts providing essential socio-politi-
cal and historical context will be supplied. Conducted in Spanish.

ment limit: 20 (expected: 20).

RLSP 204(S) Icons and Imaginaries: Culture and Politics in Latin America (D)
This course provides an overview of Latin American culture and politics by focusing on some of the most recog-
nizable names and faces from the continent's turbulent history: Christopher Columbus, Hernán Cortés and Mal-
intzín, Simón Bolívar, José Martí, Pancho Villa, Eva Perón, Frida Kahlo, Che Guevara, Rigoberta Menchú and
Hugo Chávez. In addition to exploring the controversies surrounding each figure and her or his influence within a
specific historical context, we'll also unpack some of the overarching issues of Latin American culture and poli-
tics: How are nations and nationalism constructed through processes of representation, and what roles do specific
iconic figures play in that process? How can popular culture challenge elite representations of the nation and its
heroes/heroines, and how durable are the images it produces as expressions of collective will? What opportunities
are available to women and sexual minorities in a political culture that has been historically dominated by macho
military types? This course fulfills the EDI requirement by enabling students to appreciate the figures that have
influenced generations of Latin American women and men and their sense of what is politically possible, while
challenging the class to identify the operations of power at work in the construction of the figures themselves.
Format: lecture/discussion. Assignments will include political and cultural essays, literature and films. Three

RLSP 230T(F) Violent States, Violent Subjects: Nation-Building and Atrocity in 19th-Century
Latin America (Same as Comparative Literature 230T) (W) (D)
Although the massive, mechanized wars of the 20th century often overshadow earlier conflicts, the 19th century
was also a period of widespread bloodshed in Latin America. Even after the carnage of the Independence Wars
came to an end, the new republics continued some of the most violent pursuits of the colonial period: indigenous
people were conquered, their lands settled by whites or used for grazing cattle, and blacks (often despite the offi-
cial abolition of slavery) continued to suffer exclusion, oppression, and abuse. It was a century of civil wars (Mexi-
co, Argentina, Uruguay, Peru, Colombia, Venezuela) and of two bitter international wars, the Paraguayan
War(1864-1870), and the Pacific War (1879-1883), each of which would have a lasting impact on the countries
involved. In this tutorial we will explore the literary links between some of the violent conflicts listed above and
the foundation of national identities in Latin America, reading texts that probe the social and ethical implications of
state-sponsored violence. Issues to be explored include militarism and the development of nationalism; genocide
and the national community; torture, truth and testimony; and the nature of"civilization." We will read a variety of
19th century texts by authors like Rosa Guerra, Lucio V. Mansilla and Ricardo Palma; in addition we will also read
a few contemporary texts, written in the aftermath of the most recent dictatorships in the Southern Cone and else-
where, that actively reflect on the long history of state-sponsored violence in Latin America. This course fulfills
the EDI requirement by encouraging students to examine the ways that national identities have been constructed in
Latin America (and, by extension,elsewhere) emphasizing the forms of violence that have been part of that pro-
cess.
Format: tutorial. Students will decide whether they prefer to take the course in Spanish (for Spanish/COMP credit)
or in English (for COMP credit). Students will work in pairs throughout the semester, each group meeting with the
instructor once a week. Each week one of the students will present a 5-page paper on the assigned reading and the
other will critique the paper orally.
Prerequisites: Spanish 200 or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Preference given to
Spanish and Comparative Literature majors.

RLSP 242(S) Representations of the Spanish-American City
The city has been a rich subject for Spanish-American writers and filmmakers because it seems to embody both
social order and chaos, economic progress and cultural corruption, civilized refinement and terrifying violence. In
this course we will study several short novels and films that have emerged around three such urban centers:
Buenos Aires, Argentina; Mexico City, Mexico; and Medellín, Colombia. We will look at issues of urban geogra-
phy and the often reciprocal relationship between humans and the built environment, and the seemingly compet-
ing forces of order and instability that push individuals to commit acts of indiscretion, repression, and outright
violence. Readings will include works by César Aira, José Agustín, Jorge Luis Borges, Beatriz Guido, and Fer-
nando Vallejo, as well as theoretical texts on the city. Films will include features by Alejandro Agresti, Alejandro
González Iñárritu, and Emilio Maillé. Conducted in Spanish.
Format: seminar/discussion. Evaluations will be based on meaningful class participation, three short papers, and

works by Carmen Martín Gaite, Ana María Matute, Rosa Chacel, Rosa Montero and Laura Freixas among others,
where we will explore five essential elements that construct a life narrative: memory, experience, identity, body
and agency. We will also analyze the self and identities of the narrators, and how their lives might reflect a collec-
tive memory of the Spanish community after dictatorship. Conducted in Spanish.
Format: discussion/seminar. Evaluation will be based on class participation, several short writing assignments, and
a final paper. At least one of the short assignments will be edited and re-written; the final paper will be handed in as

vantes' achievement from the perspectives of language, literature, and culture. The literary and social background
of the period will also shape our understanding of the work's historical context. Additional reading will include a

RLSP 308(S) Foundations of Latin American Literature: Colonialism and Post-Coloniality (D)
This course offers a survey of major Latin American writers from the beginning to 1900: we will read some of the
most significant chronicles of first contact and the conquest, work by Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz and other writers
from the colonial period, and important texts from the wars of independence and early national era. The first half of
the course, focusing on the period from 1492 to 1800, will examine some of the artistic forms that emerged in
response to colonization and the increasingly heterogeneous polities of Spanish America. In the second half of the
term we explore a few of the ways that 19th-century intellectuals revisited these tropes and ideas in shaping the
identities of the new republics, raising theoretical questions such as: How do republican artists and intellectuals
respond to the racial and cultural diversity of their countries? To what extent is the cultural production of postcolo-
nial Spanish America a continuation of colonial cultural forms? To get to the bottom of some of these issues we
will also read those works of postcolonial theory that have proved most thought-provoking for scholars of Latin
American literature. This course fulfills the EDI requirement because our reading of canonical Latin American
literature is explicitly focused on issues of power, violence and exclusion, including the historical exclusion of
women and indigenous peoples from Latin American literature and politics. Conducted in Spanish.

RLSP 403(F) Senior Seminar: Power, Repression, and Dictatorship in the Latin-American Novel
Military dictatorship is among the most crucial factors in Latin-American society and history, and some of the
continent's leading novelists have taken it upon themselves to depict the experience in their work. In this course
we will examine both the fact of dictatorship itself and the diverse representation thereof in Spanish-American
fiction. Novels by García Márquez, Vargas Llosa, Poniatowska, and Tomas Eloy Martínez will be closely studied.
Students will also read Absalom! Absalom! by Faulkner, whose influence on Latin-American authors' techniques
of representation has been decisive and profound. Conducted in Spanish.

YASHKIN.
LANGUAGE STUDY
The department provides language instruction to enable the student to acquire all four linguistic skills: under-
standing, speaking, reading, and writing. Russian 101-W88-102 covers the basics of Russian grammar. Russian
151 and 152 offer additional instruction in grammar and provide extensive practice in reading and conversation.
STUDY ABROAD
The department strongly encourages students desiring to attain fluency in Russian to spend a semester or year
studying in Russia or one of the former Soviet republics. Students generally apply to one of several approved
foreign study programs. Russian 152 or the equivalent and junior standing are normally prerequisite for study
abroad.
LITERATURE AND CULTURE IN TRANSLATION
The department regularly offers courses on Russian literature and culture in English for those students who
have little or no knowledge of Russian, but who wish to become acquainted with the major achievements in Rus-
sian literary and cultural history.
THE CERTIFICATE IN RUSSIAN
To enhance a student's educational and professional profiles, the Certificate in Russian offers a useful tool for
using the language in a wide variety of disciplines. The sequence of language and culture courses is designed to
supplement a student's major at Williams by enabling the student to expand his or her knowledge in a related field.
Students who enter Williams with previous training in Russian may substitute more advanced courses for all
the 100-level courses; they can also be exempted from up to two of the required courses. Thus, in order to earn a
certificate a student must take no fewer than five courses (including three courses in Russian) after enrolling at
Williams. Students must receive a minimum grade of B in each course taken in the sequence. In addition, they
must receive a score of at least 85% on a standardized language proficiency test administered by the department.

THE MAJOR
The Russian major offers students an interdisciplinary approach to the intellectual and cultural history of Russia
and the former Soviet republics. Students complete the major by combining courses in Russian language and liter-
ature with courses in history, political science, music, economics, and art. The major requires a minimum of ten
courses of which at least six must be conducted in Russian, at least two must be at the 300-level, and one at the
400-level. In addition, students may take up to four related courses offered by other departments and taught in
English.
Examples of appropriate courses in other departments are:
History 140 Fin-de Siècle Russia: Cultural Splendor, Imperial Decay
History 240 Muscovy and the Russian Empire
History 241 The Rise of the Soviet Union
History 440 Reform, Revolution, Terror: Russia, 1900-1939
Sociology 332 Communism and its Aftermath
Students selecting the major must typically complete Russian 152 or the equivalent by the end of the junior
year. Majors will normally be expected to take the 400-level seminar offered in their senior year, even if they have
previously taken another version of it. Russian majors may receive major credit for summer language study (in
consultation with the department) and for as many as four courses taken during study abroad.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN RUSSIAN
At the beginning of the second semester of the senior year, students may nominate themselves to candidacy for
the degree with honors. By the end of the junior year at the latest, however, they will have established in consulta-
tion with the department their qualifications for embarking on the project, the pattern of study to be followed, and
the standards of performance.
Students earn a degree with honors by submitting a senior thesis (493-W31-494) of honors quality.
RUSS 101(F)-W88-102(S) Elementary Russian
An introduction to contemporary standard Russian, this course provides opportunities to acquire basic proficiency
in all four language skills: listening comprehension, speaking, reading, and writing, through intensive use of au-
thentic written materials and a strong emphasis on the spoken word in all class activities. Greater emphasis is
placed on writing in the second semester. For students who have studied Russian in secondary school, consultation
with the instructor is required before registering for any Russian language course in the sequence 101 through 252.

This course will use the methodology of food history to explore the broader historical, economic, and artistic
conditions that gave rise to Russian culture. We will examine culinary practice as well as the social context of
cooking and eating in Russia. In order to elucidate the important interplay between culture and cuisine, we will
discuss such issues as the domestic roles of women and serfs, the etiquette of the table, the role of drinking and
temperance movements, and the importance of feasts and fasts in the Russian Orthodox Church calendar. Short
stories, memoirs, and cookery books will provide insight into class and gender differences, cooking techniques,
and the specific tastes that characterize Russian cuisine. This class will present Russian culture from a predomi-
nantly domestic point of view that originates from the wooden spoon as much as from the scepter. Knowledge of
Russian is not required.

The late nineteenth century in Russia witnessed an unprecedented flowering in the arts that ushered in the so-

Russian verse between 1900 and 1930, with a nod to both earlier and later poetic production. We will read lyrical
and narrative works by poets associated with various important movements, including Symbolism (Aleksandr
Blok, Andrei Belyi, Zinaida Gippius), Acmeism (Osip Mandelstam, Anna Akhmatova, Nikolai Gumilev), Futur-
ism (Velimir Khlebnikov, Aleksei Kruchenykh, Vladimir Mayakovsky), and the OBERIU (Nikolai Zabolotsky,

Associate Professor: MLADENOVIC.
Science and Technology Studies (SCST) is an interdisciplinary program concerned with science and technolo-
gy and their relationship to society. In addition to being concerned with the historical development and a philo-
sophical understanding of the ideas and institutions of science and technology; Science and Technology Studies
also examines their ethical, economic, social, and political implications.
The role that science and technology have played in shaping modern industrial societies is generally acknowl-
edged, but few members of those societies, including scientists and engineers, possess any understanding of how
that process has occurred or much knowledge of the complex technical and social interactions that direct change in
either science or society. The Science and Technology Studies Program is intended to help create a coherent course
of study for students interested in these questions by providing a broad range of perspectives. At present, courses
are offered which examine the history or philosophy of science and technology, the sociology and psychology of
science, the economics of research and development and technological change, science and public policy, technol-
ogy assessment, technology and the environment, scientometrics, and ethical-value issues.
To complete the requirements of the program, students must complete six courses. The introductory course and
senior seminar are required and three elective courses are chosen from the list of designated electives. Students
Science and Technology Studies, Williams Program in Teaching

may choose to concentrate their electives in a single area such as technology, American studies, philosophy, histo-
ry of science, economics, environment, current science, or current technology, but are encouraged to take at least
one elective in history, history of science, or philosophy. The sixth course necessary to complete the program is
one semester of laboratory or field science in additiontotheCollege's three-course sciencerequirement. Othersci-

WILLIAMS PROGRAM IN TEACHING
Director, SUSAN ENGEL
The program in teaching is designed to enable Williams Undergraduates to study the ideas, questions, and prac-
tices involved in good teaching at all levels. The program seeks to promote and facilitate an exchange of ideas
about teachers, learners and schools, within and beyond the Williams campus. The program offers a range of op-
portunities including courses on education, intensive supervised student teaching, workshops, advising, lecture
series, and ongoing peer groups for those who teach. Students may participate in a variety of ways, ranging from
taking one course to a sustained in-depth study of teaching and learning geared to those who want to become
teachers, or educational psychologists. We seek to connect students with one another, to bring in expert teachers to
provide mentoring, and to create links across the curriculum so that students can see the vital connections between
what they study (French, Algebra or Biology for instance) and the process of teaching those topics to elementary
and high school students. The program is open to any student interested in education and offers opportunities for
all levels of interest, including those who want to find out about certification and graduate study. Students seeking
certification through an arrangement with the Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts (MCLA) should consult with
Susan Engel before the end of their sophomore year.
The following provides a sample outline of the sequence of courses and experiences that an interested student
might take

At least one Winter Study in an intensive teaching practicum. The major programs are in Berkshire
County (under PSYC) or in New York City (under SPEC), although other opportunities may be listed
elsewhere in the Winter Study section of the course catalogue.
No specific major is required to participate in the program--although some lend themselves easily to certifica-
tion, such as Mathematics, English, Biology, American history, or French, almost all of our majors can provide the
basis of teacher certification. Alternately, students can major in Psychology, take a concentration of courses in a
different field, and then pursue that content area more intensively in graduate work.

THEATRE (Div. I)
Chair, ROBERT BAKER-WHITE
Professors: BAKER-WHITE, EPPEL**. Assistant Professors: SANGARE, HOLZAPFEL. Lecturers:
BROTHERS, CATALANO. Visiting Lecturers: ERICKSON, MORRIS. William Dwight Whitney
Professor of Arts and Theatre: BUCKY***.
As a reflection of the theatre's historical relationship to literature and the arts, stage production is studied in the
context of the literary and artistic movements which have informed theatrical endeavor. The major in Theatre em-
phasizes the collaborative nature of the discipline by drawing upon courses offered by faculty of the Language,
Literature, Music, and Art Departments. Although students will be equipped to proceed to graduate and profes-
sional schools in theatre, the major is primarily directed toward those interested in studying the theatre as an artistic
phenomenon and as an interpretive tool. Because a deep understanding of theatre requires training and experience
with the synthesis on stage, the major includes curricular study of production and performance, as well as contin-
ued participation in departmental stage production.
Williamstheatre, the production arm of the Department of Theatre, operates under the supervision of the depart-
mental faculty. Major departmental productions as well as laboratory and experimental productions of all kinds are
mounted on the new stages of the '62 Center for Theatre and Dance. Participation in acting or technical work is
open to all members of the Williams College community. Students majoring in Theatre will be asked to consult
regularly with departmental advisors in devising the sequence of courses and production participation that will
constitute their major.
MAJOR
The Major in Theatre consists of nine courses.
Six required courses are:
Theatre 104(F) Introduction to World Theatre and Performance
Theatre 103(S) Acting I
Theatre 201 Theatrical Design: The Collaborative Process
Theatre 244 Introduction to Theatre Technology (formerly THEA 102)
Theatre 248 The Modern Theatre: Plays and Performance
Theatre 406 Senior Seminar
Three elective courses must be taken from the department's other offerings. One elective must be a course
within the department that culminates in departmental production. Substitutions of other Williams' courses,
or of Study Abroad courses, will be made only with the consent of the department Chair. Students should
consult with the department Chair regularly in planning a balance of practice and scholarship in their elec-
tive choices.
Production requirement for the major: All majors in Theatre are required to participate in a minimum of four
department productions in addition to the laboratory requirement for Theatre 244. Participation in at least
two of the four must be in technical production and one of those two must be in stage management. Assign-
ment to productions is normally made in consultation with the department Chair.
MAJOR (for class of 2009)
The major in Theatre requires six specific courses, plus three electives as specified below. The specific
courses are:
Theatre 103 Acting I
Theatre 102 Theatre Technologies or Theatre 244 Introduction to Theatre Technology
Theatre 201 Theatrical Design: Process and Collaboration
One course focusing on Critical Studies/Dramatic Literature taught from within the department and to be tak-
en in first two years (prospective majors should consult with department chair for a list of appropriate
courses)
Prospective theatre majors should consult with the chair for the remaining two specific courses to fulfill the
major.
Theatre
­ 308 ­
Students must also take three electives from the department's other offerings, and at least one of these elec-
tives must be drawn from each of the two categories "Theatre Scholarship" and "Theatre Practice."
Theatre Practice: courses where students learn the basic artistic skills of theatre practice through creative
endeavor. (Examples: Acting, Scenic Design, Lighting Design, Costume Design, Directing.)
Theatre Scholarship: courses where students employ critical skills through research and reflection focused
on the traditional canon or on selected more recently defined subject areas. (Examples: Approaching Per-
formance Studies, Contemporary Play and Performance Analysis, Theatre History, Classical Drama,
Modern Drama and Shakespeare).
Courses which mix modes of inquiry between the above categories may be counted in either; in any case,
majors should consult with the department chair to assure an adequate distribution of electives.
The department strongly recommends that students elect additional collateral courses in dramatic literature
taught by the English, Classics, and modern language departments, and courses in opera taught by the Music De-
partment. Students with an interest in theatre design should particularly elect Art Studio courses in drawing.
Production requirement for the major: All majors in Theatre are required to participate in a minimum of four
department productions in addition to the laboratory requirement for Theatre 102. Participation in at least two of
the four must be in technical production, and one must be in stage management. Assignment to productions is
normally made in consultation with the department chair.
Theatre majors are strongly urged to include dance and fencing in fulfilling their Physical Education requirements.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN THEATRE
Candidates for Honors will apply for admission through the submission of a portfolio to the Department Chair
by February of their junior year, as well as a description of their proposed project. The portfolio will be comprised
of four parts:
1. The first part will include a list of the courses students have taken relevant to their work towards the major.
This list will include courses offered by the Theatre Department, but may also include classes taken in
other Departments. Students should also list and describe relevant independent studies and production
credits.
2. The second part of the portfolio will include a selection of materials developed for these courses and pro-
ductions listed in Part 1. The selection should include at least three papers or samples of other written work,
and might also include design projects, director's notebooks, studio art projects, actor's journals or other
forms of documentation of the candidate's work. For students who have taken a semester away, it is partic-
ularly important that they provide the Department with a detailed picture of their activities while studying
off-campus. Course descriptions and syllabi should be submitted in addition to a list of courses taken and
activities performed.
3. The third part of the portfolio is an annotated bibliography of dramatic texts which the student has read,
drawn from a list supplied by the Department. Annotations should be based upon a particular angle of
engagement with the text, that reflects the area or areas that the student has chosen to emphasize in their
theatrical training. For instance, one might choose to write from the point of view of an actor, a designer, a
director, a playwright, or a dramaturg.
4. The portfolio should conclude with a retrospective essay that reflects on the materials that are being sub-
mitted. Students should look for connections between the various aspects of their work, state any theoreti-
cal positions that they have come to embrace, assess their strengths and weaknesses, and discuss their edu-
cational goals for their work with the Department during their Senior year.
The portfolio will be examined alongside the student's record and his or her project description; a determination
will then be made as to admission into the Honors program. Students intending to apply for Honors should meet
with the Department Chair by the end of the fall semester of their junior year. Once a student is admitted to the
Honors program, the department Chair will assign an Honors Project Advisor, who will work with the student to
specify a timeline and work program for the completion of the Honors Project. At a minimum, this will entail
enrollment in Theatre 493 or 494, plus W32, plus one other course offered either within the department or else-
where that the candidate and thesis advisor designate as contributing specifically to the overall goals of the honors
work. This honors elective may not fulfill any other portion of the Theatre Major, or any other major the student
may be pursuing. All honors candidates will present their completed projects to the Department Honors Commit-
tee for evaluation.
STUDY ABROAD
The Theatre Department attempts to work individually with majors and prospective majors who desire to study
abroad. In general, with careful planning it is usually quite easy for students to complete the major in Theatre if
they study abroad in the spring of their junior year. For those wishing to study abroad in the fall of junior year, a
more complicated situation may arise, but one that can often be successfully managed through close consultation
with the department chair. Students are encouraged to consult with the chair early in their Williams careers if they
anticipate a combination of Theatre major and study abroad.
THEA 103(S) Acting I
This course deals with the development of intellectual and emotional resources required for the actor and will
explore an acting technique based on the work of Russian actor and director Constantin Stanislavsky. Students will
examine the power of public presence through theory and practice while expanding their talents, sensitivity, and
imagination.
Format: studio. Evaluation will be based on committed participation in class, preparation and performance of as-
Theatre
­ 309 ­
signed material, and some modest written assignments.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 14. Preference given to first-year students or sophomores considering the
theatre major.
This course is a prerequisite for Theatre 204.
Hour: 1:10-3:50 MR, 1:10-3:50 TF SANGARE
THEA 104(F) Introduction to World Theatre and Performance (Same as Comparative
Literature 104) (D)
This introductory course will explore performance from around the globe, focusing on both the practice and schol-
arship of theatre. Study of select historical traditions will accompany a weekly "performance lab" period, during
which time we'll act, direct, and play with material up on our feet. Specific topics may include: Korean Shaman-
ism, African masquerade, Athenian tragedy, Medieval Christian performance, Iranian Taziyeh, Roman comedy,
Japanese Noh and Kabuki, Indian Sanskrit drama, and national theatres in France, Germany, Ireland, and Ameri-
ca. We'll consider both how theatre engages in cross-cultural dialogue and how various political regimes shaped
the theatre over time.
Format: lecture/seminar w/lab. Evaluation: Assignments will include three short papers and a final, collaborative
performance project.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 50 (expected: 30). This course is a requirement for and is suggested as an
introduction to the major in Theatre. This course meets the criteria of and the Exploring Diversity Initiative as it
both engages in a cross-cultural investigation of performance and explores how theatre is deeply embedded in
political power relations.
Hour: 1:10-2:25 MR Lab: 1:10-3:50 W HOLZAPFEL
THEA 201(S) Theatrical Design: Process of Collaboration
This course examines the designer's process and collaborative role in the creation of theatre through a combina-
tion of lecture, discussion, and individual/group projects. Text and music will be analyzed in ways that help clarify
how a designer develops a point of view while solving the practical needs of production. All aspects of design--
scenery, lighting, costume, and sound--will be explored with particular emphasis on how these elements synthe-
size and contribute to the larger intellectual, emotional, and physical context of the stage. Basic presentation skills
and technique will be taught as crucial elements of design development.
Evaluation will be based upon committed class participation and thoughtful, timely completion of all assignments
and projects.
No prerequisites.Enrollment limit: 10.
Hour: 1:10-3:50 TF MORRIS
THEA 204(F) Acting II
Building on the foundation of Theatre 103, students will develop advanced performance skills through various
acting techniques defined by Stanislavsky, Brecht, Strasberg, Adler, Meisner, Grotowski, and Suzuki. Improvisa-
tion may be used to explore clarity of expression, listening, and specificity in the actor's task. Focus will be on the
imagination and creation of character, and will be emphasized through scene work. Students will present diverse
acting forms in a final theatre performance.
Format: studio.
Prerequisites: Theatre 103. Enrollment limit: 14.

THEA 228(S) Theatrical Self-Production
In today's theater world, self-production can be a vital, engaging, and necessary method of creating and producing
theatrical works. This course examines theatrical self-production and the ways in which artists exploit this model
in pursuit of their individual and collective ambitions. Through a careful examination of successes and failures in
contemporary theatrical collectives, this class will form its own unique structure for developing and producing a
range of new, innovative, and thematically linked artistic work. Operating within carefully chosen constraints,
students will share equally the administrative, artistic, and production roles in the public presentation of their
works. Thus, a major emphasis of the course will be on experiential education, which provides an invaluable
opportunity to encounter firsthand the highly complex relationship between artistry and production. An important
component of the class will be ongoing symposium with practitioners from the profession, as well as the Depart-
ment of Theater, that will focus on a range of specifically targeted skill sets necessary for students to realize their
goals. Systematic group presentations of the creative development process will provide opportunities for
guidance, critique, and sustained mentorship.
Format: seminar. Evaluation: Students will complete a comprehensive self-evaluation as a final project. Grading
will be based on committed class participation, contribution to the collective work of the class, group and
Theatre

individual presentations, and self-evaluation. Students from a broad range of curricular disciplines are welcome.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limited: 20 (expected: 15). First-year students may be accepted with approval of
instructor. Upon overenrollment, the instructors will seek to balance the course by level of prior theatrical experi-
ence.

THEA 236(S) Political Theatre Making
Placing twentieth-century theatricality in the context of its historical roots in Western theatre, this course will ex-
amine a broad range of types of protest movements. From the biting observations of the British class system by
playwrights such as Oscar Wilde, Noel Coward, and John Osborne, to mid-century American political writers
such as Clifford Odets and Edward Albee, and Italy's Dario Fo, to the relentless satire of contemporary South
African performers such as Pieter Dirk-Uys, we will investigate dramatic writing and performance style as aspects
of social and political resistance. Other groups studied may include the protest theatre of Johannesburg's Market
Theatre, Luiz Valdez's Teatro Campesino, and a younger generation of post-apartheid experimentation in multi-
ethnic South African theatre.
Format: seminar. Evaluation: A semester-length research project, including a substantial paper, based on the hypo-
thetical creation of a theatre company within specific historical, social, and political contexts.

Hour: 9:55-11:10 TR EPPEL
THEA 241(F) Performing Race: From Shakespeare to Spike Lee (Same as Africana Studies 241
and Comparative Literature 241) (D)
Since theater is both a visual and a verbal medium, the goal is to explore, through detailed close analysis, visual
and verbal representations of race--with representation being understood to mean cultural construction and with
race being defined to include whiteness as a racial category. The comprehensive scope is deliberately cross-histor-
ical to create a longer historical timeline that expands the range for comparative perspectives in the study of race.
The Renaissance starting point calls attention to the complex operations of blackface performance in which black
roles in Shakespeare and Jonson are played by white actors who are blacked up. We evaluate how this mode of
white actors literally re-presenting black characters affects the range of meaning for images of blackness. Asym-
metries of power, and the potential for disrupting differential power, are considered in relations between blacks
and whites not only at the level of characters but also at the level of authorship. We examine what happens when a
black writer gains control of the means of representation, with critical revisions of Othello as a case in point. Con-
temporary works include plays by Djanet Sears, Derek Walcott, Lorraine Hansberry, James Baldwin, Anna Deav-
ere Smith, Suzan Lori-Parks, and August Wilson, as well as Spike Lee's film Bamboozled. This is an Exploring
Diversity Initiative (EDI) course because, in the context of racial difference, we will confront forthrightly the nega-
tive realities and critically assess the possibilities for productive change and hope in cross-racial interactions.
Format: discussion. Evaluation based on active participation in class discussion; short papers; final exam.

This tutorial course will consider the understudied role of women in western theatre--as active subjects, specta-
tors, and authors --focusing on gender identity, sexuality, performativity, and representations of the body on stage
and within drama. While the focus of the tutorial will be directed towards the modern period, we will begin by
studying the role of women on the English Restoration stage and consider the increasing presence of women as
audience members, playwrights, and performers throughout the nineteenth century. Within the modern period,
close analysis of plays by Sophie Treadwell, Gertrude Stein, Lillian Hellman, Lorraine Hansberry, Maria Irene
Fornes, Caryl Churchill, Adrienne Kennedy, Holly Hughes (WOW Cafe), Wendy Wasserstein, Naomi Iizuka,
Suzan-Lori Parks, Eve Ensler, Sarah Kane, Sarah Ruhl, and others, will accompany readings of select gender and
performance theory. Attention will be given to the diversity of race and class represented by the women subjects of
our study. This tutorial is intended for sophomores and above.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: Students will meet with instructor in pairs for an hour each week; they will write a
5- to 7-page paper every other week (five in all), and comment on their partner's papers in alternate weeks. Em-
phasis will be placed on developing skills in reading, interpretation, critical argumentation, and critical written and
oral response.

THE NATIONAL THEATRE INSTITUTE
The Department of Theatre is affiliated with the National Theatre Institute, which offers additional theatre study
through its resident semester program. The Institute is fully accredited by Connecticut College and is a member of
the Twelve-College Exchange. Limited numbers of Williams students can therefore be selected to take a full se-
mester of intensive theatre study at the NTI, located at the Eugene O'Neill Memorial Theatre Centre in Waterford,
Connecticut. During the semester, students from participating colleges live and work as members of a theatre
company gaining experience with professional theatre artists in a workshop environment. Early application is es-
sential.

WOMEN'S AND GENDER STUDIES (Div. II)
Chair, Professor KATHRYN KENT (First Semester)
TBA (Second Semester)
Advisory Committee: Professors: BUELL*, BUNDTZEN***, CASE, DRUXES, C. JOHNSON, SA-
WICKI. Associate Professors: KENT***, SCHMIDT, SOLUM. Visiting Associate Professors: HON-
DERICH§. Assistant Professors: HOLZAPFEL, MARASCO, MARTIN. Librarian: OHM. Director of
the Academic Resource Center: FOSTER.
Women's and Gender Studies can be defined as the study of how gender is constructed, how it is inflected by
differences of race, ethnicity, sexuality, class, and so on, how gender affects the experiences and situations of men
and women, and how assumptions about gender influence the construction of knowledge and experience. Schol-
arship in Women's and Gender Studies has brought neglected material into established fields and raised important
methodological questions that cross disciplinary boundaries and challenge established intellectual frameworks.
The program in Women's and Gender Studies thus includes courses from a wide variety of disciplines that focus in
a coherent way on gender issues, as well as core courses that acquaint students with the interdisciplinarity of the
field.
THE MAJOR
The Women's and Gender Studies major encourages exposure to the interdisciplinary character of feminist
scholarship. In addition, majors are required to gain some knowledge of methods within a field or discipline (3
courses in one of the categories listed below), to appreciate the importance of diversity (racial, sexual, class, ethnic,
national, etc.) in scholarship on gender, to gain exposure to feminist theory, and to pursue work at an advanced
level (3 courses at the 300-level).
In order to ensure that students reflect about the paths that they choose through the major, each major will be
assigned to an advisor in the spring of the sophomore year. With the advisor, the student will establish a revisable
course of study for the following two years. Students interested in declaring a major should contact the chair of the
Program (Kent, x2549).
[ ] Courses not offered in 2008-2009 are listed in brackets.
Required Courses
The major consists of at least 9 courses. The following are required:
Women's and Gender Studies 101 Introduction to Women's and Gender Studies
Women's and Gender Studies 402 Junior/Senior Seminar in Women's and Gender Studies (The seminar
explores topics in Women's and Gender Studies, and varies from year to year. Majors may take more than
one seminar, space permitting.)

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN WOMEN'S AND GENDER STUDIES
Honors in Women's and Gender Studies may be granted to majors after an approved candidate completes an
honors project, delivers a public presentation of the work, and is awarded honors by the Women's and Gender
Studies Committee.
The honors project may be fall semester (plus winter study) or a year-long project. It may consist of a conven-
tional research thesis of 40-70 pages or of other modes of presentation (e.g., art, music, poetry, theater, fiction).
Proposals for non-thesis projects should include evidence of experience and competence in the chosen mode.
A student may become a candidate for honors in Women's and Gender Studies after the following criteria are
met:
1). in April of the junior year, submission and Women's and Gender Studies Committee approval of a 4- to
6-page project proposal, in which the ideas, aim, general methodology, and preliminary bibliography for the
project are outlined and a faculty advisor is named; prior to submission of this proposal, students must con-
sult with a reference librarian.
2). at the end of the junior year, cumulative grade point average of 3.5 from courses taken in the major;
3). in the first week of classes of the senior year, submission and approval by the faculty advisor and second
reader of a 5- to 10-page "Plan of Action" (an overview of what has already been completed and a schedule
of what needs to be accomplished to finish the project). Where appropriate, students pursuing honors will
continue to consult with the second reader over the course of the semester(s).
All honors work, including the public presentation, will be evaluated by the Women's and Gender Studies
Committee. It will decide on the awarding of honors; the advisor will award the grade(s)
STUDY ABROAD
The Williams College Women's and Gender Studies Program encourages potential majors to study abroad in
order to enhance their education and gain international perspectives on gender and women's issues and feminism.
There are many excellent study abroad opportunities offering students a variety of possible experiences: among
them cultural immersion, field work, intensive language learning, independent study, participation in another edu-
cational system. There are several semester-long programs with a specific focus on women and/or gender
administered by other U.S. Colleges that would especially enrich the educational experience of our majors:
Antioch College: Comparative Women's Studies in Europe fall semester
Augsburg College, Center for Global Education: Crossing Borders: Gender and Social Change in Mesoamer-
ica fall semester; and Social and Environmental Justice in Latin America spring semester
School for International Training:
The Balkans: Women and Democratization, fall or spring semester
Jamaica: Gender and Development, fall or spring semester
Mali: Gender and Development, fall or spring semester
The Netherlands: Identity, Gender and Sexuality, fall or spring semester

CROSS-LISTED COURSES (INCLUDING SEQUENCE COURSES)
WGST 101(F,S) Introduction to Women's and Gender Studies (W) (D)
This discussion course introduces a range of feminist issues, theories, and controversies. It has several aims: to
provide critical and analytical tools for thinking about gender; to explore key issues confronting women in U.S.
(and other) societies, and to discuss strategies for confronting them. The course will examine issues such as: body
politics, sexuality, reproductive rights, sexual violence, gender and work, motherhood and family. Above all, the
course is intended as an exploration of the tremendous diversity of thought contained under the general rubrics of
feminist and gender studies and as a vehicle for developing skills in writing and research, as well as analytical tools
for further work in the field. This course meets the requirements of the Exploring Diversity Initiative in that its
main emphases are on challenging the notion of one universalizing category of "woman," and to recognize the
diverse ways in which national, sexual, ethnic, racial, classed and other kinds of differences produce multiple and
often divergent relations of gendered power. It also whenever possible contextualizes within a global frame the
central issues that have made up and continue to define the U.S. feminist tradition, in order to encourage students
to recognize the role cultural difference plays in a variety of feminist issues and to decenter the U.S as a reference
point for all feminist theory and politics.
Requirements: regular short essays, class presentations, and a longer paper, with revisions. Evaluation will be
based on these assignments and class participation.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 18 per section (expected: 18 per section).
Required course for the Women's and Gender Studies major and concentration.

WGST 402(S) Gender and Global Justice (W)
Is it possible, or indeed desirable, to try to define and defend justice for women on a global scale? Second and third
wave feminists warned against generalizing about women's social identities and needs, emphasizing instead the
need to recognize women's differences across race, sexual orientation, nationality, religion, and social class. But
systematic and recurring patterns of gender discrimination against women in societies across the globe have led
many feminist thinkers and activists alike to theorize anew about some common sources of women's oppression
and remedies for it. Feminist approaches to global justice have emerged in recent years focusing on such factors as
the effect of economic globalization (especially structural adjustment) on girls and women; women's subordina-
tion in the family and other cultural and religious institutions; women's lack of political voice; the phenomenon of
sex trafficking; and the use of rape and gendered violence in war. Among the theories of justice we will explore are
liberal feminist approaches which stress the importance of the development of a global human rights framework
for protecting women; post-colonial and post-modern feminist approaches, which warn against relying on the
state, and the language of liberal rights, as the main instruments for protecting women's interests; and 'capability

theory', which emphasize the importance of identifying and supporting women's capabilities in order to secure
economic, social, and political justice for women. In addition to texts in social and political theory, we will also
incorporate literary fiction and film to explore the questions and prospects surrounding gender justice, especially
in non-U.S. settings.

CRITICAL REASONING AND
ANALYTICAL SKILLS (CRAAS) COURSES
Coordinator, Lecturer KAREN L. SHEPARD
To one degree or another, every class at Williams goes beyond its subject--be it mathematics, Machiavelli, or
modernism--to teach intellectual skills that have wide application in other fields as well as outside of the acade-
my: scientific reckoning, expository writing, rhetorical analysis, oral presentation, and so on.
Courses offered under the CRAAS initiative foreground such analytical skills. While each CRAAS class cov-
ers a different topic, all are aimed particularly at developing the processes necessary for excellence in a range of
fields: techniques for analyzing ideas, data, texts or artworks; approaches to interpreting, synthesizing, and devel-
oping arguments; strategies for presenting ideas and results.
CRAAS classes typically emphasize the practices of meta-analysis--self-criticism, editing, and revision--
with the goal of constant improvement. Many classes feature peer tutoring, small group work, and intensive one-
on-one engagement with the professor. Students should leave a CRAAS course with a substantially heightened
ability to approach problems, analyze texts, and craft arguments in whatever discipline they may go on to explore.
A few CRAAS courses are restricted to advanced students, but the majority are open to all, and some are spe-
cifically targeted for first year students. Most have strictly limited enrollment. Because these classes cultivate the
general strategies of effective scholarship, students are encouraged to consider taking a CRAAS course early in
their academic careers.

EXPLORING DIVERSITY INITIATIVE
Williams College is committed to creating and maintaining a curriculum, faculty, and student body that reflects
and explores a diverse, globalized world and the multi-cultural character of the United States. Courses designated
"(D)" in the College Bulletin are a part of the College's Exploring Diversity Initiative (EDI); they represent our
dedication to study groups, cultures, and societies as they interact with, and challenge, each other. Through such
courses, Williams College students and faculty also consider the multiple approaches that engage these issues.
Rather than simply focus on the study of specific peoples, cultures, or regions of the world, in the past or present,
however, courses fulfilling the EDI requirement actively promote a self-conscious and critical engagement with
diversity. They urge students to consider the operations of difference in the world and provide them with the tools
to do so. The ultimate aim of the EDI requirement is to lay the groundwork for a life-long engagement with the
diverse cultures, societies, and histories of the United States and the rest of the world.

QUANTITATIVE/FORMAL REASONING COURSES
Williams students should be adept at reasoning mathematically and abstractly. The ability to apply a formal
method to reach conclusions, to use numbers comfortably, and to employ the research tools necessary to analyze
data lessen barriers to carrying out professional and economic roles. Prior to their senior year, all students must
satisfactorily complete a Quantitative/Formal Reasoning (QFR) course--those marked with a "(Q)." Students re-
quiring extra assistance (as assessed during First Days) are normally placed into Mathematics 100/101/102, which
is to be taken before fulfilling the QFR requirement.
The hallmarks of a QFR course are the representation of facts in a language of mathematical symbols and the
use of formal rules to obtain a determinate answer. Primary evaluation in these courses is based on multistep math-
ematical, statistical, or logical inference (as opposed to descriptive answers).

RELATED COURSE LISTINGS
There are a number of significant areas of studies in which Williams offers many relevant courses, yet no for-
mal program. To alert students to the opportunity for integrating courses from diverse disciplines into a focus area
and to encourage them to do so, the courses in this section are organized as lists of topic-related courses. For their
full descriptions, see the respective departmental sections.
Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual Studies
Gay, lesbian, and bisexual studies focuses on the social construction of sexuality, past and present. Although, at

number of courses which examine how social, cultural, and political institutions shape sexualities, as well as the
responses and resistances thereto, through a variety of texts and contexts. The following courses include signifi-
cant components on gay, lesbian, and bisexual studies (at least two weeks out of the semester).

WRITING-INTENSIVE COURSES
Courses designated as "writing intensive"--those marked with a "(W)"--stress the process of learning to write
effectively. Such courses include a substantial amount of writing (a minimum of 20 pages), usually divided into
several discrete assignments. Instructors pay close attention to matters of style and argumentation. Enrollments are
limited to 19.
All Williams College students are required to take two writing-intensive courses: one by the end of the sopho-
more year and one by the end of the junior year. Students will benefit most from writing-intensive courses by
taking them early in their college careers and are therefore strongly encouraged to complete the requirement by the
end of the sophomore year.
Courses that may be used to meet the requirement in 2008-2009:
AFR 103(F) The City in Africa: Nairobi and Johannesburg (Same as History 103) (W)

WILLIAMS OFF-CAMPUS PROGRAMS
WILLIAMS-EXETER PROGRAMME AT OXFORD UNIVERSITY
Directors, Professor THOMAS A. KOHUT
THE PROGRAMME
Williams College offers a year-long programme of studies at Oxford University in co-operation with Exeter
College (founded in 1314), one of the constituent colleges of the University. Williams students will be enrolled as
Visiting Students at Exeter and as such will be undergraduate members of the University, eligible for access to
virtually all of its facilities, libraries, and resources. As Visiting Students in Oxford, students admitted to the Pro-
gramme will be fully integrated into the intellectual and social life of one of the world's great universities.
Although students in the Programme will be members of Exeter College, entitled to make full use of Exeter
facilities (including the College Library), dine regularly in Hall, and join all College clubs and organisations on the
same terms as other undergraduates at Exeter, students will reside in Ephraim Williams House, a compound of
four buildings owned by Williams College, roughly 1.4 miles north of the city centre. Six students from Exeter
College will normally reside in Ephraim Williams House each year, responsible for helping to integrate Williams
students into the life of the College and the University. A resident director (and member of the Williams Faculty)
administers Ephraim Williams House, oversees the academic programme, and serves as both the primary academ-
ic and personal advisor to Williams students in Oxford.
Students enrolled in the Oxford Programme must enroll for the full academic year, which consists of three aca-
demic terms, each of which includes eight full weeks of instruction: MICHAELMAS TERM (early October to
early December), HILARY TERM (mid-January to mid-March), and TRINITY TERM (late April to late June).
Students are expected to be in residence to write their first tutorial papers before the eight weeks of instruction
begins and to remain in residence during the week after the term ends in order to sit their final examinations. Be-
tween the three terms there are two intervening four-five week vacations, during which students may be expected
to continue reading as preparation for their upcoming tutorials.
THE TUTORIAL SYSTEM
Undergraduate instruction at Oxford University is largely carried out through individual or small-group tuto-
rials, in which students meet weekly with their tutor to present and discuss an essay they have written, based on an
extensive amount of reading undertaken from an assigned reading list they will receive at the beginning of each
term. In addition to the weekly tutorial, students are usually encouraged to attend a pertinent course of lectures
offered by the University that corresponds to the material being addressed in their tutorials.
Each student will plan a course of study for the three terms of the academic year in consultation with the direc-
tor of the Programme. In his or her capacity as the Tutor for Visiting Students at Exeter College, the director, work-
ing closely with Exeter's subject tutors, will arrange the teaching for the students, monitor student progress, be in
regular contact with the student's tutors, supervise the examinations that students will sit at the end of each aca-
demic term, and report on each student's academic progress to the Senior Tutor at Exeter College. There are no
"add/drop" periods at Oxford; once a student has made a commitment to a particular tutorial course, and the direc-
tor has then secured a tutor to teach that course, students cannot back out.
Over the course of the three terms, students are required to enroll in a minimum of FOUR full tutorial courses
(each consisting of eight individual tutorial meetings and requiring the preparation of eight essays) and ONE half
tutorial course (consisting of four individual tutorial meetings and the preparation of four essays). Some students
choose to substitute a fifth full tutorial course for the half tutorial course and a few will decide to enroll in two full
tutorial courses each term. The average course load undertaken by most students in residence in Oxford during the
past has been five full tutorial courses or their equivalent.
GRADES AND CREDIT
Grades for each tutorial course reflect the grade assigned to all eight (or four) tutorial sessions, including their
related essays, considered together, as well as the grade for the final examination on work accomplished in the indi-
vidual tutorials and supplementary readings. Final examinations last three hours in the case of full tutorial courses
and two hours in the case of half tutorial courses and are always sat in the ninth week of term, following the eight
weeks of instruction each term. The final grade recorded on the Williams transcript is calculated by counting the
grade for the tutorial meetings and essays as two-thirds of the grade and the final examination as one-third of the
overall grade. For some tutorial courses (especially in writing and the studio arts), tutors may offer the student the
option of a final paper or project in lieu of an examination.
Upon satisfactory completion of the requirements for the Williams-Exeter Programme at Oxford University,
students receive academic credit for a regular Williams academic year, the four tutorial courses replacing the regu-
lar eight semester courses the student would normally take at Williams, the half tutorial course replacing the Win-
ter Study Course. Grades eventually become a part of their Williams transcript and will be included in the com-
putation of their Grade Point Average.
Tutorial courses in Oxford may be used toward fulfilling the divisional distribution requirement; a student may
earn a maximum of three distribution requirements, with no more than one from each division, for the year. All
tutorial courses at Oxford meet the Williams College "Writing Intensive" designation, except for those in the stu-
dio arts, mathematics, and the sciences.
Tutorial courses in Oxford may also be used to meet major requirements. Some departments at Williams will
grant a two-course credit towards the major for each full tutorial course taken at Oxford, and one course towards
the major for each half tutorial course taken at Oxford. Most departments, however, will grant a one-course credit
towards the major for each relevant tutorial course taken at Oxford (whether a full or a half). Half tutorial courses
are sometimes deemed to be insufficiently broad to satisfy certain requirements for the major. Students are encour-
aged to check with their department chair(s) to confirm official department policy.

THE COURSE OF STUDY
In addition to the opportunity to pursue British and Commonwealth Studies, Williams students in Oxford will
be able to pursue tutorials in fields in which Oxford is particularly noted (Anthropology, English Literature, Mod-
ern History, Philosophy, Politics, Psychology, Classics, Theology, the Natural Sciences, etc.). Exeter College also
has a Fellow in English Language and Literature (with interests ranging from the Renaissance--including Shake-
speare--to the early nineteenth century) committed to teaching Williams students, and students are thus encour-
aged to consider undertaking at least one tutorial course in these fields as part of their course of study.
What follows is a list of tutorial courses normally available to students studying with the Williams-Exeter Pro-
gramme at Oxford. The tutorials listed below (WIOX 311-384) represent a selection of some of the standard "pa-
pers" (courses) that comprise the Oxford degrees in various subjects and that are taught in tutorial format. Normal-
ly, but not always, tutors can be secured who can teach these subjects to Williams students, although demand,
leave patterns, and other constraints, sometimes mean that not all of these subjects can be staffed in all terms.
Some tutorial courses are accompanied by lectures. In such cases the term in which the lectures are delivered is
listed, as is the term in which students should take the tutorials (MT-Michaelmas Term; HT-Hilary Term; TT-Trin-
ity Term). Sometimes, where appropriate, prerequisites are also listed.
While many students enroll in the tutorial courses listed below (WIOX 311-384), it is also possible to choose
from other available Oxford courses under the heading of WIOX 390, a general rubric for more specialized tutori-
al work. This is described in more detail below.

The choice of Special Author should approximately correspond chronologically with the period papers on offer
at any given point in the year, and with the provision of teaching and lectures.
Prerequisite: some background in the close reading of literary texts and a general familiarity with the literature of
the period. The following are examples of some of the Special Authors who are currently, or have been, or will
be studied for the Special Authors course of the Oxford University syllabus. It is important to note that other
authors can usually be studied, depending on the availability of tutors:
WIOX 333a The Beowulf poet, Alfred, Aelfric, the Exeter Book (600-1100) MT

It is open to Williams students to devise a general topic of their own choice for study, falling within one of the
categories below, when tutors are available. The option is similar to the Special Topic course followed by third-
year Oxford undergraduates. The choice of Special Topic is usually configured so as approximately to corre-
spond chronologically with the period papers on offer at any given point in the year (as given at WIOX 330
above), and with the provision of teaching and lectures--although in practice there may often be some overlap
across periods.

WIOX 390 Specially Arranged Subjects
Specially arranged tutorial courses in some subject areas other than those covered by the WIOX 311-384 courses
might also be possible. A WIOX 390 is not simply what would be called an "independent study" course at Wil-
liams. Rather, a WIOX 390 is normally a "paper" (course) that is regularly offered at Oxford as either a required
or optional part of the degree in various subjects. For a list of all the "papers" that make up the degree require-
ments in various disciplines, students should consult the University of Oxford Examination Regulations, a recent
copy of which can be found in the Dean's Office. Important guidelines for how to make sense of this complex
and weighty tome (the equivalent of the Williams College Bulletin) are available from the Dean's Office and also
from the director. Much easier to use are the web sites belonging to the individual departments or "faculties" at
Oxford University (e.g., History, Philosophy, etc.); for lists of regular papers, go to the lecture lists or "schemes"
Williams-Exeter Programme at Oxford
­ 336 ­
on the faculty web pages. It is easier to find tutors for a WIOX 390 in some fields (Classics, English, History,
Philosophy, Theology, etc.) than in others (Psychology, the natural sciences, etc) and students should realize that
it is not always possible for the Programme to accommodate their requests.
A sample list of Specially Arranged Subjects (WIOX 390) staffed during the past few years is offered below.
This list is not comprehensive. Furthermore, students who wish to undertake a WIOX 390 course are encour-
aged to consult the Examination Regulations rather than simply repeat what other students in the past have done.

NON-CREDIT FOREIGN LANGUAGE STUDY
In addition to their regular tutorial courses, students may begin or continue the study of a wide range of foreign
languages on a non-credit basis through a variety of arrangements available through the University as well as a
number of other educational and cultural institutions in the city of Oxford. The Programme normally subsidizes
such study.
STUDENT LIFE
By virtue of the fact that, while in Oxford, they are officially Visiting Students at the University--and full mem-
bers of Exeter College--Williams students are offered every opportunity to become fully integrated into student
life in Oxford. Both Exeter College and Oxford University are home to an exceptional variety of sports clubs,
debating societies, interest groups, cultural organizations, and social activities, virtually all of which are available
to Visiting Student members of the University. Students are encouraged to participate fully in the social life of
Exeter College--to dine in Hall as often as they wish, to frequent the College bar, to use the College's athletic
Williams-Exeter Programme at Oxford
­ 337 ­
facilities, and to become members of the various College clubs and organizations. Furthermore, Williams students
also have access to the University's athletic events, concerts, theatrical productions, museums, and libraries. All
Williams students in Oxford are provided with membership in the Oxford Union, which, in addition to its debating
activities and club rooms, possesses dining facilities and the largest lending library in the University.
At the Ephraim Williams House, all Williams students are housed in capacious double rooms and enjoy full
access to the House's library, common rooms, laundry facilities, computer lab, and a large dining room, in which a
weekly catered meal is served during the eight weeks of term. There are also a number of small kitchens in the
House which students may use. All rooms are fully wired for high-speed internet access and are fully equipped
with furnishings, bed linens, and a telephone. The grounds include a courtyard where basketball can be played,
sheltered bike racks, barbecue facilities, and gardens. A number of student jobs are available during the academic
year for students who wish to earn a little spending money by helping to maintain the facilities and organize Pro-
gramme activities. Ephraim Williams House is a short bike or bus ride (or a twenty-minute walk) from Exeter
College and the center of town, and is within easy walking distance of the University parks and the local shops,
restaurants and banks of Summertown. The Programme will partially subsidize student bus passes or bicycle pur-
chase or rental to facilitate travel around Oxford.
Before the academic year begins--at the end of September and in early October--ten days of orientation activ-
ities are scheduled. Students are expected to be in residence for all of these many activities, some of which take
place in Ephraim Williams House, others at Exeter College. At this time students will become acquainted with the
workings of the Programme, of Exeter College, and of the University, and will be familiarized with the rules and
regulations they are expected to abide by during their residence in Oxford.
Throughout the academic year, provision will be made for trips to a number of sites of historical, cultural, or
political interest. In the past these have included the Cotswolds, Stratford, Stonehenge, Bath, Wells, Warwick
Castle, Blenheim Palace, and various sites of interest in London. Students will also be given the opportunity to
attend a number of theatrical productions and other cultural events. Oxford's proximity to London gives students
ready access to that city's multiple attractions and many resources. The Oxford-London train service is frequent
and the journey takes just over an hour. The buses to London run even more regularly (and are cheaper), and the
one-way journey takes about ninety minutes.
During the summer before students arrive in Oxford, they will receive a copy of the latest edition of Ephs
Among the Dreaming Spires, which will further explain the perks, policies, and procedures of the Programme, the
rules and regulations they are expected to follow, and tips for how best to enjoy a fulfilling year in and around
Oxford.
ILLNESS AND INSURANCE
Students must ensure they are covered either by the Williams College health insurance policy or by some other
comprehensive health insurance plan (generally a family health insurance policy). While in Britain, students will
be covered by the National Health Service (NHS) for routine visits at the Group Medical Practice used by Exeter
College and for emergency hospital treatment. The programme also works with a physician in private practice
attached to a local private hospital. +Prescription drugs are available through the NHS for a nominal fee. There are
limited outpatient psychological counseling services available through the NHS and the Programme, although, as
Visiting Students at the University, Williams students are entitled to make use of the University Counseling
Centre. Any extensive or long-term counseling, however, would need to be covered by the student's personal
health insurance policy. Finally, students are not likely to be covered under the NHS for medical services received
in foreign countries, especially those countries that do not enjoy membership of the European Union.
FEES
The tuition and room fees paid by students on the Williams-Exeter Programme at Oxford are the same as those
for a year spent in residence at Williams. Students are responsible for some of their own meals and for all of their
personal expenses. They are also responsible for the cost of their air travel to and from Britain, although they may
select to take the group flight to London arranged by the Programme at competitive rates. They are provided with
three meals a day for the first four or five days in Oxford and with a weekly catered meal in Ephraim Williams
House during the eight weeks of term. They may also eat breakfast, lunch, and/or dinner on any day of the week at
Exeter. Students will not be charged the full Williams board fee during their year in Oxford, but they will pay a
proportion of the board fee to help cover these costs. For planning purposes, students and their parents should
expect the cost of a year on the Programme to be roughly the same as a year at Williams. Financial aid eligibility
will be figured on the usual basis of tuition, fees, room, board, and personal and book expenses, as if the student
were at Williams for the year. Similarly, the normal self-help contribution would be expected. Since the academic
year ends later at Oxford than at Williams, the summer earning expectations for students for the following year
will be reduced by one half and the difference will be made up by additional Williams aid.
APPLICATION
Admission to the Programme is on a competitive but flexible basis. Students must apply to the Dean's Office by
the prescribed deadline (normally early in February) and, prior to applying, should consult with the chair of their
major department. Any questions students might have about curricular offerings at Oxford can also be raised with
the director of the Programme in Oxford. In addition to completing the formal application form, students can ex-
pect to be interviewed at Williams and will subsequently need to complete an application for Visiting Student
status at Oxford University. All admissions to the Programme are subject to approval by Exeter College. Students
can expect to be notified of acceptance before Spring Break. It is normally expected that they will have completed
the College's distribution requirement by the end of their sophomore year. In making its decisions, the Admissions
Committee of the Williams-Exeter Programme at Oxford University takes student GPA into account, expects all
applicants to have demonstrated capacity for rigorous independent work and extensive essay writing, and looks
favorably on those students whose intellectual maturity, curiosity and enthusiasm would best prepare them for a
demanding course of study in Oxford. All applicants must identify two Williams faculty members who are willing
to provide references. Because of the emphasis at Oxford on weekly written work for each tutorial course, at least
one of those faculty members should be able to offer an assessment of the applicant's writing ability.

WILLIAMS-MYSTIC MARITIME STUDIES PROGRAM
Director, JAMES T. CARLTON
Faculty: JAMES T. CARLTON (Williams College), LISA GILBERT (Williams College), GLENN S.
GORDINIER (University of Connecticut), CATHERINE ROBINSON HALL (Mystic Seaport Mu-
seum), RICHARD KING (Mystic Seaport Museum).
The Williams College-Mystic Seaport Maritime Studies Program offers students a unique opportunity to ex-
plore the ocean, travel the Atlantic, Pacific, and Gulf coasts, and undertake original research of their own design in
the humanities and sciences. Sophomores, juniors, and seniors of all majors welcome. A term at Williams-Mystic
includes credit for one semester plus one winter study requirement, as well as intensive writing course credit. Four
Williams courses are offered as an integrated, multidisciplinary curriculum in the semester-long program at Mys-
tic Seaport, in Mystic, Connecticut: Maritime History, Literature of the Sea, Marine Policy, and either Marine
Ecology or Oceanography (see the Maritime Studies section in this catalog). Travel includes an offshore voyage
on the open ocean sailing aboard a tall ship, a seminar along the Pacific Coast, and a Louisiana field seminar, all of
which are cross-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary exercises. Students live in historic, cooperative, co-ed houses at
Mystic Seaport, the world's largest maritime museum, and have full access to world-class maritime collections, a
maritime library, a state-of-the-art Marine Sciences teaching and research center, and diverse coastal habitats
(where field research can be undertaken in a wide variety of environments, ranging from tidepools and salt
marshes to sandy beaches and estuaries). Students also participate in maritime skills under professional instruc-
tion, with choices such as celestial navigation, music of the sea, boat building, or small boat handling and sailing.
Williams-Mystic seeks candidates who are willing to try new things and work in a compelling academic environ-
ment. No sailing experience necessary. Participation in Williams-Mystic can also be used in partial fulfillment of
the Maritime Studies Concentration at Williams. Interested students should email admissions@williamsmys-
tic.org, call (860-572-5359), visit the website (www.williams.edu/williamsmystic), or obtain a Williams-Mystic
catalog from the Dean's office. Applications are on the web and at the Dean's office.

WILLIAMS IN NEW YORK
Director, Professor LIZA JOHNSON
Professors: CHAVOYA, CREWSON, L.JOHNSON, MITTELBACH, SYEED, D. WANG.
Williams in New York is an experiential education program that combines immersion in fieldwork with tradi-
tional scholarship and contemplation. It aims to help students develop critical, reflective habits of mind to carry
with them into the world of affairs. Moreover, it provides a forum to engage alumni and alumnae in the ongoing
intellectual work of the College, a milieu to stoke the unbroken dialogue between generations of Williams men
and women.
In both fall 2008 and spring 2009, the program will have eight students. Students live on the fifth floor of the
Williams Club at 24 East 39th Street, between Park and Madison avenues. Some seminars will be held at the
Graduate Center of the City University of New York at 365 Fifth Avenue, only a few minutes away from the
Williams Club. Other classes will be conducted at the Williams Club.
The curriculum for fall 2008 consists of the following four graded courses:
WNY 307T(F) Work/Ethics: Framewoorks for Observing People at Work (W)
This tutorial is directly linked to students' field work or independent study project. In semi-weekly papers and
meetings with a tutorial partner, students develop a framework for thinking about their observations in their field
placements.
Satisfies one semester of the Division II requirement.
L. JOHNSON
WNY 308(F) Explorations in the Urban Outback
Authors Michael Crewdson and Margaret Mittelbach will lead students in field research in the city's natural and
unnatural history. Fieldwork will include visits to a decommissioned airport, an urban wildlife refuge, the Ameri-
can Museum of Natural History, Freshkills Landfill, Central Park, and other wild places. Special attention will be
given to Frederick Law Olmstead's creation of "natural" landscapes in Prospect Park and Central Park. The class
will also have discussions with museum curators, pigeon racers, the Jamaica Bay keeper, geologists, biologists,
invasive species hunters, artists, and more. Assignments will include field journals and a research-based project.
Satisfies one semester of the Division II requirement.

WNY 309(F) Covering the Other: A Course in Cross-Cultural and Community-based Film
The objective of this course will be to send informed filmmakers into the field to produce short, intimate documen-
taries about New York City's diverse underrepresented communities. Students will be equipped with not only
technical skills, but also with a background in the responsibilities of community-based filmmaking to create films
that will contribute to cross-cultural dialogue at large.
In the classroom, students will be introduced to the issues surrounding cross-cultural filmmaking, through discus-
sions on ethics, research, responsibilities to subjects, and representation. Class discussions will be supplemented
by films and articles by anthropologists, filmmakers, and film critics. Students will learn practical research and
communication skills to negotiate access and build relationships with subjects, through in-class role-playing and
discussions with former documentary subjects.
The main focus of the course will be in production of students' films in the field. Students will receive technical
training in camera operating, sound recording, lighting, and editing. The class will be divided into small crews, and
each crew will be assigned to a specific community (Jackson Heights, Brighton Beach, Washington Heights).
Individual crews will be responsible for finding subjects to follow over the course of the 12 weeks, to make a short
documentary. Every week screenings of rough footage will provide students the opportunity to discuss and cri-
tique their classmates' work. Working cinematographers, editors, and directors will serve as guest speakers to con-
tribute to the discussion of student work. The class will culminate with screenings of the completed films.
Satisfies one semester of the Division I or II requirement.

WNY 310(S) Art, Space, and the City
This course will explore the ways artworks and artists engage with urban space in New York City. We will ex-
amine the interactions (and tensions) between art and the public realm, considering issues such as public access,
public representation, and, importantly, public space in relation to questions of democracy and dialogue. Through-
out the semester we will analyze various debates on art and urban space through historical and theoretical writings
and consider the issues of urban development (including, gentrification, privatization, and surveillance), cultural
diversity, immigration, and globalization. In New York City, site visits will be held at museums, galleries, alterna-
tive art spaces, and in artists' studios. Institutions and organizations that support and promote public projects, par-
ticularly experimental and/or multimedia approaches, will also be introduced. Weekly writing assignments will be
modeled on art reviews; with this goal in mind we will study review formats, styles, and conventions from a vari-
ety of publications over the course of the semester. Shorter writing assignments will be developed and expanded
into a final paper.
Satisfies one semester of the Division I requirement.
CHAVOYA
WNY 311(S) Imagining New York City
In the past century, more literary, artistic and musical efflorescences have occurred here than in new York than in
any other American city, and its artists and writers have produced the most diverse cultural products on the globe.
This course will examine particularly noteworthy moments of cultural eruption that have taken place in the city,
and we will come to understand why they happened in NYC and not anywhere else. While we will pay close
attention to the artistic and formal aspects of these works, we will also see how these cultural products are rooted
both in geographical sites (particular neighborhoods, the urban cityscape and its structures-bridges, subways, sky-
scrapers) and in various communities (artistic, ethnic, underground, rarified, gay, elite), many overlapping. New
York, while very real, also exists as a place in the American imaginary. This course will examine writers and artists
working both uptown (Harlem), downtown (the Lower East Side, the Village, Chinatown, Wall St.) and Brooklyn.
We will look in particular at works which chronicle poverty (Stephen Crane, Jacob Riis) and wealth (Henry James,
Edith Wharton), writings about the Brooklyn Bridge (Whitman, Hart Crane), writings by expatriates (Jose Marti,
Federico Garcia Lorca), and the work produced by the Harlem Renaissance, the Beats, Black Arts Movement, the
New York School of Poets, the Nuyorican Poets Café, and recent avant-garde writers. We will also look at visual
art from the Armory Show, Abstract Expressionists, Minimalists, Pop artists, "graffiti artists" and current artists
(e.g., graphic novelists such as Adrian Tomine). We will think about the effects of AIDS, immigration, 9/11,
money, etc. on the production of cultural artifacts.
Satisfies one semester of the Division I requirement.

WINTER STUDY PROGRAM
REMINDERS ABOUT WSP REGISTRATION
All students who will be on campus during the 2008-2009 academic year must register for WSP. Registration
will take place in the early part of fall semester. If you are registered for a senior thesis in the fall which must be
continued through Winter Study by departmental rules, you will be registered for your Winter Study Project
automatically. In every other case, you must complete registration. First-year students are required to participate
in a Winter Study that will take place on campus; they are not allowed to do 99's.
Even if you plan to take a 99, or the instructor of your first choice accepts you during the registration period,
there are many things that can happen between registration and the beginning of Winter Study to upset your first
choice, so you must list five choices. You should try to make one of your choices a project with a larger enroll-
ment, not that it will guarantee you a project, but it will increase your chances.
If you think your time may be restricted in any way (ski meets, interviews, etc.), clear these restrictions with
the instructor before signing up for his/her project.
Remember, for cross-listed projects, you should sign up for the subject you want to appear on your record.
For many beginning language courses, you are required to take the WSP Sustaining Program in addition to
your regular project. You will be automatically enrolled in this Sustaining Program,so no one should list this as a
choice.
The grade of honors is reserved for outstanding or exceptional work. Individual instructors may specify mini-
mum standards for the grade, but normally, fewer than one out of ten students will qualify. A grade of pass means
the student has performed satisfactorily. A grade of perfunctory pass signifies that a student's work has been
significantly lacking but is just adequate to deserve a pass.
If you have any questions about a project, see the instructor before you register.
Finally, all work for WSP must be completed and submitted to the instructor no later than Wednesday,
January 28th. Only the Dean can grant an extension beyond this date.
WINTER STUDY 99'S
Sophomores, juniors and seniors are eligible to propose "99's," independent projects arranged with faculty
sponsors, conducted in lieu of regular Winter Study courses. Perhaps you have encountered an interesting idea in
one of your courses which you would like to study in more depth, or you may have an interest not covered in the
regular curriculum. In recent years students have undertaken in-depth studies of particular literary works, in-
terned in government offices, assisted in foreign and domestic medical clinics, conducted field work in econom-
ics in developing countries, and given performances illustrating the history of American dance. Although some
99's involve travel away from campus, there are many opportunities to pursue intellectual or artistic goals here in
Williamstown.
99 forms are available online: http://www.williams.edu/Registrar/winterstudy/99direct.html
The deadline for submitting the proposals to faculty sponsors is Thursday, 25 September.
AFRICANA STUDIES
AFR 25 Youth, Gender and Social Activism in Tanzania (Same as Women's and Gender Studies
24)
This course builds on the foundation of the Winter Study Courses and Group WS99 run in January 2006, 2007 and
2008 in Senegal, Uganda, and Senegal respectively. This year we propose to extend our project to a new country
and introduce a new group of students to the work of non-governmental and grassroots health and social organiza-
tions in Tanzania, East Africa. We plan to expand this project by not only looking at gender roles and social activ-
ism, but also the role of youth organizations and their innovative approaches to the critical issues of contemporary
Tanzanian society. As proposed in our previous courses, we seek to engage students in a hands-on learning experi-
ence that allows them to understand the importance of gender structures in Tanzania and how they shape vulnera-
bility to HIV, while producing collaborative videos to further engage students with these issues. In Tanzania as
elsewhere, local and national groups have sprung up in response to concerns about poverty, unemployment, dis-
ease, and other pressing issues. Particularly inspiring are a number of AIDS education and awareness groups that
women and youth have started up to halt the spread of the disease in their communities and to offer support to
those living with it. Students in this course will have the opportunity to meet and learn from social and health
education activists and engage with local Tanzanian youth about their activist efforts.
In addition to gaining an understanding of the breadth, purpose and genesis of social activism in Tanzania, students
will learn of the mixed effect of Western commerce and tourism on the country. Non-governmental groups
(NGOs), both those run by Tanzanians and those directed by foreigners, grapple with the legacy of British colonial
structures and the present-day reality of market capitalism vs. socialist ideals and practices in an impoverished
country. These circumstances create a politically complex backdrop against which NGOs struggle to achieve their
goals. As such, part of the work of our Williams group will be to understand the challenges and practical impedi-
ments these NGOs face against a background of pervasive (and invasive) North-South power dynamics and in-
equality.
Articulated with this analysis will be a review of gender systems and their interaction with the political economy
and HIV. Gender has been widely recognized as a crucial component in the African AIDS pandemic; but it is vital
to go beyond generalizations about patriarchal African culture to an understanding of the contestation over gender
within a specific locale. Looking at gender, economics, and HIV, will be a perfect opportunity to involve local
Williams CDE alums who are employed in a wide array of Tanzanian social and governmental institutions. With
the help of Danielle Callaway '08, who will be in Tanzania with the Thomas J. Watson Fellowship, we hope to
organize a panel discussion with Tanzanian CDE alumni in Dar es Salaam to allow our Williams delegation to get

the "inside scoop" about economics, HIV/AIDS, and gender dynamics in Tanzania.
The winter study will start with pre-orientation meetings in the Fall 2008 providing background readings, Swahili
language training, and video editing workshops. Then on January 5th, the first day of winter study, the group will
meet at the airport in NYC. After a day of traveling, we will spend 4 days in Arusha, Tanzania, being hosted by
UAACC (United African Alliance Community Center, a local NGO), which will provide the students with cultur-
al introductions, basic Swahili classes, and background lectures on the landscape of HIV and grassroots activism
in Tanzania. They will also organize homestays with Maasai families, an indigenous and one of the most signifi-
cant tribal cultures in Africa. Danielle Callaway '08 will meet us at the UAACC and will play an instrumental role
in helping to facilitate language classes and lectures on culture and activism in Tanzania.
After 3 days of the Maasai homestay, we will return to the UAACC to process our experiences and to visit other
local NGOs in Arusha. After 4 more days in Arusha, we will take a two day trip to Dar es Salaam, the capital of
Tanzania, to meet with Williams CDE alumni and visit both NGOs and government organizations in the capital.
We will then return to Arusha to work on the group video projects for 6 days. Finally, we will go on a two-day
Safari to Ngorongoro Crater, considered to be the 8th Wonder of the World. The last day will be a time for debrief-
ing and group reflection before departing Tanzania on Thursday, January 29th, the last day of winter study.
Course requirements: Students will produce a final video, made with an NGO of their choosing, that addresses the
role of gender structures and/or activism among youth in Tanzania. Students will be required to keep a journal of
their reflections while in Tanzania, and will take part in a public meeting at Williams to report on and discuss their
experience and findings.
The course is open to sophomores, juniors and seniors. Videography and video editing skills are strongly encour-
aged but not required. In the event of oversubscription, students will be asked to fill out a standard questionnaire to
gage their experience in video editing and their interest in traveling to Tanzania. Enrollment limit: 10. Not open to
first-year students.
Estimated cost per student: $3,350.

ANSO 10 Meditation-Based Stress Reduction: Adopting a Mindfulness Practice (Same as Religion
10)
This course provides an opportunity to actively participate in your own health and well-being. Students will be
introduced to the concept of mindfulness and guided in how to create their own mindfulness practice, one that
incorporates meditation and yoga. Mindfulness is a way of relating directly to what is happening in your life, a way
of taking charge of your life, a way of doing something for yourself that no one else can do for you-consciously
and systematically working with your own stress, pain, illness and the challenges and demands of collegiate life.
We will meet twice per week for 3-hour sessions of meditation, yoga, and inquiry into the interplay of mind and
body in health and illness, calm and stress. The origin of meditation and yoga in the Hindu and Buddhist faiths will
be explored, with specific emphasis on the influence of Buddhist meditation on this secular stress reduction prac-
tice.
Students are required to commit to 45 minutes of mindfulness meditation practice on a daily basis. Additional
assignments will include weekly reading of texts relevant to the course as well as brief presentations of concepts

ANSO 11 Berkshire Farm Center Internship
A field placement at Berkshire Farm Center and Services for Youth in Canaan, New York. Berkshire Farm Center
is a residential treatment facility for troubled, at-risk adolescent boys who have been remanded to the Farm by the
Family Court. These youths come primarily from lower socio-economic strata, are very ethnically diverse, and
hail from both urban and rural areas throughout New York State. The problems that they bring to Berkshire Farm
are multiple. These include: the psychological scars of dysfunctional families, including those of physical, emo-
tional, and sexual abuse; chemical dependency; juvenile delinquency; inability to function in school settings; and
various other issues. Residential treatment is a multi-modal approach that includes anger-replacement training,
social skills training, and behavioral modification.
Williams students will commute to Berkshire Farm and work under supervision in one of the following areas:
school, cottage life, chemical dependency unit, research, recreation, performing arts, or in individual tutoring.
Requirements: students will keep a journal reflecting on their experiences, and a weekly seminar with the instruc-
tor will draw on service learning experience. Students will also be required to submit a final 10-page paper at the
end of the course.

ANSO 13 Epidemiology, Public Health, and Leadership in the Health Professions"
Epidemiology, the study of disease and disability in human populations, has been called the basic science of public
health and preventive medicine. Epidemiology has made substantial contributions to the advancement of health
and improved illness care through a deeper understanding of the natural history of disease, the multiple "causes"of
disease, including the role of behavioral factors, and the control of epidemics of both infectious and (later) non­in-
fectious disease. Epidemiological approaches are used constantly to test new medicines and guide prevention and
treatment strategies.
Making use of epidemic exercises , selected original papers from the medical and public health literature, and a
basic text, this course will begin by examining and reviewing the history, logic, and approaches of epidemiology.
We will then turn to a series of seminar discussions of scientific leadership in the health professions.
With the help of guest lecturers/discussion leaders, we will explore aspects of leadership in at least three of the
following areas:
S Evaluation of illness care services
S International health, specifically malaria control, drug resistant Tbc, or HIV/AIDS,
with special consideration of how best to find the balance between treatment and pre-
vention in high prevalence countries
Winter Study Program
­ 343 ­
S HIV/AIDS control, with special reference to the "Down low" culture in the US
S Ethics in international experiments in human populations
S Behavioral issues in prevention and treatment, perhaps with focus on obesity.
S Sports injuries, their incidence, prevention and treatment
The course will meet at least 3 times a week, for approximately 6­8 hours each week. There may be evening
meetings, depending on the schedules of individual instructors. Active student participation will be required. After
individual consultation with the instructor, students will be asked to write a paper on selected aspects of leadership
in health or an epidemiologic analysis based on available original literature concerning a topic of personal interest.
Grading will depend on participation and the quality of the paper.
Prerequisites: Curiosity, personal interview, and a (no more than one page) essay stating your reasons for interest
in the course and what you think you can contribute. Enrollment limit: 12.
Cost to students: no more than $150 for books and reading materials
Meeting time: afternoons, three days per week, for approximately six hours per week. There may be some eve-
ning meetings, depending on the schedules of visiting instructors.

of new technologies on community and agriculture, sustainability, environmental stewardship, citizenship, and the
value of place are among the themes in Berry's work that will be considered in the course. Students will read both
Berry's fiction as well as a variety of his non-fiction essays, which address related subject matters. Among those
deeply influenced by Berry's writings are such popular environmentalists as Michael Pollan and Bill McKibben,
some of whose work will also be explored in the course. Students will have the opportunity to visit a local Com-

ART
ART HISTORY
ARTH 10 From Stage to Screen
This course looks at movies of selected live performances, with particular attention to those which were originally
conceived for the stage. How might we understand the differences between them? What if, for example, we have
seen the play or performance staged? What if we haven't? We will consider changes in actors, setting, and narra-
tive but one of our primary questions is to ask how memorable performances "haunt" (to use Performance Studies
scholar Marvin Carlson's term) the stage and screen treatments that come after them. As a coda, we might consid-
er the current popularity of making Broadway plays based on movies. Clearly, plays and roles are continuously
reinvented. Our goal is to understand the different experiences of viewing live performances and those on film.
The course includes regular screenings as well as meetings. If possible, we will attend a current production in New
York, or more locally, that enables us to focus these questions.
Evaluation will be based on class participation, two one-page papers based on materials assigned in the course,
and a 10 page-paper or presentation (with approval of the instructor).
No prerequisites, although introductory level course in Art, Film, or Theater preferred. Enrollment limit: 10.

ARTH 11 Photography of the Distant
This course examines the circulation of photographic images of foreign places and people in England and France
in the nineteenth century. Students will be introduced to a diverse range of subjects a select number of Western
Winter Study Program
­ 344 ­
photographers imaged of the Other, including landscapes, views of historic monuments, native types and genre
scenes. We will examine the photographer's motives for traveling abroad, his aesthetic treatment of his subject(s),
and his methods for presenting work "back home." We will pay particular attention to the physical format in which
photographs were presented, as well as the context in which these images were displayed. How did the presenta-
tion of a photographic image--whether it was issued as a plate in a subscription album, viewed through lens of a
stereoscope, or projected as a magic lantern image--influence the interpretation of the subject? Which publics
encountered these images? Students will gain an understanding of how profoundly the camera shaped the nine-
teenth-century person's view of the world.
This course will meet four times a week. Lectures will address the above, and seek to contextualize photography
of the distant within a general history of photography. Portions of each course period will be devoted to a discus-
sion of images and assigned readings. Visits to the Williams College Museum of Art and the Clark Art Institute to
study relevant photographs will be an integral part of this course as well.
Evaluation will be based on 10-minute presentation before a photograph in a local art museum; 10-page research
paper.

ARTH 13 Proving Peiro: Is the Clark Piero Della Francesca the Real McCoy?
One of the most treasured paintings in our Clark Art Institute is the "Madonna and Child with Angels" attributed to
the Renaissance artist Piero Della Francesca.
But is it the real McCoy? Is it truly a restored masterpiece--or just a fake remake?
This winter study seminar is offered to a select number of students interested in doing detective work on a famous
painting, one that was little known in 1914 when Sterling Clark first purchased it. Because it was in such wretched
condition, he got it on the cheap, but then had it expensively restored during the 1950s. Since 1955 it has hung in
the Clark Museum. At first, only a few Renaissance art historians were even aware of its existence, and most of
these tended to deny it as a true Piero. Only when it was exhibited for the first time abroad in 2004, where it was
hung beside several undoubted Pieros was it accepted as genuine.
But doubts still remain, which this seminar may either resolve or sustain.
After three preliminary lectures by the professor, each student will be assigned a special topic directly pertaining to
a detail or aspect of the Clark painting that may or may not support its attribution. Students will be expected to do
independent research on their chosen topics in the library and archives of the Clark Art Institute and Williamstown
Regional Art Conservation Laboratory (WRACL), and meet periodically with the professor in order to fashion
written reports which will be orally presented during the final meetings of the seminar. Lastly, we will collectively
decide, based on all the presented evidence, whether or not the Clark "Piero" was really a Piero.
Evaluation will be based on a 10-page paper and an oral presentation.
Prerequisites: ArtH 101-102. Enrollment limit: 10. Students will be selected based on an interview.

ARTH 14 Ramayana: The Great Epic in Indian and Southeast Asian Art
The Ramayana, or "Travels of Rama", is one of the most popular epics of India. It is a heroic tale involving ro-
mance, villainy, and warfare on both the human and cosmic or heavenly scales. To know the Ramayana is to grasp
the essentials of Hindu religion, culture, and values.
This course will explore the exciting visual and performing arts inspired by the Ramayana in India, where the story
originated, as well as the lands of Southeast Asia, where it spread. Arts to be explored will include the great temple
sculptures in stone and bronze, large scale and miniature painting, plays, dance and musical drama, batik, puppet
shows, even modern day comic books, and film and television productions of the Ramayana. Social and esthetic
issues to be considered may include the role played by the arts in society; methods and aims of artistic expression;
ideals of beauty and of virtue; social status and gender; the various transformations of the Ramayana in both litera-
ture and art in various parts of India and by various levels of society ("folk" art vs. "high" art), as well as the
various different cultures in southeast Asia.
This course will consist partly of art history lectures, and partly of studio art practice.
Evaluation will be based on attendance (mandatory), participation in class discussions based on readings, a short
presentation (about 2 minutes in length), and the production of painted illustrations to the story. Exhibition of the
work on the last day of Winter Study is required. Students will also be asked to explain the part of the story that
they illustrated to a group of school children.

ARTS 11 The Camera Obscura in Visual Art
This will be a collaborative studio-based exploration of the Camera Obscura in concept and practice. The Camera
Obscura is a simple and ancient philosophical instrument and precursor to all modern optical theories of vision and
representation. We will consider its historical significance, its many applications in high and low culture, and dwell
upon its recent appearance across a wide spectrum of contemporary art practices. Students will work together to
create a variety of optical constructions, culminating in a large scale group project. Class time will be spent in
lecture, visual presentation, discussion and studio work. Time outside of class meetings will be required for studio
work, reading, and research. Students will execute a final group installation open to the community.
Evaluation will be based on participation, quality of individual and collaborative work, and final project.

ARTS 13 Entrepeneurship as an Art Form (Same as Economics 13)
In what ways is an entrepreneur like an artist? In what ways is starting a company like bringing an artwork into the
world? If, as Heidegger says, a work of art is something new that is brought into the world, and which changes the
world to allow for the new thing, then many recent start-up companies could be considered in an artistic context.
Some companies are not artworks, of course, and some lone, fantastically creative ideas, are not executable. But
on this spectrum from economic realism to what Charles Renee MacKintosh calls the seemingly ephemeral
"phantasy or caprice" of a newly introduced idea, there is likely room for a liberal arts approach to creative econo-
mics. The course combines case studies of entrepreneurs and visual artists as people, and entrepreneurial stories of
companies such as Google and Facebook, alongside lectures in economics and entrepreneurial finance and studio
activities, to explore the above questions. Coursework will include weekly research and memos, and a final team
presentation of an art project (e.g., a business plan).
Additionally, there will be periodic scheduled film viewings, small group meetings with the instructor regarding
final projects, and Wednesday afternoon studio/research time that is encouraged but not required. Participants are

ARTS 14 Sketchbooks!
Throughout history, artists have used sketchbooks to work through ideas, reflect on life, observe and study the
world around them, and to attempt a better understanding of themselves. In this course we will explore the sketch-
book as a tool for gaining insight into our thinking process. We will consider what goes on on the pages of sketch-
books, how and why it gets there, and what it can tell us about the mind of the person who created it. We will talk
about mark making and page composition, and explore the effects of different formats and drawing/writing imple-
ments. To supplement our discussions, about half of our time will be spent in the studio, learning and practicing
drawing techniques. Each student will keep a sketchbook that will form the basis of class discussions and presen-
tations. We will also visit WCMA and the Clark to take a close look at sketches by some of the great artists. There
will be several short sketching and writing assignments, culminating in a final sketchbook presentation accompa-
nied by a short self-analytical essay.
Evaluation will be based on class participation, a sketchbook, oral presentations, and writing assignments totaling

ARTS 15 Large-Format Photography
The course is designed to introduce students to studio/view cameras, to processing the sheet-film negatives made
in them and to making contact and projection prints. Studio exercises will include careful analysis of camera
movements to teach their use and a consideration of lighting techniques; dark room exercises will include the tray
development of sheet film, determination of effective film speed and control of contrast through development
time.
The subject matter of the photographs produced in the course will not be prescribed; it is limited only by the partic-
ipants' imagination and the weather in January. Working with subjects of their own choosing, students will be
instructed in the principles of traditional photographic image making by producing large-format negatives and
translating them into effective black-and-white prints in 4x5 and 8x10 formats.
Each student will be expected to make exhibition-quality prints, which may be enlargements or contact prints from
4x5 negatives, or contract prints from 8x10 negatives. The prints will be exhibited in a group show at the end of
Winter Study.
Evaluation will be based on commitment to the course, participation in discussion sessions and the quality of the
prints. Class will meet as a group for a minimum of six hours a week for lectures, demonstrations in the dark room
and studio and crits. In addition to this time, students will be expected to spend at least 20 hours a week in the
darkroom working individually, under the supervision of the course instructor and the photography technician.
No prerequisites, although some experience with a camera and dark room work would be an advantage. Enroll-

ARTS 17 Collagraphs and Silk Aquatints
In this course, students will create prints by making collagraphs and silk aquatints, both non-acid approaches. In a
collagraph, the surface of the plate is created by adhering assorted materials to a cardboard or aluminum plate to
create lines, values, and textures. In a silk aquatint, the image is made by in a reverse method by painting out
lighter tones with acrylic painting on a silk covered plate that prints a deep black. The resulting image can be very
rich, painterly, and spontaneous. Both kinds of plates will be printed as intaglios--the plates inked, wiped down by
hand, and rolled through the press. We will meet twice a week for 3 hour sessions for demonstrations, critiques,
and studio time. Students will be expected to put in extra hours during the week to finish assignments. Attendance
and one field trip to the Williams College Museum are mandatory.
Evaluation will be based on three assignments (editioned prints).

ARTS 18 Figure Modeling
This course is designed as an introduction to the challenges of working with the figure in a sculptural context. The
class will be structured as a working studio with the students sculpting in clay from a live model.
The first half of the course will emphasize learning the technical and physiological aspects of the human figure;
structure, proportion, gesture, and basic anatomy. The latter half of the course will be concerned with the creative
aspects of working with the figure and of developing individual interpretations of the human form.
In addition to working studio sessions, there will be two slide lectures on the human form in art.
Each student will be evaluated on the success of their sculpture, attendance, participation, and effort. This course

ARTS 19 Introduction to the Craft and Art of Blacksmithing
Fire, hammer, and anvil--these three simple tools have been used by blacksmiths for over three thousand years to
make the ironwork needed to create towns, civilizations, and most recently, art. While the common blacksmithing
processes: bending, tapering, and joining steel are very simple, these methods can be combined to create an in-
credibly diverse range of work--from imposing gates to delicate jewelry. In the first part of the course, the instruc-
tors will demonstrate techniques and the students will practice on small projects such as coat hooks, flowerpot
hangers, chisels, trivets, iron flowers, bracelets, napkin rings, etc. In the second part of the course, students will
design their own instructor-approved projects. Projects could include mailbox brackets, fireplace tools, hammers,
cooking utensils, woodworking tools, door hardware, jewelry, sculpture, or whatever the student can dream up!
Expect to spend 2 three-hour sessions in class and approximately 20 additional hours per week in the studio. A
slide show of traditional and contemporary work will be given to help students understand the history of the craft
and to give them ideas for individual projects. Grades will be based on class attendance and completion of assign-
ments.
No prerequisites, although students must be enthused about working with hot iron. Enrollment limit is 10 with
preference given to seniors, studio art majors, and/or those who show the most interest in the class to the instruc-
tors (via email) before we select students.
Cost to students is $90 for materials.
Meeting times: mornings.

CHIN 13 Theory and Practice of Chinese Cooking
Much more than in the U.S., in China people are always talking about food; as the Chinese saying has it, min yi shi
wei tian `the people consider eating as heaven'. This hands-on course will foster an appreciation of the historical
and cultural background of Chinese cooking, as well as the development of practical skills in preparing a variety of
Chinese dishes. To the extent possible, we will use locally available ingredients (organic if possible) to cook au-
thentic Chinese food, primarily Chinese home cooking. Since climate has had a huge impact on availability of
ingredients, the course includes an introduction to the four primary regions, or schools, of Chinese cooking--
Northern, Eastern, Western, and Southern. Guest chefs may be invited to class to introduce a number of regional
dishes. While we will cook most dishes together, every student will also have the opportunity to cook indepen-
dently. Students will be expected to complete assigned readings, view films outside of class and write film re-
views, dine at several Chinese restaurants and write food critiques, shop at an Asian supermarket to learn about the
various cooking ingredients, and interview chefs.
Evaluation will be based on class participation, two short papers/reviews, a final project involving the creation and
cooking of original recipes, and one 10-page paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 8. In case of oversubscription, preference will be given to senior and junior
Chinese majors and those who have taken Chinese language at Williams.

JAPN 11 Encountering the Tale of Genji--1000 Years Later
The Tale of Genji by Murasaki Shikibu, a lady who served in the imperial court, is considered by some to be the
world's first novel. Kawabata Yasunari called it "the highest pinnacle of Japanese literature" in his 1968 Nobel
acceptance speech. The year 2008 marks the millennium celebration of the novel's dissemination, as confirmed in
a diary entry by the author. Consisting of 54 chapters, The Tale of Genji spans three generations, depicting intricate
human relations, psychology, pathos, love, death, and jealousy. It has influenced and bequeathed traces of itself to
later genres of Japanese literature, culture, esthetics, and arts. Over a thousand years later and over ten thousand
kilometers away, Winter Study provides us a great opportunity to dive into this monumental work. We will explore
its relevance to our lives and the scope of its lasting influence, as evidenced by translations into several languages,
modern Japanese adaptations, films, anime, comic books, TV programs, and numerous theatre productions, both
traditional and modern. Materials and discussions will be in English (unless you choose otherwise via consultation
with the instructor). We will meet in the afternoon as a group an average of three times per week, with allowances
made for a few meetings to take place outside the regular class hours.
Evaluation for this course is based on a complete reading of the tale, class participation, oral presentations on some
chapters, and a final essay, about five pages long, in response to the tale in its entirety.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 12. If the course is oversubscribed, students will be selected according to se-
niority.
Cost to student: $30 to $50.

JAPN 12 Kamishibai Workshop
The kamishibai or "paper play" is a traditional street performance art of Japan. It consists of a stack of large paper
cards with colorful illustrations which are inserted in a wooden theater box and pulled out one by one as voice
performers hidden behind the box tell or "voice act" the story. Kamishibai stories and artwork were influenced by
both Kabuki Theater and the silent films of the early 20th century, and in turn have influenced the development of
manga and anime. In this kamishibai workshop, students will learn traditional techniques used in the story, art and
performance of kamishibai, and will also be encouraged to experiment with innovative techniques. Small groups
will collaborate to create original kamishibai, which we will take to schools and libraries in the area to perform.
There will be a final performance at the college for the public. Japanese language students will be encouraged to
create a Japanese version of their kamishibai, in addition to the English version.
Evaluation will be based on the successful creation and performance of original kamishibai, with attendance, par-
ticipation and teamwork also taken into account. We will meet three times a week in the morning for two-hour

JAPN 25 Exploring Japanese Culture and Language
If you've never been to Japan but always wanted to go, this is an excellent chance. If you want to explore your
identity in a totally different cultural setting, this course is also for you. This course is designed to help students
develop some level of self-conscious awareness of the cultural differences, traditions, and customs of the Japa-
nese. A total immersion in Japanese culture and society offers students a first-hand experience of the people and
culture. The experiential goals of this course are to: (1) communicate in Japanese with native speakers; (2) partici-
pate in various cultural activities; (3) experience Japanese home life; and (4) visit historic sites and deepen stu-
dents' interest in and knowledge of Japanese history. Students will spend the first three weeks in Kanazawa, which
is often called `small Kyoto' and is located in Ishikawa prefecture. They will study at the Ishikawa Japanese Stud-
ies Center, taking Japanese lessons each morning and then gathering for cultural activities in the afternoon. During
this period, students will live with Japanese families and will have an overnight trip to the Noto peninsula on the
Japanese coast. The course will end with a trip to Kyoto to visit historical sites.
Requirements: satisfactory completion of the language course, active participation in the other scheduled cultural
activities, and submission of a journal.

ASTRONOMY
ASTR 12T Exoplanets: Detection and Details
The first planets orbiting stars other than our sun were discovered more than a decade ago via a breakthrough
technique and painstaking analysis. We now know of more than 220 exoplanets, though none you would enjoy
vacationing on. But the hope is that with refinements in methods of exoplanet detection, including proposed
space-borne missions like NASA's SIM PlanetQuest and the European Spaces Agency's GAIA, we might actually
detect another "Earth" in the next decade or two. In this tutorial, students will investigate the principles involved in
current and future exoplanet detection techniques, and also study the surprising properties of planets already
found, and the implications they carry for the development of life.
Pairs of students will meet twice each week giving alternating presentations, for a total of eight tutorial sessions. It
is estimated that research, reading and writing will take students approximately 20 hours each week.
Method of evaluation: tutorial presentations and papers (with a total of 15-20 pages of writing).
Prerequisites: Math 105 or 106, Physics 141 or equivalent. Closed to students who have taken ASTR 102 or

BIOL 11 Global Health: Why We Should Care
From the Declaration of Alma-Ata to the Millennium Development Goals, there have been 30 years of good will
but limited accomplishment in bringing health to all. Health is an essential human right, but much of the world's
poor still do not have access to the most basic public health services. This is best illustrated in Africa where there is
the double burden of poverty and communicable disease. The failure to provide equitable global health and the
emergence of new infectious diseases with pandemic potential also threaten world security. This winter study will
explore what is meant by global health, how health is measured and what are the major diseases that particularly
affect the poor. It will take a biomedical approach focusing on communicable diseases, e.g. HIV/AIDS, malaria,
tuberculosis, and diseases with pandemic potential, but will also look at maternal and child health. After defining
the problems, we will explore potential strategies in achieving global health.
A variety of formats will be used to study global health issues including the current medical literature, popular
writings and film documentaries. Students will be expected to read material outside of class so that they will be
prepared to discuss the topics, and perhaps give short presentations on a focused area. We will meet three times
weekly for two hours each session.
Evaluation will be based on contributions to discussions and a ten-page paper that can: analyze a global health
issue, be a document defining a public health intervention, or a short story describing the impact of a disease or
condition on an individual, family or community.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20.

BIOL 14 Gestures of Time: A Visual Exploration
This is an interdisciplinary class that will investigate where Biology and Art intersect in the passage of time.
Through on-going detailed observation, drawing, watercolor painting, and digital photography, the class will ex-
plore ways of altering time in order to understand and communicate structures of motion in biological processes.
We will experiment with drawing and painting botanical and figurative renderings with regards to movement,
photographing a time-lapse series, as well as enlisting the Biology department's Motion Xtra high speed video
camera to slow down and analyze rapid gestures. The first few classes will emphasize drawing and watercolor
technique so that the pencil/paint begins to become a tool rather than an obstacle to capturing impressions. Stu-
dents will keep an on-going visual and written observations about a chosen botanical form as it grows throughout
the month, and produce motion books, botanical illustrations, and digital renderings. Biology Professor Joan Ed-
wards will present her findings on the record-breaking speed of bunchberry dogwood along with her discoveries
of the artistic relevance of biological processes in motion. We will also view and discuss relevant artworks
(through slides and at local museums) that express chrono-gestural concerns. Readings will be assigned and stu-
dents will be required to present a topic in conjunction with one or more or their art images. The final project will
be a synthesis of what has been observed and internalized. Students will be evaluated based on their final projects,
the depth and detail of their renderings and motion books, and their verbal participation in periodic group critiques
and discussions.
Evaluation will be based on completed portfolio of work and a final project.
Prerequisites: drawing experience helpful. Enrollment limit: 10. Preference to upper class students.

BIOL 21 Science Beyond Williams
Are you interested in hands-on experience in a science-related field beyond the Purple Valley? Are you curious to
explore science in a university or medical school research lab, a government agency, or a not-for-profit organiza-
tion? This course is designed to help students take part in scientific work or research going on outside of Williams
in order to provide them with a broader sense of what it is like to work in a professional scientific setting. Any field
of science or technology can be explored via this course.
In consultation with the course instructor, students will use resources such as the Office of Career Counseling,
science faculty members, and Williams alumni/ae to locate a mentor in the student's area of interest at a work site
in the United States. Once the course instructor approves the arrangement for a mentored, hands-on experience for
three weeks of Winter Study, the student will prepare for the internship by reading literature related to the project,
and discuss the readings with a faculty sponsor here at Williams in November/December. Once on site, students
must remain in contact with their Williams faculty sponsor by having a weekly phone conference. Participating
students would not have to be on campus during WSP prior to beginning their fieldwork. Strong interest, enthu-
siasm and willingness to plan and prepare for the internship are required for this course.
Evaluation will be based on a 10-page paper and post-WSP public presentation to a relevant department or pro-
gram on the goals and accomplishments of the project.
Prerequisites: two semesters of relevant course work in science and/or mathematics. Enrollment limit: 10.

CHEM 11 Science for Kids (Same as Special 11)
Are you interested in teaching? Do you enjoy working with kids? Do you like to experiment with new things?
Here is a chance for you to do all three! The aim of this Winter Study Project is to design a series of hands-on
science workshops for elementary school children and their parents. Working in teams of 2-4, students spend the
first two and a half weeks of Winter Study planning the workshops. This involves deciding on a focus for each
workshop (based on the interests of the students involved) followed by choosing and designing experiments and
presentations that will be suitable for fourth-grade children. On the third weekend of Winter Study (January 24,
25) we bring elementary school kids with their parents to Williams to participate in the workshops.
You get a chance to see what goes into planning classroom demonstrations as well as a sense of what it's like to
actually give a presentation. You find that kids at this age are great fun to work with because they are interested in
just about everything and their enthusiasm is infectious. You also give the kids and their parents a chance to actual-
ly do some fun hands-on science experiments that they may not have seen before, and you are able to explain
simple scientific concepts to them in a manner that won't be intimidating. It is a rewarding experience for all in-
volved.
Evaluation is based on participation in planning and running the workshops. Each group is expected to prepare a
handout with descriptions of the experiments for the kids, parents, and teachers.
No prerequisites. You need not be a science major; all that is needed is enthusiasm. Enrollment limit: 25.
Cost to student: none.
Meeting time: mornings. Classes meet three times a week for approximately three hours each session. The work-
shop is run on the third weekend of Winter Study (January 24, 25) and attendance from 9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. is

COMPARATIVE LITERATURE
COMP 10 The Grand Hotel in Modern Fiction and Film
In this course, we will visit actual hotel spaces in our area, read both contemporary and early twentieth-century
hotel fiction, and discuss a broad range of hotel films, from drama to comedy. The grand hotel with its dual prom-
ise of luxury and estrangement was considered a theatre of social transformation in the age of travel. We will read
novels, short stories, and discuss films that feature the hotel as a space that would either uphold class distinction or
give rise to class conflict, allow for sexual taboo breaking, or stage gendered identity performance. Authors and
filmmakers in this early period will include Edith Wharton, Thomas Mann, Franz Werfel, Vicki Baum, and F.W.
Murnau. We will consider short theoretical readings by Thorstein Veblen, Georg Simmel, Siegfried Kracauer on
conspicuous consumption, modernity, and metropolitan spaces. In the present, hotel dramas focus on issues of
ethnic violence (Hotel Rwanda), the invisible immigrant worker (Dirty Pretty Things), cultural alienation (Lost in
Translation), and the female body at work (A Single Girl). Comedies explore the fantasy of a dramatic social climb
through identity confusion in a hotel setting (Maid in Manhattan); satires highlight the confidence man who profits
from social pretensions (from Thomas Mann's trickster and sexual adventurer Felix Krull, to the hilarious high-
school dropout/runaway posing as the scion of a wealthy executive in Thomas Brussig's Wie es leuchtet). Fantasy
writing creates virtual hotel spaces (Robert Coover's The Grand Hotels of Joseph Cornell). Theoretical readings
focus on private versus public spaces, social distinction, warped space, and shopping for brands by Pierre Bour-
dieu, Erving Goffmann, Tony Vidler and Sharon Zukin. We will also study characteristics of real-life upscale area
hotels like The Equinox, The Porches and The Orchards through site visits.
Requirements: active class participation, one oral presentation on an aspect of hotel culture, and one 10- page final
paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15. Preference given to Comparative Literature, Literary Studies, and English

COMPUTER SCIENCE
CSCI 10 Designing and Building a Desktop Computer
This course introduces the study of computer hardware and the methods used to construct a fully working system
with an emphasis on the interconnection between the components and the operating system. There will be in-
depth study of the purpose of each part and of the different options available when purchasing. Research will in-
clude finding suppliers to acquire the parts online and will require deciphering and explaining the jargon used. The
students will have the choice of purchasing their own parts and ending up with their own computer which they can
take home, or using existing spare parts from the OIT basement to end up with a computer suitable for donation off
campus or to use as a campus email station. The class will be in a lab equipped with the hardware, spare parts and
tools for assembly. Students will research and discuss Operating System considerations such as networking, fire-
walls, anti-virus and software productivity packages for Windows, Mac and Linux. A final step will be the instal-
lation of an operating system and finding or downloading appropriate drivers for the hardware.
Evaluation will be based on research papers, quizzes and the completion of a working system and presentation to
the class.
There are no prerequisites as the class is aimed at the hardware novice, although familiarity with a screwdriver is
recommended. Enrollment limit: 15. Seniors given preference.
Meeting time: afternoons.

inaccessible and useless. The first half of this course provides an overview of the technology that underlies
Google's operations (in a manner suitable for a nonmajor), which span the core areas of Computer Science, in-
cluding databases, distributed systems, artificial intelligence, and others. The second half of the course will ex-
amine this technology's impact on our culture and economy. For example, is it ethical for Google to prioritize
search results for paying advertisers? What is the impact of storing data gathered from the web forever? The tech-
nical topics will include an overview of Google's basic infrastructure and techniques, while the cultural topics will
include privacy and censorship, Google in China, and Google's interactions with the U.S. government. Class
meetings (2 hours, 3 times per week) will consist primarily of discussions and debates based on reading assign-
ments.
Students will write 2-page summaries of the assigned readings before each class, and will take turns leading dis-
cussions. Class attendance and participation will be mandatory to receive a passing grade.

ECON 10 Mechanisms of Arbitrage
Arbitrage is a central concept of economics. This course is an introduction to mechanisms in markets which cause
arbitrage to occur in various markets, as well as those which limit arbitrage ,particularly when a mechanism coun-
teracts others. The emphasis will be on markets in public securities and the firms which may issue them as well as
markets which overlap with those in public securities.
Requirements: there will be an average of 100 pages of reading per class provided by the instructor and there will
be an expectation of 10-12 pages of papers, typically as 1- to 2-page papers for class .
Enrollment limited: 25.

tion's Capital Rules Committee.
ECON 11 Public Speaking
This course will help students become effective and organized public speakers, whether public speaking means
giving a class presentation, participating in a debate, or giving a formal speech before a large audience. We will
primarily use extemporaneous and prepared class presentations as a means of learning this skill, but we will also
study the great American speeches and presidential debates of the twentieth century for further insights into per-
suasive public speaking techniques. The class will provide a supportive environment to help each student create
his or her own public speaking style that is comfortable, confident, and conversational. We will also focus on
organizational techniques, handling visual aids effectively, eye contact and body language. Finally, receiving feed-
back and providing constructive criticism to other students in the class will be an important part of the course.
Evaluation will be based on in-class presentations, class participation, and a 10-page written critique of the stu-
dent's own videotaped presentations.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 10. Preference given to juniors and seniors.
Cost to student: approximately $25 for materials.

ECON 12 Negotiation: Theory and Practice
Life is filled with negotiations. Some opportunities for negotiation are obvious (for example, trying to pay less for
a new car), while others are only apparent once you know what to look for. In this course, you will learn how to get
more out of life by recognizing opportunities for negotiation and mastering the art of maximizing those opportuni-
Winter Study Program
­ 356 ­
ties once you've found them. You will learn how to transform your negotiations from haggling over price into
open discussions that create value for both parties; when it's wise to make the first offer, and when it's prudent to
let the other party state her price; a simple technique to appear open-minded and flexible while increasing your
chances of getting what's important to you; and many other strategies that will make you a more successful nego-
tiator in almost any situation. Before each class, you will participate in a group negotiation exercise. You will be
evaluated on the results of your out-of-class negotiations (whether you reach an agreement, and how favorable
your agreement is to your interests), your participation in class when discussing those negotiations, and a final
project.
The final project will be a critical analysis of a real-life negotiation using the principles discussed in class, and will
take the form of either a 20-minute class presentation or a paper of approximately 10 pages.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20.
Cost to student: $65.

ECON 14 Accounting
The project will examine the theoretical and practical aspects of financial accounting. Although the beginning of
the course will explore the mechanics of the information gathering and dissemination process, the course will be
oriented mainly towards users, rather than preparers, of accounting information. The project will include discus-
sion of the principles involved in accounting for current assets, plant assets, leases, intangible assets, current liabili-
ties, stockholders' equity, the income statement and the statement of cash flows. Students will be expected to inter-
pret and analyze actual financial statements. The nature of, and career opportunities in, the field of accounting will
also be discussed. The project is a "mini course." It will present a substantial body of material and will require a
considerable commitment of time by the student, including regular attendance and participation in discussion and
homework cases and problems.
The course makes intensive use of web-based resources. The course website will include required readings from
various linked web sites, additional downloadable reading material, required homework problems as well as self-
study material.
The course grade will be determined on the basis of several quizzes and a written group report presenting an analy-
sis of a company's annual report.

ECON 15 Stock Market
Elementary description and analysis of the stock market. Emphasis will be on the roles of the market in our econo-
my, including evaluation of business firms and the success of particular capital investments, allocating savings to
different types of investment, and providing liquid and marketable financial investments for individual savers.
The course will focus on the description of mechanics of trading on various exchanges and other markets, stock
market indexes or "averages" (Dow-Jones, S&P, 500, etc.), how to read the financial news, historical rates of re-
turn on stocks and portfolios, role of mutual funds, beta coefficients, and "random walk" theory. The course will
also involve a brief introduction to financial reports of firms and analysis of financial ratios.
The course makes intensive use of web-based resources. The course website will include required readings from
various linked web sites, additional downloadable reading material, required homework problems.
Each student will participate in discussions, do some homework assignments and, as part of a team, give two
presentations and write a 10-page report analyzing the wisdom or folly of having chosen a particular investment
portfolio. The course grade will be determined on the basis of performance on several quizzes and the written
investment portfolio report.
Not intended for students who already know much about the stock market.

ECON 17 Understanding Current Economic Issues
The goal of this course is to leave the students with an understanding of how the economy works and how it inter-
acts with financial markets. We will examine some of the critical issues facing the economy today, in light of
Winter Study Program
­ 357 ­
historical events and the instructor's extensive experience as a Wall Street economist. The class will explore the
dynamic relationship between the financial markets and the economy beginning with a real-time forecast of U.S.
Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
The course will build upon principles of both macro and microeconomics, but welcomes students from other dis-
ciplines. It will provide an introduction to the work done by business economists and will examine topics chosen
by the students. We will look at relationships between key economic variables, movements in interest rates, the
behavior of the dollar, oil prices and inflation. There will be class discussions of business cycles, credit cycles, long
waves and past stock-market bubbles. We will also have several invited guests from the Wall Street investment
world speaking on various aspects of the stock market.
The class will meet 3-4 times per week in the morning. Each student should expect to spend a reasonable amount
of time on homework, to participate in short presentations as well as in class discussions. There will be a formal
presentation to Williams faculty and others during the last week, supported by a short written report designed for
today's business audience.
An economic database, chart-generating software and a proprietary, statistical analysis program will be available
to each student on the Jesup computers. Use will be made of Excel spreadsheets, charts and PowerPoint.
Requirements: 3- to 5-page paper and presentation.
Prerequisites: Economics 110 or another semester course in Economics is strongly recommended. Enrollment
limit: 15.
Cost to student: about $25 for text and other materials.
Meeting time: mornings. Because essential concepts and tools are covered during the first week, all students are
required to attend the first class.

approach of academic research in equity pricing via a reading of selected papers. Students will then learn the best
software tools and data sources for conducting such research. Students will work as teams to replicate the results of
a published academic paper and then extend those results in a non-trivial manner. This course is designed for two
types of students: first, those interested in applied economic research, and second, those curious about how that
research is used and evaluated by finance professionals.
Evaluation will be based on a final 10-page paper.

ECON 25 The Political Economy of Social Cohesion: Lessons from South Africa's Miracle
In many developing countries around the world, political transitions face significant challenges. Elections are
sometimes postponed or stolen, or otherwise fail to meet the standard of "fair and free". South Africa's elections
since 1994 provide evidence of conditions under which better electoral outcomes can be achieved. While South
Africa has many of the fundamental characteristics sometimes associated with lack of political transparency--in-
cluding mineral wealth and high inequality, elections while fiercely and sometimes closely contested give way to
generally smooth political transitions. One hypothesis explaining this is the substantial progress the country has
achieved in meeting social and economic objectives, giving an increasing number of South Africans a real stake in
the economy while demonstrating the value of a vibrant political system.
When citizens believe all politicians are corrupt, they have no effective stake in the political process. However,
when they experience the concrete benefits of political change, they have an incentive to protect democratic pro-
cesses. This winter study project will explore South Africa's real but mixed progress in achieving socio-economic
delivery for the majority of its population. Since the first democratic elections in 1994, the government's social and
economic policies have turned around an economy that was in crisis. Development strategy has reduced poverty,
but slowly, and enormous backlogs in social delivery of housing, health care and education still exist. South Africa
remains one of the most unequal countries in the world, grappling with the costs and benefits of globalization as
the government embraces free trade and financial liberalization, yet attempts to implement policies aimed at re-
ducing poverty and improving social equity.
This course will investigate how South Africa's social and economic progress has contributed to political and so-
cial cohesion--and supported democratic processes. Through meetings with Parliamentarians and bureaucrats,
businesspeople and social activists, teachers and students, labor leaders and health care workers, the participants in
this course will learn about the challenges, successes and failures of South Africa's social development strategy
and the political implications. The unifying theme of this course explores how democracy legitimizes and protects
itself by supporting inclusive economic growth and social progress. The course will analyze how apartheid's
legacy has intensified this challenge, but how South Africa's lessons of experience can inform other countries
grappling with these political challenges. Using social and economic data, first-hand observation and meetings
with key stakeholders, students will acquire skills in evaluating the effectiveness of the government's approach to
Winter Study Program

socio-economic development and good governance.
The course will be co-taught by Professor Michael Samson and Mr. Kenneth Mac Quene, Executive Director of
the Economic Policy Research Institute. Before the trip, there will be a pre-travel orientation session which will
include an extensive background reading package.
Evaluation will be based on class participation, a 10-page paper and a class presentation.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 18. Not open to first-year students.
Estimated Cost to student: $3,485 (includes airfare, accommodation, meals, and other expenses).

ECON 26 Exploring Trade Justice (Same as Anthropology 26, Environmental Studies 26, Latina/o
Studies 26, and Political Science 26)
This course will introduce students to traditional and contemporary theories of international trade, including Free
Market and Fair Trade, in the context of coffee, the second largest commodity in the world. Students will read
theoretical journalistic accounts of the economic, environmental and social impacts of competing trade models to
evaluate how these models bring or inhibit the search for justice in trade. We will visit and study the organization
and administration of a fair trade cooperative, Cecocafen, in Nicaragua, and the students will have the opportunity
to pick coffee, experience the lives of coffee farmers and their families, and interview farmers as to the impacts of
trade alternatives on their lives. Upon returning, students will have the opportunity to create an awareness cam-
paign for local businesses and institutions concerning trade justice.
Requirements: Students will have a choice of a paper, a presentation to a community or other group, or an outline
of a program for trade justice activism.
Prerequisites: some coursework in economics, political science and international relations. The course should be
limited to seniors and juniors. Up to date passports needed before the course begins. Enrollment limit: 10. Prefer-
ence given to seniors, then juniors. Not open to first-year students.

ECON 51 Tax Policy in Emerging Markets
Governments in developing and transition economies need to raise tax revenue to finance critical public goods,
address other market failures and equity issues, and to avoid problems with debt and inflation. Even under ideal
conditions, figuring out how to raise taxes in a way that balances efficiency, equity, and administrative feasibility is
a hard problem. But taxation is especially challenging in emerging markets, because of the great difficulty in-
volved in taxing much of the economic activity there, serious problems with tax evasion and administration, and
the various imperfections in the economic environment in which taxes are collected. Taxes typically consume
between a fifth and a third of the proceeds of economic activity in these nations, and they profoundly affect the
incentives to undertake all varieties of economic activity. So in terms of economic growth and welfare, the stakes
involved in improving tax policy are potentially quite large. This class will build on knowledge developed in basic
public economics (Economics 503 or 205) or tax policy (Economics 351) courses to provide a more in-depth
investigation of the special problems involved in tax policy in developing and transition economies, and possible
approaches to addressing these problems. Examples of specific topics that might be addressed include: how vari-
ous approaches to the design of taxation affect incentives for both foreign and domestic investment; international
aspects of taxation; tax evasion; controlling corruption in the administration of taxation; how various opportunities
for tax avoidance and tax shelters affect the optimal design of a tax system; consideration of how the particular
conditions in developing and transition economies may affect the optimal structure of the tax system; options for
fundamental tax reform; case studies of the experience with tax reforms in various developing and transition econ-
omies; tax competition among regions and nations; and the strengths and weaknesses of the empirical evidence
that is available on these questions. Class will meet for six hours per week, and students will be expected to read
one or two articles on tax policy issues for each class meeting and to be prepared to discuss the articles in class.
Students will be evaluated based on short written assignments and a final oral presentation.
Prerequisites: one public economics or tax policy course (Economics 503, 205 or 351), and one empirical methods
course (Economics 253, 255, 510, 511, or Statistics 346). Enrollment limit: 19. This course is intended for CDE

ENGL 11 Singing School: Sacred Choral Traditions in the Berkshires and Beyond (Same as
American Studies 11 and Music 11)
This performance class will explore the history of popular sacred music in the United States, with a special empha-
sis on music that might have been sung in New England from the eighteenth to the early twentieth century. We will
begin by learning Protestant hymns by early New England "singing masters" (Billings, Ingalls, West); in this first
part of the course we will also explore Shaker and gospel/revivalist Protestant music of the early nineteenth centu-
ry. As we move forward in time our attention will broaden to other religious singing traditions that evolved from
these and/or that came into New England with new populations of people: what we pursue will partly depend on
the particular interests and expertise of members of the class. Our premise will be that this music is a valuable route
to understanding the complex religious and social cultures of New England. Outside of class, students will occa-
sionally be asked to investigate different singing traditions: this might involve reading in music and religious histo-
ry, as well as exploring old hymnals and listening to archival recordings, in part with an eye to selecting particular
pieces for interpretation and performance. Class time will be mainly devoted to singing. The class will culminate
with a concert, to be held at a local site where some of these hymns were once sung.
Requirements: Students will be expected to meet 8-9 hours a week (three discussions/rehearsals); during the final
week, when preparing for the concert, there may be one or two extra or longer rehearsals. In addition to participat-
ing in classes and the performance, students will be expected to work on one or two group projects (e.g., an oral
report on some aspect of the reading, the interpretation and teaching of one hymn to the class, or the working-up of
a small group choral piece).
Evaluation will be based on participation in discussion, the choral performance, and small group projects.
Prerequisites: Singers, conductors, and instrumentalists are of course very welcome; singers with interest in or
knowledge of a particular sacred musical tradition or style are also very welcome; but those without much pre-
vious singing experience are very welcome too, since we'll be simulating a congregation. Participants must, how-
ever, be willing to shout out! Enrollment limit: 25.

ENGL 12 Looking at Contemporary Documentary Photography (Same as ArtH 12 and Special
27)
This course explores the evolution of modern documentary photography. We will start with Robert Frank's The
Americans, and how Frank's singular vision deeply shaped the next generation of photographers working the
American streets and landscape. Diane Arbus, Bruce Davidson, Lee Freidlander, William Klein, Danny Lyon,
Gary Winogrand are some of the photographers whose work we will get to know well . Discussions will include
the new wave of independent and Magnum photojournalists (Phillip Jones Griffiths, Josef Koudleka, Susan Mei-
selas, Gilles Peress, James Nachtwey, Alex Webb, Ron Haviv and Tyler Hicks) and the wars from Vietnam to
Bosnia to Iraq they cover as well as the personal visions they explore. Insight into the diverse currents of documen-
tary photography will be covered through the work of Bill Burke, Larry Clark, Larry Fink, Nan Goldin, Emmet
Gowin, Sally Mann, Mary Ellen Mark, Nicholas Nixon , Richard Misrach, Joel Sternfeld, Birney Imes, Regan
Louie, Edward Burtynsky, Laura Letinsky and Simon Norfolk.
The class will meet three mornings a week for two hours. Slide presentations will occupy half of the first meetings
and give way to discussion of issues in documentary photography. Students will be encouraged to work on indi-
vidual projects of their own choice. Each student will be required to make a brief presentation to the class on a
documentary topic of their choice. A final paper expanding on this documentary topic will be due at the end of the
course. Students will be evaluated on their classroom presentation, general participation and their written work. A
field trip to New York will let us see first hand works from the collections at the Museum of Modern Art, Whitney
Museum of American Art and the International Center of Photography.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 12. Priority to upper class students.
Cost to student: $30 ( for NYC fieldtrip personal expenses)

ENGL 14 Write Now!
This is a creative writing course in what poet Robert Creeley called the imagination of procedure. Writers have
always relied on tricks to get words on the page, disabling those structures of mind and behavior that keep our-

selves from ourselves. W. B. Yeats and Gertrude Stein experimented with spirit writing and automatic writing,
Dadaists and surrealists invented games and methods that free unconscious expression under pressures of form. In
this course we will follow the constrained writing techniques associated with the Oulipo group ("ouvroir de la
littérature potentielle" or "workshop of literature-in-the-making"), including lipograms (writing that excludes cer-
tain letters) and the "N + 7" method (in which each noun is replaced by that noun appearing seven entries after it in
the dictionary). We will take a page from John Cage, using the roll of dice and the I Ching to build chance into the
creative process. We will play surrealist games including the exquisite corpse, echo verse, étrécissement (or "cut-
ting away"), dream resumé and time traveler's potlatch. We will read Stein's Tender Buttons (1914) and excerpts
from A Vision (1925) by Yeats and his wife, George; selections from Ludwig Wittgenstein; Raymond Queneau's
Exercices de style (1947) and Cent mille milliards de poèmes (1961); works by Harry Mathews and John Ash-
bery. Recent works will include Christian Bok, Eunoia (2001) and 99 Ways to Tell a Story (2005), Matt Madden's
graphic novel tribute to Raymond Queneau. For all our reading of theories and models, however, this course is
above all an occasion to write: often, copiously, joyfully.
Evaluation will be based on 10 pages of polished work gleaned and revised from reams of daily writing.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15. Creative writers in all genres welcome; poets priviledged in the case of
overenrollment.
Cost to student: none.
Meeting time: TBA.

ENGL 17 After Katrina: Memoir, Film, and Fiction
In 2005 Hurricane Katrina, and its aftermath--the flooding, the federal and state's bureaucratic bungling--led to
loss on a grand scale. Out of the ruins there has been an incredible and varied artistic response. Hundreds of mem-
oirs have been published, songs recorded and documentaries filmed. In this course we will explore the nature and
effectiveness of the art created in reaction to the wreckage. The first-person "witnessing"--the memoirs, historical
documentation, documentaries and journalism--preceded publication of fictional novels and stories. Such a tra-
jectory raises questions about the function of storytelling, the compensations as well as the limitations of narratives
that spring up immediately after such a disaster. What are we to make of the evolutionary process of creative re-
sponses to tragedy? We will explore the need to tell and the communal solace found in stories.
We will read 1 Dead in Attic by Chris Rose; Code Blue, A Katrina Physician's Memoir by Richard Deichmann;
New Orleans Noir, an anthology of stories written after the storm; and view Spike Lee's documentary, When the
Levees Broke: A Requiem in Four Acts.
Requirements: participation in class discussion, 1-page informal response paper to the day's reading each class
period, one final paper (6-8 pages) that draws from the assigned reading material, reveals a level of insight gained

ENGL 18 The Life and Works of Beaumarchais
Pierre-Augustin Caron de Beaumarchais was a court watchmaker to Louis XV of France, as well as an inventor,
court musician, businessman, spy, publisher, fugitive from justice, arms-dealer, and American as well as French
revolutionary. But to posterity he is better known as a brilliant and innovative playwright, the author of two dramas
and several comedies, most famously "The Barber of Seville" and "The Marriage of Figaro." In both Beaumar-
chais' life and his works, the cataclysmic events culminating in the French Revolution, as well as the deeper his-
torical shifts of this era, may be seen obliquely reflected. After several classes focussed on historiographic readings
to gain an overview of this period -- particularly of changing class and gender relations--we will study Beaumar-
chais' life, through biographies and a film, and his works; we may also look at the operas made from the Figaro
plays. All readings in English. Two-hour classes three times a week.
Evaluation will be based on a series of short papers totaling 10-12 pages.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15.
Cost to student: $25-50.
Meeting time: afternoons.

ENGL 25 Shakespeare on the British Stage: Understanding Performance (Same as Theatre 25)
This course will study a selection of Shakespeare's plays in the context of contemporary stage performance, cul-
minatiing in a 10-day trip to London and Stratford-on-Avon to see as many performances of Shakespeare plays as
we can . The on-campus portion of the course will consist of two weeks of VERY INTENSIVE study of the plays
to be seen in England--class will meet twice a day, in the morning and again in the afternoon. In the first week, we
will discuss the texts and selected criticism of the plays, working toward a broad understanding of major themes,
conflicts, and characters. Though the whole class will read and discuss all the plays, each student will focus inten-
sively on one play, and will be responsible for researching and presenting additional materials about it to the class.
Students will then be introduced to the basics of a dramaturgical versus a literary approach to interpreting a play, in
part through discussion and critique of films and filmed performances of the plays. Each student will then develop
their own dramatic interpretation of their play, and choose a key scene to direct as a representative sample of it, to
be presented to the class for discussion and critique.
In England, in addition to the plays, we will attend a specially-arranged workshop in the Globe theatre, and other
lectures, discussions, or backstage tours with theatre professionals. We anticipate seeing 7-9 different Shakespeare
productions, depending on what is available, supplemented by 0-2 plays by predecessors or contemporaries of
Shakespeare, for a total of 9 productions. Whenever possible, class discussion of the productions we see will take
place directly after the play, so students should not anticipate a lot of opportunities to explore London's night life.
Goals of the course:
1. To deepen students' understanding and appreciation of Shakespeare's dramatic works.
2. To give students practical, hands-on understanding of the different priorities and practices involved in literary
analysis of a play versus developing an effective stage production, as well as of the ways the two inform and enrich
each other.
3. To equip students to perform and articulate sophisticated analysis and critique of theatrical productions.
Requirements: Very active participation in discussion; two class presentations; direction of one scene; two 6-8
page papers due during the on-campus segment of the course, and a 3-4 page theatrical review due after we return
from England.
Prerequisites: 100-level English course or equivalent; further background in theater and/or Shakespeare a plus.
Enrollment limit: 15. Not open to first-year students. Students will be selected based on a written application and
interview, academic background, prior theatrical experience, and evidence of strong interest and commitment. En-
glish and Theater majors will get strong consideration but will not be guaranteed priority over other qualified ap-
plicants.

drawing. Students will spend time outdoors learning the ecosystem of the Williamstown area and time indoors
doing observational drawing, reflective writing, and reading and discussions of nature literature. The writing com-
ponent of the journal will be the equivalent of a 10-page paper. The drawing part will consist of ongoing entries
contained in a nature journal, to be displayed and discussed as part of the final project. Designed for students with
interests in environmental studies, natural history writing, and drawing.

ENVI 14 Green Design Workshop and LEED Certification Course
This course is a workshop in sustainable building design as well as a LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environ-
mental Design) certification course. It is being offered in conjunction with the Thoreau Fellows program, a project
funded by the Thoreau Foundation and co-directed by Stephanie Boyd of the Zilkha Center and Sarah Gardner of
the Center for Environmental Studies. There will be 10 Thoreau Fellows participating in a green design sympo-
sium in fall 2008. These students will be encouraged but not required to take this course. The course is intended to
introduce students to the basics of green design and will include a day-long workshop led by official LEED
instructors. The other classes will include guest experts and will expand upon particular aspects of green design to
give students a solid understanding of the subject that goes beyond the LEED textbook. There will also be two
day-long field trips to tour green buildings. At the end of the course there will be a trip to Albany, to the LEED
testing center where students will take the test. We expect many students to pass the test but passing is not required
to get a passing grade in the class.
Evaluation will be based on active participation in class, field trips, and completing the LEED certification exam.
Passing the exam is not required, since many do not pass the first time.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 10. Priority to Thoreau Fellows and Environmental Studies concentrators.

ENVI 15 Get Focused and Step It Up--Climate Change Activism
Students will learn about and participate in grassroots activism addressing global climate change. We will read
in-depth about the range of grassroots efforts with an emphasis on looking at community-based initiatives, politi-
cal action, and the use of the internet as a tool for promoting engagement around climate change. Grassroots orga-
nizing and activism have been critical in the U.S. given the lack of governmental leadership on this issue to date.
Students will be asked to think critically about which grassroots organizing efforts are most effective, and engage
intensively in an activism project. Students may work individually or in groups. Examples of a final project in-
clude staging a rally or educational event, creating a public service announcement, video, or public information
campaign, or conducting a research project (e.g, an observational study, survey or questionnaire) and using it as the
basis for an educational project such as a brochure or website. Class will meet twice a week for three hours. Some
course time will be spent on project work. Field trips, speakers, and videos will inform class discussions.
Evaluation will be based on a climate change activism project.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 30.
Cost to student: $50.

ENVI 16 Problems with Plastics
In this course, we will explore the life cycle of plastics, particularly plastic in the food chain, from the perspectives
of both public health and ecotoxicology. Our focus will be on endocrine disruption, the emerging toxicological
paradigm of low-dose interactions between our hormones and environmental exposures. We will explore potential
solutions, such as green chemistry, cradle-to-cradle manufacturing and the precautionary principle. Course re-
quirements include readings (which will be sent electronically), active participation in class discussions, weekly
hands-on activities (such as a waste audit), and one outside research project (which can be theoretical or applied).
No prerequisites. One goal of this course is to facilitate communication of complex scientific ideas across disci-
plines without sacrificing precision. Enrollment limit: 25.

ENVI 17 The Changing Forest
This field-oriented course explores (first hand and through readings and discussions) the history, ecology and envi-
ronmental stresses that affect New England's most abundant natural resource: the forest. An historical approach
to the region's forest communities will be taken: we will investigate how humans and the physical environment
have interacted to influence the composition and structure of forests across the New England landscape through
time; we will assess the current condition of the forest and consider what the forests of tomorrow may resemble
given current environmental trends. Specific topics will include structure, composition and dynamics of forest
communities, tree and shrub identification, adaptations, wildlife, threats to the forest, management and conserva-
tion issues. There will be three to four meetings per week, at least two of which will be outdoors (some field trips
will require students to be engaged in the class beyond normal WSP class hours). The course will culminate in a
two to three day visit to a more distant forest region. Accordingly, students should be prepared to spend many
hours in the outdoors coping with the elements.
Prerequisites: ability and willingness to hike 5 miles over rugged terrain in mid-winter conditions; a healthy inter-
est in natural history and the outdoors.
Evaluation: a paper, technical report or comparable creative work on a topic relevant to the course.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 10. Preference will be given to seniors.
Cost to student: approximately $125 (covers field trips, equipment, readings).
Meeting time: TBA.

ENVI 25 Sustainable Eleuthera: Energy, Environment and Economic Development
Eleuthera is an undeveloped and economically depressed island that is largely ignored by the national government
because of its lack of tourism and banking, which are the principle sources of revenue for the Bahamas. There is
little industry, a high unemployment rate (there is no official statistic but many claim that it exceeds 50%), and
much of the population receives public assistance. The island's advantages are its undeveloped beauty, remote-
ness, and friendliness. The landscape is clear blue waters, miles of pristine deserted beaches, and huge tracts of
coppice (forest land). There is virtually no crime and people wave at everyone as they pass on the road. Despite the
poor economy, Eleutherans are not as a group discontent and they love their island. (The national government
ensures that everyone has a decent standard of living.) But Eleuthera is poised on the brink of becoming a major
tourist destination: the Florida real estate industry has turned its attention to the island and calls it "the new Flori-
da." U.S. corporations are buying up land and planning mega-golf and marina resorts. Many island residents, aca-
demics, environmentalists and public officials feel under threat: they fear the onslaught of American tourism and
anticipate the attendant environmental and cultural destruction. The goal of this class, and of the Cape Eleuthera
Institute (CEI) with which the class is affiliated, is to develop and promote a model for tourism that provides maxi-
mum benefit to the residents and which is environmentally sound, culturally appropriate, and economically viable.
This is an experiential course in which students will learn the principles of sustainable development, will learn
about the ecology, economics, politics and culture of the island, and will work on a group project that develops
models for environmentally sound and culturally appropriate forms of economic development. Students will learn
about renewable energy and sustainable resource management (e.g. marine resources, agriculture, waste, water
resources) from the experts at the Cape Eleuthera Institute (CEI). They will also learn about the history, economics
and politics of the island in addition to going on several field trips to become familiar with the island, and they will
conduct primary research and collect qualitative and quantitative data through interviews. The class project will
focus on developing guidelines for environmentally sustainable economic development for the island. Our re-
search project is part of a larger initiative of the CEI, Freedom 2030, which CEI has spearheaded, in conjunction
with the Bahamas National Government. The goal of the project is for Eleuthera to become energy independent,
with 100% of the energy generated from local clean renewable sources, by 2030. Our piece of the Freedom 2030
initiative focuses on developing a model for low-impact, economically viable tourism (e.g.: sustainable tourism or
ecotourism). In addition to learning about these subjects outlined above, students will learn survey research tech-
niques: how to develop a research plan, design a survey, conduct an interview, and tabulate, organize and analyze
data. Prior to the trip, students are required to read "A Small Place," Jamaica Kincaid's first-hand account of an
Antiguan's experience of American tourism. On the island, students will be assigned some articles on theories of
tourism, such as "self destruct tourism" and "tourism as neo-colonialism." Students will also conduct their own
research on the socioeconomics and politics of the island during and after the trip for their contribution to the group

report, which will be submitted to the CEI.
Students will be evaluated on their class work, independent projects, and participation in all activities on Eleuthera.
They will also prepare and present a group presentation to the Williams community scheduled for February 2009.

GEOSCIENCES
GEOS 10 The Digital Darkroom (Same as ArtS 20)
The camera is an imperfect tool. Film and digital sensors record only a fraction of the range of tones and colours
the human eye can perceive, and today's monitors and printers can display only a small portion of the information
present in a well-exposed photograph. Digital processing is about optimizing the basic image for electronic dis-
play or print.
The digital darkroom allows the photographer complete control over his or her images. This course will demystify
its principles and practices by teaching the basics of digital image manipulation and optimization.
Students will learn what makes a digital image, and how the tools they use affect the image data itself. They will
learn about digital file formats and how to use their camera's histogram to ensure that they capture the maximum
amount of information from the scene in their viewfinder. They will also learn how to scan 35 mm slides and
negatives for digital post-processing.
Using Photoshop, students will learn how to bring out the best in their images. This can range from simple tone
and colour adjustments to complex layering and masking to bring out hidden detail or to maximize the aesthetic
nature of the print. They will learn how to remove dust and blemishes from their images. The basics of digital
printing and colour management will also be taught.
The students will produce a series of image pairs-processed images and their raw photo counterparts-which will be
mounted on a class web page. Each student will keep a journal recording the processes they applied and the results
achieved.
Evaluation will be based on attendance, participation and journal quality and completeness.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15.
Cost to student: $30 for books. A digital camera (with RAW capture mode) is suggested, but students may use a
35-mm film camera, and bring prints or negatives for digital processing, if they do not have a digital camera.
Meeting time: mornings for two hours, four times a week

GEOS 12 Landscape Photography (Same as Environmental Studies 12)
This class will broaden students' appreciation for the appearance and history of the landscape and teach the skills
of making a successful photograph.
Williamstown, situated in a valley between the Green and Taconic Mountains and bisected by the Green and
Hoosic Rivers, is a place of great natural beauty. The local landscape is a subject that inspires both professional and
amateur photographers alike. While Williamstown will be the subject of most of our work, we will use it to learn
principles of universal application. Students will discover the importance of light in making a photograph. They
will also learn camera skills and the mechanics of photography to make slides, which will be reviewed at biweekly
class meetings.
In addition to photographing and critiquing slides, the class will visit collections at the Clark Art Institute and
WCMA to see original work and examine and discuss books on reserve at Sawyer Library. An overview of the
history of landscape photography will be provided with an emphasis on American workers such as Carlton Wat-
kins, William Henry Jackson, Edward Weston, Ansel Adams, and Alvin Langdon Cobern. We will also demon-
strate examples of different cameras such as medium format, view cameras, and panorama cameras.
Students will produce a body of successful photographs/slides, which will be presented in a class web page.
Evaluation will be based on attendance, the student's photography and their presentation.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15. Priority given to first and second-year students.
Students will need a 35mm camera.
Cost to student: approximately $60 for film and materials.
Meeting time: three mornings a week for the first two weeks and twice a week after that; short field trips will
supplement the morning meetings.

HISTORY
HIST 10 The Justice of Violence
The Nuremberg trial of the major Nazi war criminals established a legal framework for adjudicating extraordinary
acts of violence in the post-World War II world. Indeed, the international court established at Nuremberg and the
adoption of the United Nations Genocide Convention and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948
signified the extent to which the victorious Allied powers sought to avoid repeating the flagrant missteps they had
taken in the wake of World War I. Their abysmal failure to devise an effective legal framework in response to the
atrocities committed during World War I and in its wake contributed to the violence, in general, and to the spate of
political assassinations, in particular, which were among the hallmarks of European interwar political culture. We
will read historical, legal, and philosophical scholarship in an effort to understand the history of politico-legal re-
sponses to genocide and mass atrocity--and the notions of violence and justice that underpinned them--in the
years leading up to Nuremberg and the creation of the UN.
Evaluation will be based on attendance, active class participation based on the assigned reading, and a 10-page
paper to be submitted at the end of the course.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20.
Cost to student: $50 for books and photocopies.
Meeting time: mornings; 2-3 sessions per week.

HIST 12 Reading Childhood
What books did you love when you were a kid? What books did you read over and over? Were there book charac-
ters you knew as well as real people? As adults, how does the literature we read as kids continue to influence us
emotionally and intellectually? How significant a part of childhood is reading? In this class, we will re-visit the
books we loved as children with children. Each college student will work with an elementary school student. To-
gether you will both read each other's favorite books and talk and write about them--and maybe do some illustra-
tions as well. As a class we will discuss readings on memory and the history of childhood, but your primary work
will be the literature you read with your school age reading partner.
Evaluation will be based on attendance at class sessions and meetings with your school-age reading partner, a
book list of recommended books drawn up by you and your school-age reading partner, book reviews co-authored
by you and your school-age reading partner, and two short papers.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 30.
Cost to student: none.
Meeting time: 1-2 formal class meetings per week, along with shorter meetings with reading partner, to occur
during the regular hours of the elementary school day.
LONG
HIST 13 The Historian as Detective
This course will bring students into close physical and intellectual contact with the papers of notable nineteenth-
century Americans: presidents, literary figures, and leading social reformers. Students will have a rare opportunity
to work with original manuscripts of people like Governor Thomas Hutchinson, Thomas Jefferson, John Qunicy
Adams, Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, William Cullen Bryant, John Brown, and Dorothea Dix, to cite a
few representative examples. All documents are part of the Chapin Library's manuscript holdings, and all work for
this course will be done in Williamstown. Research into any historical topic requires some knowledge of what
historical editors do and frequently calls for editing on the part of the researcher. It is detective work that begins
with the simple existence of a document but then turns it over, analyzes it, relates it, evaluates it, and finally draws
conclusions. In this course students will learn to transcribe a document accurately and to make sense of it as well.
In the first week daily classes will introduce past and present editorial practices and rationales and allow work on
more easily read Presidential letters. In sessions during each of the second and third weeks, additional points of
historical editing will be discussed, while work is done on somewhat more challenging letters in the William Cul-
len Bryant papers and the "reformer files" of the Julia Ward and Samuel Gridley Howe papers. Class sessions will
be held at the end of the fourth week in which students will present and discuss an important historical or literary
document or letter series each has earlier selected for editing.

HIST 15 The Great Depression: A Storied History (Same as Economics 19)
This course will deal with selected events of the late 1920s and 1930s from both an historical and a personal per-
spective. Through a blend of books, films, recordings, and anecdotal material--including oral histories of both the
lecturer and others--the course will seek to penetrate the mindset of those who lived through this terrifying and
bewildering but formative period in our history. For example, our examination of how a besieged Herbert Hoover
sought unsuccessfully to cope with the disastrous economic downturn will also consider the resultant cultural phe-
nomenon that developed along the rails in this country as vividly described by participants such as Eric Severeid.
Consideration of the explosion of acronyms that accompanied the Roosevelt Administration will focus not only
on the lifting of the nation's spirit, if not its economy, but on how tectonic shifts in the banking system effected a
middle-class family flirting with financial ruin. The successes and failures of FDR Administration programs will
be viewed not only as Washington envisioned them, but from the perspective of a child growing up with a class-
mate of WPA parents and of an actor in a freezing WPA Federal Theatre Project in a converted garage near the
shores of Lake Erie in the dead of winter.
Requirements: students will be expected to read substantial portions of The Great Depression by Robert Mc El-
vaine and Freedom From Fear by David Kennedy, to focus in depth on at least one of the subjects covered, and
will be encouraged to seek out and share oral histories from persons who lived through the Depression.
Evaluation will be based on class participation and one 10-page paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20.
Cost to student: $35-$50 for books and other readings.
Meeting time: mornings.

HIST 17 The Fight for Free Speech in America
There is nothing free about free speech. Although the First Amendment to the Constitution guarantees freedom of
speech and freedom of the press, these rights exist only to the extent that people are willing to fight for them. The
war on terrorism and the USA Patriot Act pose the greatest threat to free speech since the Red Scare of the 1950s.
But the censors are active in many other areas of American life: they challenge books in the public schools and
seek to restrict the content of radio, television and the Internet. This course will examine how free speech has
grown over the last century as well as the battles that are being fought today.
Requirements: regular attendance, class participation and a 10-12 page paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20.
Cost to student: $50 for books and duplicating.

HIST 25 Fashionable London: Clothing and Fetishism from Victorian Street to Westwood Catwalk
(Same as ArtH 25, Theatre 26 and Women's and Gender Studies 25)
Drawing on London's long history as a fashion capital--its museums, galleries, designer shops and punk
scenes--this course explores the role fetishist fashion practices play in shaping identity and subverting social
norms. Fashionable dress both reflects shared social fantasies and helps delineate gender; trends in dress serve as
barometers of sexual politics and push the boundaries of "perverse" and "normal." We will examine fetishistic
fashion historically, beginning with the corset controversy and tattooing in the Victorian and Edwardian periods
and ending with the contemporary sartorial statements of neo-gothic pierced hipsters in corsets and leather, and
motorcycle-booted punk street styles of recent years. We will read theoretical and historical literature on fetishism
and consumption and look at fashion magazines and plates from various periods to evaluate both the finery of
Savile Row and the subversive theatricality of Carnaby Street. We will watch films and explore London's neigh-
borhoods and museums as we discuss the sartorial dissent of personas like Oscar Wilde and David Bowie, and the
social politics of fashions by Mary Quant and Vivienne Westwood. Field trips to museums and other institutions
and stores, including the Victoria and Albert Museum in London and the Fashion Museum in Bath will enable
students to study corsets and other garments in paintings and original surviving examples. While gallery and ex-

hibition visits will provide intimate, tactile knowledge of historical dress and help us learn about textiles and con-
sumption (as well as the special problems associated with historical garments in museums), exploration of Lon-
don's clubs, fashion shops and street life will allow us to chart current fashion (and fetish) trends, as well as rela-
tionships among specific styles/looks, various forms of adornment, and identities.
No prerequisites (preference given to juniors and seniors). Enrollment limit: 10. Not open to first-year students.
Evaluation will be based on class attendance in Williamstown during the first week of the course, a journal based
on field work undertaken in London during the second two weeks of the course, and a 10-page paper based on the
journal.
Cost to student: approximately $1,825.

how males and females, specifically Latinos and Latinas, experience, navigate, and possess urban milieus. Work-
ing with ethnography, literature, critical essays, and film, we will consider how gender--as well as race and
class--is depicted, performed, and inscribed in notions of urbanity. Course materials include, but are not limited
to, fiction by Piri Thomas and Angie Cruz, and the films Girlfight and Raising Victor Vargas.
Evaluation will be based on class participation, class presentations, short research assignments, and 3 short essays.

LEAD 11 Justice and Public Policy (Same as Political Science 19)
The course will examine several significant public policy issues which have been resolved by the judicial system.
These may include affirmative action and other gender and racial issues, death penalty, free speech/obscenity, and
environmental issues. The focus of the course will be on the process involved in resolving the issues in the courts,
including the importance of the trial courts in that process, the competing interests involved, the public impact of
the decisions and, in most cases, the difficulty of resolution. Students will spend the second week in Boston where
they will have the opportunity to witness activities at the Office of the Attorney General for Massachusetts and
meet with representatives of the federal and state judiciary.
Requirements: 10-page paper/oral report and regular participation in class.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 10. If the course is overenrolled, students will be asked to write a short essay to

LEAD 12 The Presidential Transition Process: A Political Perspective
On January 21, 2009 the United States will swear in the 44th President of the United States. The peaceful transfer
of power is one of the hallmarks of our democracy...but what are the practical and political issues, tasks and con-
siderations facing the President-elect and his team. In this course, we will use the unfolding events of the Presiden-
tial transition to explore one important and public event to further our understanding of political leadership. How
does the new President incorporate political promises--to individuals, interest groups and the public--into the
key decisions of the transition process? What is the relative importance of issues and initiatives versus personnel
appointments? We will draw on guest speakers who have participated in previous Presidential transitions, follow
news coverage and blogs and selected readings to become engaged in the preparations for the inauguration and
beginning of a new Presidential term. We will also re-visit key moments in the Presidential election and look to
draw connections between those events and important decisions and developments in the transition process. Stu-
dents will be required to write a final 10-page paper which would serve to advise the new President on an impor-
tant issue of event.

LEAD 18 Wilderness Leadership
This Winter Study project is for students who would like to participate in an off-campus experiential education
opportunity. Students will be required to research an appropriate accredited program i.e. National Outdoor Leader-
ship School, Outward Bound etc., that will provide a suitable learning environment and be at least 22 days in
length. The Director of the Williams Outing Club will assist students in their search if necessary. Upon choosing a
program and being accepted, students will meet with the Director in a pre-program meeting in December to create
a framework for observing group dynamics and studying a variety of leadership styles. A required 10-page paper
based on their journals will be required immediately after their return to campus for the start of third quarter. There
will also be a follow up class to debrief the experience in the first week of February. All programs must meet with
the approval of the Outing Club Director.
In addition to off-campus opportunities, there will be a Wilderness First Responder Emergency Care course that
will take place on campus. Contact Scott Lewis for details.

LEGAL STUDIES
LGST 13 United States Environmental Law: Its Historic Roots, Its Uncertain Future (Same as
Environmental Studies 13)
Taught from the perspective of an experienced trial attorney, this course will examine the role environmental law
plays in the United States today in light of how that role has developed during the nearly forty years since the
modern era of environmental law began. As a preface, we will consider the significantly more limited influence of
environmental law in our national affairs before 1970 and some of the historical and political reasons for that situa-
tion. We will examine the reasons why the law's early application in the first half of the 20th century almost exclu-
Winter Study Program
­ 369 ­
sively to the conservation and preservation of natural resources took on in the second half a markedly different
approach, one emphasizing pollution control and all but ignoring resource conservation. This course will begin by
tracing the development of an American consciousness towards the environment through an examination of our
law and our literature. The term "law" includes state and federal judicial decisions and legislation, particularly
during the presidency of Theodore Roosevelt and during the decades which followed the year 1970 when much of
the legal basis for the American environmental protection movement was established. The term "literature" in-
cludes not just the written word (the first book we look at is "The Lorax" by your favorite childhood author, Dr.
Seuss) but also painting, sculpture, and music. Nothing too heavy! We will examine the historical and legal
choices we as Americans have made which have put our environment on trial. What has occurred in our develop-
ment as a people that explains this quintessentially American phenomenon? Our journey begins with the Puritans
of New England and the planters of Virginia and their predecessors in the New World and then moves swiftly to
the beginning of the modern era in environmental law and to its now uncertain future.
In light of this historical situation students will examine state and federal legislative and judicial attempts to ad-
dress environmental problems and then try to reach informed, rational conclusions as to whether those attempts
were successful. What were the political, social and economic issues involved and, ultimately, how did their con-
text affect the legal solutions imposed. Cases decided at the appellate level will be introduced and examined
through their trial court memoranda opinions in order to observe how the legal system actually works and how
frequently the reasoning behind the trial judge's decision changes as the case works its way through the appellate
process.
This course will be presented from a litigator's point of view, that is to say, both the practical and the theoretical,
emphasizing what is possible to achieve in the litigator's real world as informed by what the academician would
present from the security of the classroom. Evaluation will be based on attendance and classroom participation.
Students will prepare several short papers, including single page "clerk's notes," which will present one or more
sides of an issue and form the basis for classroom discussion. They will be asked to defend or reject the conclu-
sions reached or approaches taken by our courts and legislatures and by our literature, as broadly defined, on envi-
ronmental issues.
No prerequisites. This course is appropriate for students eager to explore the material presented and prepared to
argue assigned positions on important legal, literary and historical issues. Enrollment limit: 12.
Cost to student: Approximately $60 for books and materials.
Meeting time: mornings. 3 two-hour sessions a week.

LGST 14 The Work of the Supreme Court
The aim of this course is to provide a sense of the personal, theoretical, and institutional characteristics of judicial
decision making at the highest level. At the beginning of the course, all students will be furnished with a set of the
briefs for an actual pending Supreme Court case. Four students (two per side) will be assigned to make oral argu-
ments to the "Court," which will be composed of eight students, each playing a role of a sitting justice, and the
instructor, who will act as chief justice for purposes of coordination. After hearing arguments, the "Court" will
confer and prepare majority and other opinions and announce them in "open courts" at the conclusion of the term.
Evaluation will be based on the overall credibility in assigned role; effective argument, questions, performance in
conference, drafting, etc. and a 3- to 5-page "reflective" essay in which students will be expected to identify and
comment on some aspect of the work of the Court.

LGST 21 Creating a Non-Profit Organization
This course will provide students with the opportunity to learn how to structure a non-profit organization based on
a combination of class work and site visits to Boston non-profit organizations. The course will begin on campus
with classroom instruction and reading assignments on the laws governing non-profit organizations and the pro-
cesses for incorporating and obtaining tax-exempt status. The course will then move to Boston for two weeks,
where students will have the opportunity to meet with leaders of a variety of non-profit organizations, ranging
from small start-up non-profits to "venture philanthropy" groups to large, well-established charities and grantmak-
ing foundations. Possible topics of discussion with these non-profit leaders include preparing an effective business
plan, building a leadership team, fundraising techniques, volunteer management, program development and mea-
suring program effectiveness. During this time, students will work in teams to create proposals for new non-profit
organizations. They will prepare a mission statement, business plan, corporate documents and application for tax

MATHEMATICS and STATISTICS
MATH 11 The Hidden Depths of High School Mathematics
Have you ever wondered what is really happening at a graph's asymptote or why tests for divisibility work? Have
you always enjoyed those moments in mathematics when you can completely see why something is true? In this
course we will investigate topics in secondary mathematics from an advanced perspective. Often even apparently
simple topics reveal complex and fascinating nuances when considered closely, as they must be in order to be fully
understood. We will collaboratively investigate polynomial and rational functions, geometric justifications of trig-
onometric identities, and why such techniques as synthetic division, tests for divisibility, and Descartes' Rule of
signs work. This course is an opportunity for students of all disciplines to look again at some of their favorite
mathematics from high school and develop a more complete understanding of its inner workings. Each student
will select a topic for independent investigation. Evaluation will be based on class participation and a 10-page
portfolio containing the independent project and several shorter assignments.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 16. Preference will be given to students with a possible interest in a career in
teaching.

way, to restore the world view of those days.
We will work on a large wall mural in the Bronfman Science Center, with the vision of communicating ideas of
Winter Study Program

shape, pattern, and design appearing in mathematics. We explore site-specific artwork to see how lighting, posi-
tion, and the observer's viewpoint affects the design of the mural. Students will also gain experience by talking
with faculty in mathematics, studio art, and art history, along with trips to WCMA and Mass MOCA. There will be
full involvement in the project, from overall design to final construction.
Experience in any kind of mathematics is not expected. However, a strong visual imagination and artistic talent is a
definite plus.
The overall evaluation is based heavily on attendance, participation, and the overall project.
Prerequisites: Experience in studio art is preferred. Enrollment limit: 10.

MATH 16 Knitting: The Social History and Craft Form (Same as Special 16)
Creating fabric out of interlocking loops can be traced back to the Neolithic period, and knitted artifacts 1600 to
over 2000 years old have been found in Egypt, Peru, and Sweden. Knitting requires little machinery and can be
done almost anywhere yet requires a significant amount of learned skill. Knitting techniques have been handed
down through generations, shared in small groups, and transferred between cultures as trade routes emerged. The
social history of knitting in America is a rich reflection of our history of culture. We will examine the social history
of knitting through a sequence of readings and discussions, and explore knitting technique through a series of
projects. Our textbook is No Idle Hands: The History of American Knitting, by Anne L. MacDonald, and addition-
al readings will be handed out in class. We will engage in a series of project samples designed to introduce and
improve skills of beginning knitters, starting with simple washcloths, a knitted cap, and culminating in a final
project of felted mittens.
Evaluation will be based on mandatory attendance, participation, projects, posting and responses on Blackboard.

MATH 23 Gaudino Winter Study Fellows Program
The Gaudino Winter Study Fellow designation is available to up to fifteen students who create their own indepen-

independently under the direction of a faculty sponsor, who will help shape and monitor the project. The project
must receive approval from the Winter Study Committee, as well as from the Gaudino Scholar and Gaudino
Board of Trustees. The Gaudino Board is looking for projects that address specific intellectual problems through
direct experience, undertaken preferably in a social milieu that is previously unfamiliar or even uncomfortable to
the applicant. Projects must be academically rigorous and worked out carefully with faculty sponsors. Projects
should also entail systematic self-reflection on how the experiences affect students personally, and students may
be asked to discuss their project with the Gaudino Board after it is completed. The Gaudino Scholar will meet with
students as a group before and after Winter Study. All students whose projects are approved will receive the Gau-
dino Fellow designation. In addition, students on Financial Aid will receive Gaudino funding from a minimum of
50% to a maximum of 90% of the budget for the project up to $2,500, as determined by the Financial Aid office.
No additional funding for students' projects will be provided by the College. Students selecting this course will

STAT 13 Roulette
Roulette is a traditional and intriguing game, having its roots in 17th century France. It remains very popular in
Europe, where due to a slightly different design of the Roulette wheel it offers better odds than in the United States.
Part of the fascination for that game, besides its aristocratic feel, is that it allows for both small and huge wins and
offers bets at relatively favorable odds. This course takes a closer, analytical look at this elegant game. We will
study basic probability concepts to derive odds for various bets and learn how to use the free computer software R
to program and simulate various playing strategies. A statistical analysis will reveal what strategies suit your type
of play. A field trip to one of the casinos in the vicinity is planned.
Evaluation will be based on homework (49%), short quizzes (49%), and total chips at the end of class (2%).
Prerequisites: some basic exposure to computer programming. Enrollment limit: 15. Enrollment will be selected
randomly.
Cost to student: approximately $40 for transportation to and from casino. (Note: Some casinos have an age limit of
21.)
Meeting time: three times weekly (classes and computer lab) plus field trip.

American Studies 11 and English 11)
(See under ENGL 11 for full description.)
MUS 12 Opera Workshop
This course provides an opportunity for singers to explore operatic repertoire appropriate to their ability and voice
type. Participation in the course will help improve students' abilities to relate physically and emotionally with a
character, feel at ease on stage within the context of an operatic scene, and imaginatively and dramatically connect
to the music. Once enrolled, all students will be cast in scenes with their classmates. Students will then be expected
to prepare their assigned music outside of class, and to attend in-class rehearsals for their scene once scenes have
been cast. Musical preparation to be done outside of class will include research to the specific opera, role, and
scene, as well as a complete lyrical translation if the scene is in a language other than English. (Outside research
and preparation should require approximately 20 hours per week.) Students will also be asked to study two or
more video or audio productions of their opera and write a 3-4 page paper comparing each singer's portrayal of the
role they've been assigned. Evaluation will be based upon effort, attendance, individual progress, and the quality
of the singers' final performance. Participation in the final performance is mandatory. Class will be held twice for a
week for three hours, with each class session divided into rehearsals for individual scenes. Extra rehearsals will be
arranged if and when they are deemed necessary by the instructor.
Enrollment is limited to 12 students and acceptance is determined based upon live audition for course instructor.
Cost to student: none.
Meeting time: afternoons.

She holds a Masters degree in Vocal Performance from Northwestern University and has performed in operas with
the BASOTI opera company of San Francisco and the Aspen Opera Theater Center.
MUS 13 Math and Music
The course examines some of the myriad ways that mathematics can shape and inform the ways we think about
musical structure, and conversely, how music can instantiate a number of beautiful mathematical structures and
ideas. We will consider how group theory, number theory, probability and stochastic methods can offer insights
into the structure of musical systems (like tonality, and diatonic sets and scales), into the analysis of individual
pieces of music, and into the ways that music can be created and perceived. We will explore, for example, how the
mathematically unique properties of the diatonic set (the collection of tones that underlies the major and minor
scales) permit or give rise to tonality, whether other musical universes (those with more or fewer chromatic tones)
might exist that would offer the same riches as our familiar 12-tone universe, and whether and how computers can
be taught to compose meaningful harmonic progressions. For non-math types, musical examples will be used to
Winter Study Program
­ 373 ­
present all relevant mathematical concepts.
Evaluation will be based on a series of short musical problem sets, designed to illustrate relevant mathematical
concepts and techniques. Students will then work on a topic of their choice (analysis of a musical work, a com-
position based on a mathematical model, or on a speculative topic) about which they will write a short (ca. 5 page)
paper and give a class presentation.
Prerequisites: students need to be able to read musical notation. Preference will be given to math majors with
musical performance experience or students who have taken a music theory course. Enrollment limit: 12.
Cost to student: none.
Meeting time: mornings.

MUS 14 Folk, Popular, and Classical Cuban Music
This class will cover genres of Cuban folk, popular, and classical music and the impact that Cuban history has had
on Cuban music, art, and culture in general. Topics to be discussed will include; the African influence on Cuban
music between the 15th and 16th centuries, the contemporary coexistence of old African musical practices with
new musical manifestations now purely Cuban that has resulted, and Spanish influence on the Punto Cubano or
Punto Guajiro that flourished at the end of the 18th century as a family-neighborhood activity. We will also discuss
the strong bonds between Cuban music and North American music during the 20th century, and the connection
between folk music and the utilization of European techniques that gave as a result the danzon, the mambo, and
the cha cha cha, as well as multiple genres of the Cuban cancion (song). Other topics of discussion will include
how the combination of folk music/professional music imparts a dynamic to contemporary Cuban classical music
and Afro-Cuban jazz.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15.
Cost to student: none.
Meeting time: afternoons.

MUS 15 Music of Charles Mingus
Students will take part in an ensemble course primarily devoted to studying and playing the music of Charles
Mingus. Instrumentalists needed include piano, bass, drums, trumpet, saxophone, trombone, etc. as well as voice,
but all are welcome. In addition to performing the music, the course will give students an in-depth look at the life
of Charles Mingus as a composer and bassist. Each composition will be explored as to its structure and improvisa-
tional concepts. The focus of improvisation will be from an historical point of view (taking in the music of Dixie-
land, New Orleans traditional jazz, etc.) and will lead to collective improvising, using the Mingus Jazz Workshop
as an example. Music to be presented and performed will include: "Better Get Hit In Your Soul," "Goodbye Pork-
pie Hat," "Haitian Fight Song," "Nostalgia in Times Square" and "Duke Ellington's Sound Of Love." "Triumph
of the Underdog," a video by filmmaker Don McGlynn, will be shown and discussed. Evaluation will be based on
faithful attendance at rehearsals, classes, coaching sessions, and appropriate performances.
The students taking this course will be exposed to an African American jazz legend who struggled under the racial
injustices of our time. Students will learn how musicians lived, and how they functioned within the system that
they were brought up in. They will see how musicians survived on a highly creative level, and how perseverance
can lead to great things. These are all great examples to give the students of today. The story of Mingus is inspira-
tional and demonstrates pure genius. This is an opportunity for the students to feel connected to the past, and will
give them something to draw from in their own experiences. This is more than a music course; it is an inspiring
story of achievement.

MUS 25 Musical Performance: Cultural Exchange in Argentina
The Jazz Ensemble, Symphonics Winds, Concert Choir and Berkshire Symphony will be participating in this win-
ter study course leading up to a musical performance-based cultural exchange in Argentina.
During the fall semester each ensemble will prepare music by a wide range of significant Argentine composers
(Ginatera, Guastavino, Davidovsky, Kagel, Golijov, Piazolla and Gao Barbieri, among others) as well as music by
composers from the United States. Specially featured will be composers with ties to the Berkshires and, specifical-
ly, Williams College (Copland, Bernstein, Shawn, Kechley, Freddie Bryant, etc.) For the first two and a half weeks
of Winter Study the students will rehearse and refine this music on campus. In addition, they will attend several
lectures on the culture and history of Argentina. All students will have the option to travel to Argentina for the last
week of Winter Study (and several days beyond).
Section 01: for students traveling to Argentina:
On January 21 student performers will depart for Argentina where they will perform concerts, attend workshops
and coaching sessions, attend concerts and visit with Argentine singers and instrumentalists. Students will be re-
quired to keep a travel journal that records and reflects on their musical experiences in various parts of the country.
Approximate cost to student: $2200.

PHILOSOPHY
PHIL 10 The Art of Persuasion
Can't get a date? Need an extension? Parents fail to recognize your brilliance? Looking for a job? You need rheto-
ric: the art of persuasion. This course will be a practical workshop in the craft of speaking well. Students will
prepare, deliver, and analyze speeches, with the aim of becoming effective, powerful, and perhaps even brilliant
orators. Students will conclude the course by competing to persuade a distinguished panel of judges of a thesis of
their choosing.
Evaluation will be based on attendance, participation, and the quality of oral presentations made throughout the
course.
Regular class meetings will be held three times per week. A fourth weekly meeting will be devoted entirely to the
giving of speeches.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 12. Preference based on seniority and demonstrable interest in excellent
speaking.
Cost to student: approximately $50 for books.
Meeting time: afternoons.
DUDLEY
PHIL 11 Aikido and the Creation of Ethical Policy (Same as Political Science 11)
Aikido is a Japanese martial tradition that combines the samurai arts of sword and grappling with the philosophical
desire to manifest harmony in the face of conflict. As such, it addresses situations of conflict that manifest them-
selves physically, but also offers insight into how to prevent or redirect the energies--social, political, or psycho-
logical--that might otherwise become conflict in one or another aspect of our lives. By integrating physical and
intellectual components, the course seeks to forge in each student a more coherent perspective on the difficult
questions, broadly formulated as "How should we live?", that the study of Ethics and the challenge of Government
put before us. The course also seeks to provide an opportunity for students to live, for one intensive month, as if
they were 21st Century Samurai.
The academic component of the course will take advantage of the fact that a new administration will be moving
into the White House on January 20. Students will divide into 4 or 5 groups that will each develop a policy position
paper which attempts to bring ethically sound thinking to an issue of their choosing (such as Education Financing,
Nuclear Waste, Health Care, Middle East, etc.), a survey of the legislative opposition to that policy, an Aikido-in-
formed plan to frame the issue and overcome that opposition, and speech text to help establish our chosen framing
and generate an enthusiastic consensus. Obviously, which administration will be moving into the White House
will influence what issues we decide to pursue, and thus students will choose topics after the election (but before
January so as to have time to scout out Williams alumni in the incoming administration or Congress for feedback
during policy and strategy development). At the end of Winter Study there may be an opportunity to travel down
to DC to present the policy initiatives to relevant personnel.
The physical training (two hours daily in the wrestling room) will improve each student's strength, balance, pos-
ture, and flexibility. Everyone will also learn how to throw their friends across the room. About 25% of training
time will be devoted to sword and staff techniques.
Candidates need to understand that this course entails more of a commitment than most Winter Study options.
There is simply no other way to transmit and integrate the course's physical and intellectual components. Students
will be expected to want to immerse themselves in experiencing life as a (peaceful) warrior and as an apprentice
policy wonk. Additional relevant experiences, such as meditation practice, misogi, Samurai films, and episodes of
West Wing, will be an integral part of the course.
Students will be evaluated on the quality of their participation in both physical and intellectual course components,
and each team's policy output - position outline, policy prescriptions, framing plan, legislative tactical review, and
speech text. Students interested in the course should visit http://www.aikidokids.com/williamsaikido.htm before
registration begins.
Prerequisites: same physician's approval on file as the school requires to participate on sports teams. Students do
not have to be especially athletic, and in Aikido women train as equals with men. Enrollment limit: 20.
Cost to student: approximately $100 for uniform and wooden training weapons. $35 for books. Travel to DC, if
arranged, will be optional.
Meeting time: Aikido sessions 2 hrs/day depending on availability (typically 10-12 or 1-3) of the wrestling room.
Policy groups will meet on their own regularly, and for at least two hours each week with the instructor.

PHIL 12 Love: For and Against
Plato's Symposium is one of the most widely read texts in the Western philosophical tradition-a profound celebra-
tion of love and the source of our everyday understanding of "Platonic love." Freud too wrote about love; but his
story of love is certainly not celebratory. In this short course we will read the entire "Symposium" and excerpts
from various texts by Freud and compare the accounts of these two influential thinkers. We will conclude with
Laura Kipnis's contemporary polemic Against Love in which she offers a quasi-Marxist challenge to idealistic
notions of love and fidelity. Students will be asked to recommend films about love that are especially insightful.
We will choose two or three and incorporate them into our discussions.
Evaluation will be based upon contributions to class discussion in the form of presentations of short (2-3 page)
weekly papers.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 10. Preference will be given to Philosophy majors and students who have done
advanced work in Women's and Gender Studies.
Meetings times: 2-3 meetings each week (depending upon the week) and film screenings.

PHIL 13 Boxing
Boxing is one of the world's oldest sports, and there are 3000 year old artistic representations of boxing from
ancient Egypt. The history of boxing in the United States during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries reflects the
history of the nation. Issues of class, ethnicity, race, and gender have played a central role in the sport. Stories about
boxing also play a central role in the popular culture. In this course we will look at some treatments of boxing by
social historians, examine some depictions of boxing in documentary and dramatic films, and watch some classic
fights.
We will also learn some of the fundamental skills involved in boxing. Training as a boxer will give men and
women a better appreciation of the physical demands involved. Four days a week we will engage in an intensive
training regimen working on basic punching technique, footwork, defense and conditioning. The workouts will
involve minimal contact, but will be physically demanding. Students will need to purchase boxing gloves, hand-
wraps, and a jump rope.
Evaluation will be based on attendance, participation, and a 10-page final paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20.
Cost to student: $150.
Meeting time: mornings workouts; movies, discussions and seminars in the afternoon and evening
MCPARTLAND
PHIL 14 Science Fiction and Philosophy
Is it possible for you to be your own mother? Could you travel back in time and kill your grandfather, years before
your own father was born? Could a very sophisticated android fulfill the criteria for personhood? Should we allow
one to be punished now for crimes that one has not yet, but is predetermined to commit in the future? Is it possible
that you are living your entire life in an elaborate simulation? If you are in such a simulation, what, if anything,
would be wrong with that? These questions are but a few raised in works of the genre of science fiction. Authors of
science fiction use these questions, and answers to them, to develop compelling, and frequently illuminating, sto-
rylines. At their core, these stories exploit classic philosophical issues, and whereas the authors of science-fiction
raise these issues in a popular context, philosophers have long attempted more systematic investigation of the
questions and their possible answers in order to shed light on some of the fundamental concepts we use to make
sense of the world. In this course, we will examine some of the philosophical problems and paradoxes raised in
works of contemporary science fiction by reading from well-known novels, short stories and watching popular
films. Our exploration of the science-fiction literature will be accompanied by readings from classic and contem-
porary philosophers carefully discussing the central philosophical issues raised therein. The result will be a brief
survey of some classic problems in metaphysics and epistemology. We shall examine the nature of personhood,
the possibility of free will, the paradoxes of time travel, and philosophical skepticism and its implications for how
we should live our lives. Material will be drawn from readings by Philip K. Dick and Robert Heinlein, as well as
from the films The Matrix, Bladerunner, and 12 Monkeys.
Evaluation will be based on attendance, class participation, short weekly assignments, and a 10-page final paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 30.
Cost to student: under $75 for books and/or course packet.
Meeting time: mornings.

for lab 2 afternoons a week. Later classes will be mainly laboratory.
TUCKER-SMITH
PHYS 12 Meet the Right Side of Your Brain: Drawing as a Learnable Skill
Representational drawing is not merely a gift of birth or a magical ability, but a learnable skill. If you ever wanted
to draw, but doubted you had the ability or believed you could not learn, then this course is for you. This intensive
course utilizes discoveries in brain research to teach representational drawing. By using simple techniques and
extensive exercises you will discover and develop the perceptual shift from your symbol based left hemisphere to
your visually based right hemisphere. This cognitive shift enables you to accurately see and realistically represent
the physical world. You will learn to draw a convincing portrait, self-portrait, and still life. This course is designed
to develop your powers of observation and enhance your innate creative problem solving abilities, which are ap-
plicable in any field. Students need no previous artistic experience, just the willingness and desire to learn a new
skill. Students will be expected to attend and participate in all sessions. They will also be required to keep a sketch-
book recording their progress and complete a final project.
Evaluation will be based on participation, effort, and development. There will be an exhibition of coursework on
the final day of Winter Study.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15, with preference given to juniors and seniors.
Cost to student: cost of text and (approximately) $15 for drawing materials.

PHYS 14 Electronics
Electronic instruments are an indispensable part of modern laboratory work throughout the sciences. This course
will cover the basics of analog electronic circuits, including transistors and operational amplifiers, and will briefly
introduce digital circuits. Students will build and test a variety of circuits chosen to illustrate the kinds of electronic
devices and design problems a scientist is apt to encounter. Evaluation will be based on participation, completion
of both laboratory work and occasional homework, and the quality of the final project or paper.
Prerequisite: Mathematics 104 or equivalent calculus. No prior experience with electronics is required. Enrollment
limit: 16.
Cost to student: $50 for course packet and electronic parts.
Meeting time: afternoons, for a mixture of lab, lecture, and discussion, providing ample opportunity for hands-on
experience. In the last week, students will design and build a final project, or will write a 10-page paper.
STRAIT
PHYS 15 Livres des Artists--The Artist Book
In this multidisciplinary class, students will explore and explode the boundaries that traditionally define the ancient
art of bookmaking. They will step outside of traditional assumptions and preconceived ideas as the class explores a
mode of expression that is creative, graphic, sculptural and very personal. The first half of the course will explore
bookmaking and binding techniques paper decoration, drawing, printmaking (including monoprint, stamping,
photocopy transfers and transfer drawings) and book structures (such as the many variations on the accordion, the
codex, pop-up, tunnel, carousel and inventive), collage and creative writing in order to develop a plan for the cre-
ation of an individual artist's book, a multi-media expression of self that will be designed and executed in the last
half of the class.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 12.
Cost to student: $100 plus another $50/75 dependent on the types of supplies/paper/books that students end up
making.
Meeting time: During the first two weeks, students will meet every day in a studio/workshop like setting. The
second two weeks will be more open, allowing the student to develop and create their own artist book, with two
three hour meetings at the beginning and end of the week. Field trips to Chapin Library, MassMoca, and the Smith
College Museum of Art will be required and scheduled according to class needs.

POLITICAL SCIENCE
PSCI 10 Political Campaign Ads--Noise, Trash, or Democracy in Action?
American political campaigns have many elements, fund-raising, rallies, lawn signs, and much more. The focus of
this winter study course is on campaign television ads. Some have, it is often claimed, determined the outcome of
elections. Lyndon Johnson's famous 1964 campaign ad of young child plucking flower petals, shown only once,
or the Bush campaign's Willie Horton ad in 1988, are two such examples. The course will examine campaign ads,
and the research on how, why, and when they work. One of the charges often leveled against democracy is that the
people are easily seduced by clever and devious leaders, the power of rhetoric and images to mislead (among those
who have made this argument are Plato and Hobbes). What does it mean to delude or mislead? What does a
"good" campaign ad accomplish? Do campaign ads delude or do they educate, or both? Each student will write a
paper analyzing a campaign ad (or the ads used in a campaign) of their choosing.
Evaluation will be based on a 10-page paper, presentation and attendance.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20. Preference given to Political Science majors.
Costs to students: texts for course (under $100).

PSCI 12 Politics, the Press and Human Rights in Hong Kong and China
Drawing on the instructor's long experience as a print and broadcast journalist in Hong Kong, this class will ex-
amine the political and human rights issues that have arisen there, focusing especially on the period of time since
1997 when Hong Kong was transformed from British colony to Chinese Special Autonomous Region. What
kinds of rights of expression and press freedom were articulated and defended before 1997 and how have they
fared under Chinese sovereignty? Course work will focus on understanding the general political, legal and consti-
tutional situation in Hong Kong and analyzing specific cases of press freedom, censorship and self-censorship in
the post-colonial period. Comparisons and contrasts to the condition of journalism in the PRC will be made.
Evaluation will be based on a final 10-page paper.

will consider Sun Tzu's insights both in the context of ancient Chinese philosophy and in terms of their contempo-
rary relevance. The first half of the course will concentrate on placing Sun Tzu in historical and philosophical
context; the second half will examine how The Art of War has been used in a variety of modern fields.

PSCI 14 Women's Leadership in the Civil Rights Movement
African American women served in many respects as the true leaders of the U.S. Civil Rights Movement, which
for this course begins in the early 1950s and culminates in the late 1960s. Women played multiple and diverse
leadership roles, generally at the grassroots level, but occasionally, as with Fannie Lou Hamer, at the national level
as well as state-wide in Mississippi. We begin with teenager Claudette Colvin, arguably the instigator of the Mont-
gomery bus boycott; then look at Jo Ann Robinson and other leaders of the Women's Political Council who orga-
nized the bus boycott; next to civil rights pioneers Ella Baker and Septima Clark; then to l960s' activists Dorothy
Cotton (SCLC), Hamer, Diane Nash, Ruby Doris Robinson (SNCC), and NAACP attorney Marian Wright Edel-
man, who subsequently founded and led the Children's Defense Fund. Dorothy Cotton, MLK confidante and
SCLC leader, will give a guest lecture to the class on the MLK holiday. The course will focus both on the individu-
al leaders and on the complex phenomenon of black women's leadership in general, especially involving their
struggles against patriarchal norms and the special risks they took. The course will combine lectures with abun-
dant discussion, along with several films to be viewed outside of class.

PSCI 15 Infectious Diseases, Public Health Crises and Human Development
Compared to war, infectious diseases and public health crises have consistently accounted for the greatest propor-
tion of human morbidity and mortality. For instance, of the 50 million deaths recorded in 1990, infectious diseases
claimed about 17 million compared with 322, 000 from war. Through documentaries and scholarly work, we ex-
amine how infectious diseases and public health crises have impacted and shaped the course of human develop-
ment. Writers include Jared Diamond, William H. McNeil, Andrew Prince-Smith and Helen Epstein.

PSCI 16 Movies with Political Discussions of Elections, Evolution, Presidential Powers and News
This course features movies for a class discussion of the political content of each movie and its relevancy to poli-
tics today. The movies to be shown are: Inherit The Wind (a depiction of the Scopes trial otherwise known as the
Tennessee Monkey Trial) with a class discussion of the religious right's political movement to the present to dis-
credit the teaching of the theory of evolution); The Candidate (a story about a senatorial campaign) with a class
discussion of today's negative and superficial political election campaigns; All the President's Men (a dramatiza-
tion of Nixon's Watergate coverup), and Wag the Dog (a story of a fabricated war to cover-up presidential mis-
deeds) with a class discussion of President George W. Bush's run-up to the invasion of Iraq, conduct of the war,
and his constitutional use of presidential powers; Good Night, and Good Luck (the story of Edward R. Murrow, an
icon of broadcast journalism, taking on Sen. Joseph McCarthy) with a class discussion of the state of political
coverage by journalist today.

PSCI 21 Fieldwork in Public Affairs and Private Non-Profits/Volunteer Income Tax Preparation
This course is a participant-observation experience in which students work full-time for a governmental agency,
nongovernmental (including voluntary, activist, and grassroots) organization, or for a political campaign. Students
may find placements in government and nonprofit organizations in which their work involves significant involve-
ment with public issues. Examples include: town government offices; state or federal administrative offices (e.g.,
environmental agencies, housing authorities); interest groups that lobby government (e.g., ACLU, NRA); non-
profit organizations such as service providers or think tanks (e.g., Habitat for Humanity; Cato Institute); and grass-
roots, activist or community development organizations (e.g., Greenpeace or neighborhood association). In 2009,
students are especially encouraged to train and become certified IRS Volunteer Income Tax Preparers through a
special section of the course. The instructors will work with each student to arrange a placement; such arrange-
ments must be made in advance of the Winter Term. Students should first make their own contacts with an institu-

tion or agency. The instructors and members of the Political Science department are available to help students find
placements, if necessary. Each student's fieldwork mentor shall send a confirmation letter to the instructors verify-
ing the placement and describing the nature of the work to be performed by the student. Students will read a few
short articles distributed at the beginning of Winter Term and must agree to keep a journal, maintain weekly con-
tact with the instructors, and write a final paper summarizing and reflecting upon the experience. A group meeting
of all students will occur after winter study to discuss the experiences.
Requirements: 90 hours of fieldwork; satisfactory evaluation from the institutional sponsor; 10-page final paper or
equivalent; participation in final meeting.
At the time of registration, interested students should send a resume and letter of interest to Paula Consolini.

PSCI 25 Williams in NOLA
This winter study will give students a first-hand, community level understanding of New Orleans culture and the
impact of Hurricane Katrina, framed by an academic understanding of the same. Students will be in New Orleans
for the first two weeks of the Winter Study period. During that time, they will be involved in rebuilding projects in
New Orleans through Common Ground (a grass-roots recovery organization), Tulane's Semester in NOLA pro-
gram, or possibly Habitat for Humanity. Projects may involve demolition, rough carpentry, painting, landscaping,
or other manual labor in residential areas, or assisting in restoration of city facilities such as libraries, museums,
schools, etc.
Concurrent with the rebuilding/restoration projects, students will also participate in interdisciplinary studies (coor-
dinated through Tulane's Semester in NOLA) looking at New Orleans' culture, heritage, and geography, the
evolution of the city's pre-Katrina configuration, the events of Katrina's onslaught and its aftermath, and the politi-
cal, economic, and social impact of Katrina.
In addition to the exposure through their own work, students will have a tour/lecture on the construction and geol-
ogy of the levee system, and how and where it failed, and a tour of some of the area outside New Orleans proper,
where the storm alone (as opposed to levee failure) was responsible for the damage. Students will be given read-
ings from Breach of Faith by Jed Horne, One Dead in Attic by Chris Rose, and Rising Tide by John Barry, and
possibly other references, as well as viewings of Spike Lee's documentary "When the Levees Broke." Speakers
will include faculty from Tulane, a state representative from New Orleans, and residents of New Orleans, includ-
ing the Lower Ninth Ward.
Students will also have the opportunity to have discussions, both amongst themselves and facilitated by faculty,
about their experiences. When students return to Williams for the third of winter study, they will continue these
discussions and some students will do presentations for the class.
Written requirements and grading: Students will be expected to keep a journal during their stay in New Orleans,
reflecting on and (ideally) integrating their readings and their experiences. If appropriate, students may also choose
to develop a presentation to be offered to the Williams community early in the second semester.
Enrollment limit: 15. Not open to first-year students.
Cost to student: $1000.

PSYCHOLOGY
PSYC 10 Peer Support Training
Peer Support Programs are being implemented at colleges and universities here and abroad. The Psychological
Counseling Service is developing such a program for our campus, the Good Neighbor Program. Good Neighbors
will be students trained to offer support to others over a range of personal difficulties. This course will prepare you
to be an active listener, to help others feel more comfortable with social, academic, and personal relationships, and
to assist others in making decisions without giving advice. You will learn how to communicate about sensitive
issues and develop identity in the helping role. Emphasis will be given to learning one's limits within a given
situation, knowing when to refer to other resources, and what resources are available to students. This course is a
prerequisite for the Good Neighbor Program as well as providing broadly applicable helping skills that you can
apply in any interpersonal role such as Peer Health, Junior Advisor, or Baxter Fellow.
We will meet twice a week for 4 hour sessions. As a largely experiential training, most of the work comes in class,
but there will also be regular out of class assignments designed to deepen your understanding and practice of help-
ing skills.
Evaluation is based on participation, attendance (mandatory for the Good Neighbor Program), and a final class

Winter Study Program
­ 381 ­
chological nature is done, or in a classroom at Mt. Greylock Regional High School or at Williamstown Elementary
School. For the former, during the fall semester, students are responsible for locating their own potential place-
ments and consulting with the course instructor about the suitability of the placement before the winter study regis-
tration period. Students should provide the course instructor with a brief description of the proposed placement,
noting its relevance to psychology, and the name of the agency supervisor. Before Thanksgiving break, the student
must provide a letter from the agency supervisor which describes the agency, and the student's role and responsibi-
lities during winter study. For the latter (school placements), those accepted will work under the supervision of a
regular member of the teaching staff and submit a report on their work at the end of the Winter Study Period. This
project involves a four-week commitment to full-time affiliation with the school. Before winter study registration,
interested students should consult with Professor Zaki, Bronfman 300. She will assist in arranging placements and
monitor students' progress during the four-week period.
Evaluation will be based on a 10-page minimum final paper summarizing the student's experiences and reflec-
tions as drawn from a daily journal, and the supervisor's evaluation.
Prerequisite: Approval of Professor Zaki is required. Enrollment limit: number of places available at the two par-
ticipating schools up to a total of 20 in both placements.

REL 11 The Films of Ezzatullah Entezami
Most approaches to contemporary Iranian cinema focus on the great directors. This course will attempt to cut a
different line through that material by focusing on the films of one actor. No actor has been more central to the
efflorescence of Iranian film that Ezzatullah Entezami. He has worked with almost all of Iran's greatest directors.
From his debut film in 1969, Cow, (directed by Dariush Mehrjui) in which he played a simple peasant driven mad
by the loss of his beloved cow and the well-meaning duplicity of his fellow villagers to his riff on that role in Nasir
ud-Din Shah, Cinema Actor (1992) (with Makhmalbaf) to his more recent roles of old age including Twilight
(2001) and Judgment (2005) (with Masud Kimiai) his films have traversed both a personal and historical arc cen-
tral to understanding contemporary Iran. In this course we will view and discuss eight of his films, setting them in
both their historical and cultural context. We will meet eight times to watch a total of eight films. Students will read
selected articles on the history of Iranian cinema and prepare two page responses to each film.

REL 12 Create Your Life with Yoga
This class explores the multifarious yoga tradition to lay out resources and techniques you can use to create your
life. By integrating textual studies and personal practice, you take your place as a creative innovator employing the
resources of yoga. Analysis of classic yoga texts from India provides a historical, cultural, and philosophical back-
ground. Class discussions consider key yogic concepts and how they relate to contemporary life, and yoga practice
sessions explore how these themes play out, both on and off the yoga mat. Based on the powerful technology of
Anusara Yoga, you learn how to create your own effective home practice. As you gain familiarity with the basics
of human anatomy and receive individualized attention on how to work with your particular body, your practice
becomes even more effective. Creatively interacting with the yoga tradition can facilitate greater physical accom-
plishment and ease, prompt explorations of ethical dilemmas and philosophical questions, and reveal ways to re-
duce stress and optimize your energy. This class aims to provide an overview of the traditional and contemporary
dimensions of yoga, and to empower each participant to draw upon this tradition to manifest a fulfilling, life-en-
hancing personal yoga practice.
Required Texts: The Yoga Sutras, The Bhagavad Gita, Hatha Yoga Illustrated, and related articles.
Evaluation is based on attendance and participation in all classes and sessions, as well as a personal practice jour-

REL 13 Monsters and the Monstrous in Japanese Religion and Popular Culture
Monsters have long figured prominently in Japanese cultural history. In the earliest chronicles, Japanese emperors
did battle with giant spiders and married shape-shifting serpents. In medieval histories, wrathful demons attacked
the imperial palace, winged-goblins haunted abandoned temples, and ghosts infiltrated the bedrooms of royal con-
cubines. These creatures persisted into the modern era when nineteenth century tabloids reported the existence of
demon-foxes, giant serpents and cannibalistic ogresses. In the later half of the nineteenth century, monsters began
crossing over into the realm of fiction, but nonetheless popular novels and films continued to crawl with dark
beasts.
This course will investigate the role of monsters and the monstrous in Japanese religion and popular culture. We
will use a range of materials, including folktales, Buddhist exorcism manuals, short stories, medieval bestiaries,
woodcut prints, and films, to explore central themes, such as the connection between the grotesque and the erotic,
the problem of evil, the trauma of memory, the commodification of the supernatural, and the boundaries of the
human.
Requirements: participation, short responses and a 10-page paper to be submitted at the end of the course.
No prerequisites. All material is translated or subtitled in English. Enrollment limit: 19. Preference given to
Religion and Asian studies majors.

REL 25 Jerusalem: One City, Three Faiths, Many Narratives
Jerusalem excites the imagination, the emotions, and the spiritual aspirations for many people. An ancient city that
was the locus of holiness and conflict for one hundred generations still retains that description today. Through the
first half of Winter Study, we will engage readings, (primarily Karen Armstrong's JERUSALEM), class discus-
sions, and additional study, to prepare for travel to Jerusalem. We will leave Williamstown on January 11, taking
up residence in Jerusalem on Monday morning, the 12th, through Thursday the 22nd. Our study in Jerusalem will
feature many walking tours to various neighborhoods and historic sites, and will bring Christian, Jewish, and Mus-
lim teachers to present the complicated series of narratives that describe the mosaic of Jerusalem's three thousand
year history. Our educational program in Jerusalem will be led by Ophir Yarden, education director for the Inter-
religious Coordinating Council of Israel. When this course was offered in 2007, many students agreed that it was
"the most amazing experience of my life!" Further information available from the instructor, Cantor Bob Scherr,

The longevity and popularity of the Astérix comic strip series over successive generations of an international read-
ership can be explained, in part, by its subtle and penetrating rendering of Europeanism through caricature. This
course will examine some of the most enduring texts in the Astérix saga as interpretations, first, of French culture
and the way the French view themselves with respect to the rest of Europe and, second, of the way they view
Europe in dialogue with French cultural norms. Such issues as "la Patrie" (homeland), linguistic characteristics,
Winter Study Program

the idea of France, French provincial distinctiveness, France's view of a homogeneous national character seen
through its own cultural diversity, and the relationship of France to other specific regional cultures will be studied
as a way not only of defining the nation's historic legacy, but of coming to terms with the way it sees its place
within the vision of the European Union. Among the texts to be studied will be Astérix the Gaul, Astérix and the
Normans, Astérix and the Mansions of the Gods, Astérix in Corsica, Astérix in Britain, Astérix in Switzerland,
Astérix and the Goths, and Astérix in Belgium. Analysis of the primary texts will be complemented by secondary
cultural readings, especially those of Fernand Braudel and other prominent interpreters of French culture. Read-
ings will be in English, but those students who wish to read the texts in the original French should make arrange-
ments in advance with the instructor. Conducted in English.

RLFR 14 Formidable French Film: Contemporary Cinema from France, Morocco, and Québec
While the English word formidable means "difficult to deal with," "inspiring respect or wonder," or "causing fear
and alarm," the French word formidable signifies "marvelous," "amazing," and "extraordinary." This course pro-
poses to look at recent French film that is formidable in every sense of the word. From the cobblestoned streets to
the sprawling suburbs of Paris, from the beaches of Brittany to the cafés of Rouen, from the deserts of Morocco to
the snows of Québec, French-language cinema has produced a number of politically and culturally formidable
films during the past ten years. Many of the most dynamic films of the past decade have expressed the Franco-
phone world's growing concerns with the effects of globalization on such diverse issues as: immigration, educa-
tion, and employment; poverty, housing, and healthcare; sexuality, ethnicity, and family; the environment, imperi-
alism, and war. This course will center on recent film from France and the Francophone world which addresses
many of these current anxieties with great humor, emotional sensitivity, and political engagement. Among the
colorful cast of characters we will encounter are a recent college graduate, a primary school teacher, a seductive
stage actress, a platoon of young soldiers, a missing young musician, a frustrated young chef, a lovable truck driv-
er, a vengeful governess, a cabaret singer, a handsome young farmer, a fashion photographer, a motorcycling reb-
el, and a pair of French-American lovers in Paris. Our film discussions will be complemented by readings from
French film criticism, politics, and theory. Films to include Laurent Cantet's Resources Humaines (1999), Ber-
trand Tavernier's Ça commence aujourd'hui (1999), François Dupeyron's C'est quoi la vie? (1999), Agnès
Jaoui's Le Goût des autres (2000), François Ozon's Le Temps qui reste (2005), Jean-Marc Vallée's C.R.A.Z.Y.

After the arrival of cinematography in Mexico City in 1896, images of daily life in Mexico were seen around the
globe. By the mid-Thirties, the Mexican film industry was a strong producer of films. In this course students will
have the opportunity to view and discuss a variety of films directed in Mexico during the Golden Age (30's-60's)
and the independent period of the 70's by prominent contemporary Mexican film-makers such as Fernando de
Fuentes, Juan Bustillo Oro, Emilio "El Indio" Fernandez, Arturo Ripstein and others. Our discussions will be
based on the films themselves and how they portray the country's values, folklore, and approach to exposing social
evil at the time.

RLSP 16 Music Circus: John Cage and His World (Same as Music 16)
This course will explore the works, ideas, and influence of John Cage, possibly the most important American
composer of the twentieth century, and other composers, artists, and movements such as Fluxus with which he
was associated. Students will study his work through scores and writings as well as perform his music, create
compositions using procedures such as chance operations, and build and work with many of his instrumental in-
ventions and innovations, from the prepared piano to the amplified cactus. The class will conclude with a "Music
Circus," a multi-location musical performance using instruments, radios, organic matter, and found sounds, and
incorporating poetry, dance, and art, often simultaneously. This class is open to all instrumentalists, vocalists, and
composers with an interest in Cage, as well as students with a background in dance, theater, writing, or visual arts.
While the focus will be on Cage's music, students from other disciplines will be welcome to contribute final pro-
jects in their chosen medium. Class will meet three times a week with sessions divided between presentations,
discussion, listening, and rehearsal. Additional time will be required for practice and rehearsal outside of class.
Evaluation will be based on preparation for class meetings and rehearsals, smaller projects on class topics, and
final projects for the "Music Circus."
Prerequisites: Students must have a background in music, dance, writing, or visual arts. Enrollment limit: 20. If the
course is overenrolled, prospective students will be asked to submit a statement of interest and description of their

THEA 12 Welcome to the Dollhouse: Playing with Dolls, From Barbie to The Sims (Same as
Comparative Literature 12 and Computer Science 12)
Ready to play? This interdisciplinary course will explore how and why we play with dolls, ending with a creative
project in which students will design and construct their own dolls in either virtual or material form. From Ragge-
dy Ann and G.I. Joe to Cartoon Dolls and Mortal Kombat, dolls promote imagination in children but also encode
social and behavioral patterns that can remain with us into adulthood. How are these patterns established through
active play, performance and narration? How does doll playing reify or subvert racial, gender or class-based ster-
eotypes? What are the spatial or virtual habitations of dolls and how do they govern a player's behavior? How does
virtual doll playing promote the construction of alternative identities? We will study this topic through historical
research, web-based interaction, film viewing, active and virtual play with dolls, attendance at a local American
Girl Club meeting, and a field trip to The Strong Museum (National Museum of Play) in Rochester, NY.
Evaluation will be based on participation in all required activities, active reading, a 5-page "performance history"
paper, and a creative "doll making" project.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 12.
Cost to student: $10.
Meeting time: mornings.

THEA 14 Winter Theatre Lab: Advanced Scene Study
This course will focus on crafting a theatrical performance through the exploration of the relationships and person-
al engagement inherent in two person scenes. Texts will include Miller, Williams, Chekhov and Wilson, as well as
more contemporary playwrights. Classwork will concentrate on breaking down individual scenes and perform-
ances, embracing new perspectives, and developing the emotional and intellectual foundation that allows an actor
to "live" the given circumstances of the scene. The goal is to train and develop the actor's instinctual approach to
performance as well as his or her vocal and physical instrument. Students will be expected to do extensive text
work, and memorize and rehearse (with an assigned partner) outside of class. Students will also engage in basic
Meisner, clown and relaxation exercises as a group. Class will meet twice a week for three hours with additional
class time as needed.

SPECIALS
SPEC 10 Quest for College: Early Awareness in Berkshire County Schools
Today's extremely competitive higher education market places significant pressure on students nationwide to start
planning for college at an increasingly early age while simultaneously demanding ever-higher standards of excel-
lence for admission to top schools. "Early Awareness" initiatives aim to educate middle school students as to what
lies ahead on the college horizon, empowering them to make sound academic and extracurricular choices that will
keep open a maximum of options. The first week of this course will be spent in the classroom, exploring and
discussing problems and issues germane to the national trends towards greater (and earlier) college-related pres-
sures.
Students will respond to a series of readings dealing with such issues as tracking, paid test preparation and untimed
testing, early decision, parental and peer pressures, special interests, misrepresentation of information, indepen-
dent counseling, and others. Class time will also be devoted to familiarizing students with both the nuances of the
college admission process, visiting other higher educational institutions in Berkshire County, and learning how to
facilitate the early awareness game, Quest for College. Students will spend the next two weeks visiting 10-12
Berkshire County middle classes, administering the game. If student and community interest is sufficient, the
course may culminate in a public presentation and open forum regarding early college awareness initiatives.
Evaluation will be based on completion of field work (school visits), organization and a final paper (approximately
10 pages) reflecting on a course-related issue of the student's choosing.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 8. Preference given to a) students with prior experience working with middle
school aged youth, b) students who can be approved to operate college vehicles c) juniors and seniors. Interested
students must consult with the instructor prior to registration.

uals and organizations that develop innovative and systematic solutions to social problems. The focus of the
course will be on the following areas: (1) entrepreneurs, their motivations, skill sets, and leadership capabilities
and limitations; (2) innovative solutions that are either working or have promise to solve some of society's intrac-
table problems; and (3) various organizational models that are being employed to advance these creative solutions.
The study of these models will include the role of mission, objectives, strategy, and tactics as well as the challenges
and opportunities social enterprises face as they attempt to take their solutions to scale. We will discuss the various
Winter Study Program

SPEC 19 Medical Apprenticeship
Firsthand experience is a critical component of the decision to enter the health professions. Through this appren-
ticeship, students can clarify their understanding of the rewards and challenges that accompany the practice of all
types of medicine. Apprenticeships are arranged in two distinct ways: some students live on campus and are
matched with a local practitioner, while others make independent arrangements to shadow a distant professional.
The expectation is that each student will observe some aspect of medicine for the better part of the day, five days
per week. In recent years, students have shadowed physicians, veterinarians, dentists, nurses, and public health
experts.
A 5-page reflective paper is required, as is attendance (for those shadowing near campus) at three Tuesday evening
programs. Students will meet from 6:30-8:30 p.m. over dinner to hear from invited speakers from the medical
community as a stimulus to discussion about their apprenticeship experiences.
Prerequisites: Interested students must attend an information meeting in early October.
Local enrollment is limited by the number of available practitioners. Preference for placements will be given on
the basis of seniority and demonstrated interest in the health professions.
Cost to student: Local apprenticeships-vaccinations and local transportation. Distant apprenticeships-costs will
vary based upon location.

SPEC 21 The Psychology of the Workplace; a Field Study with Williams Alumni/Parents
Field experience is a critical component of the decision to enter a profession. Through this field study, students can
clarify their understanding of the rewards and challenges that accompany the practice of many different aspects
within a profession, and understand the psychology of the workplace. Field placements are arranged in two dis-
tinct ways: some students live on campus and are matched with a local professional, while others make indepen-
dent arrangements to work with a distant professional. The expectation is that each student will observe some
aspect of the profession for the better part of the day, five days per week. It is also expected that the teaching
associate will assign a specific project to be completed within the three-and-a-half week duration of the course
depending upon appropriateness.
Participation in this winter study will require the student to quickly assess the work environment, make inferences
about corporate culture, performance norms and expectations, and to take initiative not only to learn from this
experience, but also to contribute where and when appropriate. Understanding the dynamics within a work envi-
ronment is critical to success in any organization and this hands-on experience will illuminate lessons learned in
the classroom. Upon completion of the winter study, it is expected that the student write a thorough report evaluat-
ing and interpreting the experience.
Method of evaluation: It is expected that students will complete assigned readings, keep a daily journal, and write a
5-page expository review and evaluation that will become public record as a resource for other students. Finally,
the student will be expected to create a 20-minute Powerpoint presentation on his/her experience due at the end of
Winter Study. If possible the student will make a presentation to fellow students at some time during the spring
semester.
Required activities and Meeting time: The expectation is that each student will be in the field to observe some
Winter Study Program
­ 389 ­
aspect of the profession for the better part of the day, five days per week. In addition to observation there may be an
opportunity to work on distinct projects generated by the instructor depending upon appropriateness.
Prerequisites: interested students must attend an information meeting in early October, and meet individually with
John Noble to go over the details of their placements. Preference for placements will be given on the basis of
seniority and demonstrated interest in the profession of interest.
Enrollment is limited by the number of available teaching associates (maximum 20). Preference for placements
will be given on the basis of seniority and demonstrated interest in the profession of interest.
Meeting time: each student will be in the field to observe some aspect of the profession five days per week, at least
6 hours per day.
Cost to student: Local apprenticeships-local transportation. Distant apprenticeships-costs will vary based upon
location, but are the responsibility of the student.
Teaching Associates (instructors): Williams College alumni and parents of current Williams students will be re-
cruited to become instructors for this course. A broad range of professions will be represented as the course deve-
lops. Alumni and parents will receive a training packet and individual orientations with the course director in per-
son or via telephone conference.

SPEC 24 Eye care and Culture on the Atlantic Coast of Nicaragua
Continuing the model of recent eye care winter studies in Nicaragua, the trip will follow a similar protocol. In
cooperation with Ray Hooker, President of FADCANIC (The Foundation for the Autonomy and Development of
the Caribbean Coast of Nicaragua) who has assisted us in all of our previous course and certain professors of the
New England College of Optometry (specifically Dr. Bruce Moore, Dr. Nicole Quinn and Dr. Elise Harb) who
have previously trained our students in the prescription of reading and distance glasses and have accompanied our
trips, we are proposing a follow up course continuing our work of prescribing glasses and also the training of local
medical personnel to prescribe and distribute glasses as a sustaining project. In preparation for this proposed trip, at
the conclusion of our 2007 trip, we left approximately 2500 pairs of glasses and other materials and supplies in
Pearl Lagoon for future work.
After a partial week of classes on campus on the culture and politics of Nicaragua and a weekend of training in the
prescribing of glasses we would travel to Managua for a day of cultural visits (national museum, Masaya Volcano,
Huembes market). We would then travel to Bluefields to continue our work of clinics as well as training local
health care workers to prescribe and distribute reading and distance glasses. We would train and conduct clinics
around Bluefields as well as in Pearl Lagoon.
Finally we would travel to Corn Island and possibly Little Corn Island to conduct some clinics as well as some
training of health care workers. We would then return to Managua to spend the night and then return to the U.S. the
next day.
The course would conclude with the sharing of specific incidents and insights that were important learning about
ourselves and the developing world.

SPEC 26 Resettling Refugees in Maine (Same as Mathematics 26)
Sponsored by the Gaudino Scholar and the Gaudino Fund in 2008 and now again for 2009, this Winter Study
travel course will allow a small group of students to live in Portland, Maine for the month of January, where they
will explore the impact of over thirty years of refugee resettlement in the 'whitest' of the United States. Each stu-
dent will live with a refugee family from one of the over two dozen countries represented by the refugee commu-
nities of Portland, and during her or his home stay will encounter first-hand the issues confronting recent immi-
grants to the United States from Southeast Asia, Africa, Eastern Europe or Latin America. Students will keep a
daily journal to record their experiences working with their refugee family and the organizations that serve them.
Students will be exposed to such issues as race, ethnicity, and national identity; the interplay of public and private
values; the wide variety of educational, health, governmental, and religious agencies and providers serving refu-
gee families; and how these services are perceived and received by family members. Students will meet weekly
with the course instructor to discuss how their experiences are going; they will also have a chance to meet with a
group of refugee and international students at the local community college, and with some State officials serving
the multicultural communities. Students as a group will also have time in Maine at the beginning of the program
for an orientation session, and at the conclusion to share experiences with each other and write a short reflection
paper..
No prerequisites. If student interest exceeds the enrollment limit, preference will be given to those students who
demonstrate, in a short conversation with and essay submitted to the instructor, their interest in experiential learn-
ing generally and the problems confronting recent immigrants to the United States specifically. Enrollment limit:

SPEC 35 Making Pottery on the Potter's Wheel
Each class will begin with a lecture-demonstration, followed by practice on the potter's wheel. Each student will
have the use of a potter's wheel for each class. We will work on mugs, bowls, pitchers, plates, jars, lids, vases, and
bottles, and will finish these shapes as required by trimming and adding handles, lugs, lids, spouts, and knobs. We
will also work on several different handbuilding projects. After the tenth class session, all class work will be bis-
cuit-fired. The eleventh class will be devoted to glazing the biscuited pieces. Glazing techniques will include pour-
ing, dipping, layering, brushing, and stamping, and using wax resist and other masking techniques to develop pat-
tern and design. The completed work will then be glaze-fired. The last meeting will be devoted to a "final project"
gallery show of your best work. Woven into lecture-demonstrations will be presentations on various topics relating
to the science and history of pottery making.
Requirements: attendance at all class sessions and enthusiasm for learning the craft of pottery making.

SPEC 39 "Composing a Life:" Finding Success and Balance in Life After Williams
To be at Williams you have learned to be a successful student, but how do you learn to be successful in life? How
will you define success in both your career and in your personal life? How will you achieve balance between the
two? In short, what will constitute the "good life" for you? We borrow the concept of "composing a life" from
Mary Catherine Bateson, as an apt metaphor for the ongoing process of defining success and balance in life. This
course is designed: (1) To offer college students an opportunity to examine and define their beliefs, values, and
assumptions about their future personal and professional lives before entering the "real" world; (2) To encourage
students to gain a better understanding of how culture, ideology, and opportunity affect their life choices; (3) To
provide an opportunity for students to consider different models of success and balance through "living cases" (in
the form of guests from various professions and lifestyles); and (4) To aid students in contemplating their career
options through individual advising and introducing various career and life planning resources. Using selected
readings, cases, and guest speakers, we will explore both the public context of the workplace as well as the private
context of individuals and their personal relationships in determining life choices.
Requirements: regular attendance, class participation, field interview, and a 10-page final paper. Weekly assign-
ments include cases and readings from a variety of related fields, and some self-reflection exercises
