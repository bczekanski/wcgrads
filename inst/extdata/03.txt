HISTORY OF THE COLLEGE
The chartering of Williams College in 1793 was an act of faith and certainly an act surpassing the
modest intentions of Colonel Ephraim Williams, for whom the college is named.
Colonel Williams had not intended to found a college. Enroute with his regiment of Massachu-
setts militia to join the battle with the French and Indians at Lake George, the Colonel had tarried
long enough in Albany to write his last will and testament on July 22, 1755. In it he bequeathed his
residuary estate for the founding and support of a free school in West Township, where for some
years he had commanded a detachment of militia at Fort Massachusetts, farthest outpost of the
province. The will stipulated that West Township, then in dispute between Massachusetts and New
York, must fall within Massachusetts and that the name of the township must be changed to Wil-
liamstown, if the free school was to be established at all.
On September 8, 1755, Colonel Williams was killed at the Battle of Lake George. On October 26,
1791, after many delays, fifteen scholars were admitted to the free school in Williamstown. Within a
year the trustees, not content with the original modest design of the founder, were captivated by the
idea of creating a college where, as they put it, "young gentlemen from every part of the Union" might
resort for instruction " in all the branches of useful and polite literature." The proposal was extremely
ambitious, to be sure, but ambition was a common American ailment. England did not develop a third
university until the nineteenth century; Williams was the twenty-first institution of higher learning to
flower in onetime British colonies, the second in Massachusetts, the sixth in New England. On June
22, 1793, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts granted a charter to Williams College.
I
The bold decision to plant a college in the wilderness betrayed the intentions of Colonel Wil-
liams; yet the new vision had been fed by the same sort of dreams that had led Ephraim Williams to
see a school and a comfortable community where only a military outpost had stood. The early trust-
ees and the legislature of the Commonwealth were to be remembered for their foresight, but in the
decades after 1793 they had reason to acknowledge that the soil they had chosen was stubbornly
uncongenial--so uncongenial, in fact, that for many years the trustees of Williams spent more time
and energy in trying to close the College than in trying to keep it open.
In 1819 they petitioned to move the college to Northhampton, and in 1821, having been spurned by
the legislature, President Zephaniah Swift Moore took matters into his own hands. Convinced that
almost everything about Williams was impossible--its location, its funds, its enrollment--he led a
group of students over the mountains into the Connecticut Valley. There he became their president
once again, at the struggling new college known as Amherst. As for Williams, one member of the
senior class wrote home to his father: "It remains for us to say whether it shall die suddenly, or whether
it shall linger along for two or three years."
In the past the public had come to the support of the institution. A lottery furnished funds essen-
tial to the opening of the free school. A public subscription was the answer of Berkshire County to
the threat of removal in 1819. What saved the College in 1821 was the willingness of the Reverend
Edward Dorr Griffin to take the job of president and the determination with which he drew upon the
College's reputation for religious conservatism to collect much-needed funds. By 1828, the Rever-
end Griffin could be seen standing in the middle of Main Street, supervising the construction of a
handsome new building, housing a chapel, a library, and classrooms, a testament to his confidence
and his skill. The building is now known as Griffin Hall.
The College which had been taking shape under Griffin and his predecessors was not unlike
many other New England colleges where the classical curriculum and a moral atmosphere served as
the basis for training young men for professional life. The college turned out its share of clergymen,
doctors, lawyers, and teachers, serving the needs of Western Massachusetts and surrounding com-
munities in New York and Vermont. But Williams was not yet a place to which "young gentlemen
from every part of the Union" resorted. In fact, Nathaniel Hawthorne, attending the commencement
exercises in 1838, jotted in his notebook some observations on the Williams students he saw there:
"Country graduates--rough, brown-featured, schoolmaster-looking...A rough hewn, heavy set of
fellows from the hills and woods in this neighborhood; unpolished bumpkins, who had grown up as
farmer-boys."
History of the College
­ 4 ­
Williams seldom knew financial security until the end of the nineteenth century. But it did have
assets that enabled it to develop into a prototype of the small New England liberal arts college. Scen-
ery, a reputation for moral soundness, a loyal body of alumni, and a devoted faculty went a long way
toward compensating for inadequate funds.
Of the scenery, Thoreau remarked, after a visit in 1844, "It would be no small advantage if every
college were thus located at the base of a mountain." For Thoreau the location of Williams was "as
good at least as one well-endowed professorship."
In the early years the religious reputation of the College depended on the essential orthodoxy of
its presidents and faculty. It gathered strength from the famous episode of the "haystack meeting" in
the summer of 1806. Five Williams undergraduates, seeking to continue their prayers and conversa-
tions in spite of a sudden thunderstorm, retired from a grove of trees to the shelter of a nearby hay-
stack, where they were inspired to launch the great adventure of American foreign missions. The
extremely informal ties with the Congregationalists saved it from the sometimes stifling strangle-
hold of an organic denominational connection.
During a crisis in the affairs of the College in 1821, a group of alumni met in Williamstown and
organized the Society of Alumni, dedicated to the future welfare of the College. Their action gave
Williams the distinction of organizing the first college alumni society in history. Alumni loyalty was
rewarded when, in 1868, the College provided for official alumni representation on the board of trust-
ees, an act of recognition in which only Harvard, among American colleges, anticipated Williams.
II
But essentially the College has built its reputation around teachers and teaching. Mark Hopkins,
who was a Williams professor from 1830 to 1887 and president of the College from 1836 to 1872, has
become a symbol of this emphasis. In American education Hopkins pioneered in making the student
the center of the educational experience, and he did it so well that one of his former students, U.S.
President James A. Garfield, immortalized his achievement in an aphorism which has passed into the
lore of American education: "The ideal college is Mark Hopkins on one end of a log and a student on
the other." The Hopkins tradition has become one of the College's great assets. It has been perpetuated
in the lives of generations of teachers.
Scenery, a reputation for building sound character, loyal but not especially affluent alumni, and
devoted teachers could keep the College open, but like most other colleges Williams did not experi-
ence growth and prosperity until the closing decades of the nineteenth century. The scenery, of
course, remained constant, but it developed into an even greater asset as the United States became
more urbanized and industrialized. Williams was still a country college; a Massachusetts court de-
cision of 1888 declared that cows owned by the college were tax exempt. The discovery that busi-
nessmen could profit from liberal education sent college enrollments upward as the century drew to
a close; now more Williams alumni were men of affairs, fewer were clergymen. By 1906, of all the
colleges in New England, Williams drew the largest percentage of students from outside New Eng-
land.
From 1793 through 1870 the Commonwealth of Massachusetts appropriated for Williams College
over $150,000, a sum of such importance that Mark Hopkins himself observed that he did "not see
how the College could have got on" without state aid. A new and more dependable source of financial
support was developed as the century drew to a close. In the 1890's Frederick Ferris Thompson of the
Class of 1856 became the first of many individuals to supersede the Commonwealth as the largest
benefactor of the College. Ephraim Williams' original bequest of $9,297 has since grown by addition-
al gifts and bequests to an endowment valued at approximately $1.3 billion.
III
Williams moved into the twentieth century firm in its intentions to remain a college, at a time when
aspirations toward university status were unsettling many of the old colleges. It adhered to a curricu-
lum that was designed for undergraduates; it made room for the elective principle, but it subjected
course election to safeguards and controls. The idea of a liberally educated man was not jettisoned in
favor of the widely accepted idea of almost complete student freedom in course election. A survey of
the college curriculum in 1925 showed that Williams had combined the principles of prescription and
election, the goals of concentration and distribution, in such a way as to be the only major American
History of the College
­ 5 ­
college without any absolutely required courses and without any uncontrolled wide-option electives.
The Williams curriculum has continued to evolve, but it has not undergone such a series of major
overhauls as characterize curriculums inspired by the popular educational fancy of the moment. Not
having abandoned itself to the elective principle in the nineteenth century, Williams did not need to
rescue itself with the general education principle of the twentieth century.
During its long history much of the life and tone of the college was shaped by students. While the
same influence continues, the competitive pressure for admission since World War II has allowed
for a new and significant degree of selectivity on the part of the College. Among the consequences
of this change have been a quickening of the intellectual life of the College and a reconsideration of
traditions and emphases no longer considered appropriate for an institution of liberal learning.
Among the first traditions to go was compulsory religious exercises, abandoned in 1962 after a
hundred years of gradual but steady erosion. Voluntary worship in the form of ecumenical chapel
services and the activities of student religious organizations carry on another long tradition. In re-
sponse to the concern of undergraduate leaders and the faculty and in recognition of the failure of
Greek Letter Fraternities to fulfill adequately objectives consistent with college purpose, the Trust-
ees in 1962 took the first of a series of actions that replaced fraternities with a residential house sys-
tem. Williams became, as a result, a much more open community. The decision to become coeduca-
tional and the admission of women to Williams as degree candidates in 1970 have reinforced the
spirit of equality and freedom conducive to a climate of learning.
In this atmosphere of change and heightened purpose the curriculum underwent appropriate
transformations, as a careful comparative study of the yearly catalogues readily shows, leading to
the present 4-1-4 curriculum and a more flexible and wide-ranging schedule and program both on
and beyond the campus. Changes in the curriculum included the addition of majors and the
introduction of interdisciplinary programs, along with the expansion of language offerings to in-
clude full, four-year cycles in Chinese and Japanese. Continuing the tradition of putting the student
at the center of the educational experience, Williams in the Fall of 1988 introduced in each depart-
ment at least one course taught as a tutorial, in which, typically, pairs of students meet weekly with
the professor to discuss a paper, problem set, or work of art produced by one of the students. By
1992 some 40 percent of the graduating class had experienced at least one tutorial course either in
Williamstown or in the Williams-Oxford program, run in association with Exeter College, Oxford,
which provides each year for some 30 Williams juniors a year-long immersion in the life of Oxford
University.
This curricular expansion reflected, and in part resulted from, the fact that the makeup of the col-
lege community was changing to mirror more closely the growing racial, ethnic, and religious di-
versity of American society. The percentage of Williams students who identified themselves as
members of one or more American minority group rose to 25 percent; of faculty almost 13 percent.
At the beginning of this decade, President Morton Owen Schapiro inaugurated a strategic plan-
ning process, through which the College community identified priorities for change in the curricu-
lum and in residential life. The size of the faculty is being expanded to provide more curricular op-
portunities for students in tutorials and experiential learning. Requirements have been added in in-
tensive writing instruction and in quantitative and formal reasoning. New programming and struc-
tures are being added to student residential life and major projects are underway to greatly enhance
the College's student center, its facilities for theatre and dance, and its office and teaching spaces for
faculty.

MISSION AND OBJECTIVES
We are to regard the mind, not as a piece of iron to be laid upon the anvil and hammered into any
shape, nor as a block of marble in which we are to find the statue by removing the rubbish, or as a
receptacle into which knowledge may be poured; but as a flame that is to be fed, as an active being that
must be strengthened to think and to feel--and to dare, to do, and to suffer.
President Mark Hopkins '24
Induction Address (1836)
Our colleges will not be rich enough until they are able to bring the education they offer within the
reach of the poorest young man in the land.
President P.A. Chadbourne '48
Induction Address (1872)
Dedicated to the welfare of the great common life of the State, [the College] may not much longer
close its doors to one half of the community because of their sex, neither may it narrow its labors or its
sympathies to any class, to any favored few.
James D. Canfield '68
Centennial Oration (1893)
[Young people] now entering college, if given their biblical life span--and who knows what more or
less than three score and ten?--will be carrying responsibilities well into the 21st century...No one can
pretend to more than a guess at what they will then be called upon to comprehend. This much we do know:
that no training in fixed techniques, no finite knowledge now at hand, no rigid formula they might be given
can solve problems whose shape we cannot yet define. Nor have they time to waste in pursuit of transitory
expedients, the ephemeral, the shallow or the merely popular.
The most versatile, the most durable, in an ultimate sense the most practical knowledge and intel-
lectual resources which they can now be offered are those impractical arts and sciences around which
the liberal arts education has long centered: the capacity to see and feel, to grasp, respond and act over
a widening arc of experience; the disposition and ability to think, to question, to use knowledge to
order an ever-extending range of reality; the elasticity to grow, to perceive more widely and more
deeply, and perhaps to create; the understanding to decide where to stand and the will and tenacity to
do so; the wit and wisdom, the humanity and the humor to try to see oneself, one's society, and one's
world with open eyes, to live a life usefully, to help things in which one believes on their way. This is
not the whole of a liberal arts education, but as I understand it, this range of goals is close to its core.
President John E. Sawyer '39
Induction Address (1961)
The longer history of education in our own culture has been such as to suggest the openness, resil-
ience, flexibility and power of that age-old tradition of education in the liberal arts that at its best is
consciously geared to no less inclusive an activity than that of living itself...[And] no education which
truly aspires to be a preparation for living can afford to ignore the fundamental continuities that exist
between the cultivation of specific areas of specialized knowledge, expertise or skill (without which
we could scarcely endure) and that more fundamental and wide-ranging attempt to penetrate by our
reason the very structures of the natural world, to evoke the dimensions and significance of the beauti-
ful, to reach towards an understanding of what it is to be human, of one's position in the universe, and
of one's relations with one's fellows, moral no less than material. Towards that attempt we seem im-
pelled by the very fiber of our being. In its total absence, while doubtless we survive, we do so as
something surely less than human.
The history, moreover, of that most American of educational institutions, the independent, free-
standing liberal-arts college, witnesses forcefully to the power of that central educational institution
when wedded to the other long-standing conviction that education is not a process that can wholly be
confined to classroom, laboratory, studio or library, but one to which the diverse experience and richly
variegated moments of life in a residential community must all combine to make their particular con-
tribution. Extracurriculum as well as curriculum; play as well as work; fellowship as well as solitude;
the foreign as well as the familiar; discomfort as well as ease; protest as well as celebration; prescrip-
tion as well as choice; failure as well as success.
President Francis Oakley
Induction Address (1985)
At Williams, with a spectacularly talented and devoted faculty and staff, great physical and finan-
cial wealth, and the absolute finest students in all of American higher education, we are obligated to
Mission and Objectives
­ 7 ­
realize a vision of educational excellence worthy of our extraordinary resources. That vision undoubt-
edly involves the optimal use of new technologies to enhance the special relationship between a stu-
dent and a faculty member; the breaking down of departmental boundaries, fostering cutting edge
interdisciplinary teaching and research; a way to link more effectively the education that takes place
within the classroom with the education that takes place in the dorm rooms and dining halls and on the
playing fields; a program that allows our students to venture out into the world in ways that reinforce
their classroom experiences; and a commitment to redouble our efforts to educate our students in an
environment that reflects the great strength of our diverse society and to keep the precious prize of a
Williams education open to the most talented students in the nation regardless of family background.
We have never wavered in understanding that our mission is to provide the highest quality under-
graduate education possible, centered on an appreciation and indeed a love of the liberal arts. We can
build on that legacy. This is a time for Williams to set a new standard of excellence in undergraduate
education for an entire industry crying out for guidance. Let history one day note that our community
had the courage to seize the moment.

THE CURRICULUM
Williams College offers a course of study leading to the degree of Bachelor of Arts. The course
requirements prescribe both the number of courses to be completed and the minimum grade level to
be achieved; the curriculum also requires that each student explore several fields of knowledge and
concentrate in one. The full requirements for the degree include meeting the minimum academic stan-
dards stated below, residing at the College, fulfilling the distribution requirement, completing a major,
and completing the physical education requirement.
The academic year is divided into two regular semesters and a Winter Study Program. The student takes
four courses in each semester and during January pursues a single program of study on a pass-fail basis.
The Winter Study Program, which began in 1967, is intended to provide students and faculty with a
dramatically different educational experience in the January term. The differences are in the nature of
the courses, the nature of the learning experience, and the change of educational pace and format from
the fall and spring semesters. These differences apply to the faculty and students in several ways: fac-
ulty can try out courses with new subjects and techniques that might, if successful, be used later in the
regular terms; they can explore subjects not amenable to inclusion in regular courses; and they can
investigate fields outside their usual areas of expertise. In their academic work, which is graded Hon-
ors, Pass, Perfunctory Pass, or Fail, students can explore new fields at low risk, concentrate on one
subject that requires a great deal of time, develop individual research projects, or work in a different
milieu (as interns, for example, or on trips outside Williamstown). In addition, Winter Study offers
studentsanopportunityformoreindependenceandinitiativeinalessformalsetting, more opportunity
to participate in cultural events, and an occasion to get to know one another better.
REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR OF ARTS DEGREE
Academic Requirement
To be eligible for the Bachelor of Arts degree a student must pass 32 regularly graded semester
courses and receive grades of C minus or higher in at least 19 of those semester courses, pass four
Winter Study Projects, fulfill the distribution requirement, complete all requirements for the major
including an average of C minus or higher, and complete the physical education requirement.
Residence Requirement
Students who begin college at Williams must spend a minimum of six semesters in residence at
Williams. Students transferring to Williams from other institutions must spend a minimum of four
semesters in residence at Williams, and those entering as sophomores are expected to spend six se-
mesters in residence. Students are considered to be in residence if they are taking a program of study
under the direction of the Williams College Faculty. Students must be in residence for both semesters
of the final year.
The degree requirements must be completed within eight semesters, including any semesters for
which a student receives credit while not in residence at Williams. Thus, semesters spent away on
exchange programs with other colleges or on junior year abroad are included in the eight semesters.
Similarly, if a student requests, and the Committee on Academic Standing grants, degree credit based
on Advanced Placement scores, then these semesters are also included in the limit of eight.
Distribution Requirement
The distribution requirement falls into four parts. (Parts 3 and 4 DO NOT apply to the Class of
2003, 2004, and 2005.)
1) DIVISIONAL REQUIREMENT--designed to ensure that in their course of study at Williams,
students take an appropriately diverse distribution of courses across the full range of the curricu-
lum.
For the purposes of the divisional requirement, courses are grouped into three divisions: Divi-
sion I, Languages and the Arts; Division II, Social Studies; and Division III, Science and Mathe-
matics. A full listing of the subjects in each division appears below.
Students must complete at least three graded semester courses in each division. Two such
courses in each division must be completed by the end of the sophomore year. No more than two
of the courses used to satisfy the requirement may have the same course prefix.

whether verbal, visual, or musical, of a significant field of artistic expression. Students learn
how to develop the capacity for critical discussion, to increase awareness of the esthetic and
moral issues raised by works of art, and to grow in self-awareness and creativity.
Courses which fulfill the Division II requirement consider the institutions and social structures
that human beings have created, whether knowingly or unknowingly, and which in turn marked-
ly affect their lives. These courses are intended to help the students recognize, analyze, and eval-
uate these human structures in order that they may better understand themselves and the social
world in which they live.
Courses which fulfill the Division III requirement are intended to provide some of the factual
and methodological knowledge needed to be an informed citizen in a world deeply influenced by
scientific thought and technological accomplishment, and to cultivate skill in exact and quantita-
tive reasoning.
Courses with the following designations receive divisional distribution credit as indicated:

2) PEOPLES AND CULTURES REQUIREMENT-- intended to help students to begin to un-
derstand the cultural diversity of American society and the world at large, so that, as citizens of
an increasingly interconnected world, they may become better able to respond sensitively and
intelligently to peoples of varied social backgrounds and cultural frameworks. Courses which
fulfill this requirement are thus designed to familiarize students with some dimension of
American cultural diversity or that of the non-Western world. Each student must complete one
graded semester course primarily concerned with: (a) the peoples and cultures of North Amer-
ica that trace their origins to Africa, Asia, Latin America, Oceania, or the Caribbean; Native
American peoples and cultures; or (b) the peoples and cultures of Africa, Asia, Latin America,
Oceania, or the Caribbean. Although this course, which may be counted toward the divisional
distribution requirement, may be completed any semester before graduation, students are
urged to complete the course by the end of the sophomore year.
Courses that may be used to meet the requirement in peoples and cultures are marked with an
asterisk after the title. A list of courses offered in 2002-2003 which meet the requirement is on
pages 317-321.
3) QUANTITATIVE/FORMAL REASONING REQUIREMENT--intended to help students
become adept at reasoning mathematically and abstractly. The ability to apply a formal meth-
od to reach conclusions, to use numbers comfortably, and to employ the research tools neces-
sary to analyze data lessen barriers to carrying out professional and economic roles. Beginning
with the Class of 2006, prior to their senior year, all students must satisfactorily complete a
Quantitative/Formal Reasoning (QFR) course--those marked with a "(Q)." Students requir-
ing extra assistance (as assessed during First Days) are normally placed into Mathematics
100/101, which is to be taken before fulfilling the QFR requirement.
The hallmarks of a QFR course are the representation of facts in a language of mathematical
symbols and the use of formal rules to obtain a determinate answer. Primary evaluation in
these courses is based on multistep mathematical, statistical, or logical inference (as opposed
to descriptive answers). A list of courses offered in 2002-2003 which meet the requirement is
on page 320.
4) WRITING REQUIREMENT--Beginning with the Class of 2006, all students are required to
take two writing-intensive courses: one by the end of the sophomore year and one by the end of
the junior year. Students will benefit most from writing-intensive courses by taking them early
in their college careers and are therefore strongly encouraged to complete the requirement by
the end of the sophomore year. Courses designated as "writing intensive"--those marked with
a "(W)"--stress the process of learning to write effectively. Such courses include a substantial
amount of writing (a minimum of 20 pages), usually divided into several discrete assignments.
Instructors pay close attention to matters of style and argumentation. Enrollments are limited
to 19. A list of courses offered in 2002-2003 which meet the requirement is on page 323.

Major Requirement
The Major Requirement is designed to assure that all Williams undergraduates will have the experi-
ence of disciplined and cumulative study, carried on over an extended period of time, in some impor-
tant field of intellectual inquiry. Juniors are required to declare a major field of concentration; the actu-
al selection of a major is normally made at the time of registration in the spring of the sophomore year.
Major Fields
Majors are offered in the following fields:
American Studies History
Anthropology Japanese
Art Literary Studies
Asian Studies Mathematics
Astronomy Music
Astrophysics Philosophy
Biology Physics
Chemistry Political Economy
Chinese Political Science
Classics (Greek, Latin) Psychology
Comparative Literature Religion
Computer Science Russian
Economics Russian
English Spanish
French Theatre
Geosciences Women's and Gender Studies
German
General Structure of Majors
1) A student ordinarily must elect at least nine semester courses in his or her major field. A particu-
lar major may also require an additional course and/or one Winter Study Project during the junior or
senior year.
A student may also fulfill the minimum requirements for a major by taking eight semester courses
in the major field and two semester courses, approved by a major advisor, in associated fields. In inter-
departmental majors, such as Political Economy, a larger number of courses may be required.
2) A prescribed sequence of courses, supplemented by parallel courses, and including a major
seminar, is required in some major fields. Other majors ask the student to plan a sequence of elective
courses, including advanced work building on elementary courses in the field, and ending in a one- or
two- semester faculty-organized course or project in the senior year. All majors provide a system of
counseling to help students plan programs reflecting individual interests as well as disciplined and
cumulative patterns of inquiry.
Courses in many major programs require prerequisite courses in related areas. A full description of
the detailed structure of each major is found under the heading of that major in the section, "Courses of
Instruction."
Contract Major
Students who wish to undertake the coherent study of an interdisciplinary subject not covered by a
regularly offered major may propose to be contract majors. Procedures for arranging a contract major
and for honors work in such a major are described in the section, "Courses of Instruction." Students
interested in this option should begin consulting with the Dean's Office and with potential faculty ad-
visors early in the sophomore year. A student completing a contract major may not do so in conjunc-
tion with a second major. For further details, see page 136.
Double Major
A student may complete two majors with the permission of each major department and the Com-
mittee on Academic Standing. Although a student may be granted permission to use a course from
one major to fulfill a particular requirement in the other, the student nevertheless must take the mini-
mum number of courses in each field without counting any course twice. A student may be a candi-
date for Honors in either or both of the majors, but a course for Honors in one major may not be used
for an Honors course in the other.
The Curriculum
­ 12 ­
Co-ordinate Programs Offering Concentrations
In addition to majoring in a field, a student may choose to concentrate elective courses on a single
topic or area. Normally, a student declares a concentration at the time of registration in the spring of
the sophomore year. Concentrations are offered in the following programs:
African and Middle-Eastern Studies
African-American Studies
Biochemistry and Molecular Biology
Cognitive Science
Environmental Studies
Legal Studies
Neuroscience
Science and Technology Studies
Women's and Gender Studies (A concentration in Women's and Gender Studies will be avail-
able to the Class of 2003; beginning with the Class of 2004, students will be eligible to major
in Women's and Gender Studies.)
Descriptions of such possible co-ordinate programs appear under the appropriate heading in this
publication. If the co-ordinate program courses are directly related to the major, a student may be
allowed to reduce the number of courses required to complete the major.
Co-ordinate Programs
A number of programs do not formally offer concentrations, but do provide students with the
opportunity to work in areas that cut across departmental and program lines. These are: Jewish
Studies, Latin-American Studies, Leadership Studies, Materials Science Studies, and Performance
Studies. They are listed in this publication in alphabetical order.
These programs provide educational guidance only, and will not appear on a student's transcript.
Certificate in European Languages
Students may pursue a Certificate in three European languages offered at Williams (German, Rus-
sian, and Spanish). The program certifies a particular degree of proficiency, cultural literacy, and ex-
perience with the language in the context of one's college education. In order to gain the proficiency
and experience certified by the program, students must have taken a) at least five semesters of college
language (or the equivalent) and b) a standardized proficiency test administered by the departments.
In addition, students are required to gain familiarity with the culture in question by taking at least one
course each in a) the literature, music, art, or philosophy, and b) the history, economics, or politics of
the cultural area. Students must take seven courses altogether, up to two of which may be taken
abroad. Please refer to the respective language programs for details on the specific certificates.
Physical Education Requirement
The Physical Education requirement provides students the opportunity of establishing and main-
taining a general level of fitness and well-being; of developing abilities in carry-over activities; of
discovering and extending their own physical capabilities; and of developing skills in activities with
survival implications, such as swimming, life saving, and water safety.
A swim test is required of all first-year students at the start of the academic year. Students who fail
to complete the test must pass a basic swim course given in the Physical Education program during the
first quarter of the year.
Students must complete four quarters of physical education by the end of the sophomore year un-
less excused by the Dean of the College and the Director of Health. Students must enroll in at least two
different activities in fulfilling the requirement.
Participation in a fall or spring intercollegiate sport is equivalent to two activity units and participa-
tion in a winter sport is equivalent to three units. A maximum of three credits may be attained while
participating in intercollegiate sports with the exception of a two sport athlete who can fulfill the
physical education requirement by totaling four units in two sports. Students may receive a maximum
of two activity units for participation in a club sport; the remaining two units must come from the
physical education activity program.

ADDITIONAL CURRICULAR OPPORTUNITIES
Advanced Placement
At the discretion of the appropriate departments, students presenting satisfactory scores in Ad-
vanced Placement tests may be placed in advanced courses not regularly open to them, may receive
course credit toward the major, and/or may receive course credit toward the degree. A.P. credit, if
granted, can be used as a prerequisite; in partial fulfillment of the major requirement; and (if in two or
more subjects) for acceleration, i.e., completion of the degree in fewer than four years. A.P. credit
cannot be used to reduce the normal course load of any semester, to make up a deficiency incurred at
Williams, or to satisfy the Distribution Requirement.
The Critical Reasoning and Analytical Skills (CRAAS) Initiative
To one degree or another, every class at Williams goes beyond its subject--be it mathematics,
Machiavelli, or modernism--to teach intellectual skills that have wide application in other fields as
well as outside of the academy: scientific reckoning, expository writing, rhetorical analysis, oral
presentation, and so on.
Courses offered under the CRAAS initiative foreground such analytical skills. While each CRAAS
class covers a different topic, all are aimed particularly at developing the processes necessary for ex-
cellence in a range of fields: techniques for analyzing ideas, data, texts or artworks; approaches to
interpreting, synthesizing, and developing arguments; strategies for presenting ideas and results.
CRAAS classes typically emphasize the practices of meta-analysis--self-criticism, editing, and
revision--with the goal of constant improvement. Many classes feature peer tutoring, small group
work, and intensive one-on-one engagement with the professor. Students should leave a CRAAS
course with a substantially heightened ability to approach problems, analyze texts, and craft argu-
ments in whatever discipline they may go on to explore.
A few CRAAS courses are restricted to advanced students, but the majority are open to all, and
some are specifically targeted for first year students. Most have strictly limited enrollment. Because
these classes cultivate the general strategies of effective scholarship, students are encouraged to
consider taking a CRAAS course early in their academic careers.
A list of CRAAS courses offered in 2002-2003 is on page 316.
Independent Study
When a particularly able student wishes to pursue the study of a subject not covered by the normal
course offerings of the College, arrangements may be made for him or her to undertake courses of
independent study under faculty supervision. Arrangements for independent study are made with the
appropriate department at the time of registration.
Student-Initiated Courses
A Student-Initiated Course is one proposed and organized by students and sponsored by the Interdepart-
mental Program for Experimental and Cross-Disciplinary Studies. In such courses, the students carry a
heavy burden of the leadership in proposing requirements, selecting material to be covered and conducting
discussions, as well as in conceiving the basic outline of the course. The instructor supervises the syllabus,
student participation, and performance, and is responsible for evaluation of the students.
1) In order to provide for planning, students should discuss plans for Student-Initiated Courses in the
coming year at the beginning of the previous spring semester.
2) Interested students should propose Student-Initiated Courses to the Interdepartmental Program for Ex-
perimental and Cross-Disciplinary Studies and to a faculty instructor by the following deadlines:
Fall Semester courses: before the end of Spring Registration
Spring Semester courses: before the end of Fall Semester
3) Proposals for Student-Initiated Courses should include descriptions of the aims and anticipated
techniques of the course, as well as a statement concerning any anticipated constraints on enroll-
ment. Enrollment might be based on such educational considerations as the student's back-
ground of knowledge, individual potential for growth and development, maximum feasible size
of discussion groups, and availability of special materials or resources.
4) All Student-Initiated Courses, including criteria for enrollment, must be approved by:
a) a faculty member who agrees to be the instructor of the course;
b) the Interdepartmental Program for Experimental and Cross-Disciplinary Studies;
c) the Committee on Educational Policy.
Normally, each section of a student-initiated course will be limited to 15 students.
5) A student may enroll in no more than one Student-Initiated Course each semester. No more than
six such courses may be credited toward a Williams B.A.
The Curriculum
­ 14 ­
6) At the end of each Student-Initiated Course, the faculty instructor files with the Program and
with the CEP a report on the course's content, a summary syllabus, and an evaluation.
Honors Program
Williams awards the degree with Honors to those students who have demonstrated imagination,
initiative, and intellectual independence within the major. The Honors program requires two or three
courses constituting a clearly interrelated pattern of study, whether in the form of a thesis, specializa-
tion within the major, or interdisciplinary study with courses from other programs or departments. At
least one of the courses must be in addition to the minimum number required for the major; one may
be a Winter Study Project. A student who is a double major may be a candidate for Honors in either or
both of the majors, but a course for Honors in one major may not be used as an Honors course in the
other. Some programs also award honors for their concentrations.
Individual departments and programs describe special criteria, procedures, and patterns of study
for Honors in the "Courses of Instruction" section. Students should consult with their departments on
their Honors options prior to the senior year. Before the student has begun the last of the required
course units, the department or program determines whether the student is admitted to Honors candi-
dacy. The degree is awarded with Honors or Highest Honors at the end of the senior year if, in the
judgment of the department, its criteria of excellence have been met.
Tutorial Program
In the Fall of 1988, Williams introduced a Tutorial Program. Many departments offer one tutorial
during the academic year and some offer more than one. Students should examine the tutorial offer-
ings carefully in order to understand fully the subject matter of each tutorial and its operation. A com-
plete description of each tutorial to be offered appears in the relevant department's section under
"Courses of Instruction." No student is required to take a tutorial, but any student who has the ap-
propriate qualifications may apply to do so.
Tutorials generally consist of two students meeting with the tutor for a weekly session. For each
meeting, one student prepares a presentation--for instance, an essay, solutions to a set of problems, a
report on laboratory exercises, or a study of a work of art--and replies to the questions and sugges-
tions of the other student and the tutor.
Assignments are designed to require the student to spend no more time over a week preparing for a
tutorial than for a conventional course. Grading and testing will be described by the tutor at the first meet-
ing of the tutorial. Students may obtain detailed information about a specific tutorial from the tutor.
Please refer to page 43 for more information.
Williams-Mystic Maritime Studies Program
The Williams-Mystic Program offers students a challenging opportunity to focus one semester and a
winter study on the sea. Williams College faculty members serve as the Maritime Studies Program Direc-
tor and Marine Scientist. While living in historic cooperative houses at Mystic Seaport Museum, students
take full advantage of its outstanding maritime collections and library, well-equipped marine laboratory,
and diverse coastal environment. Participants enroll in a multidisciplinary program of four Williams Col-
lege courses: American Maritime History, Literature of the Sea, Oceanography or Marine Ecology, and
Marine Policy. Students also learn maritime skills under professional instruction, including music of the
sea, shipsmithing, sailing, boat building, or celestial navigation. In addition, the Program offers four field
seminars each semester, including a two-week offshore voyage on a research schooner, eight days explor-
ing the coasts of California or Oregon, and a three-day trip to Nantucket Island.
The incomparable facilities of Mystic Seaport, Mystic's varied marine habitat, and the companion-
ship of fellow students with diverse backgrounds, but all interested in the sea, provide an exceptional
setting for maritime studies. Interested students should consult the "American Maritime Studies" sec-
tion of this catalog and the Dean's Office for a Williams-Mystic catalog and an application. Admis-
sion is competitive. Applications must be made in the spring of the preceding year. Check with the
Dean's Office for deadlines.
Williams-Oxford Programme
Williams offers a year-long programme of studies at Oxford University in cooperation with Exeter Col-
lege, Oxford. Based at Ephraim Williams House, Williams' study center at Oxford, the Programme is de-
signed to offer the fullest possible integration of the students into the intellectual and social life of one of the
world's great universities. It makes full use of the Oxford tutorial system and the Oxford three-term calen-
dar is followed.
The Curriculum
­ 15 ­
In addition to extensive opportunities to pursue British and Commonwealth studies, the Pro-
gramme also offers instruction in other fields for which Oxford is particularly noted or which are rep-
resented only marginally or infrequently in the Williams curriculum. Interested students should con-
sult the Dean's Office and the "Courses of Instruction" section of this catalog.
Exchange Programs
The Twelve College Exchange Program includes Amherst, Bowdoin, Connecticut College, Dart-
mouth, Mount Holyoke, Smith, Trinity, Vassar, Wellesley, Wesleyan, Wheaton, and, for a semester
program, the National Theatre Institute, in Waterford, Connecticut. In addition, the College maintains
an exchange with California Institute of Technology, Howard University, Fisk University, the Thayer
School of Engineering at Dartmouth, and with Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.
Information on the programs and copies of the participating schools' catalogs are available at the
Dean's Office. Application deadline is in February of the preceding academic year.
Study Abroad and Other Off-Campus Study
Williams participates in study abroad programs in Spain and France (in cooperation with Hamilton
College); in China (as part of the Associated Colleges in China); in Sweden (in cooperation with
twelve other colleges and the University of Stockholm); in Denmark (with the University of Copen-
hagen Danish International Studies); and in Kyoto (the Associated Kyoto Program,run byagroupof
elevencolleges). Williams students may also receive credit for approved programs at a wide variety of
other institutions, or for work done directly in a foreign university or accredited four-year American
university if acceptable evaluation is possible. Students interested in study away should consult the
Dean's Office. Students must submit a pink petition and essay to the Dean's Office by March of the
preceding academic year for which they wish to study off campus. Students must be in good academic
standing with no deficiencies and follow the procedures as set out in the Guide to Study Abroad.
Cross-Enrollment Programs
A limited number of students may register at Bennington College or Massachusetts College of Lib-
eral Arts for courses not offered by Williams. Interested students should contact the Registrar's Office
about arrangements.
Combined Program in Liberal Arts and Engineering
The 3-2 program enables qualified students to combine a liberal arts education at Williams with
undergraduate professional training in engineering. In this program, a student studies at Williams for
3 years, completing 24 courses and 3 Winter Study Projects. He or she then transfers to a leading engi-
neering school and studies for a Bachelor of Science degree, usually for 2 more years. Upon success-
ful completion of this program, the student receives a Bachelor of Arts degree from Williams and a
Bachelor of Science degree from the engineering school. For students majoring in physics, chemistry,
computer science, or mathematics at Williams, the requirements for the senior year courses and major
exercise are waived for the Williams degree. Only students who have taken the prerequisite courses,
who have at least a B average in scientific subjects, and who have a good record in other subjects will
be recommended by their major department and approved by the Committee on Academic Standing
for this program.
Williams has a formal agreement that simplifies the application process to the 3-2 engineering pro-
gram at Columbia University. Other engineering schools offer 3-2 programs which might be ap-
proved on a case-by-case basis. All engineering schools expect that 3-2 students will have completed
several science and mathematics courses at Williams, so it is necessary to plan course selections care-
fully. The booklet "Choosing First Year Courses" includes a list of Williams courses recommended to
prospective engineers.
The 3-2 program offers an established route to entry-level employment as an engineer. In recent
years, however, most Williams students have chosen to complete the Williams B.A. in the usual 4
years and then go to graduate programs in engineering. Please see the section of this catalog titled
"Preparation for Graduate and Professional Study." Also, prospective engineers at Williams have the
opportunity to take undergraduate engineering courses at other institutions through various exchange
programs. For information about these opportunities, please see the section titled "Exchange Pro-
grams."
The pre-engineering advisor, Professor Jefferson Strait, will be happy to assist students interested
in any of the options leading to engineering careers.

ACADEMIC STANDARDS AND REGULATIONS
Attendance
In order to give students a larger share of responsibility for their own education, Williams College does
not administer a general system of required classroom attendance. The College expects students to make
full use of their educational opportunities by regular class attendance and to assume the academic risks
incurred by absences.
Although no formal system of class attendance is maintained by the College, instructors may set such
standards of attendance as they feel are necessary for the satisfactory conduct of their courses. Students
who fail to meet these standards may be warned by the instructor and notice sent to the Dean that continued
absence will result in their being dropped from the course. A failing grade will be assigned to any course
dropped after the regular course change period. Students who do not attend the first class meeting in a
semester course or Winter Study Project may be required to withdraw by the instructor. Attendance is re-
quired at announced tests and final examinations unless the student is specifically excused by the instructor
or the Dean's Office. Satisfactory attendance in four quarters of activities approved by the Department of
Physical Education is required except for students excused by the Dean and the Director of Health.
Registration
Registration for fall and spring semesters and for the Winter Study Program takes place at designated
periods during the academic year. There may be a $5 per day processing fee for any registration changes
accepted after the announced deadlines.
New students register by mail in early summer; soon after arrival at Williams, they meet with their as-
signed Academic Advisors to discuss the curriculum and their course selections. All course changes for
new students are made with the approval of the Faculty Advisors. During the first two years of study, stu-
dents are limited in the number of courses they may take in one department or subject each semester. For
full details, see pages 43-45.
Course Change Period
Course changes may be made during a designated period at the beginning of each semester. No course
changes may be made after that period except with the approval of the Committee on Academic Standing,
after consultation with the Dean's Office. During Winter Study, a second Winter Study Project may be
added if the instructor approves but the original Project may not be dropped. A processing fee of $5 per day
is assessed for each course change accepted after the announced deadline.
First-year and first-semester transfer students may be permitted to withdraw from one course (incurring
a deficiency but no grade penalty) as late as the tenth week of the semester. Upperclass students also may
once in subsequent years withdraw from a course under the same conditions. A withdrawal, recorded on
the transcript as a "W," is granted only with the approval of the instructor and a dean and only if there is
complete agreement between the instructor and the dean that, despite conscientious effort to do the work,
continuation in the course would be detrimental to the overall educational interest or health of the student.
The deficiency thereby incurred must be removed in the normal manner. See references to making up defi-
ciencies on page 18.
Course Load
Students are required to take and complete four courses each semester. In exceptional cases, students
may, upon petition to the Committee on Academic Standing and with departmental approval at the time of
registration, elect a pattern of five semester courses in the fall semester and three in the spring or three in the
fall and five in the spring; a pass-fail course cannot be used as the fifth course in this pattern.
If a student with a disability believes that he/she is unable to pursue a full course of study, the student
may petition the Disabilities and Accommodations Advisory Group for permission to pursue a reduced
course load. Such a petition must be accompanied by a professional evaluation which addresses the stu-
dent's inability to maintain a full course of study and discusses the rationale for a reduced course load.
Upon consideration of a student's petition and supporting documentation, the Disabilities and Accom-
modations Advisory Group makes a recommendation to the Committee on Academic Standing which
renders decisions. Such cases are considered on an individual basis and may be initiated at any time during
the student's tenure at Williams.
Academic Standards and Regulations
­ 17 ­
Fifth Course Pass-Fail Option
Except in the case of the unbalanced course program described above, a student may, at the beginning of
any semester, enroll in a fifth course with the permission of the instructor and on a pass-fail basis only; this
course must be specified as the pass-fail course. By the sixth week, a student must decide whether to contin-
ue the course, and if so, whether on a pass-fail or regularly graded basis. A form for designating the option
chosen will be sent from the Registrar's Office. A processing fee of $5 per day is assessed for 5th course
grading option designations accepted after the announced deadline. A course graded "Pass" may not be
used as one of the thirty-two semester courses required to complete the degree, to fulfill distribution or
major requirements, or to make up a deficiency. A pass-fail course converted to a fifth regularly graded
course may be used to fulfill distribution or major requirements or to make up a deficiency incurred in a
prior term. The grade received will be included in the calculation of the student's cumulative grade-point
average.
Winter Study Project
Students must take and pass a Winter Study Project in each of their four years. Winter Study Projects are
graded Honors, Pass, Perfunctory Pass, or Fail. All work for Winter Study Projects must be submitted by
the last day of the Winter Study Program; work may be accepted after this date only with the permission of
the Dean. Students who fail their Winter Study Projects will be placed on Academic Probation by the
Committee on Academic Standing and will be required to make up the deficiency (see page 18). Students
who fail through gross neglect of work will normally be required to resign. A student who receives a se-
cond Perfunctory Pass grade in Winter Study will be required to pass a fifth course, which may be graded
on the regular A-E or pass/fail basis, in the following spring or fall semester.
Grading System and Records
Williams uses the following system of grades: A, excellent; B, good; C, fair; D, passing; E, failing.
These letters, with plus and minus value, have the following numerical equivalents in calculating grade
averages:
A+ = 4.33 B+ = 3.33 C+ = 2.33 D+ = 1.33
A = 4.00 B = 3.00 C = 2.00 D = 1.00 E = 0
A­ = 3.67 B­ = 2.67 C­ = 1.67 D­ = 0.67
A permanent record of each student's grades is kept and this official record forms the basis for any aca-
demic action by the College.
A transcript of a student's cumulative academic record is available from the Registrar's Office upon
written request. Transcripts will not be issued for students who are in financial arrears.
Provisions relating to student records, access to them, and safeguards on their use are in the Student
Handbook.
First-Year Student Warnings
In the middle of each semester, instructors report to the Registrar those first-year students whose grades
at that time are unsatisfactory. The students and their academic advisors receive notices of warnings as a
matter of routine. The Dean's Office will inform parents of students who receive two or more warnings
unless instructed not to do so by the student within three working days of the receipt of the warnings.
Extensions of Deadlines
Deadlines for course work are set by the instructor with the following limitations:
 for courses with final exams, the latest that written work may be due is 5:00 p.m. on the last
day of reading period.
 for courses without final exams, the latest that written work may be due is 5:00 pm. on the
third-to-last day of the exam period.
If work is due before these deadlines, the instructor may grant an extension up to these deadlines solely
at his or her discretion. Short extensions beyond these deadlines may be granted by a dean but only with the
concurrence of the instructor. No extensions will be granted beyond the examination period except in the
case of serious illness.
Instructors may require students who have missed announced quizzes or hour tests to present satis-
factory explanations to a dean before they are permitted to make up the exercises.
Academic Standards and Regulations
­ 18 ­
If a student is absent from a final examination, a make-up examination may be given only with the
permission of a dean and at a time determined by the dean.
Deficiencies
A student receives credit for a course by obtaining a grade of at least D minus. If the student fails a
course, he or she must make up the deficiency.
If a failure occurs in the first semester of a full-year course, the student may, with the consent of the
instructor, continue the course and receive credit for the second semester only. If a failure occurs in the
second semester of a full-year course, credit for passing the first semester may be retained only with the
approval of the Committee on Academic Standing.
A senior who incurs a failure in the first semester in a required major course may be dropped from the
College at midyear.
Normally deficiencies can be made up only by courses taken after the deficiencies have been incurred.
Thus, for example, Advanced Placement credits may not be used to make up deficiencies.
A student must make up a deficiency in one of these ways:
1) obtain a grade of at least C minus in a summer school course, approved in advance by the Registrar,
at a regionally accredited four-year college or university; (The grade will not, however, be included
in the calculation of the student's cumulative grade point average.)
2) pass an extra graded course at Williams in the semester following the failure;
3) in the case of afirst-semester failure ofayear-long language course, obtainagrade of at leastaCminus
in the work of the second semester of that course. The failure for the first semester will, however, re-
main on the student's record and will be included in the cumulative grade point average.
A deficiency must normally be made up before the start of the following academic year, or in the case of
a deficiency incurred in the spring semester, no later than the following fall semester. A student may, in
consultation with the Dean's Office, petition the Committee on Academic Standing with an alternate plan.
Separation for Low Scholarship
It is the policy of Williams College not to permit a student to remain in residence after it has become
evident that he or she is either unable or unwilling to maintain reasonable standards of academic achieve-
ment. At the end of each term, the Committee on Academic Standing reviews all academic records that fail
to meet the following minimum academic requirements:
For first-year students: Three grades of C minus or better and no failures each semester, and
at least Perfunctory Pass on the Winter Study Project
For upperclass students: Four grades of C minus or better each semester, and
at least Perfunctory Pass on the Winter Study Project
Students whose records fail to meet these minimum academic requirements or whose records otherwise
fail to show adequate progress may be placed on academic probation or required to resign.
Students who are required to resign from the College for academic reasons are normally not permitted to
return for at least one year from the date of their resignation. A student who has been required to resign
from the College may petition the Committee on Academic Standing through the Dean for reinstatement
on two conditions only: all deficiencies must have been made up and a letter submitted to the Committee
that offers convincing evidence that the student is ready and able to complete work toward a degree at
Williams without further interruption.
When required to resign, students must vacate their rooms promptly. Financial aid students must also
see the Director of Financial Aid before leaving to discuss loan repayment and renewal of aid in the event
of readmission.
A student who fails to meet minimum academic standards in his or her final semester at Williams may
be required by the Committee on Academic Standing to meet them by earning grades of at least C minus
elsewhere before the B.A. will be awarded. If such work is required, it must be completed within three
years unless stipulated otherwise, and the courses must be approved in advance by the Registrar.

Withdrawal from the College in Good Standing
Students in good standing occasionally wish to take a personal leave of absence from the College for
sound educational reasons. Students wishing to leave the College should discuss their plans with the Asso-
ciate Dean before departure; they must submit a letter requesting permission to withdraw, pay all College
bills, and vacate their rooms promptly. Financial aid students must also meet with a representative in the
Office of Financial Aid before leaving to discuss loan repayment and renewal of aid upon return.
Normally, a student may not voluntarily withdraw from the College in good academic standing after the
eighth week of each semester. After that date, a student is expected to complete the work of the semester,
and grades will be recorded for each course in which he or she is enrolled.
A withdrawal is granted by the Associate Dean for a period of at least a full year and up to three years.
Students who leave in good standing may return with the approval of the Associate Dean. Upon return,
students are expected to complete degree requirements without further interruption.
Refunds
Payment refund or credit in the event of withdrawal is described on page 26.
Eligibility for and Completion of Majors
To be eligible for any major, students must have received grades of C minus or better in each course in
the major taken in the first two years of college and Honors or Pass on any Winter Study Project taken in
that department. A senior may enter a major only upon the approval of the department chair and the Com-
mittee on Academic Standing.
In addition to passing each major course and, where required, a major Winter Study Project, the student
must maintain an average in the major of 1.67 or higher. Seniors who have an average below 1.67 in the
major field will normally not be allowed to continue. A senior who receives a grade of E in the first semes-
ter of a required major course may be dropped from the College at mid-year. A student who falls below
these standards may continue in the major only with the approval of the Committee on Academic Stand-
ing.
A senior major exercise is not required by every department but is by some. All departments requiring
such an exercise specify it as such in the description of their major programs in the "Courses of Instruction"
section, and all students in those departments must complete the exercise satisfactorily.
Eligibility for Extracurricular Activities
A student is eligible to represent the College in any athletic, dramatic, literary, or musical event and be in
the student government, or other organization as a member, substitute, or class officer, unless he or she is
declared ineligible:
1) by the Dean;
2) by vote of the Discipline Committee; or
3) by vote of the Committee on Academic Standing because of a dangerously low record.
The Student Honor Committee may recommend to the Dean loss of eligibility as a penalty for a viola-
tion of the Honor Code.
Dean's List
All students who attain a semester average of 3.50 or higher in a program of four or more courses are
placed on the Dean's List for that semester.
Phi Beta Kappa Society
Students of the highest academic standing are eligible for election to membership in the Phi Beta Kappa
Society in accordance with the following rules:
1) The requirements for election to membership shall be a grade point average of 3.3 and Honors or
Pass in all required Winter Study Projects. There shall be two elections of new members for each class, at
the end of the junior and senior years.
2) At the end of the junior year, all students in the highest five percent of the class, ranked by cumulative
grade point average, shall be eligible for election provided they have met the requirements and have com-
pleted enough courses to be considered candidates for the B.A. degree in the following year. A student who
leaves Williams at the end of the junior year to attend graduate school may be elected under the above
procedures.
Academic Standards and Regulations
­ 20 ­
At the end of the senior year, all students not yet elected and in the highest 12.5 per cent of the class,

ments.
3) Students shall be eligible for election only if they have been students at Williams College for at least
two years.
4) Honorary members may be elected from distinguished alumni of at least twenty years' standing. No
more than one such member shall be elected each year.
5) Any student who shall have gained his or her rank by unfair means or who in the judgment of the
Dean of the College is not of good moral character is ineligible to election.
6) The name of a member elect shall be entered on the roll only after he or she has accepted the election
and has paid to the Treasurer the regular entrance fee.
7) Any undergraduate member who withdraws from the College before graduation or who falls short of
the minimum Phi Beta Kappa scholastic standing may, upon a two-thirds vote of the members present at
the annual meeting, be deprived of membership in the society.
8) Any undergraduate member who is expelled from the College shall be deprived of membership in
the Society.
9) While connected with Williams College as an officer of instruction or administration, any graduate of
Williams College who is a member of another chapter of Phi Beta Kappa shall be considered a regular
member of the Williams chapter.
10) While connected with Williams College as professor, associate professor or assistant professor, or
an officer of administration, any member of another chapter of Phi Beta Kappa shall have all the privileges
of the Williams chapter, including holding office and voting. While connected with Williams College, any
other officer of instruction or administration who is a member of another chapter shall have all the privi-
leges of the Williams chapter, except holding office and voting.
Awarding of Degrees
By vote of the Trustees, the degree of Bachelor of Arts is conferred at Commencement upon students
who have completed the requirements as to courses and grades to the satisfaction of the Faculty, have paid
all College dues and other College charges, and have returned all books belonging to the Library. The right
to a degree may, however, be forfeited by misconduct at any time prior to the conferring of the degree. No
degree in absentia will be conferred except by special vote of the Trustees on petition presented to the
Dean.
Graduation with Distinction
The Faculty will recommend to the Trustees that the degree of Bachelor of Arts with distinction be con-
ferred upon those members of the graduating class who have passed all Winter Study Projects and obtained
a four year average in the top:
35% of the graduating class -- Bachelor of Arts cum laude or higher
15% of the graduating class -- Bachelor of Arts magna cum laude or higher
2% of the graduating class -- Bachelor of Arts summa cum laude
­ 21 ­
ACADEMIC ADVISING
A variety of academic advice and counsel is provided to students during the course of their undergradu-
ate education. Instructors, departmental and administrative officers, and some special programs are avail-
able to help students explore and develop their academic interests and talents and take advantage of aca-
demic opportunities available through the College.
In the first year each student is assigned an academic advisor from the faculty or staff. This advisor
discusses course choices and academic requirements with the student. The Associate Dean for Academic
Programs coordinates this advising program, reviews the academic progress of individual students,
and--when appropriate--calls students in to discuss their situations.
In the sophomore year, students may seek advice from deans, former advisors, and instructors, along
with preprofessional and other special advisors (see page 411). Sophomores are also encouraged to discuss
major options and requirements with faculty members from departments and programs in which they have
an interest before declaring a major in the spring semester.
The student-run Senior Advisor program provides additional advice and information for sophomore
students in particular, as well as for first-year students and any others with questions about particular
courses, departments, majors, or areas of study. Senior Advisors are nominated by departments and pro-
grams from among the year's senior majors. During the course of the year the Senior Advisors hold several
Course and Majors Fairs, maintain regular office hours at the student centers, keep informed about any
changes in faculty and curriculum in their departments, and generally make themselves available for con-
sultation by students.
In the junior and senior years students are advised by faculty from their major departments or programs.
Each department or program determines its own advising system for its majors, although chairs are regu-
larly available for consultation.
ACADEMIC ASSISTANCE
Additional programs of academic assistance are also available through the Dean's Office. After confer-
ring with the instructor, a student needing extra help in a particular course may request a tutor recom-
mended to the Dean's Office by the department; costs of this tutoring are covered by the Dean's Office.
Students seeking to improve their writing skills in any course may take advantage of the Writing Workshop.
Trained and supervised by a coordinator, student writing tutors provide help with problems on papers al-
ready corrected and with drafts of papers in progress. The Math and Science Resource Center, a drop-in
help center staffed by student assistants, is also available to students of Chemistry 153, 155, 156, 201 and
202, Biology 101, 102 and 202, Mathematics 103, 104 and 105, Statistics 101, and Physics 131, 132, 141
and 142.
EXCHANGE AND STUDY ABROAD
Advising of exchange students and of Williams students wishing to study abroad in the junior year is
coordinated by the Dean's Office. Special orientation and information meetings are held during the fall
semester for new students and for students wishing to study abroad. Orientation and counseling of interna-
tional students is arranged by the International Student Advisor in the Dean's Office.
POSTGRADUATE AND PROFESSIONAL STUDY
For advice about planning for postgraduate opportunities, students may consult departmental advisors,
the Dean's Office, the Office of Career Counseling, or other special advisors listed in the Catalog and also
may refer to the catalog section, "Preparation for Graduate and Professional Study."
­ 22 ­
ACADEMIC HONESTY
All students are expected to be familiar with the Williams College Honor Code and to reaffirm their
commitment to the Statement of Academic Honesty by signing an Honor Code Pledge at the beginning of
each academic year. The Honor Code covers all aspects of academic honesty, including the writing of pa-
pers and laboratory reports as well as all quizzes, homework assignments, hour tests, and examinations.
Statement of Academic Honesty
As an institution fundamentally concerned with the free exchange of ideas, Williams College has al-
ways depended on the academic integrity of each of its members. In the spirit of this free exchange, the
students and faculty of Williams recognize the necessity and accept the responsibility for academic hones-
ty.
A student who enrolls at the College thereby agrees to respect and acknowledge the research and ideas
of others in his or her work and to abide by those regulations governing work stipulated by the instructor.
Any student who breaks these regulations, misrepresents his or her own work, or collaborates in the mis-
representation of another's work has committed a serious violation of this agreement.
Students and faculty are to report violations and alleged violations of this agreement. Such reports are to
be submitted to the Student Honor Committee, consisting of eight student members of the joint Faculty-
Student Honor System-Discipline Committee. This committee is responsible for determining the guilt or
innocence of the accused person or persons, and for recommending appropriate punishments to the Dean.
A committee of faculty members to be designated by the Faculty will sit with the Student Honor Commit-
tee in an advisory capacity.
A quorum of three-quarters shall be required for the Committee to meet. A vote of guilty by at least
three-quarters of those present is necessary for conviction. A recommendation for dismissal must be made
by unanimous vote of those present, and shall be carried out only with the assent of the President of the
College.
The Committee is responsible for informing the student body of the meaning and implications of this
statement. The aforementioned faculty committee shall be responsible for informing faculty members of
the meaning and implications of this statement.
Any amendments to this statement must be made through a student referendum in which two-thirds of
the student body votes, and in which two-thirds of those voting vote for the amendment. These alterations
must be ratified by the Faculty.
Adopted 1971
Guidelines
Instructors are encouraged to submit to the Honor Committee a written statement defining how the
Statement of Academic Honesty applies to their courses or laboratories, and to explain such guidelines to
their students. Instructors may set any type of final examination or hour test, ranging from closed-book,
alternate-seating classroom exercises to open-book, "take-home" examinations or papers, and any require-
ments for laboratory exercises. Some instructors encourage cooperation among students but others do not.
If a student is unsure how the Honor Code applies in a particular situation, it is ultimately the student's
responsibility to find out from his or her professor, or from a member of the Honor Committee, how the
Honor Code applies in that situation. An open and highly individualized system can last only as long as
both the students and the faculty work together to create a true academic community.
In written material, students are expected to avoid the possibility of even unintentional plagiarism by
acknowledging the sources of their work. Careful observance of accepted standards of reference and
attribution is required. The basic rules are summarized below. Students are further advised to consult a
recognized style manual to learn how to acknowledge sources correctly. While academic honesty does not
demand a footnote on statements of common fact, it does require that a student provide clear footnotes or
other appropriate documentation and give credit in the bibliography to ideas, interpretations, and facts that
particular sources have contributed to the student's final work.
Academic Honesty
­ 23 ­
The basic rules of attribution require that:
1) A direct quotation (whether a single word or a phrase, sentence, paragraph, or series of paragraphs)
must always be identified by quotation marks, by indenting and single spacing, or by reduced type size of
the quoted material, and a note must be used to state the exact source.
2) A paraphrase of the work of another must be acknowledged as such by a note stating the source.
3) Indebtedness to the specific ideas of others, or the summarizing of several pages, even though ex-
pressed in different words, must be acknowledged by a note stating the source.
4) Every instance of the use of another student's laboratory reports, computer programs, or other mate-
rial must be acknowledged by a note.
5) Even the use of a student's own previous work must be acknowledged; thus, a student must obtain
the prior permission of all instructors concerned before submitting substantially the same paper in more
than one course.
Procedures for Alleged Violations
Students or faculty members who have discovered a violation or a possible violation of the Honor Code
should report it promptly either to the faculty chair or to the student chair of the Honor Committee. As
soon as possible after receiving a report of an alleged Honor Code violation, the Student Honor Committee
will convene to hear the case. The person bringing the charge will present the evidence to the Committee in
the presence of the accused student, who may then speak in his or her own defense both with and without
the accuser present. After the accused student has left the proceedings, the Committee will determine inno-
cence or guilt and, if the latter, will recommend an appropriate penalty to the Dean. Depending on the
circumstances of the violation, penalties then imposed by the Dean may include such possibilities as a
directed grade of E in the course, disciplinary probation, or temporary or permanent separation from the
College.

EXPENSES
Within the limits of available funds, Williams endeavors to offer its educational opportunities to all who
qualify for admission. Income from its endowment and annual contributions from its alumni and friends
have enabled Williams to keep its tuition at about half the actual cost per student to the College.
Payment of Term Bills
College bills for one-half of all tuition and fees are mailed to parents twice a year (in mid-July and mid-
December) for payment on August 15 and January 15; a fee of $250 may be charged if payment is re-
ceived after these dates. Term bills must be paid before the semester's classes begin or the student will not
be permitted to enroll in classes or remain in residence at the College. Billing statements for accounts with
outstanding balances or current activity will be issued monthly and are due upon receipt.
All outstanding balances must be paid to the Bursar, and all books and materials must be returned to the
Library, before the student is entitled to a degree or a transcript.
College Bills
College charges for tuition, room, board, and fees for the academic year 2002-2003 are as follows:
Tuition $26,326
Room Fee (including telephone service) 3,600
Full Board 3,630
Student Activities Fee* 144
House Maintenance Fee (upperclass) or First-Year Dues 50
_______
$33,750
Other Expenses
Based on a study of expenses reported by financial aid students, a minimum normal budget for a college
year at Williams includes additional expenses estimated as follows:
Books 800
Clothing, Laundry, Recreation approximately 1200
_______
Estimated year's total, exclusive of travel expenses** $35,750
________________
*A student activities fee for support of non-athletic student organizations is charged to all un-
dergraduates as part of the College term bill. It includes, for example, subscriptions to the col-
lege newspaper, and admission to most drama productions and musical events on campus.
**Travel expenses are not included in figures listed above. The cost of two round-trip tickets is
added into each successful financial aid candidate's award.
Additional Items
A House Maintenance Fee of $50 per year is charged to upperclassmen as a part of the College term bill.
It is used to provide a base for the social and cultural programs of each residential House and to meet any
unusual maintenance expenses for the Houses. First-year class dues of $50 are charged at the rate of $25
each semester.
The Commonwealth of Massachusetts requires that, effective September 1, 1989, all full- and part-time
students enrolled in institutions of higher education located in Massachusetts must participate in a qualify-
ing student health insurance plan offered by the institution or in another health insurance program affording
comparable coverage.
Expenses
­ 25 ­
The College offers a qualifying student health insurance plan to all students. The College will allow
students to waive participation in this insurance plan if the student will certify in writing, before the begin-
ning of the academic year, that the coverage offered by an alternative program chosen by the student is
comparable to that of the qualifying program available at the College.
Information about the student health insurance program offered by the College, including current details
of its cost, is mailed to all students each year. Additional information about this program or about the Com-
monwealth's requirements is available through the Thompson Health Center at (413) 597-3166.
There may be a $5 per day processing fee for any registration changes accepted after the announced
deadlines. There is a charge of $25 for a lost key.
Payment of College Bills
A non-refundable deposit of $200 to reserve a place in the first-year class is required from all admitted
candidates (except certain financial aid recipients) by the Candidate's Reply Date of May 1. The deposit
appears as a credit on the term bill rendered in July.
College tuition statements for one half of all fees are mailed to the billing name(s) and addresses on
record twice a year--in July, payable by August 15, and in December, payable by January 15. Payment
may be made by check, money order, or wire transfer. Credit cards can not be used to pay tuition and fees.
A fee of $250 may be charged if payment is received after these dates.
Students who receive a scholarship(s) that was not awarded through the Williams Office of Financial
Aid must complete a Scholarship Information Sheet and mail it to the Bursar Office by early June. Provi-
sional credit will be posted to the semester bill for the following; anticipated disbursements of direct loans
for which a promissory note has been signed and returned to the Office of Financial Aid, anticipated dis-
bursements of outside loans approved by the lender, outside scholarships which have not yet been received
and applied against the student account and any remaining semester contract amount for the Ten Month
Payment Plan. If actual payment for the above provisional credits are not received by the date anticipated,
the provisional credit will expire and be removed from the student's account creating a balance due.
A check returned to the College for any reason such as "account closed" or "insufficient funds" will be
charged to the student's term bill and a "return check charge" of $20.00 will be assessed. The College
reserves the right to require that payment be made in the form of cash, cashier check or money order.
Students with bills still unpaid at the start of the semester who have not made satisfactory arrangements
with the Bursar will not be permitted to enroll in classes or remain in residence at the College. Furthermore,
if arrangements for payment after the start of the semester are approved by the Bursar and these expected
payments are not made on time, students may not be allowed to enroll for the next semester.
If efforts by the Bursar's Office to collect the monies owed are unsuccessful, the account could be
placed with a collection agency, and if the delinquency persists, the College's experience with the account
may be reported to a national credit bureau. It is the policy of the College to pass on to the debtor all reason-
able costs associated with collection of the debt through a collection agency. If at any time the student
believes information concerning payment delinquency is inaccurate, he/she should notify the College c/o
The Bursar's Office, P.O. Box 406, Williamstown, MA 01267.
There are several loan options available to parents through outside sources. These include the MassPlan
Loan through the Massachusetts Educational Financing Authority and the Federal Plus Loan Program.
Information on these loans can be found in the brochure A Guide to Borrowing for College.
Williams also offers an installment plan, administered by Key Education Resources, whereby the yearly
charges are paid in 10 equal installments starting in June, with no interest charges. There are no income
restrictions. Monthly payments will be the total cost (less any scholarships, Stafford or parent loans) di-
vided by 10. There is an administration fee for this program. Information on this program is sent each
spring to all parents or can be obtained by calling Key Education Resources at (800) 539-5363.

Financial Aid
Williams has a substantial financial aid program to promote the greatest possible diversity in the social
and economic background of the student population. Students interested in financial aid policies and pro-
cedures should consult Williams College Prospectus, the Student Handbook, or the Office of Financial Aid.
Distinctive Undergraduate Scholarships
Williams College, through the Office of Financial Aid, administers over three hundred endowed schol-

PREPARATIONFORGRADUATEAND PROFESSIONALSTUDY
Although the principle function of Williams is to provide a broad and solid liberal education that will be
of lasting value no matter what the vocation a student may pursue, the College recognizes that no funda-
mental conflict exists between a liberal education and preparation for a professional career; on the contrary,
a foundation of liberal studies increases professional competence in any field. A student should plan his or
her program of study so as to provide as much educational breadth and enrichment as circumstances per-
mit. A student should also give serious consideration to post-college plans early in the college career.
Each departmental major provides the foundation for graduate study in the corresponding field. Stu-
dents should consult the departmental programs listed under "Courses of Instruction" for requirements,
and for special advice regarding preparation for graduate study. Students should also consult with the ap-
propriate departmental chairman or the special faculty advisors as early as possible in their college careers
to make certain they have taken all the necessary factors into consideration.
Particular attention is called to the foreign language requirements of graduate study. Candidates for the
degree of doctor of philosophy at almost all graduate schools are required to have a reading knowledge of
both French and German. Under certain circumstances another language may replace French. Many grad-
uate schools require also a knowledge of Latin for students of English and Romantic Languages. Candi-
dates for the master of arts degree are required to have a reading knowledge of either French or German.
Students should consult departmental chairmen or the faculty advisors for the requirements in specific
fields of study.
Visual Arts
Although requirements set by various art and architectural schools differ, the basic requirements for a
variety of visual arts fields are summarized in the pamphlet "Guide to the Studio Art Major," available
from the Department of Art office in the W.L.S. Spencer Studio Art Building or the Office of Admission. A
summary of the requirements of all art and architecture schools offering Master of Arts and/or Master of
Fine Arts is available in the bulletin of the College Art Association (CAA), "MFA Programs in the Visual
Arts: A Directory." According to the current edition:
Admission to MFA programs should be based on the nature, extent, and quality of undergraduate
preparation, including courses in studio, art history, and other academic subjects. Quality of studio
preparation can best be judged on the basis of careful evaluation of work done at the undergraduate
level; therefore, a portfolio review (usually represented by slides) is regarded as an absolute necessity
in the admission process.
While many institutions consider the BFA to be the standard qualifying degree, the fact that the
applicant has attended a BA- or BS-granting institution does not necessarily rule out acceptance in
most MFA programs. Whatever the undergraduate degree, most entering graduate students tend not
to be completely prepared in one or more of the areas cited above and will require remedial make-up
work...
Some institutions use the MA degree as a qualifying prerequisite for final acceptance into MFA
candidacy, allowing the student to apply the earned credits toward the higher degree. (pp. 139-40)
Students are advised to take into consideration not only current minimum requirements but also recom-
mended courses. A summary of the essential information required for curricular planning may be found in
the "Guide to the Studio Art Major" and in the pamphlet "Choosing First Year Courses."
Business Administration
Williams offers no special course in preparation for a business career for graduate study in business
administration. The qualities which are important to succeed in business, and which graduate business
schools are seeking, are an ability to reason and to express oneself logically and clearly in written and oral
exposition; a good understanding of the physical and social environment in which business operates; a
solid background in quantitative skills; and an appreciation of human motivations and goals. This means
that a broad liberal arts program is preferred over a highly specialized one.
Within this broad prescription it may be desirable to have at least one year of economics and one year of
mathematics (including statistics and calculus). For those interested in production management or opera-
Preparation for Graduate and Professional Study
­ 30 ­
tion research, additional work in any quantitative course and/or a course in computer science would be
helpful.
But there is no particular major at Williams that is designated as preparation for the business profession.
Students interested in futures in business are encouraged to undertake a broad educational program in the
arts, humanities, and sciences. It is important that one gets involved in extra-curricular activities and that
one holds a leadership position.
Students interested in graduate work in business administration should consult with Fatma Kassamali at
the Office of Career Counseling.
Engineering
Many Williams graduates enjoy productive careers in engineering, applied science, or technical man-
agement. Successful engineers need to be able to communicate effectively, reason logically, and under-
stand both the technical and the social dimensions of a problem. A prospective engineer should pursue a
broad liberal arts education at Williams, with a strong grounding in basic science and mathematics. Most
often he or she will complete a Williams B.A. majoring in one of the sciences (usually physics, chemistry,
mathematics, or computer science) and then go to an engineering school for professional training leading
to a master's degree or doctorate in engineering. While it may be necessary to make up a few undergradu-
ate engineering courses, the opportunities at Williams to participate in scientific research and the breadth of
a liberal arts education prepare Williams graduates to succeed in engineering graduate study and in their
careers.
The booklet "Choosing First Year Courses" contains a list of Williams courses recommended to pro-
spective engineers. Students interested in engineering also have the opportunity to take undergraduate en-
gineering courses at other institutions. Williams maintains formal exchange programs with California
Institute of Technology, Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth College, and Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute. Williams students can arrange to study at one of these leading engineering schools for one or two
semesters, typically during the junior year. Individual arrangements may be possible at other engineering
schools. The 3-2 program offers another opportunity to study engineering at the undergraduate level. For
information about these opportunities, please see the sections of this catalog titled "Exchange Programs"
and "Combined Program in Liberal Arts and Engineering."
The pre-engineering advisor, Professor Jefferson Strait, will be happy to help plan course selections and
to discuss the possible paths to a career in engineering.
Law
Williams graduates regularly proceed directly to law schools on the strength of their liberal education.
No special courses are presented for pre-law students.
Students intending to study law should consult with the Pre-Law Advisor, Mary M. Winston, at the
Office of Career Counseling.
The Health Professions
Many Williams graduates elect to pursue a career in medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine, public
health, or other health-related fields. All are welcome to seek guidance from the Health Profession Office.
Students interested in medicine and related fields should pursue a broad liberal arts education, letting
enthusiasm for subjects be a guide. In most cases, a student should consider volunteer service and field-
specific internship experience in an effort to confirm interest in the chosen field. With careful planning, any
major can be studied.
In order to pursue a career in a health-related field, a student must pay particular attention to the courses
required for graduate school admission. In certain fields, upwards of twelve courses are listed as prerequi-
sites. The general requirements for many programs are outlined in "Choosing First Year Courses," but each
student considering advanced study in the health fields should plan on meeting with the Health Professions
Advisor early in the college career to ensure that planned coursework will meet specific admissions re-
quirements.
Charley Stevenson, the Health Professions Advisor, will be happy to discuss goals and specific steps
which might help a student realize them.
Preparation for Graduate and Professional Study
­ 31 ­
College Teaching/Research
The most important qualification for careers in teaching at any level is proficiency in a major. Students
interested in college teaching and research should prepare themselves at Williams for graduate work in the
subjects of their choice, whereas those interested in teaching at the elementary or secondary level should
plan to meet certification while an undergraduate or to proceed from a sound undergraduate major to a
Master of Arts in Teaching program in a reputable graduate school. (Some states and many private schools
appoint teachers without certification.) Opportunities are available during Winter Study for teaching in-
ternships at the elementary and secondary level. Certification is not required if one is interested in teaching
in private schools.
Students interested in college teaching should consult with the chairs of the departments in which they
intend to major. Those interested in teaching at the elementary and secondary level should consult with the
Director of the Program in Teaching or the Office of Career Counseling.
Teaching After Williams
There are many options for teaching after Williams, including independent and public school teaching.
Many states now offer streamlined programs to certify public school teachers, and many states offer wide
range of options for acquiring certification while you teach. Students who are interested in teaching are
encouraged to contact Susan Engel, the Director of the Program in Teaching at Williams, to find out how
they might participate in the program.
The Office of Career Counseling has a very active on-campus educational recruiting program that in-
cludes many private schools as well as Teach for America and similar programs. The program begins in
the fall and continues through the spring. Students interested in teaching at private elementary- or secon-
dary-level schools or participating in the Teach for America or similar programs directly after graduation
from Williams (certification is not required) should consult with either Mary Winston or Fatma Kassamali
at the Office of Career Counseling.
Religious Study
Students intending to go to theological seminary are not required to pursue a special course of study at
Williams. Various majors are acceptable and most liberal arts courses can be useful to the prospective min-
ister, priest, rabbi, or teacher of religion. However, given the increasing variety of complexity of post-grad-
uate vocational choices in the field of religion, it is strongly recommended that the preseminarian secure a
basic foundation in the study of religion while an undergraduate. Students contemplating advanced aca-
demic work in religion preparatory to a career of teaching and scholarship should give serious consider-
ation to concentrating their undergraduate studies in religion. Ordination requirements for various religious
communities vary widely depending on the particular tradition; in some cases it may be possible for the
prospective minister, rabbi, or religious professional to make progress on certain academic requirements or
other credentials during the undergraduate years. Students with such vocational interests are urged to make
themselves known to one of the chaplains (or, where appropriate, one of the local clergy) as soon as these
interests begin to come into focus.
Anyone interested in graduate programs in religion should consult with the faculty advisor in that field.

GRADUATE PROGRAMS AT WILLIAMS
Master of Arts in Development Economics
The Center for Development Economics, which opened at Williams College in 1960 with the support of
a grant from the Ford Foundation, offers an intensive one-year program in economic analysis and quantita-
tive techniques leading to the degree of Master of Arts in Development Economics. The program is specif-
ically designed for economists from developing countries who are already embarked on professional ca-
reers in public agencies. It includes required courses in development economics, international trade and
finance, monetary and fiscal policy, econometrics, and public finance. Center Fellows choose among
seminars in such fields as open-economy macroeconomics, agricultural economics, and economic transi-
tion.
Fellows are normally nominated by the public agencies from which they will be on leave. A candidate
must have a B.A. or B. Sc. degree of honors quality in Economics, have two or more years of relevant
work experience, and have an effective command of spoken and written English. Juniors and seniors ma-
joring in economics or political economy who have special interest in economic development or in a par-
ticular area of the world may, with the consent of the Chair of the Center and of the individual instructor,
satisfy some of their degree requirements by taking courses at the Center.
All communications relating to the degree of Master of Arts in Development Economics should be ad-
dressed to the CDE, Assistant Director, 1065 Main Street, Williams College, Williamstown, Massachusetts
01267, or e-mail cde@williams.edu.
Master of Arts in the History of Art
In cooperation with the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute, Williams College offers a two-year
course of study leading to the degree of Master of Arts in the History of Art. The objective of the program
is to offer to a small number of students a thorough professional preparation for careers in teaching and
museums, and to enable them to pursue further research whether independently or at other institutions of-
fering higher degrees. The curriculum consists of seminars in art historical subjects and an intensive study
of foreign languages in the context of the general literature of art. Problems of criticism, connoisseurship,
and conservation arising from the study of original works of art are fundamental to the program, and op-
portunities are provided for practical experience in museum work at the Clark Art Institute, the Williams
College Museum of Art, and the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art. The study of primary ma-
terials is further extended by field trips to other collections. The degree is normally awarded after two years
of resident graduate study. To earn the degree, students must take ten courses, of which at least six must be
graduate seminars (including ARTH 504). In connection with the preparation of a paper for the Graduate
Symposium, students will register for an eleventh course (ARTH 509), to be graded pass/fail, in their
fourth semester. A demonstration of proficiency in reading two foreign languages is required. Of these two,
German is required, and French is recommended. In January of the first year, students participate in a Eu-
ropean study trip with selected faculty; in January of the second year, students must complete a Qualifying
Paper. In addition to all course work, students must, at the end of the second year, either pass an oral ex-
amination in a declared field of concentration or present a shortened version of the Qualifying Paper in a
graduate symposium to be held on Commencement weekend. To enter the program a successful applicant
must have been awarded the degree of Bachelor of Arts or its equivalent from an accredited institution. An
undergraduate major in art is not required for acceptance to the program.

guage (Mandarin or Cantonese) and culture. Students are chosen by a selection committee, chaired by Pro-
fessor Crane. Interested students should contact Professor Crane for application forms. Deadline November
30th.
Teaching Assistantship Program for Graduates in France
Each year the Department chooses one or sometimes two students to participate in a French Government
assistantship program. The Williams student chosen spends the year following graduation teaching English
at a lycée in the Paris area and is the recipient of a French government stipend. Interested students must
apply to the Department early in the second semester. Priority will be given to French majors.

COURSES OF INSTRUCTION 2002-2003
COURSE NUMBERING SYSTEM
Courses designated by a single number are semester courses.
Year courses are designated by an odd number and an even number joined by a hyphen; the work of
the two semesters constitutes an integral, indivisible course. Therefore, if a student does not pass the
second half of a year-long course, he or she forfeits credit for the first half and incurs a deficiency as a
result of the forfeiture. Students who register for a year course are required to do both semesters of
that course within the same academic year.
In some departments, course numbers have special meanings that are explained in their listings.
The(F) or(S) following a course's number indicates the semester, fall or spring, in which the course
will be offered.
THESE SYMBOLS ARE USED IN DEPARTMENTAL MASTHEADS TO INDICATE
FACULTY STATUS:
*On leave for the year
* *On leave first semester
* * *On leave second semester

(except that R is used for Thursday).
The Tutorial Program at Williams
In the fall of 1988, Williams introduced a tutorial program. Students are invited to examine the tuto-
rial offerings carefully in order to understand fully the substantive content of each tutorial and its
mode of operation. A list of the tutorials to be offered in 2002-2003 is included in this section, and a
complete description of each may be found in the relevant department's section of this catalog. No
student is required to take a tutorial, but any student who has the appropriate qualifications is invited to
do so.
Tutorials
­ 44 ­
While the details of the functioning of tutorials will vary in order to accommodate the diverse sub-
ject matter of the various departments of the College, there are important common characteristics to
all tutorials. Tutorials place a much greater weight on student participation than do regular courses or
even small seminars. In general, each tutorial will consist of two students meeting with the tutor for
one hour or 75 minutes each week. At each meeting one student will make a prepared presentation--
read a prepared essay, work a set of problems, report on laboratory exercises, examine a work of art,
etc.--and the other student and the tutor will question, probe, push the student who is presenting his or
her work about various aspects of the presentation. The student then must respond on the spot to these
probings and questions. A tutorial is directly concerned with teaching students about arguments,
about arriving at and defending a position, and about responding quickly to suggestions and ques-
tions. This kind of exercise will help the student gain insight and understanding of what knowledge is
and how it is accumulated, and how there can be different interpretations and different understandings
of the same phenomenon. The student presentation drives the tutorial, and the presentation by the stu-
dent obviously means that student preparation and response are crucial to an effective tutorial. The
presentation is based on assigned and suggested reading and other work (laboratory, art work, theatre,
etc.) by the tutor.
In some tutorials both students will make a shorter presentation each week and both will react and
comment on the other's presentation. In all cases the tutorial is built around presentations by students.
In most instances there will be no more than 10 students in a tutorial. In the first and last week of the
semester, the whole group may meet together, and in the 10 weeks in-between students will meet in
pairs with their tutor. Students should therefore expect to make 5 presentations that occupy about an
hour, or 10 that require one half hour. Assignments will be designed such that the student should, in
general, be required to spend no more time over a week preparing for the tutorial than for a conven-
tional course. It is likely, however, that as students begin their first tutorial course, they will have to
spend somewhat more time preparing for it than for other courses. Once the routine becomes more
established and familiar, the tutorial is expected to require about the same total time per week as does a
regular course. The student should appreciate, however, that the weekly tutorials require exceptional
regularity and on-time performance.
Grading, testing, and similar details will be described by the tutor at the first meeting of the entire
group.
Drops and Adds: Because of the particular arrangements of the tutorial, it is necessary to limit adds
to the first week of classes only. No adds can be made after that time. Spaces in tutorials are limited,
and a late drop may unfairly deprive another student of an opportunity. Students are urged, therefore,
to think very carefully about their initial decisions.
PLEASE NOTE: Tutorials cannot be taken on a pass/fail grading basis.
More Information: Students may obtain detailed information about a specific tutorial from the
individual tutor, or about The Tutorial Program as a whole from its director, Professor Stephen
Fix (Department of English).

HONORS PROGRAM IN AFRICAN-AMERICAN STUDIES
A candidate for honors in African-American Studies must maintain at least a B+ average in the
concentration and be admitted to candidacy by the program faculty. An honors candidate must com-
plete her/his project in a semester (and Winter Study). A candidate will enroll for either AAS 491 or
492 (and Winter Study) during her/his senior year to write a forty-page thesis or to do an equivalent
project in the performing and studio arts. A faculty advisor, in consultation with the chair, can change
the particulars of an honors project.
An honors project should demonstrate unusual creativity, depth, and intellectual rigor. A candidate for
honors is permitted and encouraged to pursue non-traditional projects, such as presentations in the
performing arts, visual arts, or creative writing, as well as more traditional interdisciplinary studies.
The advisor will evaluate an honors project, and the program faculty will decide whether to confer
honors. A student wishing to become a candidate for honors in African-American Studies should se-
cure a faculty sponsor and inform the program chair in writing before spring registration of her/his
junior year.
AAS 210(F) Ebonics: Exploring an Alternative Form of English (Same as Linguistics 210)*
When a local school system in California certified the teaching of African-American English, it
created national controversy focused on linguistics adjustments in a pivotal racial minority communi-
ty. Is it a separate language, a dialect,slang, bad grammar, broken English, or really not a distinct enti-
ty? This course will review these questions in the context of educational challenges facing African-
American children whose home speech is Ebonics. The course will deal with the issues through read-
ings, drawing on research and theory in works by Rickford, Rickford, and Smitherman, Perry and
Delpit, and Connie Porter using film, group discussions, writing assignments, and lectures.
Format: discussion/lecture. Requirements: two short papers, a mid-term exam, a final paper.
No prerequisites. This is an introductory course, open to all students, including first-year students.
Enrollment limit: 25 (expected: 15).
Hour: 9:55-11:10 TR WILKERSON
AAS 491(F), 492(S) Senior Project
Non-honors candidates do a regular winter study project offered by the program or a"99." Candidates
for honors in African-American Studies must do W030 for the winter study period following 491 or
prior to taking 492.
THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN STUDIES CONCENTRATION AND THE AMERICAN STUD-
IES MAJOR
Several courses in African-American Studies count for credit in the American Studies major. There-
fore, students in American Studies can easily complete requirements for an African-American Studies
concentration by electing one course in an African subject and by taking African-American Studies 491.
Another three courses must be chosen which satisfy both American Studies and African-American
Studies requirements.

GENERAL PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The American Studies Program uses interdisciplinary approaches to develop students' understand-
ing of the complexity of the culture(s) usually labeled "American." Examining history, literature, and
other forms of expression, we explore the processes of cultural definition as contested by diverse indi-
viduals and groups. We ask new questions about aspects of American life long taken for granted; we
also use American culture as a laboratory for testing classic and contemporary theories about how
cultures work.
NON-MAJORS, FIRST-YEAR STUDENTS, AND SOPHOMORES
American Studies 201 is open to non-majors including first-year students with Advanced Place-
ment credit in American History. All elective courses are open to students who meet the requirements
of the departments that sponsor those courses. American Studies 302 and 403 are open to non-majors
with permission of the instructor.
RATIONALE FOR COURSE NUMBERING
The introductory course is offered at the 200 level to suggest the desirability of some preliminary
training in college-level history, literature, sociology, or political science. The intermediate course,
302, is offered primarily for juniors, although it is open to sophomores who have had 201 and will be
away from campus during the spring of their junior year. 403 is designed for senior majors.
American Studies

THE MAJOR
Required major courses:
American Studies 201
American Studies 302
American Studies 403
Elective courses:
Eight courses: five should be chosen from one of the specialization fields listed below, the other three
chosen from among any of the electives listed. Students are expected to take courses from at least two
disciplines when choosing the courses that make up their specializations. Students are also required
to take at least one course from a list of pre-1900 courses. Advanced Placement credit in appropriate
areas, or departmental courses not listed here, may be substituted for electives in the major, with per-
mission of the program chair.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN AMERICAN STUDIES
Candidates for honors in American Studies will undertake a substantial, year-long independent
project during their Senior year. Applicants should have a consistent record of high achievement in
courses taken for the major, and normally will have done work in the field of study of their proposed
thesis. Students who wish to write or produce an honors project should consult with a prospective
faculty advisor in their junior year. Formal application to pursue honors should be made by the time of
spring registration in the junior year. Students must submit a 1- to 2-page preliminary proposal de-
scribing the proposed project to the Chair of the American Studies Program at this time. Final admis-
sion to the honors thesis program will depend on the AMST advisory committee's assessment of the
qualifications of the student and the merits and feasibility of the project. If the proposal is approved,
they will be permitted to register for AMST 491, W030, and AMST 492 the following year. The com-
pleted project is due in mid-April. Each student will present a short oral presentation of his or her the-
sis at the end of spring semester.
ADVISING
All majors will be assigned a faculty advisor. Majors must meet with their advisor during the first
week of classes during the fall semester and at the time of the spring semester registration period in
order to have their courses and plans for the American Studies major approved. Both majors and non-
majors are encouraged to talk at any time with the program chair or other affiliated faculty about the
major.
AMERICAN STUDIES AND OTHER PROGRAMS
Students majoring in American Studies are encouraged to consider pursuing concentrations in
African-American, Environmental, and Women's and Gender Studies. Many of the courses counted
for those concentrations may also earn credit toward the American Studies major.
STUDY AWAY FROM WILLIAMS
We encourage students to pursue cross-cultural comparative studies. A major in American Studies
can be combined with study away from Williams for a semester or a year if plans are made carefully.
Many courses that will be approved for College credit may also count toward the American Studies
major if their subject matter is American culture.
Students planning to be away in the junior year should have taken American Studies 201 before
they leave; those away for junior-year spring term should take American Studies 302 in their sopho-
more year. Students should consult as early as possible with the chair or their advisor about their plans
for fulfilling the requirements of the major.

AMST 201(F) Introduction to American Studies (W)
To be an "American" means something more than U.S. citizenship. In this course, we focus on the
problems and possibilities of American identity. Access to American-ness is shaped by factors such as
class, race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, religion, and region--categories which themselves change in
meaning over time. Given the geographical, racial, and cultural diversity of the United States, the
ways in which Americans imagine nation inevitably vary over time, according to place, and among
different individuals and groups. Rather than a survey of any one aspect or period of American histo-
ry, literature, or popular culture, this course is an introduction to the interdisciplinary field of Ameri-
can Studies, a field defined both by the range of texts we read (essays, novels, autobiographies,
photographs, films, music, architecture, historical documents, legal texts), and by the questions we
American Studies
­ 50 ­
ask of them: How have different Americans imagined what it means to be an American? What ideas
about national history, patriotism, and moral character shape their visions of American-ness? How do
the educational system, mass media, government policies regarding citizenship and immigration
shape American identities? How are boundaries of inclusion and exclusion in the nation drawn? What
uses have been made of the claim to an American identity, and what is at stake in that claim? How have
Americans imagined a national landscape, a national culture, and to what ends?
Format: discussion. Evaluation will be based on a series of short critical essays and a group project.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 per section. (expected: 19 per section).Two sections. Priority to
sophomores and first-year students with AP 5 in U.S. History.

ence; education; and recent historical and theoretical work in American Studies, much of which dis-
plays a decidedly utopian bent. Since most reforming and idealizing visions develop from a height-
ened sense of what is wrong with American society, we will analyze and interpret dystopian views as
well. These will include recent art, architecture and film in which an almost saccharine representation
of American life is revealed to be a meditation upon the impossibility of hope.
Enrollment limited to Junior American Studies majors and to those American Studies majors who
need to take this course because they will be or have been away during their Junior year. Expected

AMST 403(S) Representing Slavery*
This interdisciplinary course examines American representations of slavery, with special emphasis on
accounts of the journey from slavery to freedom. We will first consider such historical material as
slave narratives, anti-slavery fiction, and antebellum journalism. Turning to the present, we will ex-
plore how and why inherited representations are being reworked, drawing our sources not only from
recent historical scholarship but from literary, artistic, and cinematic reconstructions of the story or
image of slavery, and from current popular debates over the question of reparations. By studying how
Americans have thought and fought over slavery, we will explore the broader contours and meaning
of race, sexuality, gender, freedom, subjection, citizenship, and political agency in this country. Au-
thors and artists considered may include Berlant, Burnett, Douglass, Equiano, Hartman, Jacobs, Mel-
ville, Morrison, Patterson, Piper, Rogin, Stowe, Walker.
Format: seminar. Requirements: Regular class participation, several short essays, and a 15 page term
paper.
Enrollment limit: 25 (expected: 25). Priority given to senior majors in American Studies; other stu-
dents may be admitted with permission of instructor, if space allows.

AMST 408(F) Race, Gender and Nature (Same as Environmental Studies 408 and Women's
and Gender Studies 408)*
This course broadly examines the literature of the construction of race, gender and nature from the
perspective of critical studies of science, technology and environmental studies. In this course, we
will focus on those accounts that take seriously the question of ideological constructions of race, gen-
der and nature. We will approach our discussions with several key questions in mind. First, how has
scientific practice naturalized racial and sexual difference? How have discourses of scientific objec-
tivity have been used to "authorize" social hierarchies organized by race, gender and nation? How is
domination of "nature related to these hierarchies? What does understanding the history of the social
construction of these categories suggest about the relationship between knowledge and practice? This
course examines the social construction of race, gender and nature in and through four general areas:
1) colonialism and industrialization; 2) scientific racism; 3) environmental/ecology studies; and 4)
critical science studies. Among the topics we will explore are constructions of "wilderness," colonial
environmental history, ecofeminism, the history of eugenics, Social Darwinism, sociobiology and en-
vironmental/ecological history, theory and analysis (including a discussion of the urban environment
and "environmental justice").
Requirements: Students will be evaluated on 4 criteria: 1) class presentation and leading discussion
(20%); 2) Short critical response paper (15%); a medium length research paper (30%); 4) Participa-
tion in seminar activities and discussion (35%).

SPECIALIZATION FIELDS
To provide focus for work in the major, each student will choose one of the Specialization Fields
listed below and record this choice when registering for the major. (This commitment can be revised,
in consultation with the chair.) At least five electives will be taken from among those designated to
support a specialization field. In extraordinary cases, students who wish to do so may be permitted to
design their own specialization field. Fulfillment of concentrations in African-American Studies, En-
vironmental Studies, and Women's and Gender Studies may be used as the basis for individually de-
signed specialization fields. All such arrangements must be approved by the American Studies Com-
mittee.
CULTURAL PRACTICES
Elective courses:
Cultural practices are the complex means by which peoples of the Americas express themselves,
adopting, altering, and inventing artifacts, and social forms and practices.

ANTHROPOLOGY AND SOCIOLOGY (Div. II)
Chair, Associate Professor JAMES L. NOLAN, Jr.
Professors: M. F. BROWN, D. EDWARDS, JACKALL, JUST. Associate Professor: NOLAN. Assis-
tant Professors: FOIAS, VARESE. Visiting Part-time Lecturer: MISRA.
The Department of Anthropology and Sociology at Williams aims to help students achieve an inte-
grated understanding of biography, history, culture, and social structure in both traditional and mod-
ern societies.
Anthropology explores the full range of human experience by introducing students to the study of
tribal and peasant societies, especially those on the periphery of the West, as well as to the cultural
complexities of stratified, industrial societies such as our own. Integrated with the study of specific
peoples is an examination of the various analytical schemes anthropologists have developed to under-
stand them. Courses offered in the department represent two of Anthropology's major subfields: so-
ciocultural anthropology--that is, the comparative study of human social life, institutions, and be-
liefs--and archaeology, the study of the origins and lifeways of prehistoric peoples.
Sociology studies the social and institutional intricacies of modern industrial societies and the so-
cial psychological dilemmas facing the individual in our epoch. Sociology courses introduce students
to classical and contemporary social thought about men and women and society, to the systematic
analysis of social institutions and social interaction, and to the social analysis of modern culture. The
Sociology major at Williams emphasizes the humanistic tradition of sociology, stressing qualitative
approaches to understanding how social reality is constructed.
MAJORS
The department offers separate majors in both Anthropology and Sociology, with a broad and di-
verse array of courses in both disciplines. The department is committed, however, to the unity of the
social sciences. To this end, Anthropology and Sociology offer joint core courses in methodology and
theory, as well as several elective courses in common. All joint courses are designated "ANSO."
Requirements
For the degree in Anthropology or Sociology, students must complete a minimum of nine courses
as outlined below:
(1) Core Courses. Majors in both disciplines must take a sequence of four core courses. Three of these
are joint (ANSO) courses. The sequences are:
Anthropology Joint (ANSO) Sociology
ANTH 101 The Scope SOC 101 Invitation to
of Anthropology Sociology
ANSO 205
Ways of Knowing
ANSO 305
Social Theory
ANSO 402
Senior Seminar
(2) Elective Courses. Majors in Anthropology or Sociology must take five elective courses from the
course listings of their respective disciplines or from the joint ANSO listings. Two of the courses
chosen are normally at the 300 level or above. In close consultation with their departmental advisors,
students may take some selected courses from other disciplines to fulfill major requirements in either
Anthropology or Sociology.
(3) Majors in each wing of the department are allowed to count up to two courses in the other wing to-
wards fulfillment of their major requirements.
STATISTICS AND DATA ANALYSIS
Majors in Anthropology and Sociology are required to take Statistics 101 (formerly Mathematics
143), a comparable course in statistics and data analysis, or prove competency in the area of statistical
analysis through examination. Courses taken to fulfill this requirement will not count towards the nine
course total that all majors are expected to complete.
AREA STUDIES CONCENTRATION
Students who wish to combine a major in Anthropology or Sociology with an Area Studies con-
centration are encouraged to do so. Courses taken to satisfy an Area Studies requirement may be
counted toward the major with prior approval of a student's departmental advisor. The only exception
to this rule is the Area Studies senior seminar, which cannot ordinarily be counted toward the An-
thropology or Sociology degree.
LANGUAGE STUDY, STUDY ABROAD, AND WINTER STUDY
Departmental advisors will help interested students integrate a major with study abroad, foreign
language study, or field research during the winter study period. The department encourages Williams
Anthropology and Sociology
­ 57 ­
students to take advantage of established foreign study programs in Egypt, Japan, India, Hong Kong,
and other countries. Because some foreign study programs do not offer courses that can be counted
toward the Anthropology or Sociology degrees, however, sophomores planning to study abroad in
junior year must consult with the departmental advisor before declaring a major.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN ANTHROPOLOGY OR SOCIOLOGY
Honors and highest honors are normally awarded for the completion of a year-long research project
that has resulted in an original thesis of high quality. Students wishing to write an honors thesis should
engage a member of the department faculty as a Thesis Advisor as soon as possible and must submit a
proposal for the thesis for department approval no later than preregistration in the spring of the junior
year. If the proposal is approved, they will be permitted to register for Anthropology and Sociology
493-W031-494, during which they will write and defend a thesis. If their overall work in the major
continues to be of high quality and the thesis is deemed of a similar quality, they may be awarded
honors or highest honors in Anthropology or Sociology.
ANTHROPOLOGY / SOCIOLOGY COURSES
JOINT CORE COURSES
ANSO 205(S) Ways of Knowing
An exploration of how one makes sense of the social world. Some of the key questions of the course
are: What are the philosophical and epistemological underpinnings of social inquiry? How does one
frame intellectual problems and go about collecting, sifting, and assessing field materials? What are
the uses and limits of statistical data? What is the importance of history to sociological and anthropo-
logical research? How can one use archival and other documentary materials to enrich ethnographic
research? What are the empirical limits to interpretation? What is the relationship between empirical
data and the generation of social theory? How does the social organization of social research affect
one's inquiry? What are the typical ethical dilemmas of fieldwork and of other kinds of social re-
search? How do researchers' personal biographies and values shape their work? We will approach
these problems concretely rather than abstractly through a series of case studies of how men and
women in the world of affairs, ranging from detectives, epidemiologists, and corporate lawyers, make
sense of their worlds in order to act responsibly. We will also draw upon the field experiences of de-
partmental faculty in settings as diverse as the jungles of Guatemala, the mountains of Sumbawa, Af-
ghan refugee camps, immigrant communities in Chicago, big city police departments and district at-
torney offices, corporate offices on Wall Street, and criminal drug courts across America. There will
also be some practical training in basic field methods, census and survey interpretation, and archival
research.
Requirements: a series of short papers and a final exam.
Prerequisite: Anthropology 101 or Sociology 101 or permission of instructor. Expected enrollment:
20.
Hour: 1:10-3:50 W NOLAN
ANSO 305(F) Social Theory
An introduction to social theory in anthropology and sociology, with strong emphasis on enduring
works by major thinkers--Marx, Weber, Durkheim, and Freud, among others--who have shaped
views of society in the West and beyond. Several key questions inform exploration of these works:
What are the historical roots and principal attributes of modernity? From the perspective of moderni-
ty, how do social theorists understand "the primitive"? Do society and culture have organizing rules?
What role does human agency play in the unfolding of social life? What are the possibilities and limits
of scientific approaches to the study of human social experience? In considering such questions, we
will reconstruct the intellectual and social histories of both disciplines, examining in particular how
they abandoned common ground and language, with sociologists gravitating toward paradigms of
scientific predictability and anthropologists toward relativistic frameworks of interpretation. Finally,
we will examine the migration of ideas from anthropology and sociology to other disciplines and back
again. The course emphasizes major differences between interpretive frameworks as well as common
elements that contribute to a deeper understanding of the social world.
Format: seminar. Requirements: two short essays and one research paper based on local fieldwork.
Prerequisites: Anthropology 101 or Sociology 101 and ANSO 205 or permission of the instructor.
Enrollment limit: 25 (expected: 22).
Hour: 9:55-11:10 TR M. F. BROWN
ANSO 402(S) Senior Seminar (Same as Anthropology 402 and Sociology 402)
The capstone seminar is a research seminar. Its purpose is to allow students to engage skills they have
acquired to formulate an intellectual problem, gather and analyze data, and compose an original and
synthetic work of scholarship relevant to their discipline. Projects may take a variety of forms, includ-
ing library papers, fieldwork-based papers, group projects, or other alternatives, subject to the instruc-
tor's advice and consent. Students registered for the course will meet at least once prior to the com-
mencement of Spring classes and are expected to begin the semester with a concrete research proposal
Anthropology and Sociology
­ 58 ­
in hand; senior majors writing honors theses join the seminar with projects already well underway.
Class meetings thereafter will be devoted to the discussion and mutual critique of ongoing work; stu-
dents will be required to present work in progress to the seminar at several points during the semester.
A final grade will be assigned based on the quality of the research project and on the quality of the
student's contributions to and critiques of classmates' work. Students who are not senior majors in
anthropology or sociology are permitted to register for this course only with the instructor's permis-
sion.
Requirements: major research project, class participation.
Prerequisites: Anthropology and Sociology senior majors or with permission of instructor. Expected
enrollment: 23.
Students who are doing a thesis in Anthropology or Sociology are required to audit this course and
should, therefore, make certain their schedules allow them to do so.
Hour: 8:30-9:45 TR JUST
ANTHROPOLOGY COURSES
ANTH 101(F,S) The Scope of Anthropology*
Is there such a thing as "human nature"? Why have human societies developed such a bewildering
range of customs to deal with problems common to people everywhere? This course addresses these
questions by introducing students to the comparative study of human social life and culture. Topics
surveyed in the course include economics, language and thought, kinship and marriage, law and poli-
tics, and the wide variations in human belief systems, including religions. The course also considers

From the Opium Warlords of the Golden Triangle to headhunters in Borneo, from the royal courts of
Javanese Sultans to pedicab drivers, Southeast Asia presents a broad spectrum of peoples, cultures,
and polities. This course provides an introduction to the worlds of Southeast Asia by looking at the
relationships between people, society and the state. Thematically the course is organized around the
ever-shifting relationships between central authority--both colonial and indigenous--and tribal and
peasant communities in the hinterlands. Among other topics, we will examine the "theatre state" in
nineteenth-century Bali, the conversion of the Tagalog to Christianity, history as seen through the eyes
of Ilongot headhunters, and the nightmare of Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge.

ANTH 214(S) (formerly ANSO 214) The Rise and Fall of Civilizations (Same as
Environmental Studies 224)*
Over the centuries, philosophers and historians have asked how societies evolved from simple hunter-
gatherer bands to complex urban civilizations? Human prehistory and history have shown the re-
peated cycles of the rise, expansion and collapse of early civilizations in both the Old and New World.
What do the similarities and differences in the development of these first civilizations tell us about the
nature of societal change, civilization and the state, and human society itself? The course will examine
these issues through an introductory survey of the earliest civilizations in Mesopotamia, Egypt, India,
Mesoamerica and South America. Classical and modern theories on the nature, origin, and develop-
ment of the state will be reviewed in the light of the archaeological evidence.

ANTH 218T(S) Empires in Prehistory and History (W)*
Cycles of rise and collapse of civilizations are common in our human past. Among the most fascinat-
ing cases are those of empires, conquest civilizations, or states that encompass a number of different
ethnicities, polities and peoples. However, their rise and often rapid collapse begs an important ques-
tion: how stable have empires been in human prehistory? Are they intrinsically unstable political
forms? The course will address these questions by examining the major empires of the Old and New
World in pre-modern history: Akkadian; Babylonian; Persian; Assyrian; Greek; Roman; Chinese; Ot-
toman; Aztec and Inca empires. Using readings by political scientists, historians, epigraphers, archae-
ologists and political anthropologists, we will consider the causes of the expansion and collapse of
these empires. We will also examine their sociopolitical and economic structures as mechanisms to
provide a cross-cultural comparison of the differential success and final decline of all these empires.

ANTH 225(S) Visible Culture*
Seeing comes before words, but words quickly exert their dominance, reducing the visible to a subset
of the written. This is as true in anthropology as in most other academic disciplines, in which the visual
is made significant insofar as it is transmitted in print. This course examines the potential of images
(particularly when presented in the form of photographs, video and film) for revealing aspects of cul-
ture normally obscured by the written word and for transmitting different, sometimes undervalued
insights and knowledge of the social world. In the course of the semester, we will examine some of the
ways in which filmmakers have approached the task of documenting and understanding our own soci-
ety and those of other peoples. In addition, we will compare print and film representations of the same
society to gauge what is lost and gained through the use of different media, and we will evaluate the
success of various experiments using visual tools to represent cultural phenomena. In the course of the
semester, we will also consider differences between mainstream, independent, academic, and indige-

ANTH 232(S) Gendered Spaces and Sexual Cultures (Same as Women's and Gender

How has sexuality come to be imagined and theorized historically and how has it emerged as an object
of inquiry in the social sciences? What are the cultural processes through which the conceptual, expe-
riential and embodied categories of male/female, man/woman, masculine/feminine are produced?
How is the relationship between nature and nurture talked about? This course addresses these ques-
tions by examining gender and sexuality as a set of social relations whose boundaries are fluid, and
that occupy a range of possibilities. We will look at ideas of sex, classifications of sexuality, and ritual-
ized practices that form a multitude of sexual cultures--from "boy insemination" in Melanesia to the
"third gender hijras" in India, to the "Pride" marches in San Francisco and New York City. Through a
variety of cross cultural texts, we will explore the ways in which particular sites, for instance, the do-
mestic sphere, the work place, political movements, the clinic, the anthropological field site, become
gendered spaces. In so doing, we will also reflect on anthropology and ethnographic writing as gen-
dered pursuits.

Beliefs in magic, malign and otherwise, have been nearly universal in human experience. This course
examines these beliefs in an attempt to understand their cognitive basis, symbolic effectiveness, and
social consequences. In particular we will approach the question of "magical thinking": is magical
thought "mistaken science" or a universal non-rational way of seeing the world? What does the fact of
presumably rational people holding apparently irrational beliefs say about the whole idea of rationali-
ty? Are witches self-aware agents who believe in the malign magic they practice, or are they innocent,

ANTH 333(F) AIDS in Cultural Perspective*
AIDS constitutes a complex social phenomenon--a pandemic, an illness, a set of symbols, a network
of relations, a way of life. It is undoubtedly the source of intense individual and social suffering. It is,
at the same time, a cultural object whose meanings shift with the particular contexts in which it circu-
lates. This course will explore the historical, cultural and political-economic dimensions of AIDS in a
variety of settings and manifestations: as a biomedical, epidemiological, statistical and juridical cate-
gory, as a chronic illness that generates personal narratives, as a reflection of global and local inequi-
ties of power and material resources, as the generator of social and political mobilization at the local
and transnational level, and as a metaphor for the conditions of modern life. We will examine ethno-
graphic material from North America, Latin America and the Caribbean, Africa and Asia that will
show how AIDS and responses to it exist within "local moral worlds." We will also look at reports
from the WHO and UNAIDS, journalistic and popular writing and films to analyze some of the lan-
guage and imagery that comes to surround AIDS.

The U.S. military campaign in Afghanistan climaxes a quarter-century of conflict in that country.
Though the greatest suffering has been borne by the Afghan people themselves, the rest of the world
has also been profoundly affected by the events that have taken place in Afghanistan. This course
examines the history of Afghanistan's recent travails and the legacy of the conflict. Among the issues
we will consider are the conflict of Marxism and militant Islam in Afghanistan and the guerrilla
struggle that arose in response to the Soviet invasion in 1980; the rise of the Taliban and their treat-
ment of women; the role of non-Afghan "volunteers" in the war and the evolution of al-Qaeda; the
process of nation-building and reconstruction; and the involvement of the United States in Afghani-
stan and the implications of the Afghan campaign for U.S. foreign, military, and domestic policy. In
addition to reading about and discussing various aspects of the war, its causes and its aftermath, stu-
dents will also have an opportunity to work with the Williams Afghan Media Project archive of video

ANTH 364T(F) Ritual, Politics, and Power (W)*
Power is distributed unequally in society, and one of the main avenues by which this distribution
comes about and is maintained is through ritual. History tells us that power is nothing until it is ritual-
ized, for it is only through ritual means that power can be concentrated, maintained, and transmitted.
At the same time, the converse is also true. For those contesting the way power is distributed in soci-
ety, ritual provides a necessary weapon for mobilizing support and undermining the legitimacy of
those in charge. This course looks at the relationship between ritual, politics and power from a variety
of disciplinary perspectives and in a number of different socio-cultural contexts. Beginning with the
ethological and psychological study of ritual, we will consider some of the ways in which anthropolo-
gists and sociologists in particular have examined ritual's role in society, as well as the elementary
forms of political ritual, such as rites of passage, sacrifice, and kingship. We will investigate the extent
to which rituals are similar in `traditional' and `modern' contexts. We will also examine the role ritual
plays in political resistance and the question of whether and in what circumstances rituals are subver-
sive or constitutive of the dominant structures of authority.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: students will write a 5-page paper every other week and will be given
the opportunity to rewrite one or more of these papers.

goals of terrorism directed against the United States at home and abroad, with a particular focus on
terrorism emanating from radical Islamists in the last quarter-century. Special attention to: the resur-
gence of militant Islam and the reasons for Islamists' antagonism toward the West; the recruitment,
training, and indoctrination of terrorists; the ideologies and self-images of terrorists; case studies of
specific terrorist attacks and their social psychological effects on American citizens. Third, the course
examines military actions taken to extirpate terrorism and the efficacy of such actions. Fourth, the
course analyzes the exigencies and dilemmas of ensuring public safety in a democratic society. Spe-
cial attention to: the structure and ethos of intelligence work; the investigation of terrorist networks
and their financing; the technology and organization of ascertaining identities; and the control of ille-
gal immigration. Fifth, the course examines the threat of terrorists' use of biological, chemical, and
nuclear weapons of mass destruction and the defenses against such threats. Finally, it appraises the

The course analyzes five criminal organizations that have emerged in different times and contexts: the
Sicilian Cosa Nostra, the American Mafia, the Russian Mafia, the Hong Kong Triads and the Japanese
Yakuza. We explore the extent to which these cases, notwithstanding their differences, share crucial
characteristics and features. The course begins by defining State, Mafia group, Mafia and organized
crime, and distinguishes the Mafia from superficially related phenomena, such as corruption and pa-
tronage. The course examines parallels between state behavior in early modern Europe and Mafia
behavior as well as the nature of the protection market and what Mafias do in both legal and illegal
markets. The second part of the course focuses on how Mafias perform their roles. We shall study the
resources, the organization, and instances of co-operation and competition between Mafias. The third
part of the course analyzes the relationships between Mafias and other organizations, such as states,
political parties, and politicians. We shall ask whether `Mafia protection' is supplied by organizations
other than Mafias, such as insurgent and nationalist movements. Finally, the course explores the fac-

SOC 218(F) Law and Modern Society
This class is designed to introduce students to the field of law and society. The course begins with an
overview of the various theoretical perspectives on the subject: both classical (i.e. functionalism, con-
flict theory, and Weberian interpretations of legal rationality) and contemporary (i.e. structuralism,
critical legal studies, and cultural perspectives on the law). Among the themes reviewed in this section
are sociological understandings of deviance, legitimation, and the law's relationship to religion and
the economy. Employing the interpretive frameworks supplied by the theoretical models, the next part
of the course reviews empirical research in criminal and civil law, including investigations into the
behavior of police, the criminal courts, jails and prisons, personal injury tort law, civil disputing, plea
bargaining, and other dimensions of civil litigation. The course concludes with an examination both
of the influence of social change on the nature and direction of law and, conversely, of the effects of
legal change on culture. Considered in this part of the course are the changing cultural and legal under-
standings of freedom, sexual behavior, family, and education.

SOC 309(F) Altruism and the Rescue of Persecuted Minorities*
Genocide is a feature of modern life, from Yugoslavia to Rwanda. Equally important is the individual
and/or collective rescue of persecuted people. This seminar explores why and under what conditions
some people risk danger to themselves in order to rescue others. The first part of the seminar examines
various explanations of altruistic behavior, ranging from notions of altruism as sophisticated self-in-
terest; as kin selection; as reciprocity; as empathy or sympathy; as rooted in specific"altruistic" per-
sonalities; or as stemming from moral motivations, often based in religion. We also explore the con-
nection between altruistic behavior, economic incentives, and situational factors, which either facili-
tate or hamper pro-social motivations. The second part of the seminar focuses on altruistic behavior in
risky situations, with a special focus on the rescue of Jews during the Holocaust, the rescue of Arme-
nians during the 1915 Turkish persecution, and the rescue of black slaves through the underground
railroad in the United States. Topics include the importance of being asked for help; the nature of col-
lective action; the social organization of rescue efforts through networks of like-minded empathizers;
the avoidance of moral responsibility through diffusion; and group size and empathy avoidance. Spe-
cial attention to the study of foreign humanitarian interventions undertaken by international organiza-
tions and states in the post-Second World War period, with specific focus on the dilemmas faced by

propaganda-political, commercial, social, and organizational-will be considered with attention to pro-
paganda that seeks to overthrow social structures as well as maintain them. The course will proceed
through a series of intensive case studies with a particular focus on propagandists themselves, consid-
ered as experts with symbols, and on the institutional milieux in which they work. Among other ex-
amples, we will examine the U.S. Committee on Public Information during the First World War; the
Nazi Ministry of Propaganda; the propaganda machinery in contemporary states of both the left and
right, with special attention to the Middle East; conservative and liberal "public interest" groups; pro-
paganda in contemporary social movements and national political campaigns; the workings of corpo-

Art History Route: The history of art is different from other historical disciplines in that it is founded
on direct visual confrontation with objects that are both concretely present and yet documents of the
past. We concentrate on architecture, painting, sculpture--the richest visual expressions of culture.
Since works of art embody human experience, we use the work of all other disciplines to understand
them, such as social history, perceptual psychology, engineering, psychoanalysis, and archaeology.
Because of its concentration on the visual experience, the Art History major increases one's ability
to observe and to use those observations as the basis for critical thought.
Art

ArtH 101-102 introduces students to a series of critical studies of important works selected from the
history of Western art from antiquity to the present. The critical approach of the introductory course is
maintained in all further courses, especially by assigned study of original works in the Williams Col-
lege Museum of Art, Chapin Library, and the Clark Art Institute.
An introductory studio course, ArtS 100, in which no artistic talent or prior experience are as-
sumed, provides vital training in what is a visual as well as a verbal discipline. The requirement of a
course in non-Western art expands majors' geographic as well as cultural horizons, and the require-
ment of two courses in art from periods prior to 1800 provides a necessary concentration on earlier
moments in culture. (As the contemporary architect, Philip Johnson, said, "You cannot not know his-
tory".) The junior course (ArtH 301) develops awareness of the theoretical implications, as well as the
possibilities and limitations of different art-historical methods. The requirement of a seminar or grad-
uate course in the senior year enables students to apply that knowledge of methodology to their most
specialized work in the Art History route.
Art Studio Route: The studio division of the Art major has been structured to foster the development of a
critical understanding of making art; to support creative interests and to develop students' perceptions and
imaginations as they investigate a variety of visual media. Drawing I, ArtS 100 serves as an introduc-
tion to the basic drawing and design principles which establish the foundation for the development of
visual expression. ArtH 101-102, an introduction to the history of Western art, provides part of the neces-
sary background in the critical analysis of art. The 200-level ArtS courses provide opportunities to learn the
elements of some of the principal visual arts media: architecture, painting, photography, printmaking,
sculpture, and video. These courses combine technical foundations in the medium with analysis of the
interrelation of visual form and content. The 300- and 400-level courses place a greater emphasis on the
application of appropriate visual skills and strategies to particular thematic concerns, and to the develop-
ment of the student's individual vision. All studio art seniors exhibit their work in the Williams College
Museum of Art as a part of the requirements for the major.
History and Practice Route: This route allows students to study in depth both the history of art and the
making of it. It offers considerable flexibility: students may propose courses of study that emphasize partic-
ular media, themes or methodological issues. To mention just three examples, students may design se-
quences of courses that focus on architecture, gender or narration in both the history of art and contempo-
rary practice. And students may take more courses in one wing of the department than the other, as long as
the minimum requirements in each wing are satisfied. The History and Practice route is especially well-
suited to students interested in arts-related careers outside of higher education, including work in art galler-
ies, art museums, and primary or secondary school education. Courses of study for History and Practice
majors must be approved by two members of the faculty, one from each wing of the department. Any
changes in a History and Practice course of study must also be approved by two advisors.
History and Practice Faculty Advisors: Michael Glier, Ann McCallum, and Ben Benedict in stu-
dio; E. J. Johnson and Michael Lewis in history.
COURSE NUMBERS
First Digit
The introductory courses in both Art History and Studio have 100-level numbers and are prerequisites for
most other courses in the department. The distinction between 200- and 300-level offerings is either one of
difficulty or of the sequence in which material is best taken. Also, lecture courses with no prerequisite have
a 100- or 200-level number. The 400-level seminars and tutorials are intended for advanced students, usu-
ally senior majors.
Middle Digit
Art History (ArtH)
Middle digit distinguishes courses according to geographical area, or time span covered. 0 = general; 1 =
Ancient; 2 = Medieval; 3 = fifteenth, sixteenth century; 4 = seventeenth, eighteenth century; 5 = nineteenth
century; 6 = twentieth century; 7 = Asian; 8 = African; 9 = independents, honors.
Art Studio (ArtS)
Middle digit distinguishes introductory and general courses from those specialized in different media and
arts. 0 = introductory; 1 = general; 2 = architecture; 3 = drawing; 4 = painting; 5 = photography; 6 = print-
making; 7 = sculpture; 8 = video; 9 = independents, honors.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN ART
Students who wish to become candidates for the degree with honors must show prior evidence of
superior performance in the major as well as research capabilities to carry out the proposed project.
Art History:
In order for a project to be considered, the candidate (1) must have arranged for an advisor, and (in
consultation with the advisor) a second reader to supervise and evaluate the project (2) should normal-
ly have had one course with the advisor. In addition, the topic must be within the advisor's areas of
competence and should normally be related to course work which the student has done previously. In
Art
­ 67 ­
the case of an interdisciplinary proposal, the second reader should normally come from the other dis-
cipline.
The student submits a 2-page proposal including a statement about the preparation for the project, a
description of the topic and a general bibliography. Following approval by the faculty advisor and
second reader, this proposal is reviewed by the entire Art faculty, who have the option to request revi-
sions and to refuse the proposal. Students should keep in mind that a thesis in Art History is not neces-
sary for admission to graduate study.
It is the responsibility of the candidate to select one of the following routes and to meet all dead-
lines. Students who are not making satisfactory progress on their research and writing will not be al-
lowed to continue with the thesis. The completion of the requirements, however, will not guarantee a
degree with honors. The degree with honors will be awarded for projects demonstrating a high degree
of scholarly achievement and self-motivation. All proposals must be submitted according to the
guidelines set out below. The timetable for submission of work, including specific dates, is available
in the Art Department office.
Students may select one of the following options:
1) Full-Year Thesis: Research and writing will be carried out during both semesters and WSP of the
senior year (students should register for ArtH 493-W031-494). The thesis topic, advisor and se-
cond reader must be determined by April 15 of junior year. Students who are on overseas pro-
grams junior year are advised to make arrangements prior to their departure, but they may submit
a final proposal two weeks before the fall semester of senior year if they have made the necessary
arrangements. After the thesis is submitted, the candidate for honors shall present an oral defense
before faculty and peers.
2) Half-Year Thesis: Research and writing will be carried out during fall term and winter study or dur-
ing winter study and spring term (Students should register for ArtH 493-W031 or W031-ArtH
494). For students who choose to complete the mini-thesis in the fall, proposals must be submitted
by April 15 of the junior year. For those planning to complete the mini-thesis in the spring, propos-
als must be submitted by November 1.
A student's project is judged by two members of the department, the advisor and second reader; in
the case of an interdisciplinary project, a member of the Art Department and a member of the other
relevant department or program function as advisor and second reader. In rare cases, a third reader
may be appointed by the department at the request of the advisor or second reader.
All routes require that one course and one WSP, in addition to the ten required courses for the major,
be dedicated to the honors project.
Art Studio: (for the Class of 2002)
The Art Studio division of the Art Department offers a specialization route toward departmental
honors. This route, which requires the completion of a substantial body of independently produced
visual work, consists of two courses constituting a clearly interrelated pattern of study. The first of
these must be a WSP 033 in the senior year, followed by ArtS 418T Senior Tutorial.
In the spring of the junior year, the student should consult with a prospective faculty adviser and
declare her/his intent to pursue the degree with honors to the department chair. Potential honors candi-
dates should submit a written proposal and visual documentation of prior work in the field, to the fac-
ulty adviser, on the first Monday in October, in the fall of the student's senior year. The proposal
should outline a concise and specific course of study in media with which the student can evidence
prior experience. The evidence is provided by the visual documentation, in the form of a slide portfo-
lio or video tape. Students should seek assistance from their advisers both on the written proposal and
the selection of visual documentation. The studio faculty, as a whole, will review the proposals and
support materials. The faculty adviser will inform the student of the faculty members' decision prior
to Winter Study registration. Students whose honors proposals are approved by the faculty must enroll
in WSP 033 and Arts 418T in the spring semester of the senior year. Members of the studio faculty will
review the work in progress, at the end of February. Only candidates who succeed to evidence a suffi-
cient amount of work and substantial progress will be allowed to continue to pursue the degree with
honors.
To be considered for honors a student must successfully complete all requirements for the major.
Each honors candidate will be expected to have demonstrated the ability to work independently and
the understanding of what is required to develop a body of work that investigates a thesis. The project
will culminate in a presentation agreed upon by the student, the faculty advisor, and the faculty tutor
teaching ArtS 418T. All candidates will be required to present the department with a set of no fewer
than twenty slides that document the work completed during the project. This documentation will be
accompanied by a written description of the project.
The awarding of honors will be decided by the studio faculty of the department, on the recommen-
dation of the student's advisor and the faculty member teaching ArtS 418T, based on performance in
the two related courses. Highest honors are normally awarded only to students whose performance in
both the honors program and other courses in the major has been exceptional.
Art
­ 68 ­
Art Studio: (starting with the Class of 2003)
Studio art concentrators who wish to be candidates for honors are required to add a 200-level
course, and to take the 400 level senior tutorial. An additional 300 level tutorial or 200 level course
must be added for a total of twelve courses.
Honors candidates enrolled in the senior tutorial must "evidence" prior experience in the media
chosen for the honors work. This "evidence" may consist of one or more 200-level courses in the me-
dium, course work at the 300 level and/or a slide portfolio demonstrating the student's proficiency in
the media chosen for the honors project. This work is presented to the senior tutorial instructor at the
start of the spring semester.
At the end of the spring semester, of the senior year, the honors candidate will orally defend his/her
work in the senior exhibition at WCMA. The entire studio faculty will attend the defense. Based on
the work and the oral defense, the studio faculty (as a whole) will designate honors, high honors or no
honors.
History and Practice:
The route to honors is a combination of the Art Studio and Art History honors routes. At the begin-
ning of senior year, a candidate for honors in History and Practice makes a proposal to two faculty
members, one faculty advisor from each wing of the department. If both advisors agree to supervise
the project, the candidate enrolls in independent study and works through the fall semester and winter
study. The progress of the project is assessed by both advisors at the end of winter study; if the project
is not well enough developed, the advisors may end it at that time. If the project is allowed to move
forward, the student enrolls either in ArtS 418T Senior Tutorial, if the project is primarily a matter of
making art, or in an Honors Independent Study, if it is primarily a writing project. The final project is
submitted to the two advisors, who will determine whether or not it will receive honors.

ARTH 203(F) Chicana/o Film and Video*
Hollywood cinema has long been fascinated with the border between the United States and Mexico.
This course will examine representations of the U.S.-Mexico border, Mexican Americans, and Chica-
na/os in both Hollywood film and independent media. We will consider how positions on nationalism,
race, gender, identity, migration, and history are represented and negotiated through film. We will be-
gin by analyzing Hollywood "border" and gang films before approaching Chicana/o-produced fea-
tures, independent narratives, and experimental work. This course will explore issues of film and
ideology, genre and representation, nationalist resistance and feminist
critiques, queer theory and the performative aspects of identity.
Evaluation: one short paper, mid-term exam, final exam and take home essays.

ARTH 213(F) Greek Art and Myth (Same as Classics 213)
At no other time in the history of art is myth represented with as much immediacy and sophistication
as in Greek art. In this course, we will become familiar with the representation of the figures and the
stories of the gods, goddesses, heroes, and heroines in painting and sculpture of the seventh through
first centuries B.C. Of special interest will be: the various techniques developed by Greek artists for
representing narratives visually; the historical, social, and conceptual issues that underlie mythology,
such as war, marriage, sacrifice, and the nature of men, women, and the gods; and the various modern
approaches to the interpretation of Greek myths, including the myth-and-ritual school, psychoanaly-
sis, and structuralism. Reading will include selections from ancient authors in translation, such as
Homer, Hesiod, Pindar, Aischylos, Sophocles, and Euripides, as well as from modern scholarship on
Greek art, myth, and narrative.
Format: lectures, illustrated with slides. Requirements: six 15-minute quizzes, one short paper, and a
final exam.

ARTH 220(S) The Mosque*
The mosque (masjid) is the site of communal prayer rituals and other activities of Isalm. By definition,
it must simply be a clean space oriented towards Mecca. In actuality, mosques have taken diverse
architectural forms ranging from simple hypostyle halls of mud-brick to elaborate complexes of rein-
forced concrete and plate glass. This course will address the stylistic and regional differences from the
seventh to twentieth century, including the columned halls of the central Arab lands, the centralized
domed structures such as monumental calligraphy, glazed tilework and stucco. The course will culmi-
nate in a consideration of modern mosque architecture in which tradition and modernism combine to
generate new forms of sacred space.

ARTH 222(F) Rome as City and Idea
Rome and its empire were synonymous from the beginning, unlike other imperial capitals like Paris,
London, or Baghdad. Thus Rome is an idea--one of the central ideals of western culture--as much as
it is a venerable, actual place. This course will trace the history of the city and its ideological projection
from the physical decline of late antiquity, through the Christian transformation of the middle ages, to
the archaeological project of recovering pre-Christian Rome that was initiated in the fourteenth and
fifteenth centuries. We will study the Christian reuse of old Roman buildings and art forms as well as
new churches and their mosaic and sculptural decoration.

This course will look at the art and architecture of Constantinople (Byzantium) and its empire from
the fourth to the fifteenth centuries. Considering major works of architecture, gold and glass mosaics,
frescoes, book illuminations, panel paintings (icons), enamels, jewelry and silks, it will explore the
means by which the Byzantines constructed their spiritual and worldly identities through art. Issues to
be explored will include the visual expression of imperial power, the phenomenon of iconoclasm, the
Byzantine concept of portraiture, religion and magic in Byzantine art, and the techniques employed
by Byzantine artists.

ARTH 231(S) Italian Renaissance Art
An introduction to Italian painting, sculpture, and architecture from the fifteenth and sixteenth centu-
ries. Unlike other academic disciplines, art history continues to refer to this period as a renaissance or
"rebirth." Why is this the case? To what extent is this a useful definition? We will consider these ques-
tions by paying critical attention to the ideals that have come to define the Renaissance as a period of
astounding creativity and achievement in the visual arts: the rebirth of classical culture, renewed
attention to naturalism, and developing individuality and intellectual status of the artist. We will then
take up a series of thematic lenses (including religion, domestic life, gender identity, civic ritual, polit-
ical power, and artistic style) in order to pose questions about the character and purpose of art in differ-
ent social contexts. The goal of this course is not to present an exhaustive survey of the period, but
rather to provide a broad range of frames of reference for thinking about Renaissance art.
Format: lecture and discussion. Requirements will include a midterm, a final, and two papers.
Prerequisites: ArtH 101-102. Open to majors as well as non-majors. Enrollment limit: 40.
Hour: 11:00-12:15 MW SOLUM
ARTH 232(F) The Visual Culture of Renaissance Rome
During the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, the city of Rome saw itself transformed from a shrinking
and neglected medieval town into a thriving center of artistic achievement. This lecture course fo-
cuses on the historical, geographic, and ideological forces behind this period of renovation and resto-
ration forces that reworked the urban fabric of the city while shaping the character of the visual arts
from Filarete and Fra Angelico to Bramante, Michelangelo, and Raphael. We will examine monu-
ments such as Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel, then, not only as touchstones for the history of western
art, but also as images capable of reflecting, and even constructing, a uniquely Roman sense of power,
time, and historical destiny.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: midterm, final, and two papers. Prerequisites: ArtH

American art is often looked at as a provincial version of the real thing--i.e., European art--and
found wanting. This course examines American architecture, painting, and sculpture on its own
terms, in the light of the social, ideological and economic forces that shaped it. Special attention will
be paid to such themes as the Puritan legacy and attitudes toward art; the making of art in a commercial
society; and the tension between the ideal and the real in American works of art.
Requirements: three 5-page papers, midterm, final, and a field trip.
Prerequisites: ArtH 101-102 or permission of instructor.

ARTH 266(F) History of Russian Art (Same as Russian 208)
This course offers a survey of Russian art from the first to the third millennium, from religious icons to
commercial ones. We will look at early broadsides, society portraits, landscapes, and genre paintings,
as well as a wide range of Russian handicrafts. Special emphasis will be placed on the halcyon period
from 1910 to 1930, when Russian Cubo-Futurists, Suprematists, and Constructivists profoundly in-
fluenced the development of art throughout the Western world. After examining the Socialist Realism
of the Stalin era, we will progress through Moscow conceptualism to the current appropriation of
Western style into a post-Soviet aesthetic.
Requirements: active class participation, two 3- to 5-page papers, one class presentation, and a final
10-15 page paper or final exam.

ARTH 269(S) Contemporary Performance Art History: Space, Time, Action
The artist's body was increasingly used as both the subject and object of art in the twentieth century.
By focusing on visual artists engaged in performance practices, we will examine the connections be-
tween time, action, and space, and the role of documentation in ephemeral forms of art. We will con-
sider how the body became a formal medium and its impact on the theory and practice of the visual
arts from the 1970s to the present. Throughout the course, we will explore the relationships between
form, content, theory, practice, site, and context as well as analyze the visual, conceptual, and political
effects (and possibilities) of the work.

ARTH 302(S) Plans, Planners, Planning (Same as Environmental Studies 320)
This course seeks to explain the rise of Anglo-American planning, by studying exemplars, thinkers,
and schemes during the modern period, such as utopian visions like Titus Salt's 1849 milltown: "I will
do all I can to avoid evils so great as those resulting from polluted air and water, and hope to surround
me a well-fed, contented and happy body of operatives." San Francisco's 1883 laundry restrictions,
the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893 in Chicago, New York's Zoning Resolution of 1916, prac-
titioners like Kessler, Bartholomew, Nolen, and Clathorpe, the new towns of Columbia and Reston,
theorists like Lynch will be among the topics for discussion and analysis, in a seminar stressing the
visual and spatial foci of plans.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class participation, class presentations, a final research
paper.

ARTH 307(S) The North-American Park Idea (Same as Environmental Studies 327)
This research seminar considers those sites whose nature may be displayed in an idealized form, for
reasons of stewardship, curiosity, delectation, or some other intention. Among the "open spaces" to be
studied, both in terms of design intent and design execution, are: commons and squares; groves and
pleasure grounds; cemeteries; exposition grounds; playgrounds; a few "landmark" subdivisions; and
those large natural areas or reservations generally subsumed, in common usage, by the wording "na-
tional park." Many of these "parks" are sites of leisure activities, and the design and furnishing of
outdoor recreation will be a major concomitant theme. One kind of primary evidence, in the form of
texts, will be contemporary reports, letters, and journals from the period of these sites' creation. Sec-
ondary evidence will lie in accounts of the behavior induced by the scouting, wilderness, ecological
and naturalist-explorer movements. Frederick Law Olmsted, Steven Mather, Robert Moses, and Walt
Disney are among the seminal figures whose careers in park creation will be scrutinized.
Evaluation will be based on four essays and a class presentation. (This course includes an obligatory
all-day field trip to the Boston environs, beginning with the new Financial District park at Post Office
Square, the seventeenth-century Old Granary Burying Grounds and the Boston Common, continuing
by foot out the Emerald Necklace some ten miles to the Arnold Arboretum's living collections and to
Franklin Park.)

ARTH 362(F) Art of California: "Sunshine or Noir"
California has long been considered a land of "sunshine and noir," unique in the national and interna-
tional imagination as a land of physical recreation and destruction, a land of opportunity and social
unrest. In this course, we will study the visual arts and culture of California from the 1960s to the
present. Although we will focus on southern California, particularly Los Angeles, we will also con-
sider movements in San Diego and the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Area. The course will approach
California pop, conceptual, funk, performance, installation, public, and media arts to pursue questions
of influence and interpretation concerning the relations between space, place, identity, and style in the
visual arts and popular culture. Alongside analyzing California's visual culture, we will examine the
region's cultural geography through historical and theoretical readings. Particular attention will be
given to the region's special relations to Hollywood, the automobile, beach-surf culture, and the great
diversity that characterizes the state.
Evaluation: two papers and a presentation.

ARTH 363(F) The Holocaust Visualized
This seminar will examine how memories of the Holocaust have been conveyed through visual means
and consider what historical, cultural and political circumstances have caused various nations to re-
member the Holocaust differently. We will discuss the issues prompted by public memorials, exhibi-
tions and, as one writer puts it, the "museumification" of concentration camps. How should we define
the Holocaust? Whose memory should take precedence? What is lost or gained by the inclusion of
texts with images? How might memory be misrepresented by the exhibition of visual materials such
as video testimony, photographs and artifacts? In addition, we will study art about the Holocaust, in-
cluding Art Spiegelman's non-comic "comic book" Maus and non-fiction films such as Night and
Fog,Shoah and Schindler's List, to ask whether constructed or simulated images can convey the expe-
rience of the Holocaust as well as documentary ones.
Requirements: active participation in class discussion and regular participation in a class listserver
discussion group, class trip to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, one
oral presentation, and one research paper; no exams.
No prerequisites, but course not open to auditors or first-year students. Enrollment limit: 12.

ARTH 376(F) Images and Anti-Images: Zen Art in China and Japan*
This seminar studies a variety of art forms (painting, ceramics, tea ceremony, and garden) in the con-
text of Zen in China and Japan. We will investigate the Zen aesthetic ideals and religious meanings
conveyed by these art forms. Special attention will be paid to the study of Zen painting from the
twelfth century to the fifteenth century, the golden age of Zen painting in both countries. Issues of
interest include, for example, the meanings and functions of Zen painting, iconography and its evolu-
tion, different patronage systems in China and Japan, and to what extent Japanese artists tried to break
away from their Chinese counterparts, while working with highly derivative material, both icono-
graphically and artistically.
Evaluation will be based on short essays, class attendance, participation in discussions, and oral pre-

ARTH 433(F) Mundus alter: The Arts in Renaissance Venice
To its modern-day visitors the city of Venice seems a world apart, yet a belief in Venice's singularity is
nothing new. The fourteenth-century Tuscan poet, Petrarch, referred to the island as mundus alter, or
another world, and Venetians themselves have long been cultivating a sense of "otherness." Distin-
guished by its great wealth and piety, stable government, diversity of peoples, and unique geographi-
cal situation (a city of canals that served as the European gateway to the Holy Land and Byzantium),
Renaissance Venice experienced this period of artistic renewal in ways different from other Italian
centers. This seminar will examine the art produced in Venice during the fifteenth and sixteenth centu-
ries with an underlying focus on the concept of Venezianità, or "Venetian-ness," that shaped the myth
in which the city wrapped itself.
Format: seminar. Requirements will include class discussion, presentations, and a 15- to 20-page re-
search paper.

ARTH 451(F) Sex, Race and Prostitution in Nineteenth-Century France: Manet's Olympia
and its Legacy (Same as Women's and Gender Studies 451)
An indisputable icon of modernism, Manet's Olympia, picturing a white working-class prostitute, a
black servant offering her flowers, and a black cat, caused an uproar of epic proportions when it was
exhibited in the Salon of 1865. The ways in which Olympia challenged codes of representation out-
raged contemporaries and continue to fascinate in our time. This course examines the valences of this
image, including the inflammatory discourses of realism, prostitution, and inter-racialism, from the
time it was exhibited to its most recent status as feminist cult image and gender bender. Beginning
with T. J. Clark's absorbing analysis of the critical writing of 1865 (The Painting of Modern Life,
1985), the course explores scholarly interventions by Michael Fried, Sander L. Gilman, Lorraine
O'Grady, and Denean Sharpley-Whiting, as well as influential writings on prostitution by Alain Cor-
bin, Hollis Clayson, and Charles Bernheimer. Finally, we consider the crucial role the painting and the
issues it raises continue to play in recent artistic productions by artists including Renee Green, Kazuo
Morimura, Renee Cox, Carrie Mae Weems, and Ida Applebroog. How might this "Olympia revival"
help us re-conceptualize the art historical discourse?
Format: seminar. Extensive reading, 2-3 short position papers, oral presentation, 15- to 20-page re-
search paper, attendance of relevant public lectures, and possible field trip to New York required.

ARTH 470(F) American Orientalism*
"Orientalism" has become a ubiquitous term in academic discourse but relatively little has been done
to explore the manifestations of this phenomenon in the realm of the visual arts, or to establish the
distinctive character of American Orientalism. Instead, the works of nineteenth-century painters such
as Gerome are often used to epitomized the visual evidence. This course will address this reduction-
ism critically, beginning with the American students of Gerome and proceeding chronologically and
comparatively. In the process, we will utilize both established and emerging art forms (e.g., advertis-
ing) to trace the efflourescence of orientalist imagery in the context of the emerging mass culture in
America. Students will be expected to undertake a major research project.

ART STUDIO COURSES
ARTS 100(F,S) Drawing I
The process of drawing develops a heightened awareness of the visual world. Your subjective experi-
ences and your objective experiences combine to form a larger perceptual understanding of the envi-
ronment in which you live. Drawing allows you an alternative use of these processes and provides a
format for stating what you know about the world. Drawing is an excellent means for improving your
skills in observing, seeing distinctions, and creating new meanings from your perceptions. This is an
introductory course which will investigate the properties of making an image on the two-dimensional
page. While drawing is an essential basis for much of the artmaking process, its use is not limited to
artists. Design, illustration, engineering, and science are among the many fields which incorporate
drawing.
Evaluation will be based primarily on the quality and quantity of work produced as well as some atten-
tion to the student's progress. Lab fee.
There are three to five sections of ArtS 100 offered each semester. Although individual faculty mem-
bers teaching beginning drawing do not follow a common syllabus, they share common goals. Syllabi
for each section are available either from the secretary's office in the W. L. S. Spencer Art Building or
can be obtained on the Hector file server: Departments, Art, and then ArtS 100.

This drawing course will continue to investigate the techniques, principles of organization, and ideas
which were introduced in the Drawing I course. Having become more familiar with the drawing pro-
cess, students will be encouraged, through selected problems, to expand and challenge the conven-
tions of markmaking. As with any discipline, familiarity with the rules allows the users to seek alter-
natives and develop definitions of how the drawing process can best be suited to their own visual vo-
cabulary. The range of exercises could include traditional materials on paper as well as combinations
of materials more commonly associated with non-art disciplines, i.e., computers, industrial materials,
literature, etc.
Evaluation will be based on evidence of each student's progress, as shown in a portfolio of drawings
made in class and as homework. Attendance and participation in class discussions are also considered

"New genre public art [is] visual art that uses both traditional and nontraditional media to communi-
cate and interact with a broad and diversified audience about issues directly relevant to their lives
[and] is based on engagement." So writes Suzanne Lacy, a long-time practitioner of such work. En-
gagement with members of the public is the premise on which this public art tutorial is founded: the
hands-on work of the class will consist in exploring issues directly relevant to the lives of our targeted
audience-participants. We will develop art designed for a life outside of the gallery, art that empha-
sizes a process of engagement with issues. We will investigate the places where we live, our environs,
listening, looking, reading, interviewing. Students will learn how to elicit concerns of local citizens
and, through workshops on computer visual drafting and collaborative processes, evolve projects that
will air those concerns in public settings and in public formats. Requirements: readings, exercises
with public places, journal writing on posed questions, taped interviews, drafts of projects pursued
with group, attendance at one public meeting of student's choice, final project and presentation.
Prerequisites: any 100-level course in ArtS or ArtH, and any 200-level course in the Art Department,

ARTS 319(F) Junior Seminar: Strategies of Imaging
The junior seminar addresses the interplay between artmaking practices and art theory and criticism.
This year the course will focus on three spaces of encounter for modern and contemporary art: the
museum, the street, and the living room. Students will engage critical materials and art historical ex-
amples related to these spaces, raising questions about public and private spaces, art and everyday life,
and twentieth-century shifts in practices of display and looking. The course will also address how
these sites have in turn served as actual source material for artists' productions. For example, how has
the space of the museum inspired work by Mark Dion, Joseph Cornell, Ann Hamilton, the Museum of
Jurassic Technology, Andrea Fraser, or Fred Wilson? How does the street figure as a space of appear-
ance and/or as a topic of inquiry in the work of Eduard Manet, Asco, Allan Kaprow, Adrian Piper, or
Doug Aitken? How does the living room become the subject of work by Andrea Zittel, Louise Lawler,
Pippilotti Rist, or Inigo Manglano-Ovalle, as well as the site of broadcast radio, tv, and internet fine
arts projects? Critical works may include writings that address these spaces by Lippard, Kirshenblatt-
Gimblett, Holston, Delaney, Chavoya, Baudelaire, Benjamin, Debord, Spiegel, Lefevbre, Corbusier,
Marguiles, and others.
A substantial amount of critical reading and viewing will be required, as well as regular journal en-

ARTS 364T(S) Artists' Books
This course will investigate the processes and ideas associated with the making of artists' books,
works that are fine art objects primarily using visual images and/or text. For example, individual proj-
ects could include literary text/visual image combinations, visual diaries, three-dimensional pop-up
books, solely visual narratives, autobiographies, animated "flip" books, or sculptural books. Limited-
editioned as well asone-of-a-kindwork will be encouraged. Media options include etching, lithogra-
phy, relief printing, hand painting, drawing, some photo processes and bookbinding techniques (from
boxes to hard binding). As a tutorial, this course is designed to meet individual needs, stress student
participation and responsibility for learning, and to examine differing points of view. Students will
meet in groups of two for discussion and critique of individual projects in the tutorial format: i.e., stu-
dents are expected to give a half hour presentation weekly regarding their projects and selected read-
ings, and to respond to criticism and questions by the peer student and the instructor. Students will also
meet once a week as a group for demonstrations, slide presentations, meetings with visiting artists,
and discussion of readings.
Evaluation will be based on student participation and conceptual and technical quality of the work.
There will be one required field trip during the semester. Lab fee.

ARTS 386T(S) Sexuality and Media (Same as Women's and Gender Studies 385T)
Sexuality and Media is a video production class focused on the representation of sexualities in film
and video. The course will ask, what visual and narrative strategies shape desire in media? What sto-
ries about normative and non-normative sexualities are told by means of those strategies? How has
historical context shaped the stories that media tells about sexuality, and how have queer media mak-
ers used media to shape the historical context that they live in?
Students will engage moving images from a variety of contexts, primarily cinema, avant garde film
and video, and tv news. Assignments will be realized as video productions, in response to issues
raised by the cinematic history of sexuality. Brief writing assignments will also be required.
Films and videos considered may include works by: Jean Genet, Dorothy Arzner, Jack Smith, Ken-
neth Anger, Chantal Ackerman, Isaac Julien, Shirley Clarke, Patty Chang, John Greyson, Lisa Cholo-
denko, Yoko Ono, Gregg Bordowitz, Denise Gonzalves, Andy Warhol, and others. Related readings
will also be required.
Art
­ 80 ­
This class will approach ideas and cinematic forms at a high level and a fast pace. In terms of media
production, however, no prior experience is necessary, and students will learn appropriate technical
skills throughout the course. Taught in a tutorial format, each student will meet with the professor in
groups of two, and will respond to thematic issues raised by the course material, using video produc-
tion as the primary medium of response.
Prerequisites: Drawing 100, Women's and Gender Studies 100, or American Studies 201, or permis-
sion of instructor.Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Preference given to Art majors, American Stud-

studio art majors, in consultation with the tutor, will determine the individual projects that will serve
as the focus of their work for the semester. During the course, students are expected to refine their
creative directions in a coherent and structured body of work which will be exhibited at the Williams
College Museum of Art. Students are responsible for buying their own materials.
Prerequisites: completion of all other studio courses required for the art studio route. Open to senior
Art majors only.

ARTS 497(F), 498(S) Independent Study
With current staffing limitations, it is difficult for studio faculty to supervise more than a very few
independent studies projects. We feel our curriculum includes rich and varied offerings and believe
that the need for most independent work can be met through those regular offerings.
Prerequisites: no student will be accepted into an independent study project unless he/she has com-
pleted two 200-level ArtS courses and one 300-level ArtS tutorial. Permission of the instructor is still
required.
GRADUATE COURSES IN ART HISTORY
Requirements for the Degree of Master of Arts in Art History
The degree is normally awarded upon successful completion of two years of resident graduate
study. To earn the degree the student must earn a grade of at least B- in each of ten courses, at least
six of which must be graduate seminars (including ArtH 504). In connection with the preparation of
a paper for the Graduate Symposium, students will register for an eleventh course (ArtH 509), to be
graded pass/fail, in their fourth semester.
In addition to completing the required courses, students must participate in a group study trip to
Europe during winter study period in the first year, complete a Qualifying Paper in January of the
second year, and satisfy the language requirement in the manner described below (see "Language
Courses").
Senior art majors may enroll in graduate seminars, space permitting, with the permission of the
instructor.
ARTH 501(S) Museums: History and Practice
This course will examine the history of museums in Europe and America, focusing on historical tradi-
tions and current expectations affecting institutional operations today. Historical tradition and current
practice as it relates to museum governance and administration, architecture and installation, acquisi-
tions and collections, cultural property issues, as well as the many roles of exhibitions in museum
programming will be addressed, along with museums' social responsibility as scholarly and public
institutions in an increasingly market-driven, non-profit environment.
Evaluation will be based on oral presentations as well as two term papers.

ARTH 502(F) Photography and the Graphic Arts During the Second Empire
In this seminar we will pursue an intensive study of French photography during the 1850s and '60s,
with an emphasis on the major technological innovations (the transition from paper negatives to glass,
and salt prints to albumen, as well as photomechanical processes) and the intersections between pho-
tography, printmaking, and painting. We will examine the roles of government commissions, photo-
graphic societies, public exhibitions, and contemporary criticism, as well as crosscurrents between
England and France. In addition to exploring commercial photography and amateurism, we will un-
dertake in-depth analyses of the careers of Gustave Le Gray, Édouard Baldus, Nadar, Charles Nègre,
and Charles Marville. This seminar meets in the study room of the Department of Prints, Drawings,
and Photographs of the Clark Art Institute.
Enrollment limit: 11, with reading knowledge of French strongly encouraged.

This course charts art history's evolution from the Renaissance to the present, with emphasis on the
questions and analytic methods the discipline has generated over the past century. Close readings of
art-historical texts that exemplify particular approaches will be checked against the interpretations
they might yield of individual artists, works, genres, or styles. Topics include: art history's institution-
al and intellectual history; style-based periodization; changing relationships between art history, art
theory, and art criticism; models for the interpretation of the visual arts, including iconography, se-
miotics, and anthropology; the social participation of art and artists; the challenges of identity politics
to traditional art history; and the writing of art history as a self-conscious practice. Each student will be
responsible for short papers and presentations on selected readings and works of art, and for a longer
final paper.

of art, artifacts, and decorative art objects; give them an understanding of the history of artist materials
and methods; and familiarize them with the ethics and procedures of conservation.
This is not a conservation training course but is structured to provide a broader awareness for those
who are planning careers involving work with cultural objects.
Class format will include slide presentations, lectures, gallery talks, hands-on opportunities, technical
examinations and group discussions. Sessions will be held at the Williamstown Art Conservation
Center, Williams College, Clark Art Institute, and the Governor A. Nelson Rockefeller Empire State
Plaza Art Collection in New York. Examination questions may be formulated from exhibitions at
these locations.
Six exams will be given. Exam scores will be weighed in proportion to the number of sessions covered
by the exam (e.g., the paintings exam, derived from six sessions in the course, will count as 25% of the
final grade). There is no overall final exam. Some exams may be designated "open book"; however,
all work should be a student's individual effort.

pression. The aim of the course is to introduce the student to the diverse ways in which thinkers, writ-
ers, and makers sought to understand and engage with the ocular. This course is intended as an
introduction to art and aesthetic theory as developed within medieval Islamic civilization, with special
attention to the study of vision, and its physical and psychological dimensions.

ARTH 563(F) Moving Pictures: The Un-Easy Relationship Between Early Film and Fine Art,
1895-1910
The introduction of new technology always changes the way we see--and the way we use visual rep-
resentations to communicate. This certainly was the case when film was presented to mass audiences
beginning in 1895. In this course we will try to situate early film (i.e., pre-feature films--actualities,
reenactments, skits, trick films, etc.) within the larger visual culture of the turn of the century by using
art historical methods to interpret it. Our primary goal will be to understand the impact of the new
medium by looking at early films side-by-side with fine art painting of the period.
The emphasis will be on definitions of reality and realism as they pertain to cinema and the American
Ashcan School (1900-1910), but broader issues of Impressionism and Post-Impressionism in New
York and Paris will also be explored.
Format: seminar. Requirements: There will be a short and a long paper, both of which will be present-

ARTH 568(S) Cubism and Its Interpretations
No artistic tendency of the early twentieth century had greater international impact than Cubism,
which affected the practice of artists of the most diverse orientation throughout Europe and Russia. It
is equally true that no twentieth-century movement has generated a comparable mass of critical and
scholarly literature. Indeed, a study of the historiography of Cubism can, arguably more than that of
any other twentieth-century tendency, serve as a microcosm of the evolving concerns of art-historical
discourse, from the formalism of the early to mid-twentieth century to more recent concerns with
sexuality, semiotics, "primitivism," the market, and social history. This seminar will closely re-ex-
amine the objects of classic Cubism themselves (primarily Picasso, Braque, Gris) as well as the devel-
oping historiographic interpretations of this art.
Requirements and basis for evaluation: students will be responsible for leading class discussion on
one set of readings, an oral report, to be presented in revised, written form at semester's end, and a
ten-minute critical commentary on another student's oral report.

LANGUAGE COURSES
Reading proficiency in two European languages is required for the M.A. degree in Art History at
Williams, and provision for attainment of this qualification is an integral part of the program of
study. Of these two, German is required, and French is recommended. Elementary and intermediate
undergraduate courses offered by the language departments are open to graduate students, and the
graduate program offers advanced, one-semester courses in French and German art-history read-
ings. A student who begins elementary language study after enrollment in the program should ex-
pect to take a sequence of courses. Details may be obtained from the graduate program office. En-
tering students with some previous language background will be asked to take a standard reading
examination for purposes of placement. A score of 500 is required for admission to the advanced
course. Students with scores below 500 will be enrolled in elementary language courses. Students
should aim to complete all language work no later than the end of the third semester.
To satisfy the requirement in each of the two required languages, a student must: (a) score 700 or
better on the SAT II reading examination upon enrollment in the program or, (b) complete satisfac-
torily (B- or better) and punctually all assignments and tests in the advanced courses. The same
standards and expectations apply to language courses as to other courses and seminars.
Second-year students who have successfully completed German 501-502 and have indepen-
dently developed their German language skills during the summer may, before the commencement
of their third semester of study, arrange to take a two-hour translation examination administered by
the graduate program. Students who pass the examination are exempted from German 509.
If appropriate to his or her course of study, a student may petition to substitute another language
for French. Instruction in Spanish, Russian, Latin, and Greek is regularly offered in the undergradu-
ate curriculum, whereas independent arrangements must be made for Italian, Dutch, and other lan-
guages.
GERM 501(F)-502(S) (101-102) Elementary German
This course is for students who have had no previous study of German. It consists of the regular under-
graduate introductory course.
GERM 509(F) Readings in German Art History and Criticism
Texts are selected from characteristic works of art history and criticism and from the specialized liter-
ature required in concurrent seminars.
Prerequisites: German 501-502 or the equivalent with a final grade of B- or above.
RLFR 511(F) Intensive Grammar and Translation
An intensive grammar course for students interested either in developing or in improving their basic
reading skills in French. Emphasis will be on a general review of grammar and sentence structure as
well as on developing a wide range of vocabulary centered around art history.
RLFR 512(S) Readings in French Art History and Criticism
An advanced translation course specializing in art history. Texts will be selected from fundamental
works of art history and criticism and from the specialized literature required in concurrent art semi-
nars in the Graduate Program in Art History.

The proposal should include a statement of the topic, a general description of the types of materials
available for study and how the study will be carried out, and the name of the faculty member who will
serve as advisor. Admission to the honors thesis program will normally be limited to students who
have maintained at least a B+ average in their courses for the major.
Students admitted to the program should register for ASST 493-W031-494, CHIN 493-W031-494,
or JAPN 493-W031-494. They will be expected to turn in the final draft of their thesis shortly after
spring break and to discuss their results formally with their faculty graders. Their final grades in the
three courses listed above and the award of Honors, Highest Honors, or no honors will be determined
by the quality of the thesis and the student's performance in the oral defense.
THE ASIAN STUDIES ENDOWMENT
The Linen summer grants for study abroad, the Linen visiting professorships, and several other
programmatic activities in the department are supported by an endowment for Asian Studies estab-
lished by family and friends in memory of James A. Linen III, Class of 1934, Trustee of the College
from 1948 to 1953 and from 1963 to 1982.

offered depending on student needs and available resources; interested students must contact the
coordinator of the Chinese Program well before the independent study is planned, and present a
proposal to the program coordinator of the professor with whom they are interested in working by
the first day of pre-registration week. Those students entering with proficiency in Chinese should
see the program coordinator concerning placement.
The department also offers courses on Chinese literature in translation for those students who
have no knowledge of the language but who wish to become acquainted with the major achieve-
ments in Chinese literary and intellectual history. Students having questions concerning these
courses should also see Professor Silber. For the purpose of the distribution requirement, all courses
in Chinese are considered Division I.
CHIN 101(F)-W088-102(S) Basic Chinese*
An introduction to Mandarin, the language with the largest number of native speakers in the world,
which is the official language of mainland China and Taiwan, and one of the official languages of
Singapore. Course objectives are for the student to develop simple, practical conversational skills and
acquire a basic proficiency in reading and writing in both the traditional and the simplified script at
about the 500-character level. This course, which assumes no prior background in Chinese, will con-
sist of approximately 60% training in speaking and listening with the other 40% spent on reading and
writing. Classes consist of a combination of "act" classes, conducted exclusively in Mandarin, where
students use the language in various types of drills and communicative activities; and "fact" classes,
conducted in Mandarin and English, where students learn about the language and culture. Both audio-
tapes and videotapes will be employed extensively.
Evaluation will be based on daily classroom performance, homework, quizzes, weekly tests, and a
final exam.
Credit granted only if both semesters and the winter study sustaining program are taken.

CHIN 234(S) Post-Mao Literature and Culture (Same as Comparative Literature 216)
(W)*
With the end of the Cultural Revolution and the death of Mao in 1976, China's social and cultural
scene began to loosen, and by the mid-1980s exploded with new venues, methods, and material. Writ-
ers, artists, and filmmakers, often influenced by the West, flexed the bounds of state control by experi-
menting with new forms and treating new or previously taboo themes. In this course we will trace
developments in Chinese culture from 1978 to the present, treating fiction (including works by Wang
Meng and Mo Yan), poetry (e.g., Bei Dao), reportage, essays, film (e.g., Zhang Yimou and Chen
Kaige), and popular culture from a variety of literary and cultural studies perspectives. All readings,
screenings, and discussions will be in English.
Format: discussion with some informal lecture. Evaluation with be based on class participation and

CHIN 275(F) China's Greatest Novel (Same as Comparative Literature 275)*
China's greatest novel,The Story of the Stone (also known asThe Dream of the Red Chamber) was writ-
ten in the mid-eighteenth century, when China was the largest and richest state in the world. Achieving
breadth and nuance only found in the Western traditionacentury later, this novel offers what seems to be
a realistic description of a wealthy extended family--with all its generational, gender, and class con-
flicts, power struggles, love stories, and economic and entertainment activities. Yet the novel also chal-
lenges the relationship between truth and fiction, reality and illusion, for the stone is magical, given life
by aBuddhistandaDaoistpriest.Wewillreadthenovelthroughtheperspectivesofliterarystudies,

CHIN 301(F), 302(S) Upper-Intermediate Chinese*
Although the oral skills will continue to receive attention, there is at this level increased emphasis on
reading and writing. A major goal of the course will be developing students' reading proficiency in
standard written Chinese, the grammar and vocabulary of which differ considerably from the collo-
quial written Chinese which was introduced during the first two years of instruction. About half of the
course will be devoted to newspaper reading, with the remainder consisting of several modules that
may include short selections from modern Chinese fiction, films, or other types of performance litera-
ture. Both simplified and traditional character texts will be used. Conducted in Mandarin.
Format: two 75-minute classes plus a 50-minute conversation session; primarily reading and discus-
sion, with students being required to write a short essay every other week. Evaluation will be based on
classroom performance, homework, quizzes, and a final exam.
Prerequisite: Chinese 202 or permission of instructor.
Hour: 10:00-10:50 MWF Staff
CHIN 401(F), 402(S) Advanced Chinese*
This course is designed to enhance the Chinese language proficiency of students who are already at
relatively advanced levels. A wide assortment of materials is used including (for speaking/compre-
hension) audiotapes, videotapes, and films featuring Chinese speakers from various segments of soci-
ety; and (for reading) newspaper and magazine articles dealing with Chinese politics and economics
as well as selections from modern Chinese literature. Conducted in Mandarin.
Format: two 75-minute classes plus a 50-minute conversation session; primarily reading and discus-
sion; students are required to write a short essay every other week. Evaluation will be based on class-
room performance, homework, quizzes, tests, and a final exam.

Hour: 2:35-3:50 MR Staff
CHIN 412(S) Introduction to Classical Chinese*
Also termed Literary Chinese in English and Wenyan or Gudai Hanyu in Chinese, Classical Chinese
was the standard written language of China from around the fifth century BC until the 1920s and
served for many centuries as the written lingua franca of China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam. More-
over, remnants of Classical Chinese are still used frequently in Modern Chinese, in both writing (e.g.,
newspaper and road signs) and speech (e.g., proverbs and aphorisms). After several weeks of study of
basic grammar and vocabulary, we will read short texts in literature, history, and philosophy from the
works of authors such as Confucius, Mencius, Laozi, Zhuangzi, Sima Qian, and the Tang poets Li Bai
and Du Fu. While the main objective is to develop reading proficiency in Classical Chinese, the
course also serves to enhance proficiency in Modern Chinese through classroom discussion in Man-
darin, translation of Classical Chinese into Modern Chinese, and comparison of Classical Chinese and
Modern Chinese vocabulary and grammar.
Conducted in Mandarin.
Evaluation will be based on classroom performance, homework, tests, and a final exam.

ASTRONOMY (Div. III)
Chair, Professor KAREN B. KWITTER
Professors: KWITTER, PASACHOFF. Observatory Supervisor/Instructor: SOUZA.
Why is the sky dark at night? What are those mysterious twinkling lights that dot the nighttime sky?
What is Earth's place in the Universe? Astronomy is the science that asks and tries to answer questions
like these. We have come a long way toward understanding what makes the sky appear as it does and
how the Universe is fashioned. The Astronomy Department offers courses for anyone who is inter-
ested in learning about the Universe, and who would like to be able to follow new astronomical dis-
coveries as they are made. All courses in Astronomy satisfy the Division III requirement. The Astro-
physics major, administered jointly with the Physics Department, and the Astronomy major, are de-
scribed below.
The beginning astronomy courses are offered on two levels. Astronomy 101, 102, 104, and
330-type courses are intended primarily for non-science majors, and have no prerequisite. Astronomy
111 is designed for students with some exposure to or interest in physics. It has a prerequisite of one
year of high school physics or permission of the instructor, and a corequisite of Mathematics 104 or
equivalent background in calculus.
Most of the astronomy courses take advantage of our observational and computational facilities: a
24" computer-controlled telescope with sensitive electronic detectors, and our own network of com-
puter workstations for image processing. The Astronomy Department homepage can be accessed on
the World Wide Web at http://www.williams.edu/Astronomy.
ASTROPHYSICS MAJOR
The Astrophysics major is designed for students who want a rigorous introduction to the field, and
includes not only those who plan graduate study in astronomy, astrophysics, or a closely related field,
but also those interested in a wide variety of careers. Alumni are not only astronomers but also com-
puter scientists, geologists, teachers, doctors, lawyers, business school professors, and so on. In recent
years, many astrophysics majors have had a second major in fields as wide ranging as mathematics,
geosciences, economics, and art history. This major emphasizes the description of the Universe and
its constituents in terms of physical processes. Potential Astrophysics majors should consult early
with members of the Astronomy and Physics Departments to determine their most appropriate route
to and through the major. An essential ingredient in such students' undergraduate training is experi-
ence in physics and mathematics. Therefore, the major normally will begin in the first year a student is
Astronomy, Astrophysics
­ 91 ­
at Williams with Physics 131, 141, or 151 and Mathematics 104 or 105 in the fall. Students with very
good background placing them out of Physics 142 and out of Mathematics 104 may choose to take
Physics 201 and Mathematics 105 instead. Astronomy 111 will often be taken in the fall of the sopho-
more year; however, many students take it in the fall of their first year at Williams, along with physics
and math. Students who might place out of physics courses should read the section on placement un-
der Physics. Students who place out of Physics 131 or 141 into Physics 142 or 151 should particularly
consider taking Astronomy 111 in the fall of their first year.
In addition to the major courses described below, other courses in geosciences, mathematics, and
computer science may also be appropriate.

en. Students entering with Advanced Placement in physics and/or mathematics may obtain credit to-
ward the major for the equivalent of Physics 141 and/or Mathematics 104 and/or 105 taken elsewhere,
but at least 8 courses in astronomy, physics, and mathematics must be taken at Williams. There are
some aspects of astrophysics that are closely related to chemistry or geosciences. In recognition of this
relation, certain advanced courses in those departments can be accepted for credit toward the Astro-
physics major on a two-for-one basis. It is not possible to double major in Astrophysics and Physics.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN ASTROPHYSICS
The honors degree in Astrophysics will be awarded on the basis of a senior thesis presenting the
results of an original observational, experimental, or theoretical investigation carried out by the stu-
dent under the direction of a faculty member in Astronomy or Physics. There are no specific grade
requirements (other than College-wide requirements for remaining in good academic standing) for
entry into the thesis research program; however, a student wishing to do a thesis should have demon-
strated both ability and motivation for independent work in previous courses and in any earlier re-
search involvement. Students doing theses will normally choose a topic and an advisor early in the
second semester of their junior year. During the senior year, those students whose proposals have been
approved will elect two courses and a winter study project in addition to the minimum requirements
for the major. Preparation for the thesis will occupy at least one course (Astrophysics 493) and the
winter study project (Astrophysics 031). At the end of the winter study period, the departments will
decide, in consultation with each student, whether to admit that student to honors candidacy. Both a
written thesis and an oral presentation to faculty and fellow students are required. The degree with
honors will be awarded to those who meet these requirements with distinction. The degree with high-
est honors will be awarded to those who fulfill the requirements with unusually high distinction.
The departments will be flexible with regard to the number and timing of courses devoted to thesis
research within the general guidelines of two courses and a winter study project over and above the
minimum major requirements and the written and oral presentations, especially in cases of students
with advanced standing and/or summer research experience. Students considering unusual requests
are urged to consult with potential advisors or the department chairs as early as possible.

ASTRONOMY MAJOR
The Astronomy major is designed for students with an interest in learning about many aspects of
modern astronomy, but who do not choose to take the advanced physics courses of the astrophysics
major. It is also appropriate as a second major for students concentrating in another field. The Astron-
omy major emphasizes understanding the observed properties of the physical systems that comprise
the known Universe, from the Sun and solar system, to the evolution of stars and star clusters, to the
Milky Way Galaxy, to external galaxies and clusters of galaxies. Because some knowledge of physics
and calculus is necessary to understand many astronomical phenomena, the Astronomy major re-
quires the first two semesters each of the physics and calculus that are also required of Physics majors
and Astrophysics majors.
There are several possible routes through the Astronomy major, depending on preparation and in-
terest. Students considering a major in Astronomy should consult with members of the department
early and often. A first-year student, unsure about choosing between Astronomy and Astrophysics,
may wish to take not only Astronomy 111 but also Physics 131, 141, or 151 and Mathematics 104 (if
necessary) in the fall. Students who might place out of physics courses should read the section on
placement under Physics.

ASTRONOMY COURSES
COURSES FOR NON-MAJORS WITH NO PREREQUISITES
ASTR 101(F) Stars: From Suns to Black Holes
What makes a star shine? For how long will the Sun keep shining? What are black holes and how can
they form? Astronomy 101, a non-major, general introduction to the part of contemporary astronomy
that includes how stars form and how they end their existence, will provide answers to these questions
and more. The course gives special attention to the exciting discoveries of the past few years. Topics
include modern astronomical instruments such as the Hubble Space Telescope, the Chandra X-ray
Observatory, the 10-meter Keck Telescopes, and the Very Large Telescope in Chile, and results from
them; how astronomers interpret the light received from distant celestial objects; the Sun as a typical
star (and how its future will affect ours); and our modern understanding of how stars work and how

ASTR 104(S) The Milky Way Galaxy and the Universe Beyond
It has been less than a century since the Sun was discovered not to be at the center of the Milky Way
Galaxy, and our Milky Way Galaxy determined to be only one of countless "island Universes" in
space. The new millennium is bringing a host of technological advances that are enabling us to under-
stand ever more clearly our place in the Universe and how the Universe began. For example, the
Hubble Space Telescope brings clearer images of celestial objects than have ever been obtainable be-
fore, and is allowing progress on determining the past and future of the Universe. The Chandra X-ray
Observatory, launched in 1999, is giving us unprecidentedly detailed views of violent objects like su-
pernova remnants and galaxies containing giant black holes. In addition, observations of the early
Universe are giving clues into how its currently observed structure arose, and is confirming and en-
larging our understanding of the Big Bang. Astronomy 104, a non-major, general introduction to part
of contemporary astronomy comprising the study of galaxies and the Universe, will explore the an-
swers to questions like: What is the Milky Way?; Why are quasars so luminous?; Is the Universe made
largely of "dark matter"?; Is there "dark energy"? What determines the ultimate fate of the Universe?
This course is independent of, and on the same level as Astronomy 101 and 102. Observing sessions
will include use of the 24" telescope and other telescopes for observations of stars, star clusters, plan-
ets and their moons, nebulae, and galaxies, as well as daytime observations of the Sun.
In labs, students will be able to explore concepts discussed in class; students will also have the oppor-

ASTR 336(S) Science, Pseudoscience, and the Two Cultures (Same as History of Science
336) (W)
A famous dichotomy between the sciences and the humanities, and public understanding of them,
was laid down by C. P. Snow and has been widely discussed, with ignorance of the second law of
thermodynamics compared with ignorance of Shakespeare. In this seminar, we will consider several
aspects of science and scientific culture, including how scientific thinking challenges the claims of
pseudoscience. We will consider C. P. Snow and his critics as well as the ideas about the Copernican
Revolution and other paradigms invented by Thomas Kuhn. We will discuss the recent "Science
Wars" over the validity of scientific ideas. We will consider the fundamental originators of modern
science, including Tycho, Kepler, Galileo, and Newton, viewing their original works in the Chapin
Library of rare books and comparing their interests in science with what we now call pseudoscience,
like alchemy. We will review the history and psychology of astrology and other pseudosciences.
Building on the work of Martin Gardner in "Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science," and using the
current journal "The Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine," we consider from a scientific point
of view what is now called complementary or alternative medicine, including both older versions
such as chiropractic and newer nonscientific practices.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on biweekly 5-page papers, participation in discussions,
and a 15-page final paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 12 (expected: 12). Preference will be given to juniors and seniors

A focused investigation of the possibility of life arising elsewhere in our Galaxy, and the chances of
our detecting it. In this course, pairs of students will explore the astronomical and biochemical re-
quirements for the development of Earth-like life. We will consider the conditions on other planets
within our solar system as well as on newly-discovered planets circling other stars. We will also ana-
lyze the famous "Drake Equation," which calculates the expected number of extraterrestrial civiliza-
tions, and attempt to evaluate its components. Finally, we will examine current efforts to detect signals
from intelligent alien civilizations and contemplate humanity's reactions to a positive detection.

ASTR 402(S) Between the Stars: The Interstellar Medium (W)
The matter between the stars--the interstellar medium--manifests itself in many interesting and un-
expected ways, and, as the detritus of stars, its properties and behavior hold clues to the history and
future evolution of both stars and the galaxies that contain them. Stars are accompanied by diffuse
matter all through their lifetimes, from their birthplaces in dense molecular clouds, to the stellar winds
they eject with varying ferocity as they evolve, to their final fates as they shed their outer layers,
whether as planetary nebulae or dazzling supernovae. As these processes go on, they enrich the inter-
stellar medium with the products of the stars' nuclear fusion. The existence of life on Earth is eloquent
evidence of this chemical enrichment.
In this course we will study the interstellar medium in its various forms. We will discuss many of the
physical mechanisms that produce the radiation we observe from diffuse matter, including radiative
ionization and recombination, collisional excitation of "forbidden" lines, collisional ionization, and
synchrotron radiation. This course will be both writing- and observing-intensive. Weekly short papers
will be assigned; these papers will be thoroughly edited by the professor and returned so that com-
ments can be absorbed for future submissions. In class, students will present key ideas from the as-
signed reading and will solve relevant problems. Throughout the semester students will also work in
small groups to design, carry out, analyze, and critique their own observations of the interstellar me-
dium using the equipment on our observing deck.
Format: seminar and discussion, 3 hours per week, plus computer work and observing. Evaluation
will be based on weekly papers, class presentations/problem-solving, and observing projects.

Biochemistry and molecular biology are dynamic fields which lie at the forefront of science. They
have provided important insights and advances in the elucidation of the relationship between the
structure and function of proteins, the molecules and cells of the immune system, enzyme structure
and action, membrane assembly and structure, DNA and RNA structure, the nature of the genetic
code, and the molecular basis of gene regulation. Recombinant DNA and other biotechnologies have
Biochemistry and Molecular Biology
­ 96 ­
provided new and powerful tools which have exciting applications. Current applications range from
the diagnosis and treatment of disease to enzyme chemistry, developmental biology, and the engineer-
ing of new crop plants.
The Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Program is designed to provide students with an oppor-
tunity to explore living systems in molecular terms. Biochemistry and molecular biology are at the
interface between the chemical and biological methods of looking at nature, therefore, the program
draws heavily from these disciplines. While chemistry is concerned with the relationship between
molecular structure and reactions, and biology focuses on cells and organisms, biochemistry and mo-
lecular biology probe the details of the structures and interactions of molecules in living systems in
order to provide the foundation for a better understanding of biological molecules both individually
and as members of more complex structures.
PROGRAM
While aspects of biochemistry and molecular biology can be very diverse, a common set of chemi-
cal and biological principles underlie the more advanced topics. With this in mind, the program has
been structured to provide the necessary background in chemistry and biology and the opportunity to
study the many facets of the modern areas of the biochemical sciences. Students interested in the Bio-
chemistry and Molecular Biology Program should plan their course selection carefully. Since it is ex-
pected that Biochemistry 321 and 322 would be taken in the junior year, students are advised to take
the prerequisites for those courses in both chemistry and biology during their first two years at Wil-
liams. While the program is open to all students, it is expected that it will appeal primarily to majors in
biology and chemistry because of the number of courses required in those fields. In addition to taking
the required courses, students planning to complete the Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Pro-
gram are strongly encouraged to elect courses in mathematics and physics.
THE FOLLOWING INTERDEPARTMENTAL SEQUENCE COURSES SERVE AS THE
CORE OF THE BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY PROGRAM
Biochemistry 321 and 322 provide a comprehensive introduction to biochemistry. These courses
taken in conjunction with Biology 202 Genetics and Biology 306 Advanced Molecular Genetics pro-
vide a thorough background in essentially all of the areas of modern biochemistry and molecular
biology.
BIMO 321(F) Biochemistry I--Structure and Function of Biological Molecules (Same as
Biology 321 and Chemistry 321)
This course introduces the basic concepts of biochemistry with an emphasis on the structure and func-
tion of biological macromolecules. Specifically, the structure of proteins and nucleic acids are ex-
amined in detail in order to determine how their chemical properties and their biological behavior
result from those structures. Other topics covered include enzyme kinetics, mechanism and cataly-
sis and regulation; the molecular organization of biomembranes and membrane transport; and the
principles of recombinant DNA technologies. In addition, the principles and applications of the meth-
ods used to characterize macromolecules in solution and the interactions between macromolecules
are discussed.
The laboratory provides an opportunity to study the structure of macromolecules and to learn the fun-
damental experimental techniques of biochemistry including electrophoresis and chromatography.
Format: lectures, three hours a week; laboratory, four hours a week. Evaluation is based on three hour
exams, a final exam, problem sets and performance in the laboratories including lab reports.
Prerequisites: Chemistry 202 and Biology 101. No enrollment limit (expected: 25).
Hour: 10:00-10:50 MWF Lab: 1-5 W,R GEHRING
BIMO 322(S) Biochemistry II--Metabolism (Same as Biology 322 and Chemistry 322) (Q)
This lecture course provides an in-depth presentation of the complex metabolic reactions which are
central to life. Emphasis is placed on the biological flow of energy including alternative modes of
energy generation (aerobic, anaerobic, photosynthetic); the regulation and integration of the metabol-
ic pathways including compartmentalization and the transport of metabolites; and biochemical reac-
tion mechanisms including the structures and mechanisms of coenzymes. This comprehensive study
also includes the biosynthesis of small molecules (carbohydrates, lipids, amino acids, and nucleo-
tides). Laboratory experiments introduce the principles and procedures used to study enzymatic reac-
tions, bioenergetics, and metabolic pathways.
Format: lectures, three hours a week; laboratory, four hours a week. Evaluation is based on several
exams, a paper, and performance in the laboratories including lab reports that emphasize conceptual
and mathematics analysis of the data generated.
Prerequisites: Biology 101 and Chemistry 202 or 155 and 251/255. May be taken concurrently with
Chemistry 256. Enrollment limit: 40 (expected: 36). Preference given to junior and senior Biology
and Chemistry majors and BIMO concentrators. This is a quantitative/formal reasoning course.

The Biology curriculum has been designed to provide students a broad base for understanding prin-
ciples governing life processes at all levels, from biochemistry and cell biology to physiology to envi-
ronmental biology and behavior. Courses emphasize fundamentals common to all subdisciplines in-
cluding the coupling of structure to function, the transfer of energy in living systems, communication,
and the molding of diversity by the evolutionary process. In upper-level courses and in independent
and honors research, students have the opportunity to investigate areas at the frontiers of modern biol-
ogy.
Although the Biology major is specifically designed to provide a balanced curriculum in the broad-
er context of the liberal arts, it is also excellent preparation for graduate studies in medicine and the life
sciences.

MAJOR REQUIREMENTS
In order to make the major accessible to students with diverse interests, required courses are kept to
a minimum. The Biology major is satisfied by nine courses, as follows:
Biology 101 The Cell
Biology 102 The Organism
Biology 202 Genetics
Any two 300-level courses, one of which must have a laboratory associated with it.
Any one 400-level course other than 493-494, 497, or 498.
Any other three courses or any other two courses and two semesters of Organic Chemistry.
NOTE: Independent study courses and AMS 311 (Same as Biology 231) do not fulfill the 300-level
or 400-level course requirements. Both WIOX 215, Biology: Ecology of Flowering Plants, and
WIOX 216, Biology: Evolution, in the Williams Oxford Program qualify for major credit.
Distribution Requirement
In order to ensure that majors broaden their knowledge of biology, one of the elective courses for
the major must include an upper-level course covering biological processes at levels of organization
above the cell. Courses that satisfy this distribution requirement are indicated in the individual course
description.
COURSE SELECTION AND PLACEMENT
It is preferable for students who plan to major in biology, or think they may be interested in doing
so, to take Biology 101, 102 during their first year at Williams. It is also possible to begin the Biology
major during the sophomore year, although students should understand that it may require taking sev-
eral semesters with two or more biology courses.
Students interested in biology, whether or not they intend to major in it, are encouraged to take Biol-
ogy 101, 102. It is also possible, with permission of the department, to take Biology 203 Ecology,
Biology 204 Animal Behavior, and Biology 220 Field Botany without prerequisite. Other biology
courses designed specifically for students who do not intend to take additional upper-level courses in
biology include Biology 132 Human Biology and Social Issues, Biology 134 The Tropics: Biology
and Social Issues, and Biology 133 Biology of Exercise and Nutrition. All of these courses satisfy the
Division III distribution requirement; in addition, Biology 134 satisfies the Peoples and Cultures dis-
tribution requirement.
Beginning students should normally enroll in Biology 101 and 102. Students with unusually strong
backgrounds in biology, such as those with outstanding performance on the College Board Biology
Advanced Placement Test, may be permitted to elect a sophomore-level course in lieu of Biology 101
and/or Biology 102 upon successful completion of a departmental qualifying exam.
COURSES RELATED TO THE BIOLOGY MAJOR
Students planning to pursue their interest in biology and related fields after completing their under-
graduate degrees are strongly encouraged to take one year of chemistry, at least one semester of math-
ematics (a course in statistics is recommended), and one semester of Physics. Students may wish to
check the requirements for graduate admission at relevant universities, and are also encouraged to
consult with the Biology Department's graduate school advisor, Professor Raymond, about prerequi-
sites for admission to graduate programs.
BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
Students interested in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (BIMO) should consult the general
statement under Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.
NEUROSCIENCE
Students interested in Neuroscience (NSCI) should consult the general statement under Neurosci-
ence.
ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
Students interested in Environmental Studies (ENVI) should consult the general statement under
Environmental Studies.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN BIOLOGY
In order to be recommended for the degree with honors, a Biology major is normally expected to
have completed the equivalent of two semesters and a winter study (031) of independent research
culminating in a thesis which demonstrates outstanding achievement of an original and innovative
nature. Although the presentation of a thesis and associated oral presentation in the fall and poster
defense in the spring are required for consideration for a degree with honors, their completion should
not be interpreted as a guarantee of a degree with honors. The principal considerations in admitting a
student to the program of independent honors research will be mastery of fundamental material and
skills, ability to pursue independent study successfully, and demonstrated interest and motivation.
Students interested in participating in the honors program should consult with the department prior to
spring break; approval must be received before spring registration in the junior year.
Biology
­ 99 ­
The minimum course requirements for a degree with honors in Biology are Biology 101, Biology
102, Biology 202, two 300-level biology courses (one of which must have a laboratory associated
with it), one 400-level biology course, Biology 493, Biology 494, WSP 031, and any other two
courses in biology (or any other one course and two semesters of Organic Chemistry).
In addition to the normal honors route, which includes two semesters (Biology 493-494) and a win-
ter study of research (WSP 031) during senior year, students have the option,subject to the approval of
their thesis advisor, to begin the honors research during winter study junior year or during the second
semester junior year. Students beginning honors in winter study of junior year would take Biology
494 in the spring of their junior year followed by Biology 493 in the fall of their senior year; students
beginning honors during the second semester of junior year would take Biology 494 that semester,
followed by Biology 493 in the fall of senior year and winter study research in the winter of the senior
year.
CREDIT FOR COURSES AT OTHER INSTITUTIONS
Students who enroll in study away programs may receive credit for up to two 200-level electives
towards the biology major upon approval of the course syllabi by the Biology Department's study
abroad coordinator, Professor Banta.
Students wishing to register for courses in biology involving college-level prerequisites should
consult, in person, with a member of the Biology Department, during the spring registration period.
Such consultations will include a review of the course syllabi and the transcripts of the relevant pre-
vious college work, and students should bring these materials with them.
BIOL 101(F) The Cell
This course provides an introduction to the cellular aspects of modern biology. It explains the devel-
opment of cell structure and function as a consequence of evolutionary processes, and it stresses the
dynamic properties of living systems. Topics considered include biological molecules and enzyme
action, membrane structure and function, energy exchange and design of metabolic systems, expres-
sion of genetic information, and cell signalling. In addition to textbook assignments, articles from the
recent biological literature will be assigned and discussed.
Format: lectures/discussions/laboratory, six hours a week. Evaluation will be based on hour tests, a
final exam, and weekly lab reports.

BIOL 132(S) Human Biology and Social Issues
From reading the headlines in newspapers and magazines one gets the impression that human society
is on the verge of a wondrous transformation to be brought about by the application of new biological
knowledge. Can science really provide us with a future that is free of disease and social problems? Is
biology the important underlying dictator of who we are and how we live our lives? Or are we more
than the sum of our biological parts?
In lectures, we'll examine recent scientific advances and/or setbacks in understanding and manipulat-
ing human reproduction, development, inheritance, and health. In particular, research in the areas of
the Human Genome Project, gene therapy, cloning and cancer will be explored. In addition, in discus-
sion sections we will address the implications of this current research for individuals and for society as
a whole.
Format: lectures/discussions, approximately four hours per week. Evaluation will be based on hour
exams, a final exam, a short paper, and participation on a discussion panel.
No prerequisites. Closed to Biology and Chemistry majors; does not satisfy premedical requirement
in biology; does not count for Biology major credit. Enrollment limit: 80 (expected: 50). Preference

BIOL 134(F) The Tropics: Biology and Social Issues (Same as Environmental Studies 134)*
Intended for the non-scientist, this course explores the biological dimensions of social issues in tropi-
cal societies, and focuses specifically on the peoples and cultures of tropical regions in Africa, Asia,
Latin America, Oceanea, and the Caribbean. Tropical issues have become prominent on a global
scale, and many social issues in the tropics are inextricably bound to human ecology, evolution, and
physiology. The course begins with a survey of the tropical environment of humans, including major
climatic and habitat features. The next section focuses on human population biology, and emphasizes
demography and the role of disease particularly malaria and AIDS. The final part of the course covers
the place of human societies in local and global ecosystems including the challenges of tropical food
production, the importance of organic diversity, and the interaction of humans with their supporting
ecological environment.

BIOL 202(F) Genetics (Q)
Genetics, classically defined as the study of heredity, has evolved into a discipline whose limits are
continually expanded by innovative molecular technologies. This course covers the experimental ba-
sis for our current understanding of the inheritance, structures, and functions of genes. It introduces
approaches used by contemporary geneticists and molecular biologists to explore questions about as-
pects of biology ranging from embryonic development to aging. The laboratory part of the course
provides an experimental introduction to modern genetic analysis. Laboratory experiments include
linkage analysis, bacterial transformation with plasmids, DNA restriction mapping, and computer-
based cloning.
Format: lectures/laboratory, six hours a week. Evaluation: Biweekly problem sets, weekly laboratory
exercises and laboratory reports, and three examinations; 90% of the final grade is determined by per-
formance on written exercises and exams.
Prerequisites: Biology 101 and 102. No enrollment limit (expected: 85). This is a quantitative/formal

BIOL 206T(S) Genomics (W)
Genomics, the study of complete DNA sequences of organisms, has been touted as the new revolution
in biology. Yet at this early stage of the field, a limited amount of new biology has been revealed
through experimental and analytical manipulations of genomic information. This tutorial course,
Biology
­ 101 ­
aimed primarily at sophomores, explores the extent to which genomics research has, and has not, ex-
panded our understanding of biology. We begin by understanding the experimental means of acquir-
ing correct and complete DNA sequence(s) of a species. This background allows a critical analysis of
the current data and databases used in genomic analysis. Reading recent primary literature, we will
then fully examine experimental approaches that assess interesting biological phenomena on a ge-
nome-wide basis. For example, we will study papers describing the genome-wide changes in messen-
ger RNA levels when a pathogen infects a host, or when fruit flies proceed through a normal twenty-
four hour cycle, in order to assess how these experiments enlighten our understanding of particular
biological systems. The course will also explore topics in proteomics, the study of complete protein
sequences obtained from genomics analysis. The quest for understanding the diversity and evolution
of a protein family, for discovering a minimal genome capable of life, or for predicting the precise
molecular functions of proteins based on comparative genomic analyses are potential proteomics is-
sues to be analyzed.
The class will meet as a whole once per week to discuss and refine questions on required readings of
primary literature. Each student will also be assigned to a weekly tutorial meeting with the instructor
and one other student. Every other week at this tutorial meeting, students will present a written and
oral critical analysis of the assigned reading. Students not making a presentation will question and
critique the work of their colleague.
Format: discussion 75 minutes a week, tutorial meeting 1 hour a week. Evaluation will be based on
discussion participation, tutorial participation, and five tutorial papers of four pages each.

BIOL 301(F) Developmental Biology
Developmental biology has undergone rapid growth in recent years and is becoming a central orga-
nizing discipline that links cells and molecular biology, evolution, anatomy and medicine. We are now
beginning to have a molecular understanding of fascinating questions such as how cells decide their
fate, how patterns are created, how male and females are distinguished, and how organisms came to
be different. We have also discovered how the misregulation of important development regulatory
genes can lead to a variety of known cancers and degenerative diseases in humans. In this course we

We will examine the molecular and cellular bases of the transduction and encoding of physical phe-
nomena such as light, sound, and chemicals in a variety of organisms, including plants and invertebra-
tes. We will focus on questions such as: What properties of the physical world are sensed (and which
ones are ignored)? What mechanisms are used to convert physical or chemical energy into a changed
biological state within a cell? What are the consequences of this changed state? How are differences in
the attributes of one modality in the physical world represented by differences in molecular and cellu-
lar processes? Among the examples we will consider are: a comparison of visual structures and pig-
ments in bacteria, plants, arthropods, molluscs, and primates; sound transduction and its musical con-
sequences; and the olfactory system of mammals--which is able to produce a large variety of recep-
tors specific to an individual's experience.

Circadian rhythms have been described in all organisms studied, including humans, a wide range of
other eukaryotes and several prokaryotes. With periods of about 24 hours, these rhythms regulate
biochemical, cellular, physiological and behavioral activities. Circadian rhythms are generated by
cellular clocks--genetically determined internal pacemakers that maintain their oscillations in the ab-
sence of environmental cues but may be reset by periodicities in the environment, especially the light-
dark cycle. Only recently have we begun to understand how circadian rhythms are generated and con-
trolled at the cellular level. This course will explore the basic biochemical features of biological
clocks with the aim of understanding their crucial role in regulating key biological parameters, such as
enzyme levels, levels of hormones and other regulatory molecules, and activity and sleep cycles.

MAJOR
Through a variety of individual courses and sequential programs, the department provides an op-
portunity for students to explore the nature and significance of chemistry, an area of important
achievement in our quest for knowledge about ourselves and the world around us. The student of
chemistry is able to become aware of the special viewpoint of chemists, the general nature of chemical
investigation, some of its important results, how these results are expressed, and something of their
significance within the fields of science and in the area of human endeavor as a whole.
A major in chemistry can be achieved in several ways, preferably beginning in the student's first
year at Williams, but also beginning in the sophomore year. Building on a foundation in general chem-
istry, organic chemistry, and physical chemistry, a student elects additional advanced courses to com-
plete a major that is consistent with his or her background in other sciences, interests, and goals. A
student's program might emphasize biochemistry, organic chemistry, physical chemistry, or inorganic
chemistry, with additional courses available in analytical chemistry, environmental science, and ma-
terials science. Students considering a major in chemistry should consult with amember of the depart-
ment as early as possible in order to plan a program which best suits their interests and abilities and
which makes full use of their previous preparation.
Usually the requirements for the major are fulfilled by completing "Required Courses" and the ap-
propriate number of "Elective Courses." Starting at the 300 level, at least three of the courses taken
must have a laboratory component. In addition, the department has a number of "Independent Re-
search Courses" which, while they do not count toward completion of the major, provide a unique
opportunity to pursue an independent research project under the direction of a faculty member.
The Chemistry Department curriculum and major requirements began changing in the fall of the
2001-2002 academic year. As a result, first year students or sophomores who plan to begin a chemis-
try major, or who simply want to take introductory chemistry courses, should consult the section be-
low entitled "New Curriculum" to make course selections. However, juniors and seniors who have
already begun a chemistry major are subject to somewhat different requirements and should consult
the table on page 110 entitled "Former Curriculum" to make course selections. Questions about meet-
ing major requirements in either curriculum structure should be made directly to the Department
Chair.

aStudents begin the major in the first year with either Chemistry 151 or 153 (based upon placement
test results and consultation with the chair). Students with outstanding performance on the College
Board Chemistry Advanced Placement Test or the International Baccalaureate Exam, and having
consulted with the chair, may begin the major with Chemistry 155 and will place out of Chemistry
256. The first year is completed with Chemistry 156. In the second year at the introductory level,
students take either Chemistry 251 or 255 and Chemistry 256.
bStudents wishing to pursue a research-based version of the laboratory program in Chemistry 251
may elect 255 after consultation with the chair.
cChemistry 256 is the fourth course in the Department's Introductory-level sequence. This course is
a prerequisite (or co-requisite) for all Quantitative and Advanced-level electives.
dTo complete the major in Chemistry, students must elect any one of Chemistry 361, 364, 366, or
367. The course elected, in consultation with the chair or major advisor, will depend on the stu-
dent's future plans.
eChemistry 361 and 366 are strongly recommended for anyone considering graduate school in
chemistry.
fThe Chemistry major requires either nine semester chemistry courses or eight semester chemistry
courses plus two approved courses from among the following: Biology 101, 102; Computer Sci-
ence 134; Mathematics 103, 104, 105; Physics 131, 132; or any courses in these departments for
which the approved courses are prerequisites. No more than two advanced-level organic courses
may be counted toward completion of the major.
Completion of any one of the advanced-level elective courses will satisfy the College requirement
that a student complete a major seminar.
For the purpose of assisting students in selecting a program consistent with their interests, the fol-
lowing groupings of electives and faculty advisors are suggested. However, a case can be made for
selecting courses from the different groups.
Biochemistry: Chemistry 321, Chemistry 322, Chemistry 324, Chemistry 341, Chemistry 342, Chemis-
try 344, Chemistry 367, Chemistry 426, Chemistry 436T, Chemistry 464T (Students interested in bio-
chemistry should consult with Ms. Gehring, Mr. Kaplan, Mr. Chihade, or Mr. Lovett.)
Organic Chemistry: Chemistry 324, Chemistry 341, Chemistry 342, Chemistry 344, Chemistry 441T
(Students interested in organic chemistry should consult with Mr. Chihade, Mr. Markgraf, Mr. Richard-
son, or Mr. Smith.)
Physical and Inorganic Chemistry: Chemistry 332, Chemistry 335, Chemistry 361, Chemistry 364,
Chemistry 366, Chemistry 368, Chemistry 436T, Chemistry 464T (Students interested in physical
chemistry should consult with Mr. Bingemann, Mr. Chang, Mr. Peacock-López, or Mr. Thoman. Stu-
dents interested in inorganic chemistry should consult with Ms. Park or Mr. Schofield. Students inter-
ested in materials science should consult with Ms. Park.)
The Chemistry major provides excellent preparation for graduate study in chemistry, biochemistry,
chemical engineering, environmental science, medicine, and the medical sciences. The major can
also be useful to those whose later professional or business careers may be related to chemical materi-
als or processes. While any accepted route through the major would permit a student to proceed to
graduate study in chemistry, three electives should be considered a minimum, and the particular im-
portance of Chemistry 321, 335, 361, 364, and 366 as preparation for advanced study should be noted.
In addition, at least a semester of research and courses in computer science are strongly recom-
mended.
Students with principal interests outside of the sciences may extend a secondary school foundation
in chemistry by electing a basic two-semester introductory course of a general nature or they may
Chemistry
­ 107 ­
elect semester courses designed for non-majors. All courses in chemistry satisfy the distribution re-
quirement.
The department is accredited by the American Chemical Society (A.C.S.), a professional body of
academic, industrial, and research chemists. The A.C.S. suggests the following courses for someone
considering graduate study or work in chemistry or a related area. Students completing these courses
are designated Certified A.C.S. Majors: 151 (153 or 155), 156, 251 (255), 256, 335, 361, 364, 366,
493-494; and at least two courses from 321, 322, 342, 344, 368, 426.

describing this option.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN CHEMISTRY
The degree with honors in Chemistry provides students with an opportunity to undertake an inde-
pendent research project under the supervision of a faculty member, and to report on the nature of the
work in two short oral presentations and in a written thesis.
Chemistry majors who are candidates for the degree with honors take the following in addition to a
major listed above:
Chemistry 493-W31-494 Senior Research and Thesis
The principal considerations in admitting a student to a program of independent research are mas-
tery of fundamental materials and skills, ability to pursue independent study successfully, and demon-
strated student interest and motivation. In addition, to enroll in these courses leading to a degree with
honors, a student must have a B- average in all chemistry courses or the permission of the chair. At the
end of the first semester, the department reviews the student's progress and determines whether the
student is a candidate for a degree with honors. The designation of a degree with honors in Chemistry
or a degree with highest honors in Chemistry is based primarily on a departmental evaluation of the
accomplishments in these courses and on the quality of the thesis. Completion of the research project
in a satisfactory manner and preparation of a well-written thesis usually results in a degree with hon-
ors. In cases where a student has demonstrated unusual commitment and initiative resulting in an out-
standing thesis based on original experimental results, combined with a strong record in all of his or
her chemistry courses, the department may elect to award a degree with highest honors in Chemistry.
EXCHANGE AND TRANSFER STUDENTS
Students from other institutions wishing to register for courses in chemistry involving college-level
prerequisites should do so in person with a member of the Chemistry Department. Registration should
take place by appointment during the spring semester prior to the academic year in which courses are
to be taken. Students are requested to have with them transcripts of the relevant previous college
work.

aBased on an outstanding performance on the College Board Chemistry Advanced Placement Test,
and having consulted with the chair, a first-year student may gain credit toward the major for 101,
102 and elect Chemistry 201-202 or 301, 302 directly.
bWhile the organic chemistry courses are normally elected before the physical chemistry courses,
the order may be reversed. The organic chemistry courses and the physical chemistry courses may
also be elected concurrently.
cChemistry 301 is a prerequisite for Chemistry 302. Chemistry 301, 302 are strongly recommended
for anyone considering graduate study in chemistry.
dChemistry 301, 310 are strongly recommended for anyone considering graduate study in biochem-
istry.
eThe Chemistry major requires either nine semester chemistry courses or eight semester chemistry
courses plus two approved courses from among the following: Biology 101, 102; Computer Sci-
ence 134; Mathematics 103, 104, 105; Physics 131, 132; or any courses in these departments for
which the approved courses are prerequisites. No more than two advanced-level organic courses
may be counted toward completion of the major.
Completion of any one of the advanced-level elective courses will satisfy the College requirement
that a student complete a major seminar.
For the purpose of assisting students in selecting a program consistent with their interests, the fol-
lowing groupings of electives and faculty advisors are suggested. However, a case can be made for
selecting courses from the different groups.
Biochemistry: Chemistry 303, Chemistry 308, Chemistry 310, Chemistry 311, Chemistry 314T,
Chemistry 321, Chemistry 322, Chemistry 406 (Students interested in biochemistry should consult
with Ms. Gehring, Mr. Kaplan, Mr. Chihade, or Mr. Lovett.)
Organic Chemistry: Chemistry 303, Chemistry 310, Chemistry 311, Chemistry 312T, Chemistry
313 (Students interested in organic chemistry should consult with Mr. Chihade, Mr. Markgraf, Mr.
Richardson, or Mr. Smith.)
Physical and Inorganic Chemistry: Chemistry 304, Chemistry 305, Chemistry 313, Chemistry
314T, Chemistry 316T, Chemistry 318, Chemistry 401 (Students interested in physical chemistry
should consult with Mr. Bingemann, Mr. Chang, Mr. Peacock-López, or Mr. Thoman. Students
interested in inorganic chemistry should consult with Ms. Park or Mr. Schofield. Students inter-
ested in materials science should consult with Ms. Park.)
The Chemistry major provides excellent preparation for graduate study in chemistry, biochemistry,
chemical engineering, environmental science, medicine, and the medical sciences. The major can
also be useful to those whose later professional or business careers may be related to chemical materi-
als or processes. While any accepted route through the major would permit a student to proceed to
graduate study in chemistry, three electives should be considered a minimum, and the particular im-
portance of Chemistry 301, 302, 304, 305, and 321 as preparation for advanced study should be noted.
In addition, at least a semester of research and courses in computer science are strongly recom-
mended.
Students with principal interests outside of the sciences may extend a secondary school foundation
in chemistry by electing a basic two-semester introductory course of a general nature or they may
elect semester courses designed for nonmajors. All courses in chemistry satisfy the distribution re-
quirement.
The department is accredited by the American Chemical Society (A.C.S.), a professional body of
academic, industrial, and research chemists. The A.C.S. suggests the following courses for someone
considering graduate study or work in chemistry or a related area. Students completing these courses
are designated Certified A.C.S. Majors: 101, 102 (103-104), 201-202, 301, 302, 304, 305, 493-494;
and at least two courses from 303, 311, 321, 322, 401, 406.

COURSES FOR NON-MAJORS WITH NO PREREQUISITES
CHEM 111(F) Fighting Disease: The Evolution and Operation of Human Medicines
The past decade has seen an explosion in the number of pharmaceuticals available to doctors and their
patients. Pills are now available to treat conditions as varied as depression and baldness, and a cure for
the common cold is in development. A visit to the doctor now seems incomplete without a prescrip-
tion. Changes in Food and Drug Administration and health insurance policies combined with the tre-
mendous increase in advertisement of prescription drugs have also placed a larger burden on consum-
ers in deciding which drugs to take, as well as in paying for the medication.
This course focuses on understanding, at a biochemical level, how several drugs work their curative
magic as well as how they may lead to undesired side effects. We examine the processes through
which drugs are discovered or created and how they are then brought to consumers. Topics range from
the discovery of aspirin and the effect of World War II on the discovery of cheap treatments for malaria
to advances in protease inhibitors and combination therapies which have dramatically extended the
lives of AIDS patients. The main focus of the course is basic concepts in chemistry and biology which
underlie the action of any drug. We also explore the connections between basic research, biotechnolo-
gy companies, multinational pharmaceutical firms, patent attorneys, regulatory agencies, doctors,
and insurers which eventually lead to the availability of a given drug.
This course is designed for the non-science major who does not intend to pursue a career in the natural
sciences. Principles in organic chemistry and biochemistry will be developed as needed.
Format: lectures, three hours a week. Evaluation is based on quizzes, problem sets, class participation,
one short paper, a midterm, and a final exam.
No prerequisites. No enrollment limit (expected: 40).

CHEM 115(S) AIDS: The Disease and Search for a Cure
Since the discovery of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) in 1983, modern techniques of
molecular biology have revealed much about its structure and life cycle. The intensity of the scientific
Chemistry
­ 113 ­
investigation directed at HIV-1 is unprecedented in history. We now know more about this virus than
any other known pathogen. However, the early optimism concerning the prospects for an effective
AIDS vaccine has now waned and HIV strains that are resistant to drug therapies are common. We are
now nearly two decades into the AIDS pandemic and the World Health Organization estimates that
there are more than 50 million HIV-infected persons worldwide.
After an introduction to chemical structure, we examine the molecular biology of the HIV virus, the
molecular targets of anti-HIV drugs, and the prospects for a cure. We discuss the origin, epidemiology
and modes of transmission of HIV-1 and HIV-2, and look at how HIV-1 interacts with the human im-
mune system. We also discuss both old and new methods of vaccine development and the prospects
for making an effective AIDS vaccine.
This course is designed for the non-science major who does not intend to pursue a career in the natural
sciences.
Format: lectures, three hours a week. Evaluation is based on problem sets, two hour tests, quizzes, and
a final exam.

CHEM 301, 302, and 306 Physical Chemistry
The following three courses provide a thorough introduction to physical chemistry. Students who
wish to explore the physical aspects of chemistry in greater depth than provided by 306 are urged to
consider 301, 302. This pattern of course elections is particularly appropriate for those students
who have taken Chemistry 103-104/108.
The focus of thermodynamics in 301 makes this course of special interest to students considering
careers in biochemistry, biology, geology, engineering, and physics. First-year students, sopho-
mores, and other students not meeting the formal prerequisites listed below, but who possess the
basic skills provided by those courses, may register for 301 with the instructor's approval.
CHEM 301(F) Physical Chemistry: Thermodynamics
The thermodynamic laws provide us with our most powerful and general scientific principles for pre-
dicting the direction of spontaneous change in physical, chemical, and biological systems. This
course develops the concepts of energy, entropy, free energy, temperature (and absolute zero), heat,
work, and chemical potential within the framework of classical thermodynamics. The principles de-
veloped are applied to a variety of problems: chemical reactions, phase changes, energy technology,
and environmental science.
Laboratory experiments provide quantitative and practical demonstrations of the theory of real and
ideal systems studied in class.
Format: lectures, three hours a week; laboratory, four hours a week. Evaluation is based on problem
sets, laboratory work, exams, and an independent project.
Prerequisites: Chemistry 101, 102/106 (103-104/108), a basic knowledge of applied integral and dif-
ferential calculus such as provided by Mathematics 104, 105, and some basic mechanics such as pro-
vided by Physics 131 or 141. No enrollment limit (expected: 20).
Hour: 9:55-11:10 TR Lab: 1-5 M,W THOMAN
CHEM 302(S) Physical Chemistry: Structure and Dynamics
This course integrates a number of physical chemistry topics. An introduction to quantum mechanics
provides students with the basis for understanding molecular structure. Statistical mechanics is then
used to demonstrate the formal and quantitative link between the properties of single molecules and
the thermodynamic and kinetic behavior of macroscopic collections of molecules. Rate laws, enzyme
kinetics, and transport properties are discussed. Applications of these principles are chosen from a
variety of areas, including polymer chemistry, biochemistry, photochemistry, and solid and liquid
state chemistry. Quantitative laboratory experiments and consultation with the scientific literature
provide the background necessary for carrying out an independent theoretical or experimental proj-
ect.
Format: lectures, three hours a week; laboratory, four hours a week. Evaluation is based on problem
sets, laboratory work, two hour tests, and a final exam.
Prerequisite: Chemistry 301, or Chemistry 155 and 251/255. May be taken concurrently with Chem-
istry 256 with permission of instructor. No enrollment limit (expected: 10).
Hour: 8:30-9:45 TR Lab: 1-5 W BINGEMANN
CHEM 303(S) Synthetic Organic Chemistry
The origins of organic chemistry are in the chemistry of living things and the emphasis of this course is
on the chemistry of naturally-occurring compounds. This course presents the logic and practice of
chemical total synthesis while stressing the structures, properties and preparations of terpenes, poly-
Chemistry
­ 114 ­
ketides and alkaloids. Modern synthetic reactions are surveyed with an emphasis on the stereochemi-
cal and mechanistic themes that underlie them. To meet the requirements for the semester's final proj-
ect, each student chooses an article from the recent synthetic literature and then analyzes the logic and
strategy involved in the published work in a final paper. A summary of this paper is also presented to
the class in a short seminar. Laboratory sessions introduce students to techniques for synthesis and
purification of natural products and their synthetic precursors.
Format: lectures, three hours a week; laboratory, four hours a week. Evaluation is based on problem
sets, midterm exams, laboratory work, a final project, and class participation.
Prerequisites: Chemistry 201-202, or Chemistry 155 and 251/255. May be taken concurrently with
Chemistry 256. No enrollment limit (expected: 12).
Hour: 9:55-11:10 TR Lab: 1-5 M RICHARDSON
CHEM 304(S) Instrumental Methods of Analysis (Same as Environmental Studies 304)
This course provides the student an understanding of the applicability of current laboratory instru-
mentation both to the elucidation of fundamental chemical phenomena and to the measurement of
certain atomic and molecular parameters. Experimental methods, including absorption and emission
spectroscopy in the x-ray, ultraviolet, visible, infrared, microwave, and radio frequency regions, chro-
matography, electrochemistry, mass spectrometry, magnetic resonance, and thermal methods are dis-
cussed, with examples drawn from the current literature. The analytical chemical techniques devel-
oped in this course are useful in a wide variety of scientific areas. The course also covers new develop-
ments in instrumental methods and advances in the approaches used to address modern analytical
questions.

CHEM 310(S) Enzyme Kinetics and Reaction Mechanisms
Enzymes are complex biological molecules capable of catalyzing chemical reactions with very high
efficiency, stereo-selectivity and specificity. The study of enzymatically-catalyzed reactions gives in-
sight into the study of organic reaction mechanisms in general, and into the topic of catalysis especial-
ly. This course explores the methods and frameworks for determining mechanisms of enzymatic reac-
tions. These methods are based on a firm foundation of chemical kinetics and organic reaction mecha-
nisms. The first portion of the course is devoted to enzyme kinetics and catalysis including discus-
sions of transition state theory, structure-reactivity relationships, Michaelis-Menten parameters, pH-
Chemistry

dependence of catalysis, and methods for measuring rate constants. As the course progresses, the con-
cepts of mechanism and its elucidation is applied to specific enzymatic processes as we discuss reac-
tion intermediates and stereochemistry of enzymatic reactions. Our discussions of modern methods
include the use of altered reactants, including mechanism-based inactivators and genetically modified
enzymes as tools for probing enzymatic reactions.
Format: lectures, three hours a week. Evaluation is based on problem sets, quizzes, a midterm exam, a

CHEM 314T(S) A Theoretical Approach to Biological Phenomena
This course focuses on the application of physicochemical theoretical methods to biophysical and
biochemical systems. The basis of the classical theoretical models, as well as new theoretical ap-
proaches to biological phenomena are discussed. The predictions of these theoretical models are
compared to the results obtained by experiment. The topics include a thermodynamic approach to
biochemical reactions and bioenergetics; receptor-mediated endocytosis; nonequilibrium kinetics of
concentrated enzyme solutions; analysis of the differences between direct transfer and diffusional
transfer of metabolites; and mathematical immunology, with an emphasis on the complement system.
After an initial meeting of all students, groups of two students meet with the instructor weekly for fifty
minutes where one student gives an oral presentation. Both students are responsible for readings and
written solutions to assigned problems based on advanced-level textbooks, review articles, and re-
search journals. The last week is devoted to the presentation of final projects.
Format: tutorial. Evaluation is based on the quality of presentations, class participation, written es-
says, solutions to problems, and an oral final exam.

This course introduces the basic concepts of biochemistry with an emphasis on the structure and function
of biological macromolecules. Specifically, the structure of proteins and nucleic acids are examined in de-
tail in order to determine how their chemical properties and their biological behavior result from those
structures. Other topics covered include enzyme kinetics, mechanism and catalysis and regulation; the
molecular organization of biomembranes and membrane transport; and the principles of recombinant
DNA technologies. In addition, the principles and applications of the methods used to characterize macro-
molecules in solution and the interactions between macromolecules are discussed.
The laboratory provides an opportunity to study the structure of macromolecules and to learn the funda-
mental experimental techniques of biochemistry including electrophoresis and chromatography.

energy generation (aerobic, anaerobic, photosynthetic); the regulation and integration of the metabol-
ic pathways including compartmentalization and the transport of metabolites; and biochemical reac-
tion mechanisms including the structures and mechanisms of coenzymes. This comprehensive study
also includes the biosynthesis of small molecules (carbohydrates, lipids, amino acids, and nucleo-
tides). Laboratory experiments introduce the principles and procedures used to study enzymatic reac-
tions, bioenergetics, and metabolic pathways.

Visiting Professor of Liberal Arts: PORTER. Assistant Professor: PANOUSSI*.
The course offerings in Classics enable students to explore the ancient Greek, Roman, and Greco-
Roman worlds from various perspectives: art, archaeology, philosophy, religion, and especially litera-
ture and history. Courses are of two types: language (Greek and Latin) and translation (Classical Civi-
lization). The 100-level language courses are intensive introductions to Greek and Latin grammar; the
200-level language courses combine comprehensive grammar review with readings from Greek or
Latin texts of pivotal historical periods; the 400-level language courses explore in depth selected au-
thors or topics and the methods of analysis appropriate to each of them. Courses in which texts are
read in translation provide both introductory surveys and opportunities for more specialized study of
the ancient Greco-Roman world from earliest historical times through late antiquity.
MAJOR
Majors and prospective majors are encouraged to consult with the department's faculty to ensure a
well-balanced and comprehensive selection of Classics courses appropriate to their individual inter-
ests. A course or courses in ancient history are strongly recommended. Majors may also benefit from
Classics
­ 117 ­
advice on courses offered in other departments which would complement their particular interests in
Classics. A reading knowledge of French, German, and Italian is useful for any study in Classics and
is required in at least two of these modern languages by graduate programs in classics, ancient history,
classical art and archaeology, and medieval studies.
The department offers two routes to the major: Classics and Classical Civilization.
Classics: (1) Six courses in Greek and/or Latin, with at least two 400-level courses in one language;
(2) Three additional courses, elected from the offerings in Greek, Latin, or Classical Civilization or
from approved courses in other departments.
Classical Civilization: (1) Either Classics 101 or 102, and either Classics 222 or 223; (2) Three
additional courses from the offerings in Classical Civilization or from approved courses in other de-
partments. (3) Three courses in Greek or Latin with at least one at the 400 level, or four courses in
Latin at any level. (4) A senior independent study is normally required to complete the Classical Civi-
lization major. Several of the courses elected, including the independent study, should relate to each
other in such a way as to reflect a concentration on a particular genre, period, or problem of Greek and
Roman civilization, including topics in ancient art and archaeology, religion in the Greco-Roman
world, and ancient philosophy.
In addition to the courses in Classical Civilization, appropriate courses from other departments or
from approved study abroad programs may be elected for the major. Examples of such courses, which
may vary from year to year, are ArtH 412 (Monsters and Narrative: Greek Architectural Sculpture),
Political Science/Philosophy 231 (Ancient Political Thought), and appropriate courses at the Intercol-
legiate Center for Classical Studies in Rome or at another approved overseas program.
Senior Colloquium: In lieu of a semester-long major seminar, majors will participate in the Senior
Colloquium, a student-faculty discussion group that meets twice each semester during the senior year.
The meetings focus on critical readings in Classics, often in conjunction with a guest lecturer's visit.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN CLASSICS
Students who wish to be considered for the degree with honors will normally present a thesis or
pursue appropriate independent study in the fall and winter study of their senior year. This thesis or
independent study offers students an opportunity to work in depth on a topic of their choosing and to
apply and develop the techniques and critical methods with which they have become acquainted dur-
ing their regular course work. It may also include relevant work with members of other departments.
In order to write a thesis, students normally must have a minimum GPA of 3.3 in their major courses
and must submit a thesis proposal before the end of the spring semester of their junior year that earns
departmental approval. To be awarded the degree with honors in Classics, the student is required to
have taken a minimum of ten semester courses in the department (not including the thesis or indepen-
dent study) and to have demonstrated original or superior ability in studies in the field both through
course work and through the thesis or equivalent independent study.
COURSE NUMBERING SYSTEM
Language Courses: The numbering of these courses through the 200 level reflects the prerequisites
involved; the only prerequisite for any 400-level course is Greek 201 or Latin 202, or equivalent lan-
guage preparation. The numbering of the 400-level courses partially reflects the order in which they
are offered over a two-year period for Greek and a three-year period for Latin. It also indicates a good
order in which to take the 400-level courses but not an essential order, and individual students may
enter the sequence at any point. While not every student will take every course, the rotation of
400-level courses is arranged to permit exposure, in a three- to four-year period, to most of the impor-
tant periods and genres of classical studies.
Classical Civilization Courses: The numbering of these courses often suggests a recommended but
rarely necessary sequence of study within a given area of classical studies. Most of the translation
courses do not assume prior experience in Classics or a cross-listed field.
CLASSICAL CIVILIZATION
CLAS 101(F) Greek Literature (Same as Comparative Literature 107)
The literature of the archaic and classical Greek polis was produced by and for a "performance soci-
ety." As we read in translation Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, Hesiod's Works and Days, the poetry of an
Archilochus, Sappho, Solon, Theognis, or Pindar, tragedies by Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides,
comedies by Aristophanes, brief selections from the historians Herodotus and Thucydides, and some
portions of Plato's philosophical writings, we will attend closely to the performance contexts in which
these works were first produced, both to enrich our literary analysis of each work and to spin the the-
matic threads we will follow through this complex and varied literature. From the oral epics of Homer
and Hesiod in the eighth century to Plato's written "dialogues" in the fourth, the problem of paideia,
education or socialization, preoccupied Greeks of the polis. Who should be educated, about what
things, by whom, and how? How do we learn or know something, and what kinds of knowledge is it
possible or desirable to attain? Which types of familial and civic arrangements create which types of
anthropoi, human beings? What kinds of anthropoi should society aim to create? What could or
Classics
­ 118 ­
should an anthropos be? How do categories like male and female, slave and free, or Greek and barba-
ros relate to one another and to the category anthropos? Is anthropos a category of "being" or "do-
ing"--in short, of performance?
Format: lecture with some discussion. Evaluation will be based on participation in class but chiefly on
several short response papers, two 5- to 7-page essays, and a take-home final examination.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 40 (expected: 40). Preference will be given to first-year students
and sophomores.

PANOUSSI
CLAS 103(S) Greek and Roman Drama: Renewal and Transformation (Same as
Comparative Literature 109 and Theatre 311)
The reading list for this course includes many of the major tragedies of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and
Euripides, at least two comedies of Aristophanes, and probably an example or two of New Comedy
(Menander, Plautus, or Terence). But it includes also a number of contemporary plays based on an-
cient myth or ancient models (Anouilh's Eurydice and Antigone; Cocteau's Orphée, Sartre's The
Flies, Williams' Orpheus Descending, Eliot's Family Reunion, etc.) as well as Homer's Odyssey and
a few other readings, both ancient and modern, from outside drama. Though we shall read the ancient
plays closely, our specific focus will be less on drama per se than on themes of transformation and
renewal as they occur in myth, cult, drama, and other literature of all periods. In keeping with this
theme, students will be encouraged not only to develop critical and analytic sophistication in dealing
with these various materials but also to create their own transformations of ancient myth and ancient
models, in whatever medium they choose.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on contributions to class discussion, a 5-10 page
paper, a creative project, and a mid-term and final exam. Students taking the course as Theater 311
will be expected to undertake an additional project, to be determined in consultation with the instruc-
tor. In the past, students have frequently chosen to prepare some sort of dramatic performance for the
class (e.g., one of the works we have read, or an original work by the students themselves, etc.).
No prerequisites. Open to first-year students. Enrollment limit: 25 (expected: 15-20). Priority given to
first- and second-year students and to Theatre students.

CLGR 201(F) Intermediate Greek
Reading of selections from Hesiod and from Plato, combined with grammar review. The primary goal
of this course is to develop fluency in reading Greek. We will also read the texts closely to explore
important continuities and changes in Greek culture between the archaic and classical periods. The
emphasis will vary from year to year, but possible subjects to be explored include: the education and
socialization of the community's children and young adults; religion and cult practices; the performa-
tive aspects of epic (and choral) poetry and of prose genres like oratory and the philosophical dia-
logue; traditional oral poetry and storytelling and the growth of literacy; the construction of woman,
of man; the development of the classical polis.

CLGR 406T(S) Coming of Age in the Polis (Same as Women's and Gender Studies 406)
(W)
Studying a society's modes of rearing its young, and especially the ways it prepares and tests adoles-
cents for their "coming of age" into their adult roles, provides an excellent approach to exploring its
fundamental values and institutional practices. Archaic and classical Greek literature not only reflects
but actively reflects upon the socialization of boys and girls in the Greek polis. In this course we will
read in Greek selections from the Homeric Hymns to Demeter and Apollo and, in its entirety, a trage-
dy (e.g., Sophocles' Philoctetes), examining these texts through the lens of "coming of age." We will
read in English brief selections from Homeric epic and from elegiac and lyric poetry (monodic and
choral), and several Athenian tragedies and perhaps a comedy. We will also read critical literature on
childrearing, religious cults for boys and girls of different ages, and the role of dance, song and poetry
Classics

in preparing the young for their adult roles, particularly in fifth-century Athens.
Students will be divided into tutorial pairs chiefly according to their previous experience in Greek
courses. Students will meet with the instructor once a week either individually or in pairs to present
their translations of the Greek assigned for that week, and they will also meet once a week in pairs for
the oral presentation of written 5- to 7-page reports. At the latter meeting, each student will alternate
between making a formal presentation one week and, in the next week, offering an oral critique of the
other student's presentation.
Class format: recitation/discussion. Evaluation will be based on the translations, reports, and critiques
presented in the tutorial sessions.
Prerequisite: Greek 201 or permission of the instructor. Enrollment: 10 (expected: 6-8). This course is
writing intensive.
Hour: 11:00-12:15 MWF HOPPIN
CLGR 407(F) The Sophists
This course considers the nature of the sophistic movement and its impact on Athens and Athenian
authors in the second half of the fifth century B.C.E. We will devote the first half of the term to devel-
oping an understanding of the movement through selected readings, both in Greek and in translation,
from the extant fragments of Protagoras, Gorgias, Antiphon, and other sophistic thinkers; from those
dialogues of Plato (e.g., Protagoras, Symposium, Gorgias) and Xenophon (e.g., Memorabilia) that
focus on the sophists and their relationship to Socrates; and from Thucydides ("Melian Dialogue")
and Euripides (e.g., Hecuba), both of whom were profoundly influenced by the sophists. During the
second half of the course we will read, in Greek and in its entirety, Aristophanes' Clouds, with a focus
on trying to understand both the play itself and the complex relationship of its playwright to Socrates
and the sophists. We will also read, in translation, one or two other plays of Aristophanes (e.g., Birds,
Frogs).
Format: The course will be run as a seminar, with classes devoted primarily to translation and discus-
sion of the texts we are reading. Evaluation will be based on 75-minute midterm and final exams con-
sisting primarily of translation of assigned Greek texts, and above all on participation in class, presen-
tation of oral reports, and a substantial final paper.
Prerequisite: Greek 202 or consent of instructor. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 7).

LATIN
CLLA 101(F)-102(S) Introduction to Latin
This is a full-year course on the fundamentals of the Latin language. The first semester and part of the
second emphasize learning basic grammar; the rest of the second semester is devoted to reading selec-
tions from Latin poetry (including Vergil's Aeneid and some Medieval Latin poetry, e.g., the Carmina
Burana) and from Latin prose (e.g., Pliny's Letters and/or the Vulgate Bible). This course is designed
for the student with no previous preparation in Latin or who has had only a little Latin and wishes a
refresher. Credit is granted for the first semester only if the second semester is taken as well. Students
with some previous experience in Latin may want to enroll in CLLA 102 only: consult the department.
Format: recitation/discussion. Evaluation will be based on frequent quizzes, tests, classroom exer-
cises, and a final exam.

CLLA 201(F) Intermediate Latin I: The Late Republic
Reading of selections from Latin prose and poetry, normally from a speech or letters by Cicero and
from the poetry of Catullus. This course includes a comprehensive review of Latin grammar and aims
primarily at developing fluency in reading Latin. At the same time it acquaints students with one of the
most turbulent and important periods in Roman history and attends to the development of their inter-
pretative and analytic skills.
Format: recitation/discussion. Evaluation will be based on classroom performance, quizzes, a mid-
term, and a final exam. Occasional oral presentations or short essays may be required as well.
Prerequisite: Latin 101-102 or 3-4 years of Latin in secondary school: consult the department. Enroll-
ment limit: 12 (expected: 6-10).
Hour: 9:00-9:50 MWF KRAUS
CLLA 202(S) Intermediate Latin II: The Early Empire
Like Latin 201, this course pairs poetry and prose and aims to develop students' fluency in reading
Latin while acquainting them with a vitally important period in Roman history. More than Latin 201,
however, this course attends to the development of students' analytic and interpretive skills. We will

CLLA 404(F) Vergil's Aeneid
Although he used the Iliad and Odyssey as literary models, Vergil created a thoroughly Roman--and
Italian--epic with the Aeneid, a poem which addresses contemporary politics (the principate of Au-
gustus) through the figure of Aeneas, the mythical hero of Troy. We will pay close attention to the
political as well as the literary background of Rome's greatest literary achievement, and one of the
major issues we will explore is the degree to which Vergil's Aeneid provides a new model of the Ro-
man military and political leader.
Evaluation will be based on contributions to class, a midterm exam, and a final paper.

CLLA 409(S) Satire
Satura quidem tota nostra est--"Satire is completely ours" wrote the Latin rhetorician Quintillian.
What does it mean to "possess" a literary genre? Did the Romans invent satire? Is satire quintessen-
tially Roman in its character? Do Romans exert a kind of imperial control over satire, i.e, can only
Romans and Latin discourse achieve mastery over this genre? Or, according to a looser reading, does
"nostra" suggest that satire is "about us," that rather than Rome mastering satire, satire has mastered
Rome? We will explore these issues by tracing the history and character of satire from its Greek and
Roman origins, through its masters--Horace, Persius, and Juvenal--until its application by Jerome
and the Caena Cypriani in a later Christian context. Attention will also be given to variant forms of the
genre such as the Menippean satire of Varro, Petronius, and the anonymously written "pumpkinifica-
tion" of the emperor Claudius.
Format: recitation/discussion. Evaluation will be based on translations, participation, class presenta-

COGNITIVE SCIENCE (Div. II)
Chair, Associate Professor KRIS N. KIRBY
Advisory Committee: Professors: GERRARD, H. WILLIAMS. Associate Professors:
DANYLUK**, KIRBY. Assistant Professors: CRUZ, ZAKI.
Cognitive science is concerned with how humans, non-human animals, and computers acquire,
represent, manipulate, and use information. As an interdisciplinary field it combines research and
theory from computer science (e.g., artificial intelligence), cognitive psychology, philosophy, linguis-
tics, and neuroscience, and to some extent evolutionary biology, math, and anthropology. Complex
issues of cognition are not easily addressed using traditional intra-disciplinary tools. Cognitive re-
searchers in any discipline typically employ a collection of analytic and modeling tools from across
traditional disciplinary boundaries. Thus, the methods and research agenda of cognitive science is
broader than those of any of the fields that have traditionally contributed to cognitive science. The
Cognitive Science Program is designed to provide students with the broad interdisciplinary founda-
tion needed to approach issues of cognition.
THE CONCENTRATION
The concentration in Cognitive Science consists of six courses, including an introductory course,
four electives, and a senior research project.
Minds, Brains, and Intelligent Behavior (COGS 222) is the entry-point into the concentration,
and provides an interdisciplinary perspective on issues of cognition. Ideally, it should be taken before
the end of the sophomore year. Emphasizing the highly interdisciplinary nature of the field, the four
electives must be distributed over at least three course prefixes. In the fall of the senior year, concen-
trators will conduct interdisciplinary Research in Cognitive Science (COGS 493), supervised by
members of the advisory committee from at least two departments.
REQUIRED COURSES
Cognitive Science 222 Minds, Brains, and Intelligent Behavior: An Introduction to Cognitive Science
Cognitive Science 493 Research in Cognitive Science
ELECTIVES
Four electives are required, chosen from at least three prefixes, at most two of which can be at the 100
level.
Computer Science 108 Artificial Intelligence: Image and Reality

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN COGNITIVE SCIENCE
Formal admission to candidacy for honors will occur at the end of the fall semester of the senior
year and will be based on promising performance in COGS 493. This program will consist of COGS
W031-494(S), and will be supervised by members of the advisory committee from at least two depart-
ments. Presentation of a thesis, however, should not be interpreted as a guarantee of a degree with
honors.
COGS 222(S) Minds, Brains, and Intelligent Behavior: An Introduction to Cognitive
Science (Same as INTR 222, Philosophy 222 and Psychology 222) (Q)
This course will emphasize interdisciplinary approaches to the study of intelligent systems, both natu-
ral and artificial. Cognitive science synthesizes research from cognitive psychology, computer sci-
Cognitive Science, Comparative Literature
­ 123 ­
ence, linguistics, neuroscience, and contemporary philosophy. Special attention will be given to the
philosophical foundations of cognitive science, information theory, symbolic and connectionist ar-
chitectures, the neural basis of cognition, perception, learning and memory, language, action, reason-
ing, expert systems, and artificial intelligence.
Requirements: several short papers and self-paced weekly lab exercises.
Prerequisites: Psychology 101 or Philosophy 102 or Computer Science 134 or permission of the
instructors. Background in more than one of these is recommended. Enrollment limit: 25 (expected:
25). This is a quantitative/formal reasoning course.
This course satisfies the Division II distribution requirement.
Hour: 1:10-2:25 MR CRUZ and KIRBY
COGS 493(F) Research in Cognitive Science
Independent empirical or theoretical research for one semester, under the guidance of two Cognitive
Science faculty from different departments. Research must be interdisciplinary, but may consist of a
scholarly paper, empirical research, computer or mathematical modeling, or any combination of the
above. Students will meet biweekly to discuss their projects, and give oral presentations of their pro-
jects at the end of the fall semester.
COGS W031-494(S) Senior Thesis
The senior concentrator, having completed the fall research project and with approval from the advi-
sory committee, may devote winter study and the spring semester to a senior thesis based on the fall
research project.
COMPARATIVE LITERATURE (Div. I)
Chair, Associate Professor JULIE A. CASSIDAY
Professors: DRUXES, GOLDSTEIN, B. KIEFFER, G. NEWMAN*, STAMELMAN***. Associate
Professors: CASSIDAY, ROUHI. Assistant Professors: CARTER*, FOX, FRENCH, SILBER,
VAN DE STADT. Mellon Post-Doctoral Fellow: STONE.
Students motivated by a desire to study literature in the broadest terms, as well as those interested in
particular examples of literary comparison, will find an intellectual home in the Program in Compara-
tive Literature. The Program in Comparative Literature gives students the opportunity to develop their
critical faculties through the analysis of literature in its international and multicultural context. By
crossing national, linguistic, historical, and disciplinary boundaries, students of Comparative Litera-
ture learn to read texts for the ways they make meaning, the assumptions that underlie that meaning,
and the aesthetic elements evinced in the making. Students of Comparative Literature are encouraged
to examine the widest possible range of literary communication, including the metamorphosis of
genres, forms, and themes.
Whereas specific literature programs allow the student to trace the development of one literature in
a particular culture over a period of time, Comparative Literature juxtaposes the writings of different
cultures and epochs in a variety of ways. The rubrics of the Program's core courses--Literary Genres,
Literary Movements, Literature and Theory, and Cultural Studies--introduce the student to a variety
of critical methods. Because interpretive methods from other disciplines play a crucial role in investi-
gating literature's larger context, the Program offers courses intended for students in all divisions of
the college and of all interests. These include courses that introduce students to the comparative study
of world literature and courses designed to enhance any foreign language major in the Williams cur-
riculum. In addition, the English Department allows students to count one course with a COMP prefix
as an elective within the English major.
The Program supports two distinct majors in Comparative Literatureand Literary Studies. The ma-
jor in Comparative Literature requires advanced work in at least one language other than English and
is strongly recommended for students contemplating graduate study in the discipline. Both majors
provide a strong basis for any career demanding analytical, interpretive, and evaluative skills and al-
low the student, within a framework of general requirements, to create a program of study primarily
shaped by the student's own interests.
MAJORS
Comparative Literature
The Comparative Literature major combines the focused study of a single national-language litera-
ture with a wide-ranging exploration of literary forms across national, linguistic, and historical boun-
daries. Each student declaring the major must select a single foreign language as his or her specialty,
although the serious study of literature in foreign languages other than the student's specialty is
strongly encouraged. The languages currently available are French, German, Ancient Greek, Latin,
Russian, and Spanish. Each student will also be paired with a faculty advisor with whom the student
will meet each semester to discuss how best to fulfill the requirements for the major.
Eleven courses are required for the major:
Comparative Literature 111 The Nature of Narrative (Literary Genres)
Comparative Literature
­ 124 ­
Any three of the following core courses:
Comparative Literature 221 Twentieth-Century European Poetry (Literary Genres)
Comparative Literature 224/English 204 The Feature Film (Literary Genres)
Comparative Literature 231 Romanticism (Literary Movements)
Comparative Literature 232 European Modernism (Literary Movements)
Comparative Literature 240/English 230 Introduction to Literary Theory (Literature and Theory)
Comparative Literature 252 Modern Women Writers and the City (Cultural Studies)
Comparative Literature 254T The Fallen Woman in Literature and Film (Cultural Studies)
Comparative Literature 321 The Cultures of Poetry (Literary Genres)
Comparative Literature 340 Literature and Psychoanalysis (Literature and Theory)
Comparative Literature 343/English 373 Modern Critical Theory (Literature and Theory)
Three literature courses in the student's specialty language, in which texts are read in the origi-
nal. At least one of the three must be above the 200-level.
Three courses in which most of the course work concerns literature other than that of the stu-
dent's specialty language or literary theory. These courses may be selected from Comparative
Literature offerings or from other departments and must be approved by the student's major
advisor. Only one may be in English or American literature. Among the offerings of other de-
partments that are possible, the following employ readings in English translation and are espe-
cially appropriate to the major:
Anthropology 280
English 126, 135, 202, 218, 219, 220, 221, 327, 339, 341, 345, 346, 361, 371, 393

Religion 210, 211, 304
Theatre 210, 211, 322T, 328
Comparative Literature 402 Senior Seminar (variable topics)
Students who are considering a major in Comparative Literature should aim to acquire intermedi-
ate-level proficiency in their specialty language by the end of the sophomore year. They should also
complete core course requirements by the end of their junior year. Students pursuing the Comparative
Literature major are strongly encouraged to study abroad during their junior year and may receive
major credit for up to 4 courses taken during study abroad. At least three courses towards the major
must be at the 300 level or above. Students are expected to take the version of 402 offered in their
senior year, even if they have previously taken 402.
Literary Studies
The Literary Studies major allows for a wide-ranging exploration of literary forms across national,
linguistic, and historical boundaries. Unlike the major in Comparative Literature, the Literary Studies
major does not require the student to choose a specialty language, although the serious study of litera-
ture in one or more foreign languages is strongly encouraged. Each student will be paired with a facul-
ty advisor, with whom the student will meet each semester to discuss how best to fulfill the require-
ments for the major.
Eleven courses are required for the major:
Comparative Literature 111 The Nature of Narrative (Literary Genres)
Any four of the following core courses:
Comparative Literature 221 Twentieth-Century European Poetry (Literary Genres)
Comparative Literature 224/English 204 The Feature Film (Literary Genres)
Comparative Literature 231 Romanticism (Literary Movements)
Comparative Literature 232 European Modernism (Literary Movements)
Comparative Literature 240/English 230 Introduction to Literary Theory (Literature and Theory)
Comparative Literature 252 Modern Women Writers and the City (Cultural Studies)
Comparative Literature 254T The Fallen Woman in Literature and Film (Cultural Studies)
Comparative Literature 321 The Cultures of Poetry (Literary Genres)
Comparative Literature 340 Literature and Psychoanalysis (Literature and Theory)
Comparative Literature 343/English 373 Modern Critical Theory (Literature and Theory)
Five courses devoted to literature or literary theory that cover at least three different national/
cultural traditions. The courses may be selected from Comparative Literature offerings or from
other departments and must be approved by the student's major advisor. Of the courses taken
outside of the Program in Comparative Literature, no more than two may have the same course
prefix. Students are strongly encouraged to include courses in a foreign language among these
five. Among the offerings of other departments that are possible, the following employ readings
in English translation and are especially appropriate to the major:

Comparative Literature 402 Senior Seminar (variable topics)
Students who are considering a major in Literary Studies should aim to complete core course re-
quirements by the end of their sophomore year. Students who choose to study abroad during their
junior year may receive major credit for up to 4 courses taken during study abroad. At least three
courses towards the major must be at the 300 level or above. Students are expected to take the version
of 402 offered in their senior year, even if they have previously taken 402.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN COMPARATIVE LITERATURE OR LITERARY STUDIES
To achieve honors in Comparative Literature or Literary Studies, a student must prepare a thesis,
usually 50-75 pages long, during the senior year (COMP 493-W031-494 or LIT 493-W031-494). The
topic of the thesis must be comparative and/or theoretical in approach. Those majoring in Compara-
tive Literature must include a significant amount of material in the literature of the student's specialty
language. Students must apply to the Program's advisory committee for permission to pursue an hon-
ors thesis before the beginning of the senior year.

derstanding of a given text? In what ways, and for what purposes, do authors create different narrators
to present a story? Our texts may include writings from Antiquity, and by Cervantes, Goethe, Austen,
Gogol, Balzac, Flaubert, Dostoevsky, and Kafka. We will accompany these texts with pertinent
theoretical pieces by-among others-Aristotle, Plato, Culler, Benjamin, and Foucault. All readings in

COMP 221(F) Twentieth-Century European Poetry (W)
The course will be a comparative study of modern poetry as written in the twentieth century, and espe-
cially since World War II, by European poets of various national backgrounds as they have come to
confront different historical events, lyrical traditions, and personal experiences and as they have med-
itated poetically on the reality of everyday things, on the nature of perception and language, on the
instability of the poetic self, and on poetry's unique power to understand and give meaning to the mys-
teries of human life. From England, we will study the postcolonial writings of the West-Indian poet
Derek Walcott; from France, the machine-age and war poetry of Guillaume Apollinaire; from Germa-
ny, the mystical works of Rainer Maria Rilke and the post-Holocaust and dialogical poems of Paul
Celan; from Ireland, the poetry of political and domestic struggle of Eavon Boland and Seamus
Heaney; from Italy, the crystalline lyrics of Eugenio Montale; from Poland, the poems of revolt and
exile of Czeslaw Milosz; from Portugal, the heteronymic poetry of Fernando Pessoa; and from Rus-
sia, the acmeist work of Osip Mandelstam. Students will also read theoretical and critical essays on
poetry and poetics by these poets and others. The course will be conducted entirely in English, and
discussion will be given to the "sea-change" a translation necessarily imposes on a poetic work. All
readings in English.

This course will explore a series of movements and theories that shaped much of European thought,
culture, and literature from 1890 until 1945. Given the tremendous political, social, and geographic
upheaval of this period, which included the Bolshevik Revolution and two devastating world wars,
we will examine the varied responses that such chaos occasioned in the writing of that time. Change
can be both prohibitive and liberating, and we will consider how it dissolved and reshaped individual
Comparative Literature

notions of identity, tradition, morality, the creative process, spirituality, physical life, gender, and, per-
haps most importantly, how it forced writers to ponder what it means to be human. Readings will in-
clude Wilde, Kafka, Proust, Freud, Mann, Mandelstam, Bulgakov, Woolf, Babel, Akhmatova, and
Orwell. We will also consider works from the other arts so as to broaden our understanding of aesthet-
ic practice during this period. All readings in English.

COMP 254T(S) The Fallen Woman in Literature and Film (Same as Women's and
Gender Studies 254T) (W)
The fallen woman is a recurrent character that appears in many guises throughout the history of narra-
tive. In this course we will explore how and why the fallen woman in her various manifestations has
had such a prominent role in literature and film across different cultures and epochs. From Eve to the
wily courtesan, from the adulteress, to the femme fatale of hard-boiled films, she is a figure that often
reveals more about society than anyone else. At the same time, by virtue of being "fallen" she is usual-
ly on the fringes. Outside society, and outside morality, she lacks a recognizable social role. This situa-
tion provides her character with a fascinating and paradoxical point of view that allows her to see
through society's self-conception. We will read several great works of literature and watch some of
the classic films in which the fallen woman is the central character and in which her unique perspec-
tive is highlighted. Authors will include Cervantes, Balzac, Flaubert, Maupassant, Hawthorne, Whar-
ton, James, Proust, and Rodoreda. We will watch films directed by, among others, Renoir, Buñuel,
Mizoguchi and Pasolini. Additional reading will be drawn from historical and critical works. All read-
ings in English.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: meetings between the instructor and each pair of students will take
place once a week. Each student will write a 5- to 7-page paper every other week to which his partner
will formally respond during our meeting.

COMP 261(F) The Arab Novel in Translation (Same as African and Middle Eastern Studies
251)*
This course explores the relationship between the development of the Arab novel and the challenges
faced by the Arab World in the twentieth century. The Arab novel is neither a mere copy of its western
counterpart nor is it simply an organic outgrowth of the literary tradition of the Arab World. It is, rath-
er, a literary response to the region's own particular experiences with modernity. As such, it is a rich
site to explore how groups and individuals in the region have dealt with issues such as urbanization,
war, imperialism, nationalism, and gender. We will consider how the issues faced by the region have
had an impact on literary language and style. We will also discuss the translation of Arabic literature
into English, since translation not only transforms the original text but also determines which texts
one is able to read. How does this fact affect our ability to address the above issues if the novels that are
available to non-Arabic speakers are not necessarily representative of literary production in Arabic
itself? We will explore these questions through the reading of novels by writers such as Naguib Mah-
fouz (Nobel Prize winner from Egypt), Ghassan Kanafani (Palestine), Hanan al-Shaykh (Lebanon),
al-Tayyib Salih (The Sudan), Assia Djebar (Algeria) and others. In addition to novels, we will read a
variety of secondary texts and watch at least one feature film from the region. All readings in English.
Format: discussion with some lecturing. The final grade will be based on class participation, short
weekly reaction papers, a short individual or group presentation, and a final paper of 6 to 8 pages re-
lated to the student's presentation topic.

Why is it that the most famous work of Arabic literature in the West was, until recently, relatively
unread in the Arab world? This course will examine the discovery-some would say invention-of The
Arabian Nights in the West and the reasons for its languishing for so long in relative obscurity in the
Comparative Literature
­ 128 ­
Arab World. We will also study closely the text itself, an amazing collection of narratives framed by
the famous tale of the king Shahriyar and his story-telling wife Shahrazad. Toward the end of the
course we will look at some of the modern creative texts-written and filmic-inspired by The Arabian
Nights in both the West and the Arab world. Primary readings will be supplemented by secondary
historical and critical literature on the work and the course will deal centrally with issues of narration,
colonialism, orientalism, translation, and gender. All readings in English.
Requirements: The final grade will be based on class participation, short weekly reaction papers, one
individual or group presentation and a final paper of 6 to 8 pages.

To bring the all-too familiar everyday to our attention, artists and writers have made it strange. What
happens when we view everyday life from elsewhere? While everyday culture has often been experi-
enced as repressive and alienating in modern Western societies, a new importance assigned to every-
day life was seen as liberating in Japan during the twenties and in contemporary China. The contours
of the everyday are delightfully vague, and it always exceeds theorizing. For instance, is its privileged
place the street or the home? Is it lived largely in institutions that regulate our daily lives, or is it lived
between and outside them? Everyday commodities like sugar, the car, standardized housing, the post-
card will be analyzed. Fiction by Flaubert, Tolstoy, Kafka, Woolf, Perec, Saramago, Suri, Ha Jin, and
Yoshimoto. Several films will also be discussed. Theory may include excerpts from Freud, Kracauer,
Goffman, Lefebvre, de Beauvoir, Friedan, Barthes, Foucault, and Bourdieu. All readings in English.

sistant Professors: FREUND, LERNER*, TERESCO.
Computers play an enormously important role in our society. General-purpose computers are used
widely in business and industry and are found in an increasing number of homes. Special-purpose
computers are found in everything from automobile engines to microwave ovens. Understanding and
exploiting the great potential of computers is the goal of research in computer science. Among the
many fascinating research projects in progress in computer science today are investigations of: ways
to focus more computational power on a problem through the simultaneous use of many processors in
parallel; revolutionary computer languages designed to simplify the process of constructing complex
programs for computers; the use of computer-generated graphic images in the arts and as a tool for
visualization in the natural sciences; and the use of digital methods in global communications. The
Computer Science Department at Williams seeks to provide students with an understanding of the
principles underlying computer science that will enable them to understand and participate in these
exciting developments.
The department recognizes that students' interests in computer science will vary widely. The de-
partment attempts to meet these varying interests through: (1) its major; (2) a selection of courses in-
tended primarily for those who are interested in a brief introduction to computer science or who seek
to develop some specific expertise in computing for application in some other discipline; and (3) rec-
ommendations for possible sequences of courses for the non-major who wants a more extensive
introduction to computer science. These offerings are discussed in detail below.
MAJOR
The goal of the major is to provide an understanding of algorithmic problem-solving as well as the
conceptual organization of computers and complex programs running on them. Emphasis is placed on
the fundamental principles of computer science, building upon the mathematical and theoretical ideas
underlying these principles. The introductory and core courses build a broad and solid base for under-
standing computer science. The more advanced courses allow students to sample a variety of special-
ized areas of computer science including graphics, artificial intelligence, computer networks, soft-
ware engineering, compiler design, and operating systems. Independent study and honors work pro-
vide opportunities for students to study and conduct research on topics of special interest.
The major in Computer Science equips students to take advantage of awide variety of career oppor-
tunities. Thus the major can be used as a preparation for a career in computing, for graduate school, or
simply to provide an in-depth study of computer science for the student whosefuturecareerwillonly
tangentially be related to computer science.

MAJOR REQUIREMENTS
Required Courses in Computer Science
A minimum of 8 courses is required in Computer Science, including the following:
Introductory Courses
Computer Science 134 Introduction to Computer Science
Computer Science 136 Data Structures and Advanced Programming
Core Courses
Computer Science 237 Computer Organization
Computer Science 256 Algorithm Design and Analysis
Computer Science 334 Principles of Programming Languages
Computer Science 361 Theory of Computation
Electives
Two or more electives (bringing the total number of Computer Science courses to at least 8) chosen
from 300- or 400-level courses in Computer Science. At least one of these must be a course designated
as a PROJECT COURSE. Computer Science courses with 9 as the middle digit (reading, research, and
thesis courses) will normally not be used to satisfy the elective requirements. Students may petition the
department to waive this restriction with good reasons.
Required Courses in Mathematics
Mathematics 211 Linear Algebra
Mathematics 251 Discrete Mathematics
Students who take Computer Science 105, 108 or 109 may use that course as one of the two elec-
tives required for the major in Computer Science. Those who count Computer Science 109 toward the
major must select an elective different from Computer Science 371 (Computer Graphics) for their
project course. Similarly, students who count Computer Science 108 as an elective cannot select
Computer Science 373 as their second elective. Note also that Computer Science 108 and 109 are not
open to students who have already successfully completed a Computer Science course number 134 or
above; Computer Science 105 is not open to those who have already successfully completed a Com-
puter Science course numbered 136 or above.
To be eligible for admission to the major, a student must normally have completed Computer Sci-
ence 136 as well as Mathematics 251 by the end of the sophomore year. Mathematics 211 must be
completed by the end of the junior year. Students are urged to have completed two of the four core
courses (Computer Science 237, 256, 334, and 361) by the end of the sophomore year and must nor-
mally have completed at least three out of the four core courses by the end of the junior year.
Satisfactory participation is required in the Computer Science Colloquium by all senior majors.
With the advance permission of the department, two appropriate mathematics courses numbered 240
or above may be substituted for one Computer Science elective. Other variations in the required
courses, adapting the requirements to the special needs and interests of the individual student, may be
arranged in consultation with the department.
Potential majors are strongly encouraged to pick up the latest copy of the Informal Guide to
Courses in Computer Science, which can be obtained from the departmental office or on the World
Wide Web at http://www.cs.williams.edu. This document contains much more information on the ma-
jor, including suggested patterns of course selection and advice on courses relevant to different stu-
dent goals.
LABORATORY FACILITIES
The Computer Science Department maintains two departmental computer laboratories for students
taking Computer Science courses. The Macintosh laboratory (used in Computer Science 105, 108,
109, 134, 136, and 237) consists of an electronic classroom containing Macintosh G4 computers. This
laboratory also contains projection facilities enabling the instructor to display the computer screen
during lectures and demonstrations.
The Unix laboratory (used in courses numbered 136 and above) consists of a network of worksta-
tions that are available exclusively to students taking advanced Computer Science courses. These
workstations also support student and faculty research in computer science.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE
The degree with honors in Computer Science is awarded to a student who has demonstrated out-
standing intellectual achievement in a program of study which extends beyond the requirements of
the regular major. The principal considerations in recommending a student for the degree with honors
will be: mastery of core material, ability to pursue independent study of computer science, originality
in methods of investigation, and creativity in research. Honors study is highly recommended for those
students with strong academic records in computer science who wish to attend graduate school, pur-
sue high-level industrial positions in computing, or who would simply like to experience research in
computer science.
Computer Science
­ 131 ­
Prospective honors students are urged to consult with their departmental advisor at the time of reg-
istration in the spring of the sophomore or at the beginning of the junior year to arrange a program of
study that could lead to the degree with honors. Such a program normally consists of Computer Sci-
ence 493 and 494 and a WSP of independent research under the guidance of a Computer Science fac-
ulty member, culminating in a thesis which is judged acceptable by the department. The program pro-
duces a significant piece of written work. The written work often includes a major computer program,
depending on the nature of the honors work. All honors candidates are required to give an oral presen-
tation of their work in the Computer Science Colloquium in early spring semester.
Students considering honors work should obtain permission from the department before register-
ing in the fall of the senior year. Formal admission to candidacy occurs at the beginning of the spring
semester of the senior year and is based on promising performance in the fall semester and winter
study units of honors work. Recommendations for the degree with honors will be made for outstand-
ing performance in the three honors courses. Highest honors will be recommended for students who
have displayed exceptional ability, achievement, or originality.
INTRODUCTORY COURSES
The department offers four introductory courses--Computer Science 105: Understanding the
Web: Technologies and Techniques, Computer Science 108: Artificial Intelligence: Image and Real-
ity, Computer Science 109: The Art and Science of Computer Graphics, and Computer Science 134:
Introduction to Computer Science.
Students planning to major in Computer Science will usually begin their studies within the depart-
ment by taking Computer Science 134. Computer Science 134 provides an introduction to computer
science and programming. No programming experience is required in order to take this course. Stu-
dents with significant programming experience should consider electing Computer Science 136 (see
"Advanced Placement" below). The combination of Computer Science 134 and Computer Science
136 serves as a prerequisite to most upper-level courses in the department.
Those students interested in learning more about important new ideas and developments in Com-
puter Science, but who are not necessarily interested in developing extensive programming skills,
should consider Computer Science 105: Understanding the Web: Technologies and Techniques,
Computer Science 108: Artificial Intelligence: Image and Reality, or Computer Science 109: The Art
and Science of Computer Graphics. Computer Science 108 discusses the techniques used to construct
computer systems that exhibit intelligent behavior from learning to planning and problem-solving.
Computer Science 109 introduces students to the techniques of computer graphics used for the cre-
ation of artistic images.
Non-majors primarily interested in developing programming skills for use in other disciplines are
directed to Computer Science 134. Alternately, those expecting to construct programs that produce
graphic images may wish to consider the combination of Computer Science 109 followed by Com-
puter Science 134.
Those students intending to take several Computer Science courses are urged to begin satisfying
their mathematics requirements early. Note in particular that Mathematics 251 covers material com-
plementing that in the introductory courses (Computer Science 134 and 136) and is a prerequisite for
many advanced courses. As a result it should be taken in the first year a student is at Williams or in the
fall of the sophomore year if possible.
ADVANCED PLACEMENT
Students with an extensive background in computer science are urged to take the Advanced Place-
ment AB Examination in Computer Science. A score of 4 or better on the AB exam is normally re-
quired for advanced placement in Computer Science 136. Students scoring 3 or lower on that exam or
who have taken the Advanced Placement A Examination in Computer Science should consider enrol-
ling in Computer Science 134.
Students who wish to be placed in Computer Science 136 but who have not taken the Advanced
Placement Examination should consult with the department. Such students should have had a good
course in computer science using a structured language such as C++ or Java, and should have covered
such topics as recursion, arrays, records, files, and have some exposure to object-orientation.
PLANS OF STUDY FOR NON-MAJORS
The faculty in Computer Science believes that students can substantially enrich their academic ex-
perience by completing a coherent plan of study in one or more disciplines outside of their majors.
With this in mind, we have attempted to provide students majoring in other departments with options
in our department's curriculum ranging fromtwo-coursesequences to collections of courses equiva-
lent to what would constitute a minor at institutions that recognize such a concentration. Students in-
terested in designing such a plan of study in any department should discuss their plans in detail with a
member of thefaculty.Wewelcomesuchinquiriesfromstudents.Toassiststudents making such plans,
however, we include some suggestions below.
Students seeking to develop an extensive knowledge of computer science without majoring in the
department are encouraged to use the major requirements as a guide. In particular, the four core
courses required of majors are intended to provide a broad knowledge of topics underlying all of com-
Computer Science
­ 132 ­
puter science. Students seeking a concentration in Computer Science are urged to complete at least
two of these courses followed by one of our upper-level electives. Such a program would typically
require the completion of a total of five computer science courses and one course in mathematics
(MATH 251).
There are several sequences of courses appropriate for those primarily interested in developing
skills in programming for use in other areas. For general programming, Computer Science 134 fol-
lowed by Computer Science 136 and 237 will provide students with a strong background in algorithm
and data structure design together with an understanding of issues of correctness and efficiency. Com-
puter Science 323 provides valuable exposure to the techniques and tools needed for the development
and maintenance of large software systems. The sequence of courses Computer Science 109 and 134
would provide sufficient competence in computer graphics for many students interested in applying
such knowledge either in the arts or sciences. For students requiring more expertise in the techniques
of computer graphics, Computer Science 136 and 371 could be added to form a four-course sequence.
There are, of course, many other alternatives. We encourage interested students to consult with the
department chair or other members of the department's faculty.
GENERAL REMARKS
Divisional Requirements
All Computer Science courses listed may be used to satisfy the Division III distribution require-
ment.
Alternate Year Courses
Computer Science 108, 109, 323, 336, 337T, 338T, 371, 373, 432, and 434 are each normally of-
fered every other year. All other Computer Science courses are normally offered every year.
Course Numbering
The increase from 100, through 200 and 300, to 400 indicates in most instances an increasing level
of maturity in the subject that is expected of students. Within a series, numeric order does not indicate
the relative level of difficulty of courses. Rather, the middle digit of the course number (particularly in
upper-level courses) generally indicates the area of computer science covered by the course.
Course Descriptions
Brief descriptions of the courses in Computer Science can be found below. More detailed informa-
tion on the offerings in the department is available in the Informal Guide to Courses in Computer Sci-
ence.
Courses Open on a Pass-Fail Basis
Students taking a computer science course on a pass-fail basis must meet all the requirements set
for students taking the course on a graded basis.
With the permission of the department, any course offered by the department may be taken on a
pass-fail basis. Courses graded with the pass-fail option may not be used to satisfy any of the major or
honors requirements. However, with the permission of the department, courses taken in the depart-
ment beyond those requirements may be taken on a pass-fail basis.
COURSES INTENDED PRIMARILY FOR NON-MAJORS
CSCI 105(F) Understanding the Web: Technologies and Techniques (Q)
This course will enable students to understand the technology that underlies the World Wide Web and
provide them with the skills needed to effectively use this new medium. The course introduces tech-
niques for creating hypermedia documents on the web. Students will learn the basics of HTML, the
formatting language used to author World Wide Web documents, and a subset of Java, a language that
can be used to add interactive elements to web pages. The technology that makes the Web possible is
developing as rapidly as its use is growing. New facilities are introduced frequently. Web "standards"
are evolving in several directions simultaneously as vendors introduce competing proposals. Accord-
ingly, rather than simply learning how to use the Web as it is today, we will also examine the funda-
mental technologies that make the Web possible. These include digital encoding techniques, comput-
er network organization, communication protocols and encryption systems. This material will leave
students prepared to understand future possibilities for, and obstacles to, the development of the Inter-
net.
Format: lecture/laboratory. Evaluation will be based on homework, laboratory work and examina-
tions. 55% of a student's final grade will be determined by performance on examinations.
Prerequisites: Mathematics 100 or 101 (or demonstrating proficiency in the Quantitative Studies
diagnostic test--see catalog under Mathematics). This course is not open to students who have suc-
cessfully completed a Computer Science course numbered 136 or above. Enrollment limit: 60 (ex-
pected: 40). This is a quantitative/formal reasoning course.

CSCI 108(S) Artificial Intelligence: Image and Reality (Q)
Over 50 years ago, scientists began to envision a world where computers and humans could converse.
In 1956 the field of "Artificial Intelligence" was officially born, and the work on "AI" began in ear-
nest. Walking and talking robots are still mostly the stuff of science fiction, but AI is close to making
them reality. In this course, we will explore the field of Artificial Intelligence. We will try to answer
the question "what makes a machine intelligent?" Among the systems we will explore in lecture will
be game-playing systems, systems that learn from their environments, and systems that create plans
for complex tasks. Underlying all the topics addressed in this course will be two fundamental issues:
How can information be represented in a computer so that the machine is able to make use of it? How
can the system manipulate that information so that it is able to perform a task that requires intelli-
gence? This course will emphasize hands-on laboratory experience. Laboratory projects will focus on
the building and programming of simple robots.
Format: lecture/laboratory. Evaluation will be based on weekly laboratory programming assign-
ments, four problem sets, short papers, and a final examination having similar format to the problem
sets.
This course does not assume any programming experience, but assumes that the student is comfort-
able working with a computer. This course is not open to students who have successfully completed a
Computer Science course numbered 136 or above. Enrollment limit: 18 (expected: 18). Preference
given to first-year students and sophomores. This is a quantitative/formal reasoning course.

COURSES INTENDED FOR BOTH NON-MAJORS AND MAJORS
CSCI 134(F,S) Introduction to Computer Science (Q)
More than the processor inside, it is the software running on a computer that determines the machine's
behavior and usefulness. In this course, students will learn principles of design, implementation, and
testing of object-oriented programs. Using the Java programming language, we will cover fundamen-
tal concepts including classes, objects, message sending, control structures, arrays, files, and event-
driven programming, as well as providing an introduction to concurrency. Through the study of these
topics, students will learn both to construct programs of their own and to understand the capabilities
and limitations of existing software.
Format: lecture/laboratory. Evaluation will be based on weekly programming assignments, two test
programs, and midterm and final examinations.
Prerequisites: Mathematics 100 or 101 (or demonstrating proficiency in the Quantitative Studies
diagnostic test --see catalog under Mathematics). No previous programming experience is required
or assumed. Students with prior experience with object-oriented programming should discuss ap-
propriate course placement with members of the department. Enrollment limit: 30 per section (ex-
pected: 25 per section). This is a quantitative/formal reasoning course.

CSCI 256(S) Algorithm Design and Analysis (Q)
This course is concerned with investigating methods of designing efficient and reliable algorithms.
By carefully analyzing the underlying structure of the problem to be solved it is often possible to dra-
matically decrease the computational resources needed to find a solution. Through such analysis one
can also verify that an algorithm will perform correctly, as well as accurately estimate its running time
and space requirements. We will present several algorithm design strategies that build on data struc-
tures and programming techniques introduced in Computer Science 136, including induction, divide-
and-conquer, dynamic programming, and greedy algorithms. Particular topics to be considered will
include algorithms in graph theory, computational geometry, string processing, and advanced data
structures. In addition, an introduction to complexity theory and the complexity classes P and NP will
be provided.
Format: lecture. Evaluation is based upon problem sets and programming assignments, and midterm
and final examinations.

techniques for transmitting information efficiently and reliably over a variety of communication me-
dia. We will look at the addressing and routing problems that must be solved to ensure that transmitted
data gets to the desired destination. We will come to understand the impact that the distributed nature
of all network problems has on their difficulty. We will examine the ways in which these issues are
addressed by current networking protocols such as TCP/IP and Ethernet. This course will be taught in
the tutorial format. Students will meet weekly with the instructor in pairs to present solutions to prob-
lem sets and reports evaluating the technical merit of current solutions to various networking prob-
lems. In addition, students will be asked to complete several programming assignments involving the
implementation of simple communication protocols. There will be a midterm and a final examination.

CONTRACT MAJOR
Contract Major Advisor: PETER D. GRUDIN
Students with the talent and energy for working independently and with the strong support of two
faculty advisors may undertake a Contract Major: a coherent study of an interdisciplinary subject not
covered by a regularly offered major. Such a major must be in an area suitable to the talents of the
faculty in residence and cannot consist of minor modifications to an existing major. A Contract Major
also must conform to the structure and have the coherence of a departmental or program major--i.e.,
it must embody a disciplined cumulative study that moves from an elementary to an advanced level
and culminates in a synthesis similar to a senior major course. Hence a Contract Major usually con-
sists of a program of existing courses, sometimes supplemented by courses of independent study and
the senior course.
The process of constructing a proposal for a Contract Major is both interesting and demanding. As
part of that process, students should consider carefully the advantage of working within existing ma-
jors or programs, taking note of the considerable intellectual pleasures involved in sharing similar
educational experiences with other students working within the same field. Students might also con-
sider whether their interests could be met by completing a regular major and coordinate program, or a
double major, or simply by working outside a major field in courses of special interest. Because the
Contract Major represents an exceptional opportunity provided for students whose interests cannot be
met through existing departmental and interdepartmental majors and programs, it cannot be pursued
in conjunction with another major.
Students who wish to explore or propose a Contract Major should consult with the Contract Major
advisor and with potential faculty sponsors as early as possible in the fall semester of the sophomore
year, and then--during the sophomore year--follow these procedures:
1) The student must initiate discussion with at least two members of the faculty from differing
departments who expect to be in residence during the student's senior year and who are willing to
endorse the Contract Major and undertake a central role in supervising its implementation, criti-
cism, evaluation, and ultimate validation. Since in essence faculty sponsors substitute for the stu-
dent's major department, they are expected to play an important role in the Contract Major.
The student must develop, in conjunction with the faculty sponsors, a written proposal (forms and
guidelines are available in the Dean's Office) which should contain:
a) a description of the proposed major area of study and an explanation of the reasons for
proposing the Contract Major. A sound and persuasive rationale for the major is crucial for
obtaining approval from the Committee on Educational Policy (C.E.P.).
b) a list of all courses in the proposed major and an explanation for each course choice. A
minimum of nine semester courses, one of which must be designated the senior major
course (and taken during the senior year), must be completed for a Contract Major. Nor-
mal rules governing course grades and grade point average apply for entry into and contin-
uation in a Contract Major.
c) a list of other courses taken or anticipated to meet College distribution requirements, including
grades received in courses already completed.
2) By mid-January, the student must meet with the Contract Major Advisor to discuss and further
develop the proposal.
3) By the first day of spring semester classes, the student must submit a complete draft of the pro-
posal to the Contract Major Advisor for feedback.
4) By the end of the fourth week of the spring semester, the student must submit the final proposal to
the Contract Major Advisor. By this date also, the faculty sponsors must submit their endorsement
forms to the Contract Major Advisor. If the student is essentially proposing to transform an existing
coordinate program (e.g., African-American Studies, area studies programs, Environmental Studies,
Women's and Gender Studies, etc.), into a Contract Major, the chair of that program should also sub-
mit to the Contract Major Advisor a statement attesting to the validity of the proposal by the end of the
fourth week of the spring semester.
5) The Contract Major Advisor then conveys the proposal, a copy of the student's most recent aca-
demic progress report, the faculty sponsors' endorsement forms, and recommendations regarding the
Contract Major, Critical Languages
­ 137 ­
feasibility and substance of the proposal, for approval by the Committee on Educational Policy. The
C.E.P., after consultation with departments and programs substantially affected by a proposal, will
vote on each proposal individually and will report the decision to the Contract Major Advisor, who
will notify students and sponsors before the spring registration deadline. If the time needed for C.E.P.
review demands it, the Contract Major Advisor may postpone notification to students and permit
them to register late without penalty. In making its decisions, the C.E.P. considers the student's aca-
demic record, the coherence and feasibility of the plan of study, and the degree of support expressed
by the faculty sponsors and, if appropriate, program chairs.
Subsequent changes in a Contract Major must be requested in writing by the student and ap-
proved by the faculty sponsors as well as by the Contract Major Advisor. Where there has been sub-
stantial alteration of the original program, the Contract Major Advisor will forward the student's
written request to the C.E.P. for reconsideration.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN THE CONTRACT MAJOR
The route to the degree with honors in the Contract Major will normally be a senior thesis requir-
ing two semesters and a winter study of work. In special circumstances a student may propose to
substitute a one-semester course or a winter study course for one of his or her thesis courses and
write a mini-thesis. The Contract Major with honors shall comprise a minimum of eleven semester
courses or ten semester courses plus one winter study. One semester of independent study undertak-
en for the thesis may be allowed to fulfill the requirement for a senior major course.
The faculty sponsors shall determine by the end of winter study whether the student is to be ad-
mitted to honors candidacy. If not admitted to honors candidacy, the student may elect not to continue
further independent study. If admitted to honors candidacy, the student shall submit a written thesis or
minithesis to three faculty readers, at least one of whom shall be a faculty sponsor and at least one of
whom shall not be a faculty sponsor. The outside reader or readers shall be selected by the Contract
Major Advisor in consultation with the faculty sponsors. There will be a one-hour oral exam by the
readers, and they shall make a final decision regarding honors.

CRITICAL LANGUAGES (Div. I)
Coordinator, JANE CANOVA
The Critical Languages Program enables students to study important foreign languages not taught
in regular courses at Williams. The languages offered are Arabic, Hebrew, Hindi, Korean, and Swahi-
li. Each may be studied for one year at the elementary level.
All courses adhere to the guidelines of the National Association of Self-Instructional Language
Programs (NASILP). Students work independently with standard language textbooks and individual
cassette tapes for roughly ten hours per week and attend two one-hour group review sessions per week
with native-speaking tutors. Language faculty from other institutions conduct the midterm and final
exams and determine the final grades.
To be eligible for a Critical Languages course, the student must:
z demonstrate proven capability for independent work and previous success in foreign language
study;
z explain how study of the language will integrate with his or her major or other academic inter-
ests;
z present a letter of recommendation from a Williams faculty member;
z in some cases take a pretest for placement;
z have attained sophomore standing or higher;
z have at least a 3.00 Grade Point Average.
Interested students should obtain an application form for the desired course in early April. Forms
are available at the Center for Foreign Languages, Literatures, and Cultures in Weston Hall. Students
must meet with the program coordinator and hand in the completed application forms no later than
one week before preregistration. The application must be approved before registering for the course.
Students should note that Critical Languages courses are hyphenated, meaning no credit is given
for the first semester until the second semester is successfully completed. Students must normally be-
gin a course in the fall semester. It cannot be taken Pass/Fail.

A Critical Languages course will be scheduled only if and when at least two students are accepted
into the course. Students planning to register for the course must attend an organizational meeting the
first week of each semester.

MAJOR
For students who have already taken Economics 101, your course sequence should be Econom-
ics 101, any Economics course numbered 201 to 240 prior to taking Economics 251 or 251M,
252, and a statistical methods course (either 253 or 255, or Statistics 201 and 346) which should
be taken before 401, plus any three economics electives of which at least two must be selected
from advanced electives numbered 350 to 394, and Economics 401.
(Please note that students who have taken Economics 101 cannot take Economics 110 or 120.
Note that students cannot take Economics 110 or 120 without having passed the quantitative
studies exam or the equivalent.)
Students who are beginning their sequence with Economics 110 or Economics 120 should fol-
low the following sequence:
Economics 110 Principles of Microeconomics
Economics 120 Principles of Macroeconomics
(Economics 110 and 120 may be taken separately and in any order)
Economics 251 Price and Allocation Theory
or Economics 251M Price and Allocation Theory (This section of the Price and Allocation
Theory course will employ a somewhat more mathematical exposition of microtheory.)
Economics 252 Macroeconomics
One statistical methods course, Economics 253 or 255, or Mathematics 201 and 346. (The sta-
tistical methods course should be taken before 401.)
Three Economics electives, of which at least two must be selected from advanced electives
numbered 350 to 394
Economics 401 Senior Seminar
To complete the major, economics students must receive a passing grade on the oral examination
given in the course of Economics 401. A student who fails the oral examination must re-take the exam
and receive a passing grade.
The primary objectives of the major are to develop an understanding of economic aspects of con-
temporary life and to equip the student to analyze economic issues of social policy. The introductory
courses stress use of the basic elements of economic analysis for understanding and resolving such
issues. The two required intermediate theory courses then provide a more thorough grounding in eco-
nomics as a discipline by examining the strengths and weaknesses of the price system in allocating
economics resources and by examining the aggregate processes which determine employment, infla-
tion, and growth. A course in statistical methods (253 or 255, or alternatively, Statistics 201 plus Sta-
tistics 346) equips the major to understand and apply the basic tools of quantitative empirical analysis.
Majors must take three electives, in at least two of which they apply parts of the theory learned in the
required intermediate theory courses. In the senior seminar, the student studies a series of current
theoretical or policy problems, applying analysis and research methods.
The normal requirement that nine economics courses be taken at Williams will usually be waived
only on the basis of transferred credit deemed acceptable by the department. Credit is granted based
on grades consistent with college policy on various examinations:
Economics
­ 139 ­
z Students who receive a 5 on the Microeconomics AP or Macroeconomics AP exam, or a 5 on each,
may place out of Economics 110 or 120, or both, respectively, but major credit will be given for only
one course.
z The Department will grant major credit for both Economics 110 and 120 to a student who receives a
6 or 7 on the higher-level Economics IB examination, and that student can place into any 200-level
course or intermediate-level micro or macro course.
z For A levels credit, the Department will grant major credit for both Economics 110 and 120 to a
student who receives a grade of A or B.
Prospective majors please note that instructors in all sections of Economics 251, 252, 253, and 255
feel free to use elementary calculus in assigned readings, lectures, problem sets, and examinations;
therefore, Economics 110 and 120 and Mathematics 103 or its equivalent are required as prerequisites
for these courses except for 251 which only requires Economics 110 and Mathematics 103 as a pre-
requisite. By elementary calculus is meant differentiation of single variable polynomial functions and
conditions for a maximum or minimum; it does not include integration or multivariable calculus.
Instructors in advanced electives (courses numbered 350-394) may also use elementary calculus in
assigned readings, lectures, problem sets, and examinations. Students interested in graduate study in
economics should consider studying more advanced mathematics; see your advisor for specific
suggestions. Students are also reminded that some courses now have specific mathematics require-
ments; see course descriptions.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN ECONOMICS
We encourage all majors who have at least a 3.5 GPA in economics courses to consider honors. To
be admitted to candidacy for honors in economics a student must complete a substantial piece of inde-
pendent research. Two routes to honors are open: the Specialization Route and the Thesis Route.
1) Specialization Route, consisting of these three units:
a. Development of a thesis proposal in the second module of Economics 401;
b. An honors winter study project (W030) in January of the senior year;
c. Economics 404 Honors Seminar.
Students who have notified the department of their interest in writing an honors thesis will use the
second module of Economics 401 to develop a thesis proposal. Such proposals frequently build on
research papers completed for advanced electives, but this is not a requirement. If the proposal is ac-
cepted, the student will be admitted to W030. The department provides a memorandum to majors with
more details every spring and fall.
2) Thesis Route (Economics 493-W031-494):
A few students each year will be accepted for year-long thesis research on a subject closely related
to the scholarly interests of a faculty member. A student who hopes to do such independent and ad-
vanced research in close association with a faculty member should begin to work out a mutually satis-
factory topic early in the second semester of his or her junior year. Application to the department must
be made before the end of the junior year by submitting a detailed proposal for work under the super-
vision of the faculty member. The WSP of the senior year is also spent on the thesis.
TheCollege Bulletin states that students who wish to receive honors must take at least one course in
addition to the minimum number required for the major. Students who pursue a year-long thesis and
therefore take both Economics 493 and 494 may substitute Economics 493foranupper-levelelective
iftheywishto.StudentswhopursuetheSpecializationRouteto Honors may not substitute Economics
404 for an upper- (or lower-) level elective requirement.
AFRICAN-AMERICAN STUDIES AND AREA STUDIES
A major in economics who concentrates in African-American or Area Studies may substitute the
non-economics courses in the concentration for one lower-level elective in the Economics major, but
not for an advanced elective (350-394).
Note on Course Numbers: Courses between 201 and 240 are lower-level electives and are open to
first-year students who have taken 110 or 120 (or 101). Courses between 260 and 349 are intermedi-
ate electives which do not build on specific prior experience, but do require some maturity, so they
have any two economics courses or permission of the instructor as prerequisites. Courses 350 and
above are advanced electives primarily designed for Economics and Political Economy majors and
have intermediate theory prerequisites.
ECON 110(F,S) Principles of Microeconomics (Q)
This course is an introduction to the study of the forces of supply and demand that determine prices
and the allocation of resources in markets for goods and services, markets for labor, and markets for
natural resources. The focus is on how and why markets work, why they may fail to work, and the
policy implications of both their successes and failures. The course focuses on developing the basic
tools of microeconomic analysis and then applying those tools to topics of popular or policy interest
such as minimum wage legislation, pollution control, competition policy, international trade policy,
Economics
­ 140 ­
discrimination, tax policy, and the role of government in a market economy. This course is required of
majors and highly recommended for those non-majors interested in Environmental Studies, Women's
and Gender Studies and Political Economy. The department recommends that students follow this
course with Principles of Macroeconomics or with a lower-level elective that has Economics 110 as
its prerequisite. Students may alternatively proceed directly to Intermediate Microeconomics after
taking this introductory course.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: problem sets, quizzes, short essays, midterm, final exam.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 40 (expected: 40). This is a quantitative/formal reasoning course.

ECON 203(S) Gender and Economics (Same as Women's and Gender Studies 203)
This course uses economic analysis to explore how gender differences can lead to differences in eco-
nomic outcomes, in both households and the labor market. Questions to be covered include: How
does the family function as an economic unit? How do individuals allocate time between the labor
market and the household? How have changes in family structure affected women's employment, and
vice-versa? What are possible explanations for gender differences in labor force participation, occu-
pational choice, and earnings? What is the role of government in addressing gender issues in the home
and the workplace? How successful are government policies that primarily affect women (e.g., com-
parable worth policies, AFDC/TANF, subsidization of child care)? The course will focus on the cur-
rent experience of women in the United States, but will place these gender differences in a historical
and cross-cultural context.

This is an introduction to the economies and development problems of the poorer countries in Africa,
Asia, and Latin America. We shall discover both the roots and the extent of these problems, and ex-
plore possible solutions. The course begins by investigating how different socio-historical environ-
ments have shaped various third world economies. Then, keeping this in context, it attempts to get an
idea of the best feasible policies to tackle a whole range of critical development issues. These issues
include poverty and its alleviation, the population explosion, employment and migration patterns,
raising education and health standards, and making agriculture and industry more efficient. Finally,
we will consider some broader international issues--like patterns of trade, foreign aid, and the in-
ternational debt crisis.
Each student will be expected to study these issues for an individual country or region, attempting to
get an idea of the socio-economic context from reading examples of relevant third world literature.

of intervention? What effects do government policies have on individual incentives? The course will
cover issues in both taxation and spending. Specific programs will be considered such as Social Secu-
rity, Medicare, education, and public assistance for the poor. We will also discuss rationales and strate-
gies for reforming the U.S. tax system.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements will include two short policy memos, a midterm and a final.

ECON 207(F,S) China's Economic Transformation Since 1980*
Over the past twenty years, China has undergone an unprecedented economic turnaround. Since
opening the economy, average incomes in China have quadrupled and over 250 million people have
been lifted out of poverty. In this course, we will study the transformation of China's economy from
several perspectives. First, we will study the wildly successful transition of China from a commune-
based economy to ``market socialism.'' Within this study, we will discuss the ways that institutions
and organizational structures in China have led to and have been changed by the economy in transi-
tion. We will then discuss the effects of trade on China's economy, and conclude by exploring the
effect of China's rapid economic expansion on the environment. Throughout the course, we will con-
sider ways China's economy will continue to change over the next ten to twenty years.

ences in earnings and employment are analyzed through a variety of mechanisms such as labor force
participation, the role of unions, human capital accumulation and occupational choices. Topics with
important public policy implications such as discrimination and affirmative action, minimum wages,
and immigration will also be presented. Theoretical models will be presented and critiqued with em-

ECON 353(S) Decision-making and Judgment (Q)
Studies of decision-making suggest that most people substantially violate even undemanding models
of rationality. Are people truly irrational, and, if so, can anything be done about it? This course focuses
on normative decision-making (how we should make decisions under general conditions), descriptive
decision-making (how we do make decisions under actual conditions), and the contrast between the
two. We proceed to a view of prescriptive decision-making, or how we might combine normative and
descriptive insights to improve decision-making and judgment. Topics include decision-analytic
methods for improving decision-making rigor (e.g., decision trees); microeconomic concepts and
tools for optimization problems; game theory as appropriate; insights from cognitive psychology on
heuristics (short cuts) that sometimes help, but often distort, decision-making; integrated models of
judgment that call for both analysis and intuition; insights from the newly-emerging studies of judg-
ment and wisdom. Until a few years ago, this topic was given normative treatment in departments of
engineering, statistics and economics, and was separately taught as a descriptive science in depart-
ments of psychology. The apparent value of combining the two into a single, prescriptive analysis of
decision-making and judgment has led to a recent wave of interdisciplinary approaches such as the

ECON 358(F) International Economics
Over the past decade and since World War II, the growth of world trade has significantly outpaced
growth of real GDP to create an increasingly global marketplace. For a group of rapidly growing East
Asian economies, the expansion of trade and the rise in the share of manufactured products in exports
has been even more spectacular. This course will cover the theory and empirical analyses of the causes
and consequences of international trade. Special attention will be focused on the relations between
technology, trade, and economic growth. Topics covered will include trade and welfare, comparative
advantage and its sources, the role of increasing returns and product differentiation, trade and eco-
nomic growth, trade policy with and without market power, and foreign direct investment.

ECON 383(S) Cities, Regions and the Economy
Cities and urbanization can have significant impacts on the economy. In many developed economies,
a process of regional decline is associated with older, industrial cities. In developing countries, the
process of economic growth is generally associated with increasing urbanization. Urbanization, with
its increasing concentration of population and production, puts particular pressure on markets to allo-
cate resources for provision of land, housing, transportation, labor and public goods. Urbanization can
alter the productivity of land, labor, and capital in ways that can improve the welfare of residents and
the performance of the broader economy. In this course we will examine these conflicting economic
forces and examine some recent research that contributes to our understanding of the difference be-
tween regional growth and decline, and the role that the urban structure plays in these processes. We
will examine the function of land, housing, transportation, and labor markets in the urban context, and
the scope for public policies to improve the performance of the regional economy. Format: lecture/
discussion. Requirements: two midterms and a research paper.

Public finance is the branch of economics concerned with government expenditure and taxation, fo-
cusing primarily on microeconomic aspects of these activities. It provides tools for understanding the
effects of government policies, as well as a useful conceptual framework for analyzing normative
questions such as "what is a good policy?" This seminar will present the basic principles for public
finance, and apply them to topics of particular importance in developing countries. The course will
begin by considering the efficiency of market economics, and rationales for government intervention
in the market, such as public goods, externalities, information-based market failures, and equity. Ap-
plications include environmental policy, education, health care, aid to the poor, and social security.
We then move on to the economics of taxation, considering what kinds of taxes are used in developing
countries, the economic and distributional effects of taxation, questions of administration and eva-
sion, and options for reform such as the value added tax. Time permitting, we may also address topics
such as pubic enterprises, political economy, and decentralization.

ECON 520(S) Research Studies
In this course, each Fellow carries out an individual research study on a topic in which he or she has
particular interest, usually related to one of the three seminars. The approach and results of the study
are reported in a major paper. Research studies are analytical rather than descriptive and in nearly all
cases include quantitative analyses. Often the topic is a specific policy problem in a Fellow's own
country.

COURSES AND COURSE-NUMBERING
The course offerings in English enable students, whether majors or non-majors, to explore litera-
ture in a variety of ways, and to satisfy their interests in particular authors, literary periods, and genres.
They emphasize interpretive skills, systematic and critical thinking, and careful attention to the gener-
ic, cultural, and historical contexts of literature written in English.
100-LEVEL COURSES
At the introductory level, the department offers a range of writing-intensive 100-level courses
which focus on interpretive skills--techniques of reading--as well as skills in writing and argumenta-
tion. The department also offers English 150, Expository Writing, a course focusing on rudimentary
writing skills. All 100-level courses are designed primarily for first-year students, although they are
English
­ 150 ­
open to interested sophomores, juniors, and seniors. A 100-level course other than 150 is required for
admission to most upper-level English courses, except in the case of students who have placed out of
the introductory courses by receiving a score of 5 on the Advanced Placement examination in English
Literature.
200-LEVEL COURSES
Most 200-level courses are designed primarily for qualified first-year students, sophomores, and
junior and senior non-majors, but they are open to junior and senior majors and count as major
courses. Several 200-level courses have no prerequisites; see individual descriptions for details.
200-level Gateway courses are designed for first- and second-year students who are considering be-
coming English Majors, or who are interested in pursuing upper-level course work in the department.
All Gateway courses are writing-intensive. Completion of a Gateway course is a requirement for the
major.
300-LEVEL COURSES
The majority of English Department courses are at the 300 level. 300-level courses are open to
sophomores, juniors, and seniors. They are normally not open to first-year students, although in ex-
ceptional cases first-year students may enroll in a 300-level course with consent of the instructor.
400-LEVEL COURSES
400-level courses are intensive, discussion-oriented classes that place a premium on independent,
student-initiated work. Such classes can be structured in a variety of ways. A course might alternate
tutorial sessions with seminar meetings, or it might take the form of a colloquium, with discussions
organized around individual or group presentations on different aspects of a topic. Or a class might be
oriented around a long final paper on a topic of the student's devising and involve conferences focused
on the progress of that project. Limited to 15 students, 400-level courses are open to students who
have completed at least one 300-level English course; they should be attractive to any student inter-
ested in a course that emphasizes intensive discussion and independent work.
ADVISING
All junior and senior English majors are assigned a departmental faculty member as an advisor.
Students' preferences for advisors are solicited during the preregistration period in April, and assign-
ments are announced at the start of the school year.
Non-majors who wish to discuss English Department offerings are invited to see any faculty mem-
ber or the department chair.
MAJOR
Majors are urged to select a balance of intermediate and advanced courses, and to choose classes
from both the American and British traditions. Each student can fashion his or her own sequence of
study within a basic pattern that insures coherence and variety. This pattern comprises at least nine
courses.
They are also urged to elect collateral courses in subjects such as art, music, history, comparative
literature, philosophy, religion, theatre, and foreign languages with a view to supporting and broaden-
ing their studies in literature. In particular, the study of classical and modern languages, as well as of
foreign literatures, is strongly recommended.
Requirements
The nine courses required for the major must include the following:
1) Any 100-level English class except English 150. Students exempted by the department from
100-level courses will substitute an elective course.
2) At least two courses dealing primarily with literature written before 1700 (identified in paren-
theses at the end of the course description).
3) At least two courses dealing primarily with literature written between 1700 and 1900 (identified
in parentheses at the end of the course description).
4) At least one course dealing primarily with literature written after 1900 (identified in parentheses
at the end of the course description).
5) At least one "criticism" course (identified in parentheses at the end of course description). A
course fulfilling the criticism requirement entails a sustained and explicit reflection on problems of
critical method, whether by engaging a range of critical approaches and their implications or by ex-
ploring a particular method, theorist, or critic in depth. Please note that when a criticism course also
deals with literature satisfying a historical distribution requirement (pre-1700, 1700-1900, etc.), the
course may be used to satisfy either the criticism or the chronological requirement, but not both.
6) At least one 200-level Gateway course (listed at the end of the 200-level course descriptions).
Gateway courses are designed for first- and second-year students contemplating the major or intend-
ing to pursue more advanced work in the department; these courses focus on analytical writing skills
while introducing students to critical methods and historical approaches that will prove fruitful as they
pursue the major.
The English Department encourages majors to consider courses offered in the Comparative Litera-
ture Program. The English Department will allow students to countone course with a COMP prefix as
English
­ 151 ­
an elective in the English major. This course must be an elective; it may not be used to satisfy the de-
partment's historical distribution, criticism, or gateway requirements.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN ENGLISH
The English Department offers three different routes toward honors: a creative writing thesis, a crit-
ical thesis, and a critical specialization. The requirements of each are described below. Candidates for
the program should normally have at least a 3.5 average in courses taken in English, but admission
will not depend solely on course grades. Formal application to pursue honors must be made to the
director of honors by April of the junior year. For the Class of 2003, the Director of Honors is Profes-
sor Kathryn Kent.
All routes require honors students to take a minimum of TEN regular-semester courses (rather than
the nine otherwise required for the major), and to devote their senior year winter study course to their
honors projects. More specifically:
Students doing a creative writing thesis must, by graduation, take at least nine regular-semester
courses, and, in addition, take English 497 (Honors Independent Study, fall) and English 031 (Honors
Thesis, winter study) during senior year.
Students writing a critical thesis must, by graduation, take at least eight regular-semester courses,
and, in addition, take English 497 and English 498 (Honors Independent Study, fall and spring) and
English 031 (Senior Thesis, winter study) during senior year.
Students pursuing a critical specialization must, by graduation, take at least eight regular-semester
courses, and in addition, take English 497 and English 498 (Honors Independent Study, fall and
spring) and English 030 (Honors Colloquium: Specialization Route, winter study) during senior year.
A student who is highly-qualified to pursue honors, but who, for compelling reasons, is unable to
pursue a year-long project, may petition the department for permission to pursue a critical thesis or
critical specialization over one semester and the winter study term. Since the norm for these projects is
a full year, such permission will be granted only in exceptional circumstances. If granted, the stan-
dards for admission and for evaluating the final project would be identical to those that apply to year-
long honors projects.
All students who wish to apply to the honors program are required to consult with a prospective
faculty advisor, as well as with the director of honors, before April of the junior year. In early-April,
candidates submit a 1-page preliminary proposal that provides as specific a description as possible of
the proposed project. The director of honors reviews proposals with the faculty advisor, and then
makes a recommendation to the whole department. Students whose proposals are accepted receive
provisional admission to the program at this time. Students not admitted to the honors program are
advised, when appropriate, about other possible ways of pursuing their interests (e.g., independent
studies, regular departmental courses).
Admitted students must consult with their advisors before the end of the spring semester of junior
year to discuss reading or work pertinent to writing the formal honors prospectus. This prospectus,
due in early August before the fall semester of senior year, is a decisive factor in final admission to the
program. Two copies of the formal prospectus must be submitted--one to the director of honors, and
the other to the student's advisor. After reviewing the prospectuses and consulting with advisors, the
department's honors committee determines final admission to the program. Applicants are notified
during the first week of the fall term.
While grades for the fall and winter study terms are deferred until both the honors project and re-
view process are completed, students must do the equivalent of at least B+ work to continue in the
program. Should the student's work in the fall semester not meet this minimal standard, the course
will convert to a standard independent study (English 397), and the student will register for a regular
winter study project. A student engaged in a year-long project must likewise perform satisfactorily in
winter study (English 030 or 031) to enroll in English 498 in the spring semester. When such is not the
case, the winter study course will be converted to an independent study "99."
Students are required to submit to their advisor, on the due dates specified below, three final copies
of their written work. While letter grades for honors courses are assigned by the faculty advisor, the
recommendation about honors is made by two other faculty members, who serve as readers of the
student's work. These readers, after consulting with the faculty advisor, report their recommendation
to the whole department, which awards either Highest Honors, Honors, or no honors. Honors of any
kind are contingent upon satisfactory completion of courses in the major during the spring semester of
the senior year. Highest honors are normally awarded only to students whose performance in both the
honors program and regular courses in the major has been exceptional. All students who are awarded
honors participate in a series of informal presentations at the end of the spring term in senior year.
Creative Writing Thesis
The creative writing thesis involves the completion of a significant body of fiction or poetry during
the fall semester and winter study of the senior year. (With permission of the honors committee, the
thesis may be undertaken during the winter study period and the spring semester of the senior year.)
Since a student will most likely include in the thesis writing done in earlier semesters, a creative writ-
English
­ 152 ­
ing thesis usually involves only the fall semester and the winter study period, rather than the full year
allotted to complete the critical essay.
Requirements for admission include outstanding work in an introductory and an advanced work-
shop, a recommendation from one of the creative writing teachers (who will then act as thesis advi-
sor), a brief preliminary proposal, and the approval of the departmental honors committee. The formal
prospectus consists of a 1-page description of the project, including its relation to work completed and
in-progress. Students must also submit a writing sample. A creative writing thesis begun in the fall is
due on the last day of winter study. The methods of evaluation are identical to those for critical projects
(but their page limits do not apply).
Critical Thesis
The critical thesis involves writing a substantial scholarly and/or critical essay during both semes-
ters as well as the winter study period of the senior year. The formal prospectus, a 2- to 3-page descrip-
tion of the thesis project, should present a coherent proposal indicating the range of the thesis, the
questions to be investigated, the methods to be used, and the arguments likely to be considered, along
with a brief bibliography.
Significant progress on the thesis, including a substantial amount of writing (to be determined by
student and advisor), is required by the end of the fall semester. A first draft of the thesis must be com-
pleted by the end of the winter study period. The spring semester is to be devoted to revising and refin-
ing the work and to shaping its several chapters into a unified argument. Ideally, the length of the hon-
ors essay will be about 15,000 words (roughly 45 pages). In no case should the thesis be longer than
25,000 words, including notes. The finished thesis is due on the second Friday following spring break.
Critical Specialization
The critical specialization route is intended to provide students with an opportunity for making a
series of forays into an area of interest that is both broad in scope and related to work undertaken in at
least two courses. At least one of these courses must be in the English Department, and both need to
have been taken by the end of fall term in senior year. The critical specialization must be united by a
common area of interest, such as a given literary form or historical period, a topic that cuts across
several periods, an issue in literary theory, a topic that connects literary and cultural issues, a compara-
tive literature or interdisciplinary topic. Students are encouraged to propose specialization topics of
their own devising. The following examples are meant only to suggest the kinds of topics appropriate
to a critical specialization: lyric traditions, postmodern narrative, magic realism, Dante and modern
literature, Freud and literature, the poet as citizen, new historicist approaches to literature, feminist
film criticism.
In addition to reading primary works, the student is expected to read secondary sources, which de-
scribe or define issues critical to the area of specialization. The formal prospectus, a 2- to 3-page de-
scription of the project, should specify the area and range of the study, the issues likely to be explored,
and the methods to be used for their investigation. This prospectus should also describe the relation
between previous course work and the proposed specialization, and include a brief bibliography of
secondary works. The pursuit of the specialization route requires the following: (1) writing a set of
three essays, each about ten pages long (a page being approximately 250 words), which together ad-
vance a flexibly-related set of arguments. The first two essays are due by the end of the fall semester,
and the third by the end of winter study; (2) developing an extended annotated bibliography (about
four to five pages long) of selected secondary sources, explaining their importance to the area of spe-
cialization (due mid-February); (3) meeting with the three faculty evaluators (one of whom is the ad-
visor) during the last two weeks in February to discuss the trio of essays and the annotated bibliogra-
phy; (4) writing a fourth essay of ten to twelve pages, the purpose of which is to consider matters that
arose during the faculty-student discussion and to reflect on the evolution and outcome of the intel-
lectual journey undertaken by the student. This final essay is due on the second Friday after spring
break.
The same three faculty members are involved throughout the assessment process, and the standards
and methods of evaluation are the same as for other kinds of honors projects, with the following ex-
ception: For the specialization route, the evaluation will also include the student's performance in the
discussion with the three faculty readers, and that discussion will include not only the student's writ-
ing but also secondary sources.
COURSES
100-LEVEL COURSES (except English 150)
Through small class discussions (limited in size to 19 students per section) and frequent writing
assignments, 100-level English courses ask students to develop their skills as readers and as analyti-
cal writers. Each course assigns 20 pages of writing in various forms. These courses are prerequi-
sites for taking most other English courses. Students who receive a 5 on the AP English Literature
exam may take upper-level courses without first taking a 100-level. All 100-level English courses
are writing intensive.

ENGL 107(F,S) Green World (Same as Environmental Studies 107) (W)
This course will explore the rich and various ways in which literature has constructed and interpreted
the green-written world: as the symbol of youth, love, beauty, and passing time; as a pastoral paradise
where man's fall from grace brings death into the world; as a scene of cyclical renewal and spiritual
rebirth; as the archetypal symbol of man's desire to transform chaos into civilization and art--to tame,
order, idealize, and copy nature's bounty while humanizing, plundering, and destroying the environ-
ment. We will a engage a wide range of genres from the Renaissance to the present: Burnett's classic
children's book, The Secret Garden, Shakespeare's comedy, As You Like It, selections from Genesis
and Paradise Lost, selected nature lyrics by Marlowe, Donne, Herbert, Marvell, Wordsworth, Keats,
and Frost; Gluck's The Wild Iris, Woolf's To the Lighthouse, contemporary prose meditations on
building gardens and protecting the earth by Jamaica Kincaid and Michael Pollan. We will conclude
with the hilarious Peter Sellers film, Being There, where Chance's proverbial gardening lore is taken
for political wisdom.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: active participation in class discussion, and 20 pages of
writing in the form of short essays.

ENGL 108(F) Forms of Revenge (W)
Even in its most brutal expression, revenge lies close to art. Writers in almost every period have ex-
ploited this affinity and vengeance is as basic to the detective novel and the suburban sitcom as it is to
ancient epic and the medieval fabliau. In this course, we will consider the representation of revenge in
a range of genres. Works by Homer, Shakespeare, Poe, Nabokov, Neil Jordan and Lucille Ball.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: 20 pages of writing in the form of short papers.

ENGL 110(S) The Age of the Short Story (W)
This class will emphasize the development of critical reading skills through its focus on the short
story, a particularly crucial genre in the nineteenth century. We will examine the humorous, grotesque,
political, and realistic strains of short fiction in America across the century, and consider the function
of the story as both an artistic practice of economy and as a presence in periodical publishing--where
it functions both to entertain and to editorialize. Readings include a range of authors, such as Haw-
thorne, Poe, Edward Everett Hale, Rebecca Harding Davis, Bret Harte, Sarah Orne Jewett, Charles
Chestnutt, and Henry James.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: class participation and 20 pages of writing in the form of
frequent short papers.

(See under Comparative Literature for full description.)
Note: English 120 may be used as the prerequisite for other English courses.
ENGL 126(F) Stupidity and Intelligence (W)
Stupidity fascinates authors, and they do not merely despise it-they feel it and make us feel it. Why?
Around the same time that psychologists began measuring and ranking intelligence-and stupidity, un-
der various names, of course occupied the space below (average) intelligence-literary authors were
finding types of stupidity within intelligence. What is stupidity? Why can't it stay sequestered from
intelligence? Is there such a thing as literary stupidity? (Can one be specifically a bad reader not only
of books but of life?) What are the problems of intelligence? We shall be reading stories, novellas,
novels, and plays by Melville, Poe, Henry James, Kafka, Borges, Stoppard and others, and we shall be
viewing such films as Mr. Death and Forrest Gump.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: active class participation, and five papers totaling 20
pages.

ENGL 127(F) The Celtic Other World: From Myth to Romance and Beyond (W)
Written down between the twelfth and fifteenth centuries in manuscripts like the Book of the Dun
Cow (Irish) and the White Book of Rhydderch (Welsh), stories about the Celtic Other World sparkle
even in translation. With delicate description, whimsical humor, exuberant excess, and heroic energy,
they conjure up a world in which the boundaries between magic and reality collapse in unexpected,
English
­ 154 ­
thought-provoking ways. In the Irish story "Da Derga's Hostel," a bird flies through a skylight to fa-
ther the hero Conare Mar. In "The Wooing of Etain," a woman turns her rival into a scarlet fly. In the
Welsh story "Culhwch and Olwen," the warrior Clust, though "buried seven fathoms in the earth," can
still "hear an ant stirring from its bed in the morning fifty miles away." The magic of Arthurian ro-
mance is almost exclusively Celtic in origin. By Chretien de Troyes (twelfth-century France), we will
read Yvain, The Knight with the Lion and Perceval, the Story of the Grail and from fourteenth-century
England we will read Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. From medieval romance, we will follow the
influence of the Celtic Other World in Shakespearean comedy (Midsummer Night's Dream), and in
romantic, Victorian, and early modern poetry by Keats, Tennyson, and Yeats. The goal of the course,
in addition to its particular subject matter, is to develop effective reading and writing strategies for
works of different genres and time periods.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: weekly writing assignments, both formal and informal,
including required electronic journal postings. Students will do 20 pages of writing in the form of
frequent short papers and will be evaluated on writing and class participation.

ENGL 129(F) Twentieth-Century Black Poets (W)*
From Langston Hughes to contemporary poets such as Amiri Baraka and Angela Jackson, African
American poets have been preoccupied with the relations of poetry to other traditions. Vernacular
speech, English poetry, jazz and other musical forms, folk humor and African mythology have all
been seen as essential sources for black poetry. This course will survey major poets such as Hughes,
James Weldon Johnson, Countee Cullen, Robert Hayden, Gwendolyn Brooks, Baraka, Jackson, and
Yusef Komunyakaa, reading their poems and their essays and interviews about poetic craft. We will
ask how black poetry has been defined and whether there is a single black poetic tradition or several.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: twenty pages of writing in the form of a journal on the
readings and several short papers.

pers, and a final paper.

ENGL 135(F,S) African-American Literary Lives (Same as American Studies 135) (W)*
Given the central importance of the autobiography to the development of African-American litera-
ture, this course aims to explore the ways in which this form has come to influence the writing of Afri-
can-American fiction in the twentieth century. Beginning with James Weldon Johnson's Autobiogra-
phy of an Ex-Coloured Man, arguably the first "modern"African-American novel and a work that ex-
plicitly crosses both generic and racial categories, the course will explore figurations of blackness,
passing, African identity, assimilation and segregation through the subsequent fictional/autobio-
graphical writings of Richard Wright, Ralph Ellison, Nella Larsen, James Baldwin, Toni Morrison,
Octavia Butler and Gayl Jones.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: 20 pages of writing, in the form of short papers.

ENGL 137(F) Shakespeare's Warriors and Politicians (W)
From history, legend, and his own imaginative powers, Shakespeare has fashioned superlative war-
riors: Hotspur, Othello, Macbeth, Antony, and Coriolanus are larger-than-life soldiers on the battle-
field. They are, however, frequently undone by love and politics. Hotspur is no match for the shrewd
political maneuvering of Prince Hal; Othello's love for Desdemona turns to hate through the machina-
tions of the Machiavellian Iago; Macbeth is pushed to regicide by his wife; and Antony is twice un-
done--made "a strumpet's fool" by Cleopatra and defeated by a mere "boy" in the supreme politician
Octavius Caesar. This course will examine six plays by Shakespeare, where the virtues and weak-
nesses of the warrior and the politician are seen to be in tension: Henry IV, Part I, Othello, Macbeth,
Antony and Cleopatra, Coriolanus, and Troilus and Cressida. In the last two plays, Shakespeare por-
trays the convergence of sex, war, and politics with a new cynicism that leaves no character un-
scathed.

ENGL 139(F) The Experience of Poetry (W)
"If I feel physically as if the top of my head were taken off," Emily Dickinson wrote, "I know that is
poetry." This course will explore the particular pleasures and excitements of poetry, reading work by
John Donne, Robert Frost, Elizabeth Bishop, e. e. cummings, William Butler Yeats, Mary Oliver, Ste-
phen Dunn, Edwin Arlington Robinson, and many others. We will raise such questions as, How exact-
ly is poetry different from prose? Can we ever determine the "true" meaning of any poem? Can we
argue successfully that some poems are good and some are bad? How is our reading of a poem af-
fected by what we know about the author, or the historical moment when the poem was composed, or
the shape of the book in which it first appeared?
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: 20 pages of writing in the form of two or three short as-
signments of varying lengths, and two 5- to 6-page papers, one of which will be revised, as well as
class participation.

ENGL 140(F) Writing the Environment (W)
Covering both English and American traditions, we will study the abiding preoccupation of writers
from the Romantics onward with nature and the environment. The location of nature as site of knowl-
edge, experience and self-examination, as well as the sense of its endangerment will be of primary
concern. A strong emphasis will be placed on reading poetry, and the course will include poems by
Wordsworth, Coleridge, Keats, Shelley, Clare, Hopkins, Hardy, Frost, Moore, Bishop, Heaney and
Ammons. We will also read Thoreau's Walden and Darwin's Voyage of the Beagle, along with shorter
prose pieces by John Burroughs, Gary Snyder and Rachel Carson.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: class participation, four short papers (about 5 pages
each).

ENGL 209(F) American Literature: Origins to 1865 (Same as American Studies 209)
This survey of American writing before 1865 will trace literary forms including the sermon, the essay,
the romance, and the slave narrative, and inquire into the value and authority associated with these
different modes of writing. In addition, we will reflect upon the difficulties in constructing an Ameri-

both fiction and poetry. We will situate these works not only within the literary movements of the time
(e.g., realism, modernism, and postmodernism), but also within other important historical and cultural
occurrences (e.g., immigration and migration, civil rights, commodity culture). Throughout, the em-
phasis will be on the diverse, sometimes conflicting traditions that make up the American literary can-
on. Readings may include works by such authors as Twain, Chopin, Chesnutt, Hemingway, Hughes,
Hurston, Faulkner, Ellison, Ginsburg, Pynchon, Morrison, and Cisneros.

ENGL 229T(F) Elegies (W)
This tutorial--intended primarily for sophomores--explores elegies as a literary genre. In their most
familiar form, elegies honor and memorialize the dead. More broadly conceived, the genre includes
works lamenting other kinds of loss as well--the loss of a lover, place, country, or cherished version of
one's past. We'll consider the special challenges and opportunities of the elegiac voice: how it man-
ages to give public expression to private grief; negotiates problems of tone and perspective; worries
about and celebrates the capacity of language to generate hope and consolation; and seeks a kind of
solace in the literary effort to evoke, preserve, or rewrite a lost life or an absent past. This course fo-
cuses primarily on poetry, English and American, across a broad historical range. We'll first read
poems from 1600-1900--including works by Jonson, Milton, Donne, Dryden, Gray, Shelley, Tenny-
son, and Whitman, and then turn to some of the twentieth-century's great poetic elegists--Owen,
Yeats, Auden, Lowell, and Heaney. Finally, we'll consider how the elegiac voice works in fiction,
especially in stories by Joyce "The Dead" and Nabokov "Spring in Fialta."
Requirements: Students will meet with the instructor in pairs for an hour each week; they will write a
5-6 page paper every other week (five in all), and comment on their partners' papers in alternate
weeks. Emphasis will be placed on developing skills not only in reading and interpretation, but also in
constructing critical arguments and responding to them in written and oral critiques.

ENGL 253(S) Non-Fiction Writing
A student-led course focusing on reading and (especially) writing non-fiction. Two seniors are
instructors for the course, with a faculty member acting as sponsor and mentor. Grading is done by the
instructors in close collaboration with the faculty sponsor. This year, the course will focus on the writ-
ing of personal essays. We will explore the reasons for writing personal essays and the problems of
writing about one's own experience, and through diverse readings and discussion we will consider
different approaches to personal writing. Throughout the course students will be involved in the vari-
ous stages of the writing process, and will complete assignments ranging from short essays, and a
longer, multiple-draft final essay. Authors to be read may include Abbey, Baldwin, Dillard, Barry Lo-
pez, Thomas Lynch, Oates, and others.
Requirements: frequent short writing assignments and a longer final paper.

Courses for full description)
GATEWAY COURSES
200-level "Gateway" courses are designed for first- and second-year students contemplating the
major or intending to pursue more advanced work in the department; these courses focus on analyti-
cal writing skills while introducing students to critical and historical approaches that will prove
fruitful in later courses.
ENGL 222(S) Studies in the Lyric (W)
In this course we will explore the scope and limits of the lyric poem: its penchant for introspection and
irony, its forms of intimacy and exclusion, its skepticism about and passion for its project. We will
consider how the formal elements of the lyric poem (such as versification, tone, image, and syntax)
work to dramatize these concerns in ways that shift over time. Readings will include poems by Donne,
Blake, Coleridge, Keats, Tennyson, Dickinson, Yeats, and Berryman, among others, as well as critical
essays on the nature of lyric poetry.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: active class participation and four writing assignments,
amounting to twenty pages of writing.
Prerequisite: a 100-level English course, except 150. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19).

ENGL 225(F,S) Romanticism and Modernism (W)
The literature of Europe in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries was dominated by two aesthetic
movements, Romanticism and Modernism, respectively. While Modernism is often thought to mark a
decisive break with Romanticism-in part because both movements presented themselves as "new," a
radical departure from what had gone before-there are important continuities and affinities as well as
breaches between the two movements. This course will investigate the nature of Romanticism and
Modernism, and the relation between them. We will study major works from each period, including
polemics, poetry, novels, and short stories by Wordsworth, Coleridge, Percy and Mary Shelley, Yeats,
Eliot, the French Symbolist poets, Wilde, and modern novelists such as Joyce and Woolf. We will
explore each movement's engagement with a range of topics and issues: for example, the subjective
experience of time and memory; the nature of symbolization, and the role of "feeling" in art; the rela-
tion of the individual mind to social life; the conflicted appeal for the artist of "common" language and
experience, on the one hand, and avant-garde forms of expression, on the other. Our broader aim will
be to invite potential English majors to think critically about the principles that underlie the ordering
of literary history into aesthetic movements and "periods." In this writing-intensive course, we will
regularly attend in class to analytic procedures and the framing of arguments; once or twice during the
semester, classes will be replaced by tutorial sessions, in which students will meet in pairs with the
instructor.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: four or five short essays, including at least one revision.

ENGL 227(F) Contesting American Poetics (W)
How do poems come to assume their particular forms? What is a poem's horizon of possibilities? To
answer these questions, we will engage in comparative poetics, focussing on nineteenth- and twen-
tieth-century American work. Beginning with an extended consideration of Whitman and Dickinson,
English
­ 159 ­
we will learn to identify a poet's poetic program (however loosely defined) as it changes over time and
circumstance. In addition to poems, we will consider letters, journals, essays and taped performances.
We will pay special attention to the social and political contexts of "schools" or "movements," listen-
ing for each poet's underlying sense of her or his place in the world. The course will be organized
around pairings selected from the following list: Hart Crane; Marianne Moore; William Carlos Wil-
liams; Langston Hughes; Robinson Jeffers; Imiri Baraka; Adrienne Rich; Gary Snyder; the Black
Mountain School (e.g., Olson, Creeley, Levertov); the Beats (e.g., Ginsberg, Corso, Ferlinghetti); the
New York School (e.g., Ashbery, O'Hara). Students should emerge from this course with a solid sense
of the varieties of modern American poetry, but also, and perhaps more importantly, an immediate
understanding of how to handle poems as readers.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: This course is designated both as "writing intensive" and
as part of the Critical Reasoning and Analytical Skills initiative: students will be asked to write fre-
quently and to revise steadily, producing a total of 20 pages of writing over the course of the semester.

ENGL 228(F) Augustan and Modernist Satire (W)
Why did the genre of satire flourish to such an extent in Britain in the eighteenth century, and again
experience a resurgence in the early twentieth century? By reading satire from both periods in con-
junction, including the works of Dryden, Swift, Pope, Rochester, Congreve, Eliot, Lewis, Huxley,
Orwell and Waugh, the seminar will explore the strategies of satire as a mode of cultural criticism. The
issue of whether satire is an inherently conservative or progressive genre will be raised, along with
questions of literary form and its deformation. Students will read some literary criticism in conjunc-
tion with the primary texts.
Format: discussion /seminar. Requirements: class participation, three papers of varying length along
with e-mail responses.

ENGL 234(S) Heroic and Mock-Heroic (Gateway) (W)
This Gateway course studies the heroic and mock-heroic traditions in English poetry and drama, be-
ginning with Shakespeare and ending with T. S. Eliot and James Joyce. Among our concerns: what
constitutes "heroic" conduct? how are these values articulated? how is "the heroic" redefined in vari-
ous works from different eras from antiquity to modernism? how is heroism challenged, complicated,
and sometimes satirized by mock-heroic projects? how might heroic and mock-heroic elements coex-
ist in a single vision? Such inquiries will be focused upon Shakespeare's Henry IV and Henry V, Mil-
ton's Paradise Lost, Pope's The Rape of the Lock, Byron's Don Juan, Browning's Aurora Leigh,
poems by Tennyson, Yeats, and Eliot, and an episode from Joyce's Ulysses.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: 20 pages of writing in the form of weekly papers, alter-

ENGL 236(S) Witnessing (Gateway) (W)
This class will explore the complexity of "witnessing"--recounting what one sees in a way that insists
on the truth and, possibly, the urgency and corrective power of one's vision. Our readings will be
eclectic, and may include: TV news; documentary films; eighteenth-century travel narratives; poems
by Dante, William Blake, and Carolyn Forsche; religious visions and prophecies; fiction by John Bu-
nyan and Toni Morrison; memoirs by Elizabeth Prince and Eli Wiesel. Toward the end of the semes-
ter, we will focus on two historical events--the slave trade and the Holocaust--reading a variety of
documentary and fictional accounts. Our discussions will examine how, and to what ends, our texts
both claim the authority of the "eye-witness account" and challenge assumptions about what we can
"see" and know.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: twenty pages of writing in the form of frequent informal
responses to the readings and 4 formal essays, each of which will involve a revision. For two of these

ENGL 307(F) Introduction to Medieval Literature
Not a survey in the historical sense, but an exploration of issues and controversies in medieval studies.
Landmark literary works from a variety of genres will be juxtaposed with both medieval and contem-
porary theoretical texts, and with relevant critical essays, to evaluate both the questions we ask of me-
dieval texts and the answers we find. How do we read the gender roles and power politics encoded in
the literature of courtly love, for example? C. S. Lewis argued in 1936 that medieval courtly love
idealized women and refined men. Contemporary feminist, psychoanalytic, and queer theorists
would offer strikingly different perspectives. How might these different perspectives affect our read-
ing of The Romance of the Rose, the most influential courtly love poem of the Middle Ages? How do
we read the status of language in a period keenly aware of the gulf between God's Word and human
words, Truth and fiction? How do deconstructionist theories about the inadequacy of language
compare to medieval theories? And what relevance do these have to a reading of the General Pro-
logue of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales--a work in which the narrator is obsessed almost to paralysis
with both divine Truth and poetic truth? Other works and topics we might consider are chivalric ideals
in an Arthurian romance: what exactly are knights questing for in Chretien's Yvain, The Knight with
the Lion? How helpful are the suggestions of queer theory and Marxist theory? Saints' lives and/or the
Book of Margery Kempe: what are we to make of the extremes of holiness in an era that elevated hys-
terics into saints and ostracized saints as social misfits? The goal of the course is to introduce students
to some landmark works of medieval literature and, more importantly, to a variety of critical ways to
think about them.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: frequent short electronic journal postings, two 6- to 8-page

ENGL 311T(S) Studies in Shakespeare: Hamlet and Lear (Same as Theatre 315) (W)
"Who's there?" Hamlet begins with a question. It is directed from one player to another but also clear-
ly to the audience, and it challenges us to think about who we are and what we are doing there. In this
tutorial, we will read Lear and Hamlet, concentrating on the puzzles of reception that they pose. Along
with the plays, we will consider critical texts by Charles Lamb, T.S. Eliot, William Empson, and Stan-
ley Cavell, and watch performances--some respectful, some parodic--by Lawrence Olivier, Ken-
neth Branagh, and Arnold Schwarzenegger.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: Students will meet with the instructor in pairs for an hour each week;

ENGL 316(S) The Art of Courtship (Same as Women's and Gender Studies 316)
During Elizabeth I's reign, love poetry and dramatic comedy acquired a remarkable popularity and
brilliance, unparalleled in English literary history. What is the "art"--the language, form, and rheto-
ric--of Elizabethan courtship? What kind of society generated this literary obsession, and conversely,
what kind of culture and sexual relationships did the literature of courtship and seduction produce?
This course explores the links between literary conventions and social conventions, sexual politics
and court politics. It studies gems of English Renaissance literature (Shakespeare's Twelfth Night and
Much Ado About Nothing, love poetry by Shakespeare, Spenser, Sidney, and Donne, Castiglione's
The Courtier) along with court rhetoric, political negotiations, the first poem written and published by
an Englishwoman, the first English autobiography, social debates over poetry, the theater, sexuality,
clandestine marriage, women's lawful liberty, and the preservation or destruction of the social order.
There will be short lectures and lots of discussion.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: weekly journal entries, and a final research paper of
10-12 pages.

ENGL 319(F) Shakespeare in Love (Same as Theatre 319)
What made Shakespeare's dramas of love phenomenal popular successes as well as enduring works

depth Shakespeare's sonnets, three comedies (A Midsummer Night's Dream, As You Like It, Twelfth
Night) and three tragedies (Romeo and Juliet, Othello, and Antony and Cleopatra). We will examine
the ways in which attitudes toward love, sexuality, gender, subjectivity, dialogue, society and perfor-
mance evolve as Shakespeare's poetic style and dramatic technique mature, and the genre shifts from
lyric to tragedy and comedy.
Requirements: active participation in class discussion, Blackboard postings, and a final 10- to

ENGL 321(S) Samuel Johnson and the Literary Tradition
Johnson has been exceptionally influential not only because he was a distinguished writer of poems,
essays, criticism, and biographies, but also because he was the first true historian of English literature,
the first who sought to define its "tradition." We will read Johnson's own works and Boswell's Life of
Johnson to discover Johnson's talents, tastes, and standards as an artist, as a moral and literary critic,
and as a man. We next will use Johnson's Preface to Shakespeare and Lives of the English Poets to
examine how this great intelligence assessed writers from the Renaissance through the eighteenth
century. While reading his commentary on Shakespeare and his critical biographies of Milton, Dry-
den, Pope, Swift, and Gray, we will analyze selected works by these writers so as to evaluate John-
son's views and to sharpen our understanding of the relationships between his standards and our own.

ENGL 331(F) What is Romanticism?
This class will revisit the old critical question, "What is Romanticism?" We will read a range of British
Romantic-era texts: poetry and prose of the canonized Romantic poets (Blake, Wordsworth, Coler-
idge, Byron, Shelley, and Keats) together with work by their popular contemporaries, including poets
Charlotte Smith, Mary Robinson, and Felicia Hemans, and essayists William Hazlitt and Thomas De-
Quincey. We will ask: to what extent are at least some of these authors self-consciously shaping the
literary movement we now call "Romanticism"? How do they seek to define this movement, and what
might they be defining it against? In what ways do "Romantic" aesthetics and ideology shape and/or
react to the broader political, social and economic culture of early-nineteenth-century England?

The most well-known American transcendentalists are Emerson and Thoreau, but their works could
not have come into being outside of the complex and eccentric circle within which they moved. In this
course we shall read Emerson and Thoreau's works alongside those of their friends and associates,
including Bronson Alcott, Margaret Fuller, Orestes Brownson, and Theodore Parker, to gain a sense
of the diversity of the movement, which encompassed church reforms, educational experiments, and
utopian communes. We will also read the hostile and satiric voices of contemporary critics of the tran-
scendentalists to understand the radicalism of this now-hallowed movement. Critical questions will
center around the problems posed by writings founded in religious fervor, the interaction between
argument and artistry which marks the ambition to change a society through writing, and the advan-
tages and disadvantages of historical context as a methodology.

ENGL 341(S) American Genders, American Sexualities (Same as Women's and Gender
Studies 341)
This course investigates how sexual identities, desires, and acts are represented and reproduced in
American literary and popular culture. Focusing on two culturally rich periods--roughly 1880-1940
(when the terms "homosexual" and "heterosexual" came to connote discrete sexual identities), and on
the last twenty years--we will explore what it means to read and theorize "queerly." Among the ques-
tions we will ask: What counts as "sex" or "sexual identity" in a text? Are there definably lesbian, gay,
bisexual, transgender or queer writing styles or cultural practices? What does sexuality have to do
with gender? How are sexual subjectivities intertwined with race, ethnicity, class, and other identities
and identifications? And why has "queerness" proven to be such a powerful and sometimes powerful-
ly contested concept? We will also explore what impact particular historical events, such as the rise of
sexology, the Harlem Renaissance, and the emergence of a transgender movement have had on queer
cultural production. Readings may include works by the following theorists--Almaguer, Butler,
Sedgwick, Foucault, Freud, Hammond--as well as James's "The Beast in the Jungle," Stein's QED,
Cather's "Paul's Case," Larsen's Passing, Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby, Diaz's "Drown," Fein-
berg's Stone Bitch Blues, and poetry by Lorde, Hughes, Pratt, and Rich, as well as screenings of con-
temporary videos and films such as Looking for Langston and The Wedding Banquet.

ENGL 343T(F) Whitman and Dickinson in Context (W)
In this tutorial, we will read closely the works of two of the most influential and fascinating poets in
the U.S., Walt Whitman and Emily Dickinson. In addition to studying in depth their poems and other
writings--in Whitman's case, his essays; in Dickinson's, her letters--we will delve into some of the
major critical debates surrounding their work, both individually and when compared to one another.
For example, Whitman is often viewed as perhaps the most public nineteenth-century American poet,
whereas Dickinson is regarded as perhaps the most "private." We will interrogate this assumption,
exploring how each poet represents publicity and privacy in his/her work, as well as their efforts to
"perform" and/or reform the American self. We will also examine how each poet engages questions of
gender and sexuality, as well as contemporary debates surrounding such issues as abolition/slavery,
women's suffrage, temperance, and territorial expansion. Finally, we will explore Whitman and Dick-
inson's relation to significant literary and philosophical movements of the period, including transcen-
English
­ 163 ­
dentalism and the culture of sentiment. Throughout the course, emphasis will be on analyzing and
generating interpretations of Whitman and Dickinson's works, constructing critical arguments, for-
mulating cogent written critiques, and carrying on an oral debate about a variety of interpretations.
Students will meet with the instructor in pairs for an hour each week. They will alternate between
writing 5- to 7-page papers and commentaries on their partner's papers.
Format: tutorial. Students will be evaluated on their written work, their oral presentations of that work,
their analyses of their colleague's work, and on a final, comprehensive essay that will address the
themes engaged in the tutorial.

ENGL 347(S) Henry James
This course will be devoted to the work of Henry James, whose brilliant, demanding innovations of
prose style and acute psychological and ethical explorations mark the shift from the nineteenth-centu-
ry to the modern novel. James writes about what it meant for American and European societies around
the turn of the century to be mutually exposed to, and by, one another. In so doing, he raises questions
about what it means to be civilized, to be smart, and to be rich. We will consider how the drama of
consciousness is played out in his characters' struggles with love and conscience, and in his own pre-
occupation with capturing stylistically the narrative logic of the passions. We will read the novellas
Daisy Miller, The Beast in the Jungle, The Aspern Papers, and The Turn of the Screw; the novels Por-
trait of a Lady, The Bostonians, The Ambassadors, and The Golden Bowl; and assorted critical writ-
ings.

ENGL 348(F) Faulkner, Morrison, and the Representation of Race*
This course has two abiding aims. One aim is to explore in depth--and back to back--the fiction of
(arguably) the two major twentieth-century novelists concerned with race in America. The other aim
is to work towards evaluative criteria that might be genuinely attentive to both the intricacies of race
and the achievements of form. A particular challenge we will face throughout the course is the follow-
ing: how to focus on race (and secondarily gender) in both writers' work yet keep their distinctive
voices from disappearing into "white/male" and "black/female." Faulkner readings will include some
short stories and the following novels: The Sound and the Fury, Light in August, and Absalom, Absa-
lom! Morrison readings will includePlaying in the Dark and the following novels: Sula, Song of Solo-
mon, Beloved, and Paradise.

ENGL 350(S) Herman Melville and Mark Twain
Despite their profound differences in literary style and personal temperament, Herman Melville and
Mark Twain had much in common. Both gained national popularity through their travel writings, both
were acute and critical observers of American political life, and both were adventurous innovators in
the craft of prose fiction. Melville, however, spurned his own success and alienated his readers with a
series of complex, difficult, and unsettling novels. Mark Twain, on the other hand, expanded his popu-
larity with astonishing effectiveness. This course will examine and compare the works and careers of
these writers. A comparative approach to works such as Benito Cereno and Puddn'head Wilson, satir-
ical works addressing slavery and racial attitudes, should be illuminating. On the other hand, we will
also attend to the traits that make these writers such singular literary artists.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: one short paper of five to seven pages and a final paper of
about fifteen pages.

ENGL 353(F) Modern Poetry
In this course, we will explore the tangled and controversial means by which poets writing chiefly
between the two World Wars tied the political, social, and intellectual ferment of the era to the fate of
poetry. Both dire and admiring accounts of these poets' work point to a central impulse to aestheticize
political and philosophical problems. Considering issues such as occultism, Irish nationalism and un-
requited love in the poetry of W. B. Yeats; pedantry, religious conversion, and baby-talk in that of T. S.
Eliot; and cosmopolitanism, isolationism and insurance in that of Wallace Stevens, we will consider
the ways in which these poets' work both plays out and eludes accusations of self-reflexive lyricizing.
We will examine the roles of aristocratic bias, abstruse erudition, and proto-fascism in their work, as
well as critics' tendencies to equate these impulses. Although we will focus chiefly on the work of
these three poets, we will also refer to the poetry of William Carlos Williams, Ezra Pound, Robert
Frost, Marianne Moore and Langston Hughes, considering whether the populism and comparative
stylistic accessibility of some of these poets is an antidote to, or another means to formulate, the con-
cerns of so-called "high modernism."

ENGL 356(S) Dead Poets' Society
Ted Hughes's publication of Birthday Letters in January, 1998, was portrayed in the press and reviews
as breaking a 35-year silence on his wife Sylvia Plath's suicide in 1963. What made this volume of
poems a best-seller was its confessional and biographical drama. Hughes addresses his dead spouse
and returns to all of the major events in their shared life, simultaneously exposing his feelings and
intuitions about what went wrong in their marriage and why Plath was driven to take her life. Less
evident to the general reading public was that Birthday Letters extends a dialogue between Plath and
Hughes on the nature of poetry and poetic identity that began in their courtship. Plath felt that Hughes
initiated her into a strong feminine voice, and she, in turn, was responsible for introducing the young
British Hughes's work to an American audience. Many of Plath's Ariel poems are written on the re-
verse side of Hughes's poems and are often in heated exchange with them; Hughes was the editor of
Plath's posthumous publications and could be said to have `authored' Ariel because of his power over
selecting poems for this volume; in addition, Hughes has written several critical assessments of
Plath's work that presume final authority on how her work should be understood and received. Birth-
day Letters, with its frequent borrowing of titles and images from Plath's poems and its revisiting of
incidents she describes in her letters, journals, and fiction, prolongs a conversation and collaboration
between two poets that began in 1956 and may still be heard whenever they are read together. This
course will explore the Plath-Hughes marriage, both biographically and poetically. Topics may in-
clude: the conflict between Plath's confessional sensibility and Hughes's modernist aesthetic and
questions about the literary merits of baring one's soul; the role of biography generally in literary in-
terpretation; the controversies surrounding posthumous publication of Plath's work; and the extent to
which some of Hughes's final publications constitute `having the last word' on both personal and
poetic disagreements with his dead wife.

ENGL 359(F) Modernism: Theory and Fiction (Same as Comparative Literature 369)
Drawing on a range of theorists and novelists, this course will explore some of the most compelling
energies and problems that drive a century of Western Modernism (from the1840s through the1940s).
On the theory side, we begin with Kierkegaard's Fear and Trembling, to be followed by Nietzsche's
Genealogy of Morals and some of Freud's major essays. On the fiction side, we read Dostoevsky's
Notes from Underground prior to launching a more sustained inquiry into the work of three modern-
ists: Kafka, Proust, and Woolf. The course will conclude by attending to a number of provocative es-
says in Walter Benjamin's Illuminations.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: one short paper (5 pp), one longer paper (10-12 pp), a

ENGL 360(F) Joyce's Ulysses
This course will explore in depth the demanding and exhilarating work widely regarded as the most
important novel of the twentieth century, James Joyce's Ulysses, which both dismantled the tradition-
al novel and revitalized the genre by opening up new possibilities for fiction. We will discuss the ways
in which compelling issues of character and theme (e.g., questions of heroism and betrayal, oedipal
dynamics, sexuality and the politics of gender, civic engagement and artistic isolation, British imperi-
alism and Irish nationalism), are placed in counterpoint with patterns drawn from myth, theology, phi-
losophy, and other literature, and will consider the convergence of such themes in an unorthodox form
of comedy. In assessing Ulysses as the outstanding paradigm of modernist fiction, we will be equally
attentive to its radical and often funny innovations of structure, style, and narrative perspective. In
addition to Joyce's novel, readings will include its epic precursor, Homer's Odyssey, as well as bio-
graphical and critical essays. (Students unfamiliar with Joyce's short novelA Portrait of the Artist as a
Young Man, which introduces characters later followed in Ulysses, are urged to read it in advance of
the course.)

ENGL 364(S) Classical Hollywood Cinema
This course addresses the "Golden Age" of Hollywood cinema, the 1930's and 1940's, when Holly-
wood set the stylistic and narrative norms for mainstream cinema and turned out more films, of a high-
er general quality, than at any other time in its history. We will survey this enormous and varied cultur-
al outpouring mainly by exploring several of the film genres into which films of the period were oga-
nized: the gangster film, the Western, the screwball comedy, film noir, and the melodrama (e.g., re-
spectively,Scarface,Stagecoach,Bringing Up Baby,The Maltese Falcon, and Gaslight). Some atten-
tion will also be given to tracking the work of individual "authors" or directors (e.g., Ford, Hawks,
Lubitsch, Hitchcock), and analyzing the nature of the star system in general and the cultural signifi-
cance of particular stars (e.g., Humphrey Bogart, Cary Grant, Katherine Hepburn, John Wayne, Ingrid
Bergman). Theoretical and critical readings will be chosen to illuminate these approaches to film
study. This course will require a substantial commitment of time for the frequent mandatory screen-
ings and the regular reading assignments.

ENGL 371(S) Feminist Theory and the Representation of Women in Film (Same as
Women's and Gender Studies 371)
Woman's position as the "object of the gaze" is the focus of much recent critical film theory. Central to
these theoretical writings is a psychoanalytically-based (Lacanian) perspective that endows men with
access to subjectivity as viewers and agency within narrative, and assigns woman a role as fantasized
object within a male economy of desire. This perspective, which we find in the work of Laura Mulvey,
Jacqueline Rose, Stephen Heath, and Mary Ann Doane, is complemented by a more socio-ideological
approach in the work of E. Ann Kaplan, Tania Modleski, and Teresa de Lauretis. We will attempt first
to understand the theoretical texts in which the feminine figures as a central term for aesthetic dis-
course and ideological controversy. Second, we will analyze films, applying and testing these critical
perspectives. Questions concerning the problematic subjectivity of the female spectator will be pri-
mary, and we will be especially concerned with the ways in which various kinds of works--from
those considered to be highly conventionalized or "classical" to those deemed "avant-garde" or sub-
versive in the way they treat convention--address themselves to a male versus a female spectator.
Finally, we will evaluate the interpretive possibilities afforded by psychoanalytic and socio-ideologi-
cal methods both separately and together. In addition to reading selections from film theorists and
critics, we will look at such films as Aliens, Now, Voyager, Thelma and Louise, Vertigo, Mulholland
Drive and Boys Don't Cry.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: active participation in class discussions, one 4- to 5-page

ENGL 372(S) African-American Literary Criticism and Theory (Same as American
Studies 372)*
Beginning with Alain Locke's "The New Negro," this course is intended to introduce students to
some of the overarching issues and themes of African American literary criticism in the Twentieth
Century. Moving through four historical periods--the Harlem Renaissance, the Protest Era, the Black
Arts Movement and Postmodernism--we will investigate the critical methods and strategies through
which an African American literature and collectivity has been, and continues to be, formed. We will
move through these periods by reading the critical work of W.E.B. DuBois, Jessie Fauset, Zora Neale
Hurston, Sterling Brown, Richard Wright, James Baldwin, Ralph Ellison, Stephen Henderson, Bar-
bara Smith, Barbara Johnson, Toni Morrison, Henry Louis Gates, Jr., Sherley Anne Williams, Stuart
Hall and Paul Gilroy. In doing so, we will be asking a set of practical questions: What is the relation-
ship between sociopolitical criticism and literary history? Should Afrocentric ideology govern the
theoretical and critical examination of African American literature? What role does literature play in
shaping contemporary debates about the social construction or political realities of race and gender?
What is the nature of the relationship between American and African American literary history? How
has the formation of African American literature challenged or affirmed other literary and national
paradigms?
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: four short essays and one oral presentation as well as par-
ticipation in class discussion.

ENGL 373(S) Modern Critical Theory (Same as Comparative Literature 343)
This course will explore the complex and provocative work of a variety of contemporary theorists in
terms of a few fairly simple questions: What are we up to when we read literary texts? What norms or
conventions inform even our most casual interpretive act, and where do they come from? What forms
of pleasure and what assertions of power are entailed in reading and writing, and how do our literary
pursuits bear on questions of sexual and political desire? Although we will range beyond these au-
thors, this semester we will focus especially on the work of Jacques Derrida, Jacques Lacan, and femi-
nist theorists. In order to keep our own activities as readers at the forefront, we will enter into the criti-
cal fray by way of a variety of specific literary texts and films, including novels by Virginia Woolf and
Margaret Duras, poems by Sylvia Plath and Louise Erdrich, films by Werner Herzog and Billy Wilder.

ENGL 381(F) Melancholy and History (Same as Comparative Literature 381)
We will explore the literary uses of melancholy, considering it not as a pensive retreat from history, but
as a series of dynamic transactions with it. We will examine a range of conflicting impulses toward a
lost past in texts written during periods of political, social, or economic upheaval, whose crises are
often figured in the guise of female characters' psychic traumas. In such texts, melancholy provides a
logic by which we interpret and represent history, and a mode of social and cultural critique. The
course will be divided into three parts: "The Melancholy State," "Hypochondria and the Body Poli-
tic," and "Mania and Charisma." Readings will be drawn from Jane Austen's Persuasion, George
Eliot's Daniel Deronda, Vladimir Nabokov's Ada, or Ardor, Tom Stoppard's Arcadia, and Tony Kus-
hner's Angels in America, as well as poetry by Gray, Keats, and Dickinson. We will also consider
representations of the Great Depression in such screwball comedies as My Man Godfrey and Nothing
Sacred. Theoretical texts will be drawn from the work of Freud, Melanie Klein, Kristeva, Burke,
Marx, Weber and Benjamin.

ENGL 396(S) Fiction Without Borders*
This course explores the effects of globalization--the economic integration of national markets-- on
the production of literature in the late-twentieth and early-twenty-first centuries. As trading blocs in
Latin America, North America, Europe and Asia are being formed and consolidated, a growing num-
ber of literary texts are being produced that focus on the social and cultural consequences of economic
globalization. This literature confronts both the possibilities and pitfalls of this new global era by ad-
dressing issues of immigration, multiculturalism, pluralism and ethnic identity through provocative
experiments with narrative form. The reading list covers a broad terrain: from Salman Rushdie's and
V.S. Naipaul's reflections on "coming to America" to the perils of border-crossings described in the
fictions of Gayl Jones, Jhumpa Lahiri, Michael Ondaatje and Rohinton Mistry.

ENGL 401(S) The Middle Ages Imagined (Same as Comparative Literature 401)
No other period of literature has so continuously and popularly riveted the imaginations of writers and
filmmakers as the Middle Ages. One recent literary historian has claimed that the images and ideas we
associate with the Middle Ages are essentially the invention of twentieth century medieval scholars
who saw the period through the lenses of their own personal interests and values--among them J. R.
R. Tolkien and C. S. Lewis. But medieval writers also created images to serve their own interests and
values and those of their patrons. We will read some landmark essays by medievalists who have de-
fined the Middle Ages for the twentieth century--C. S. Lewis on courtly love, J. R. R. Tolkien on epic
and romance, Mikhail Bakhtin on carnival, and (less well known outside medieval studies but no less
influential) D. W. Robertson, Jr. on religious values. Against these essays we will set some major
English
­ 168 ­
works by medieval writers with aggressive polemical agendas of their own: Andreas Capellanus's
The Art of Courtly Love, Chretien de Troyes' Yvain the Knight with the Lion, St. Augustine's On
Christian Doctrine, selections from Geoffrey Chaucer's Canterbury Tales. In the second half of the
course students will explore the "afterlife" of medieval literature in popular fiction and film of their
own choosing. Choices might range from Camelot (the musical), to Monty Python and the Holy Grail
to Marian Zimmerman Bradley's Mists of Avalon to Umberto Eco's The Name of the Rose. The course
will be run as a colloquium in which students work in small groups on selected topics and present their
work orally to the group. Each student will submit a final paper of 15-20 pages on a topic that repre-
sents a culmination of the student's work and interests over the course of the semester.

ENGL 430(S) The Brontës: The Making of Myths (Same as Women's and Gender Studies
430)
This course will explore the evolving mythic power and enduring imaginative force of the art the
Brontës created. Readings will begin with the famous fantasy kingdoms the Brontë children--Char-
lotte, Emily, Branwell, and Anne--produced while living in an isolated parsonage on the Yorkshire
moors in mid-nineteenth-century England. We will then turn to three novels by Charlotte (Jane Eyre,
Villette, and Shirley), Emily's poetry and her novel, Wuthering Heights, and selected writings by Anne
and Branwell. In addition, each student will read and report on one of the many competing biogra-
phies of the Brontës. Subjects for discussion will include the Brontës' own myth-making; the aesthetic
transformation of their childhood experiences into fiction and poetry; and the mythologizing and de-
mythologizing of their life and work in contending nineteenth- and twentieth-century biographical
and critical accounts of the Brontës. In addition to regular class discussion, the course entails six
colloquia, three involving student-led exploration of critical readings on Brontë texts, the others focus-
ing on independent work-in-progress on term projects and competing Brontë biographies.
Format: discussion/colloquium. Requirements: active participation, three colloquia presentations,
two short papers, and a 15-page term paper.
Prerequisite: at least one 300-level English course. Enrollment limit: 15 (expected: 15). Preference to
English majors and concentrators in Women's and Gender Studies. (1700-1900)
Hour: 2:35-3:50 TF S. GRAVER
ENGL 434(F) William Blake
In this course we will study the illuminated works of the poet and printmaker William Blake. Our texts
will include Songs of Innocence and Experience, The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, Visions of the
Daughters of Albion, America, Europe, and Jerusalem, all of which we will read in facsimile editions.
We will also read a range of historical and critical materials. Our discussions will attempt to articulate
and explore the particular ways in which Blake's books challenge us as readers of literature, as con-
sumers of cultural products, and as political thinkers.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: frequent informal short writing assignments, one 5-page,
and one longer (10-15) paper, preceded by conference. Enrollment limit: 15 (expected: 15).

ENGL 284(S) Adaptation: Words into Images
Economy of words, resonance and the play between traditional and untraditional structure are shared
values which make short stories and feature films related forms. And yet the successful adaptation of a
great short story into a great movie is rare. The primary point of this class is to write a full-length
screenplay which is an adaptation of an existing short story. Students will also read a selection of sto-
ries by such authors as J.D. Salinger, Alice Munro, James Salter and Richard Ford and watch a selec-
tion of movies by screenwriters including Robert Towne, Mike Leigh, Woody Allen, and Alexander
Payne & Jim Taylor. In two short papers, students will consider the results of selected adaptations and
analyze the transitions from story to movie; they will also be expected to try their own hand at an
adaptation.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: a full-length screenplay and two short analytical papers.
Prerequisite: a 100-level English course, except 150. Enrollment limit: 20 (expected: 20).

ENGL 374(S) The Monologue
The monologue is an eccentric theatrical device--the single voice speaking uninterrupted for an ex-
tended time in a departure from realistic dialogue. The class will be a study of this device and will
require both creative writing and video production. After reading and watching many examples from
theater and movies, students will write a series of original monologues and they will choose one as the
basis for a short video which they will cast, direct, shoot and edit. A written analysis of the student's
production process will also be required. Final works will be shown in a video `display' of mono-
logues.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: exercises in writing monologues; short video production;
written analysis of the production process.

CONCENTRATION IN ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
The Environmental Studies Program, within the liberal arts mission of Williams College, provides
students with an opportunity to explore how humans interact with the environment, including physi-
cal, biological, philosophical, and social elements. The program is designed so that students will grow
to realize the complexity of issues and perspectives and to appreciate that many environmental issues
lack distinct, sharp-edged boundaries. Our goal is to aid students in becoming well-informed, envi-
ronmentally-literate citizens of the planet who have the capacity to become active participants in their
communities ranging in scale from the local to the global. To this end, the program is designed to
develop abilities to think in interdisciplinary ways and to use holistic-synthetic approaches in solving
problems while incorporating the knowledge and experiences they have gained from majoring in oth-
er departments at the College.
The concentration in Environmental Studies allows students to focus some of their elective courses
in an integrated, interdisciplinary study of the environment--that is, the natural world, both in itself
and as it has been modified by human activity. The purpose of the program is to provide the tools and
ideas needed to engage constructively with the environmental and social issues brought about by
changes in population, economic activity, and values. Environmental controversies typically call
upon citizens and organizations to grasp complex, uncertain science, contending human values, and
ethical choices--in short, to deal with matters for which the liberal arts are a necessary but not suffi-
cient preparation. Environmental Studies accordingly includes courses in natural sciences, social
sciences, humanities, and the arts, in order to equip students with the broad educational background
needed to analyze complex environmental matters and to fashion pragmatic, feasible solutions.
The program is administered by the Center for Environmental Studies (CES), located in Kellogg
House. Founded in 1967, CES is one of the oldest environmental studies programs at a liberal arts
college. In addition to the academic program, CES is the focus of a varied set of activities in which
students lead and participate, often with other members of the Williams community. The Matt Cole
Environmental Studies
­ 171 ­
Memorial Library at Kellogg House holds a substantial collection of books, periodicals, unpublished
documents, maps, and electronic media. Kellogg House also houses a new Geographic Information
System laboratory as well as study and meeting facilities available to students and student groups. The
Center administers the Hopkins Memorial Forest, a 2430-acre natural area northwest of campus,
where field-study sites, a laboratory, and passive-recreation opportunities may be found in all seasons.
CES also operates an environmental analysis laboratory at the Science Center.
The Environmental Studies Program has three overlapping components:
 In order to earn the concentration in Environmental Studies, students must complete a set of seven
courses.
 All students are strongly encouraged to meet the Four Places goal. (See below.)
 Students are encouraged to pursue honors in Environmental Studies by planning a senior thesis.
Concentration Requirements
Seven courses are required: four are core courses to be taken by all students earning the concentration;
three are distribution courses to be selected from the lists below.
Core courses
101 Humans in the Landscape
203 Ecology
302 Environmental Planning and Design Workshop
402 Senior Seminar
The core courses are intended to be taken in sequence, although there is some flexibility allowed.
Environmental Studies (ENVI) 101 is a broad introduction to the field, emphasizing the humanities
and social sciences. ENVI 203 is a course in ecology, offered in Biology, that provides a unified con-
ceptual approach to the behavior of living things in the natural world. ENVI 302 (Environmental
Planning) puts teams of students to work on planning projects of immediate importance in the Berk-
shires. ENVI 402, the senior seminar, is an opportunity for concentrators majoring in a wide variety of
disciplines to draw together their educational experiences and provide a personal accounting of how
they understand the interdisciplinary character of environmental studies and its connections to their
future lives and careers. The core course structure affords students freedom to explore and to special-
ize in diverse fields of study, while sustaining a focus on environmental questions throughout their
time at Williams.
An interdisciplinary course emphasizing field science, ENVI 102 (Introduction to Environmental
Science), is strongly recommended for all students interested in the concentration. Note that enroll-
ments in ENVI 102 are limited. In order to assure enrollment, students should consult with one of the
instructors during autumn semester. ENVI 102 must be taken before the junior year.
Distribution Courses
In order to earn the concentration a student must take one course from each of the following three
groups. Courses may be counted both toward the concentration in Environmental Studies and toward
a disciplinary major.

Variations from the requirements of the concentration must be approved in writing by the director of
the program. Students are urged to consult with program faculty and the director as soon as they devel-
op an interest in the concentration.
In addition to courses fulfilling the concentration requirements, the following electives and related
electives are offered:
Environmental Studies 397, 398 Independent Study of Environmental Problems
Environmental Studies 493-W031-494 Senior Research and Thesis
Environmental Studies
­ 173 ­
Winter study courses play an important role in the program, offering opportunities to experiment in
fields unfamiliar to the student, and for interdisciplinary topics to be developed by faculty working
alone and in teams. Students are urged to review each year's winter study offerings bearing in mind
their interests in the environment.
Rationale for Course Numbering
The numbering sequence of the four required courses reflects the order in which they should be
taken, although Environmental Studies 302 may be taken in the senior or sophomore year if a student
is away junior year. Cross-listed courses are assigned the same number as the departmental number
whenever possible.
Four Places--A Goal
The human place in natural landscapes is intrinsically geographic, and learning about humans in
particular places is an essential part of environmental studies. By the time each student in Environ-
mental Studies graduates, she or he should have developed intellectual insight into and personal expe-
rience of four places: "Home"; "Here"--the Berkshires; "There"--an alien place; and "The
World"--a global perspective. For practical purposes, There is a place where the geography is unusu-
al in the student's experience (e.g., developing country, inner city, arctic), so are the socioeconomic
circumstances (for example, per capita income might be a small fraction of a year's tuition at Wil-
liams), and the working language is not standard English. Although this goal is not a requirement for
the concentration, it is a significant aspect of the program, and CES resources are aimed in part at
enabling all students to meet this goal. For example, students are encouraged to pursue summer in-
ternships in their "Home" communities, or to do semester or winter study courses at locations outside
the temperate zones ("There"); field courses in natural science or history courses emphasizing New
England can deepen familiarity with "Here." Students concentrating in Environmental Studies should
plan winter study courses and summer work or study experiences with the Four Places goal in mind,
particularly the experiences "There" and at "Home." Courses not in the list of electives for the con-
centration may be considered as substitutes, on a case-by-case basis, if they also meet the Four Places
goal in a way not otherwise available in the program. Students should see the program director for
further information.
Honors in Environmental Studies
A student earns honors in Environmental Studies by successfully completing a rigorous, original
independent research project under the supervision of two or more members of the faculty, including
at least one member of the CES faculty. The research project should be reported and defended both in
a thesis and orally. A student may undertake an honors thesis and submit it to both his or her major
department and Environmental Studies; petitions for a joint honors project should be approved by the
department chair and the director of the program no later than the beginning of the student's senior
year. Students who pursue honors in Environmental Studies alone should enroll in Environmental
Studies 493-W031-494, Senior Research and Thesis, in addition to completing the requirements for
the concentration.
Because most research requires sustained field, laboratory, or library work that is difficult to com-
bine with conventional coursework, students are strongly encouraged to spend the summer before
senior year doing honors research. Funds to support student research are available from restricted en-
dowments of the Center, and an open competition is held each spring, to allocate the limited resources.
Some departments also provide limited support for summer thesis research. Students and their faculty
sponsors should plan the thesis with the possibility of summer research in mind.
A faculty recommendation for honors in Environmental Studies will be made on the basis of the
academic rigor, interdisciplinary synthesis, independence, and originality demonstrated by the stu-
dent and in the completed thesis. In contemplating an honors thesis, students should take into account
their mastery of the basic materials and skills (often in more than one academic discipline), their abil-
ity to work independently, and their commitment and desire to pursue a sometimes arduous but typi-
cally rewarding process that combines intellectual achievement with tests of character and fortitude.
ENVI 101(F) Humans in the Landscape
A survey of basic topics, aimed at putting environmental questions into the contexts of natural and
social science and the arts and humanities. By the end of the term, the student should be able to recog-
nize and to interpret the natural, economic, and industrial bases of daily life; investigate that which
seems interesting or problematic in his or her environment, at levels ranging from local to global; and
be able to make judgments about which aspects of that environment are worth additional time, effort,
or commitment. These skills, particularly the last, are necessary but not sufficient for developing a
stance toward environmental quality as an element of civilized life.
Principal means of evaluation will be two quizzes (testing detailed recall), written exercises (testing
ability to grasp and make use of ideas important to the course), and a final exam; attentive participa-

tion in class and conference discussions will also count. Attendance at field trips, films, and the like is
strongly encouraged.
Format: lecture/discussion.
No enrollment limit (expected: 30-40).
Satisfies one semester of Division II requirement.
Hour: 10:00-10:50 MWF K. LEE
ENVI 102(S) Introduction to Environmental Science
Environmental Science is an interdisciplinary approach to the study of environmental issues. This
course stresses the scientific methods used by biologists, chemists and geologists to analyze and mea-
sure changes in the environment. Current environmental problems affecting the Williamstown area
are used as a basis for exploring issues of global importance, including air pollution, endangered spe-
cies, solid-waste disposal, water quality and the effects of land-use changes on environmental quality.
This course meets four times a week, including three one-hour morning sessions and a three-hour af-
ternoon period. Morning sessions are divided between lectures and discussion, and we spend after-
noons in the field or laboratory.
Format: lecture/discussion/lab. Evaluation will be based on reports of field and laboratory projects,
participation in discussion, and an independent research project.
Preference given to first-year students. This course is designed for students who have a strong interest
in environmental science. Enrollment limit: 36 (expected: 25).

ENVI 211(F) Global Trends, Sustainable Earth
This course examines the possibility of a sustainability transition, a future in which material prosperi-
ty may be combined with preservation of the life-support systems of the human and natural world.
Over the past 200 years the human presence on the planet has changed dramatically, as seen in long-
range trends of environmental modification, population growth, and economic change. Although hu-
man population growth is slowing, this is but one ingredient of a sustainable long-term relationship
between humans and nature. Other important aspects, including loss of biodiversity, consumption and
a globalizing economy, and technological change will be reviewed, in an effort to illuminate the idea

of a transition toward sustainability and the challenges implied by its ambitions and hopes.
Course objectives: 1) Students should understand the idea of a sustainability transition, including the
strengths and weaknesses of this social-learning approach to environment and social action. 2) Stu-
dents should be able to explore long-term, large-scale phenomena, calling upon a variety of disciplin-
ary methods and drawing together information about both human activities and the natural world.

ENVI 231(F) Globalization and the Environment (Same as Political Science 226)
The large protests over the last few years at international gatherings ranging from the World Trade
Organization (WTO) meeting in Seattle in December 1999 to the World Economic Forum in New
York in January 2002 point to widespread public concern about the environmental and social conse-
quences of globalization. This course will explore the issues behind the protests, including environ-
mental challenges such as burgeoning trade in timber and hazardous chemicals and related social
threats such as growing income inequality and diminishing cultural diversity. We will also examine
possible opportunities stemming from globalization, from growing commerce in environmentally
beneficial products and technologies such as shade-grown coffee and wind power to the use of new
communications technologies to create powerful international citizens' coalitions for change. And we
will study institutional changes needed to shift the world economy onto a more environmentally and
socially sustainable course, including reforming international economic organizations such as the
WTO, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Bank and strengthening international environ-
mental treaties and institutions.
This course complements Environmental Studies 232(S) Managing Global Commons. Hilary French
is the Class of 1946 Visiting Professor of International Environmental Studies in the autumn semester.
She is Director of the Global Governance Project at the Worldwatch Institute in Washington, D.C.,
and a consultant to the United Nations Environment Programme.

ENVI 232(S) Managing Global Commons (Same as Political Science 220)
Aristotle once observed "that which is common to the greatest number has the least care bestowed
upon it." More recently, biologist Garrett Hardin coined the phrase "the tragedy of the commons" in
warning that jointly owned and freely available resources tend to be overused to their destruction.
This course focuses on issues related to the use and management of global commons, in particular the
oceans and seabed, the atmosphere, outer space, and Antarctica. We will examine the extent to which
these global commons are subject to environmental tragedies and review the international laws and
institutions that have been created to manage use of these domains, which lie outside exclusive juris-
diction of nation-states. Among the specific problems to be addressed are marine pollution, the de-
cline of ocean fisheries, the depletion of the ozone layer, global climate change, and resource exploita-
tion in Antarctica.
This course complements Environmental Studies 231(F) Globalization and the Environment.

ENVI 302(F) Environmental Planning and Analysis Workshop
This course introduces the theories, methodologies, and legal framework of planning and allows stu-
dents to experience the planning process through hands-on project work in the region. The first part of
the course introduces the literature and illustrates it through analysis and discussion of case studies. In
the second section of the course, students apply their skills through the study of an actual planning
problem. The project work draws on students' past curricular and extracurricular activities and makes
use of interdisciplinary knowledge and methodologies. Teams of students, working in conjunction
with a client in the community, research and propose solutions to a current environmental planning
problem. The course culminates in public presentations of each team's planning study. This course
also includes field trips and computer labs. Format: discussion/project lab.
Requirements: midterm exam, short written exercises, class presentations, workshop presentations,
final group report.
Prerequisites: Environmental Studies 101 and Biology/Environmental Studies 203, or permission of
instructors. No enrollment limit (expected: 25). Open only to juniors and seniors. Required course for
students wishing to complete the Environmental Studies Program.

ENVI 307(F) Environmental Law (Same as Political Science 317)
In the past twenty years, environmental law has emerged as an important aspect of how we govern the
use of public and private property. This course introduces students to the study of law from the per-
spective of a litigator and legislator, and takes up both the common law of nuisance, which is the
foundation for environmental governance in the Anglo-American tradition, and an array of statutory
law, which has profound implications for our ideas about property and how we put those ideas into
practice. In our society, and increasingly around the world, these ideas are central to civil order and to
our efforts to maintain a balance between our individual wishes and our commitment to our communi-
ties.
Format: lecture/discussion.
Prerequisites: Political Science 201 and Environmental Studies 101. This is a companion course to
Environmental Studies/Political Science 308 (Environmental Policy). The courses may be taken in
either order. No enrollment limit (expected: 20).
Hour: 7-9:30 p.m. M VAN OOT
ENVI 308T(S) Environmental Policy (Same as Political Science 308T) (W)
Over the past generation, environmental policy has emerged as a new and important aspect of the gov-
ernance of the natural world and private property in the U.S. This course introduces the study of public
policy and its politics from the perspective of the constellation of professionals, managers, and activ-
ists involved in the implementation and formulation of policies. We will take up the organizational
forms and politics that underlie governing in a "post-industrial" political economy, and survey the
array of policies that has transformed that governance for natural resources, property, and ecosystem
services. Environmental policy is a response to the complexities of the contemporary economy, and
its technical and social challenges strain long-accepted notions of democratic representation and ra-
tionality.
Work required: Each student completes, in stages, a 20-page research paper on an environmental
policy or controversy. Initial proposal, bibliography, and graphic materials are assembled, culminat-
ing in a 12-page background paper describing the issues and actors. The research paper should incor-
porate the background paper, with revisions, into a 20-page analysis of the case and its governmental
dynamics, including policy recommendations. There is also a 90-minute exam on the course readings.
Format: tutorial.
Prerequisites: Environmental Studies 101; Political Science 201 is recommended. This is a compan-
ion course to Environmental Studies 307/Political Science 317 (Environmental Law). Enrollment: 12

FRS 101(F) Introduction to Religion
This course examines the structure and dynamics of certain aspects of religious thought, action, and
sensibility--employing psychological, sociological, anthropological, and philosophical modes of in-
quiry. We will begin with a survey of stances toward religion that have come to dominate the century's
view of the place and the truth of religion. These include the phenomenological, Mircea Eliade's
Sacred and the Profane; the psychoanalytic, Sigmund Freud's Civilization and Its Discontents; the
sociological, Emile Durkheim'sElementary Forms of Religious Life; the anthropological in the works
of Clifford Geertz, Victor Turner, Claude Levi-Strauss and Carolyn Bynum; and finally the theologi-
cal in the works of Paul Tillich and Mary Daly. With the tools we develop in the first half of the course
we then turn to the study of some religious traditions: Hinduism, Buddhism, Confucianism, Judaism
and Christianity. In this portion we will read such world classics as the Bhagavad Gita, Hebrew Scrip-
tures, Gospel of Matthew, and Kierkegaard's Fear and Trembling. Emphasis on class discussion and
the writing of interpretive papers.
Requirements: weekly 1-page papers in response to assigned questions, including visits to art mu-
seums and religious services. Writing these papers should help discussions, both in the classroom and
in the dorm. Midterm paper and self-scheduled final. FRS students in the past have greatly appre-
ciated having an entry-full of companions to talk with as they thought about how to respond to the

MAJOR
The Geosciences major is designed (1) to provide an understanding of the physical and biological
evolution of our planet and its interacting global systems, (2) to help us learn to live in harmony with
our environment, and (3) to appreciate our place within the vastness of Earth history. Forces within the
Earth are responsible for the development of mountain ranges and ocean basins. Waves, running wa-
ter, and glaciers have shaped the surface of the Earth, providing the landscapes we see today. Fossils
encased in sedimentaryrockssupplyevidencefortheevolutionoflifeand help to record the history of
the Earth.
Students who graduate with a major in Geosciences from Williams can enter several different fields
of geoscience or can use their background in other careers. Students who have continued in the geo-
sciences are involved today, especially after graduate training, in environmental fields ranging from
hydrology to earthquake prediction, in the petroleum and mining industries, federal and state geologi-
cal surveys, geological consulting firms, and teaching and research in universities, colleges, and sec-
ondary schools. Graduates who have entered business or law have also found many applications for
their geoscience background. Other graduates now in fields as diverse as art and medicine pursue their
interest in the out-of-doors with a deeper appreciation for the natural world around them.
The Geosciences major sequence includes, after any 100-level course, five designated advanced
courses, two elective courses, and either Geosciences 212 (Invertebrate Paleobiology) or Geosci-
ences 303 (Igneous and Metamorphic Petrology).
Sequence Courses (required of majors)
201 Geomorphology
202 Mineralogy and Geochemistry
301 Structural Geology
302 Sedimentation
401 Stratigraphy
Elective courses may be clustered to provide concentrations in selected fields. Suggested group-
ings are listed below as guidelines for course selections, but other groups are possible according to the
interests of the students. Departmental advisors are given for the different fields of Geosciences.
I Environmental Geoscience. For students interested in surface processes and the application of
geology to environmental problems such as land use planning, resource planning, environmental im-
pact analysis, and environmental law. Such students should also consider enrolling in the coordinate
program of the Center for Environmental Studies.

Earth, the origin and deformation of rocks and minerals, and mineral exploration.
102 An Unfinished Planet
105 Geology Outdoors
303 Igneous and Metamorphic Petrology
(Students interested in The Solid Earth should consult with Professors Wobus or Karabinos.)
With the consent of the department, certain courses at the 200 level or higher in Biology, Chemistry,
Mathematics, or Physics may be substituted for elective courses in the major. Credit may be granted in
the Geosciences major for American Maritime Studies 211/Geosciences 210 (Oceanographic Pro-
cesses) or American Maritime Studies 311/Biology 231 (Marine Ecology) taken at Mystic Seaport.
Students considering graduate work in geosciences should also take courses in the allied sciences
and mathematics in addition to the requirements of the Geosciences major. The selection of outside
courses will depend on the field in which a student intends to specialize. Most geoscience graduate
schools require a year of Chemistry and Mathematics through 105. For those going into Environmen-
tal Geoscience, courses in computer science or statistics are recommended. For those considering
Oceanography, Stratigraphy, and Sedimentation, Biology 102 and Biology 203 are suggested. For
students entering Solid-Earth fields, Physics 131 and 132 are recommended.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN GEOSCIENCES
In order to be recommended for the degree with honors, a student is expected to have completed at
least two semesters and a winter study project (031) of independent research culminating in a thesis
which demonstrates outstanding achievement of an original and innovative nature. The principal con-
siderations in admitting a student to a program of independent research are mastery of fundamental
material and skills, ability to pursue independent study successfully, and demonstrated student inter-
est and motivation.
Further advice on the major can be obtained from the department chair.
GEOS 101(F) Biodiversity in Geologic Time (Same as Environmental Studies 105)
Is planet Earth now undergoing the most severe mass extinction of species ever to have occurred dur-
ing its 4.5-billion-year history? By some calculations, the expanding population of a single species is
responsible for the demise of 74 species per day. This provocative question is addressed by way of the
rock and fossil record as it relates to changes in biodiversity through deep geologic time before the
appearance of Homo sapiens only 250,000 years ago. Long before human interaction, nature con-
ducted its own experiments on the complex relationship between evolving life and changes in the
physical world. This course examines ways in which wandering continents, shifting ocean basins, the
rise and fall of mountains, the wax and wane of ice sheets, fluctuating sea level, and even crashing
asteroids all shaped major changes in global biodiversity. Particular attention is drawn to the half doz-
en most extensive mass extinctions and what factors may have triggered them. Equal consideration is
given to how the development of new ecosystems forever altered the physical world. How and when
did the earliest microbes oxygenate the atmosphere? Do the earliest multicellular animals from the
late Precambrian portray an architectural experiment doomed to failure? What factors contributed to
the explosive rise in biodiversity at the start of the Cambrian Period? What explanation is there for the
sudden appearance of vertebrates? How and when did plants colonize the land? What caused the de-
mise of the dinosaurs? Is the present dominance of mammals an accident of nature? The answers to
these and other questions are elusive, but our wise stewardship of the planet and its present biodivers-
ity may depend on our understanding of the past. Concepts of plate tectonics and island biogeography
are applied to many aspects of the puzzle.
Format: lectures, three hours per week; one two-hour laboratory per week (some involving field
work); plus one all-day field trip to the Helderberg Plateau and Catskill Mountains of New York, and a

GEOS 102(S) An Unfinished Planet
The Earth is a work-in-progress, an evolving planet whose vital signs--as expressed by earthquakes,
volcanic eruptions, and shifting plates--are still strong. In a geological time frame, nothing on Earth
is permanent: ocean basins open and close, mountains rise and fall, continental masses accrete and
separate. There is a message here for all who live, for an infinitesimally brief time, on the moving
surface of the globe. This course uses the plate tectonics model--one of the fundamental scientific
accomplishments of this century--to interpret the processes and products of a changing Earth. The
emphasis will be on mountain systems (on land and beneath the oceans) as expressions of plate inter-
actions. Specific topics include the rocks and structures of modern and ancient mountain belts, the
patterns of global seismicity and volcanism, the nature of the Earth's interior, the changing configura-
tions of continents and ocean basins through time, and, in some detail, the formation of the Appala-
chian Mountain system and the geological assembly of New England. Readings will be from a physi-
cal geology textbook and primary source supplement, selected writings of John McPhee, and refer-
ences about the geology of the Northeast.
Format: lectures, three hours a week; labs (several involving field work), two hours a week; one re-
quired all-day field trip during the last week of the semester to the Connecticut Valley, and the high-
lands of western Massachusetts. Evaluation will be based on two hour-tests, weekly lab work, and a
scheduled final exam.

Hour: 10:00-10:50 MWF Lab: 1-3 W WOBUS
GEOS 103(F) Environmental Geology and the Earth's Surface (Same as Environmental
Studies 103)
Limitations imposed by the physical environment have become increasingly important as population
expands. Geologic materials such as soil, sediment, and bedrock, and geologic processes involving
earthquakes, volcanic activity, and running water often pose constraints on land use. This course ex-
amines the nature of geologic materials, the physical processes that continuously change the surface
of the Earth, and how these processes affect human activity. Topics include volcanic and earthquake
hazards, surface-water erosion and flooding, landslides, groundwater, solid waste disposal, resource
issues, global climate change, and the importance of geologic information to land-use planning. Lab-
oratories emphasize field and classroom studies of surface processes and discussion of their applica-
tion to planning.
Format: lectures/discussions, three hours per week; one two-hour laboratory a week; local field trips.
Evaluation will be based on two hour exams, weekly labs, and a final exam.

GEOS 104(S) Oceanography (Same as Environmental Studies 104)
This course will present an integrated introduction to the oceans. Topics covered will include forma-
tion and history of the ocean basins; ocean chemistry; oceans through time; currents, tides, and waves;
oceans and climate; coastal processes and ecology; productivity in the oceans; and resources and
pollution. Coastal oceanography will be investigated on an all-day field trip to the New England coast.

GEOS 105(F) Geology Outdoors (W)
An introduction to geology through student field projects. The mountains, lakes, rivers, and valleys of
the Williamstown area provide unusual opportunities for learning geology in the field. Student pro-
jects will include the study of streams as active agents of erosion and deposition, the effects of glaci-
ation on the New England landscape, and the history of mountain building in the Appalachians. Fol-
lowing several group projects introducing the techniques of field geology, students will pursue inde-
pendent projects on subjects of particular interest to them. This course departs from the standard sci-
ence course format with three lectures and a required lab each week. Instead, emphasis is placed on
learning through active participation in field projects and presentation of results through high quality
writing. The class will meet two afternoons each week from 1:00 to 3:45 p.m. There will be two all day
field trips. This course is designed for students who have a serious interest in geology or other natural
and environmental sciences, the outdoors, and writing.
Format: discussion/field laboratory six-hours a week. Evaluation will be based on participation in
field work and discussions, five eight-page papers based on field projects, and an oral presentation of
independent projects. Students will use detailed comments on their papers to improve their writing

surficial geologic processes and their importance in shaping the physical environment. The course
emphasizes the nature and rates of constructional, weathering, and erosional processes and the influ-
ence of climatic, tectonic, and volcanic forces on landform evolution. Labs focus on field measure-
ments of hydrologic and geomorphic processes in the Williamstown area as well as on the analysis of
topographic maps and stereo air photos.

environmental conflicts that result from human intervention in hydrologic processes. Lectures and
use of computer models about hydrology (surface water and groundwater) introduce discussion of
topics such as dams and flooding, pollution of water with nutrients or toxic chemicals, and water-
borne disease. Technical reports and readings in American prose are used to study attitudes about ir-
rigation, water depletion and salinization, water law and economics, and aspects of the hydraulic em-
pire of the American West.

GEOS 212(S) Invertebrate Paleobiology (Same as Biology 211)
This course offers an introduction to the study of prehistoric life. The fossils of marine invertebrates
provide an excellent foundation for this purpose, because they are widespread and abundant, they are
often well-preserved, and they have a record that reaches back in time over 600 million years. The
intellectual discovery of fossils as organic relics and the ways in which fossils were used by earlier
generations to support conflicting views on nature are briefly surveyed. The lecture topics that follow
are organized to illustrate the various directions explored by paleontologists today to solve a broad
range of questions. These include: biological and paleontological views on the species concept rele-
vant to taxonomy; ongoing debate over the timing and mechanisms of evolution; biostratigraphy as a
means to correlate sedimentary rocks; functional morphology as a means to reconstruct the biome-
chanics of extinct species; analysis of fossil assemblages to interpret the ecology of ancient environ-
Geosciences

ments; paleogeography as related to patterns in biodiversity, and the possible causes of mass extinc-
tions. Laboratory exercises utilize superb fossil collections to study the processes of fossilization and
to survey the biology and taxonomy of the major invertebrate phyla.
Format: lectures, three hours a week; one three-hour laboratory a week; field trip to the Lower Devo-
nian Helderbergs of New York State. Evaluation will be based on weekly lab reports, a midterm paper,
a midterm exam, a lab practicum, and a final exam.

GEOS 214(S) Remote Sensing and Geographic Information Systems (Same as
Environmental Studies 214)
Remote sensing involves the collection and processing of data from satellite and airborne sensors to
yield environmental information about the Earth's surface and lower atmosphere. Remote sensing
enhances regional mapping of rock types and faults and analysis of vegetation cover and land-use
changes over time. A Geographic Information System (GIS) links satellite-based environmental mea-
surements with spatial data such as topography, transportation networks, and political boundaries, al-
lowing display and quantitative analysis at the same scale using the same geographic reference. This
course covers the principles and practice of remote-data capture and geographic rectification using a
Global Positioning System (GPS), as well as the concepts of Remote Sensing, including linear and
non-linear image enhancements, convolution filtering, principle components analysis, and classifica-
tion. Principles of GIS include display and classification, spatial buffers, and logical overlays. Weekly
labs focus on practical applications of these techniques to data from Hopkins Memorial Forest, the
Berkshire region, and other areas of North America.
Format: lectures, three hours per week; weekly lab.
Prerequisite: at least one introductory course in Biology, Environmental Studies, or Geosciences. En-
rollment limit:16 (expected 16). Preference to sophomores and juniors.

GEOS 215(F) Climate Changes (Same as Environmental Studies 215) (Q)
In recent years, there has been a growing public and scientific interest in the Earth's climate and its
variability. This interest reflects both concern over future climate changes that may result from an-
thropogenic increases in atmospheric greenhouse gases and growing recognition of the economic im-
pact of "natural" climate variability (for example, El Niño events), especially in the developing world.
Efforts to understand the Earth's climate system and predict future climate changes require both study
of parameters controlling present day climate and detailed studies of climate changes in the past. In
this course, we will review the processes that control the Earth's climate, like insolation, distribution
of heat, ocean circulation, and the greenhouse effect. At the same time, we will review the geological
record of climate changes in the past, examining their causes, positive and negative feedback effects,
and indicators of the stability or instability of the climate system.
Format: lectures/discussions, three hours a week. Evaluation will be based on weekly problems
(25%), two hour exams (50%), and a final project (25%) where students will collect, analyze, and
interpret data. Weekly exercises will emphasize developing problem solving skills and using quanti-
tative analyses to assess if a given explanation is possible and reasonable. These exercises will include
developing and applying numerical models of the carbon cycle and basic radiative balance models.
Prerequisites: none. No enrollment limit (expected: 25).

GEOS 217T(F) Planetary Geology (Same as Astronomy 217T) (W)
Planetary geology is hot! In the last few years space probes and the Hubble Telescope have given us
stunning new perspectives on our planetary neighbors, and the recent thrilling discoveries of the bi-
zarre "hot Jupiters" orbiting other stars have forced us to reexamine ideas about the evolution of our
own solar system. We can't hike around on Mars or Europa, so we have to infer composition, form,
texture and process from photographs and sparse chemical data. By reading recent research papers we
will examine a number of topics, which may include planetary formation and differentiation, the
failed-planet hypothesis, surficial features of planets and their interpretation, tectonics in the solar sys-
tem, liquid water in the outer solar system, water on Mars, and giant-planet migration.
Evaluation will be based on five 2500-word (about five pages) papers, discussion, and critical analy-
sis. There will be a strong focus on polished writing and argument, and papers will be thoroughly
edited by the professor for style, grammar and syntax. Students will improve their writing by integrat-
ing into successive papers the editorial comments they receive, and also by editing the writing of their
tutorial partners.

GEOS 218T(S) The Carbon Cycle (Same as Environmental Studies 218) (W)
Carbon dioxide is the most important atmospheric greenhouse gas, and human activities are adding
carbon to the atmosphere at unprecedented rates. Yet only half of the carbon we emit each year re-
mains in the atmosphere because biological, geological, and chemical processes continually cycle
carbon from the atmosphere to the ocean, to land plants and soils, and to sediments. The workings of
the carbon cycle are at the center of many controversies surrounding the causes of past climate
changes and the outcome of future global warming. How was the earth's climate steered by past
changes in the carbon cycle, billions and millions of years ago? Will natural processes continue to take
up such a high percentage of carbon emissions as emissions continue and climate changes? Can and
should we coax natural systems to take up even more carbon? How might carbon emissions be re-
duced on the scale of the Williams campus? We will explore these issues through readings of current
journal articles and reports, as well as participation in a national workshop on reducing carbon emis-
sions on campuses.
Requirements: After an initial group meeting, students will meet in pairs for one hour each week with
the instructor. Each student will orally present a written paper every other week for criticism during
the tutorial session. Evaluation will be based on the five papers and each student's effectiveness as a
critic.
Prerequisites: One introductory course in biology, chemistry, or geosciences or one course cross-
listed in the Environmental Studies Program. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Preference to soph-
omores and juniors. Writing intensive.
Hour: TBA STOLL
GEOS 250T(S) Tectonics, Erosion, and Climate (W)
Traditional models of landscape development postulate rapid pulses of tectonic uplift followed by
long periods of gradual erosion. In sharp contrast, recent studies suggest that landscape is the product
of complex interactions between tectonics, erosion, and climate. It is clear that tectonic uplift directly
affects erosion rates and may induce orographic climate changes, but can climatically enhanced ero-
sion rates drive tectonic processes? Can very rapid uplift and erosion in one region, such as the Hima-
layas, affect global climate by sequestering greenhouse gases during the weathering of sediments?
Some researchers believe so. This course will explore the feedback mechanisms that have been pro-
posed to explain how tectonics, erosion, and climate
affect one another and produce the landscapes we observe today. Topics will include plate tectonics
and crustal thickening, erosion and exhumation processes, climate and erosion rates, isostasy, equilib-
rium landscapes, formation of orogenic plateaus, and formation of the Himalayas and development of
the Asian monsoon.
This course will follow the tutorial format. After an initial group meeting, students will meet in pairs
for one hour each week with the instructor. Each student will orally present a written paper every other
week for criticism during the tutorial session.
Evaluation will be based on five five-page papers and each student's effectiveness as a critic.
Prerequisites: At least one of the following courses: Geosciences 201, 202, 301, 302, 303, or 401 or
with permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected:10). Preference given to geosciences
majors. This course is writing intensive.
Hour: TBA KARABINOS
GEOS 301(F) Structural Geology (Q)
The structure of the Earth's crust is constantly changing and the rocks making up the crust must de-
form to accommodate these changes. Rock deformation occurs over many scales ranging from indi-
vidual mineral grains to mountain belts. This course deals with the geometric description of struc-
tures, stress and strain analysis, deformation mechanisms in rocks, and the large scale forces responsi-
ble for crustal deformation. The laboratories cover geologic maps and cross sections, folds and faults,
stereonet analysis, field techniques, strain, and stress.
Format: lectures and discussion, three hours a week; one three-hour laboratory each week. Evaluation
will be based on weekly laboratory exercises, problem sets, a midterm exam, and a final exam. Many
of the laboratories and problem sets use geometry, algebra, and several projection techniques to solve
common problems in structural geology.
Prerequisites: Geosciences 101, 102, 103, or 105 or consent of instructor. No enrollment limit (ex-
pected: 12). This is a quantitative/formal reasoning course.

GEOS 302(S) Sedimentation (W)
The composition and architecture of sediments and sedimentary rocks preserve information about the
rocks that were eroded to form them, the fluids and forces that transported them, the mechanisms by
which they were deposited, and the processes by which they were lithified. This course will provide
an introduction to the principles of sedimentology, including sedimentary petrology, fluid mechanics,
bedform analysis, and facies architecture.
Format: lectures and discussions, three hours per week; one three-hour laboratory each week; one
half-day and one all-day field trip. Evaluation will be based on laboratory work, writing assignments,

an hour exam, and a final exam. Ten written critiques (each 1000 words) of specific assigned papers
from the sedimentological literature are designed to teach clear written expression and careful analyti-
cal reading. Papers will be thoroughly edited for style, grammar and syntax. Students will improve
their writing by integrating editorial comments into successive papers. Each student will compile his/
her papers as a growing body of work, and each new paper will be read and edited in the context of the
previous submissions.

GEOS 303(F) Igneous and Metamorphic Petrology
The origin of metamorphic, plutonic, and volcanic rocks are examined in the light of field evidence
and experimental work. Rock texture and composition are used to interpret the environment of forma-
tion of individual rock types, and important assemblages are related, where possible, to theories of
global tectonics.
Laboratory work emphasizes the study of individual rock units and rock suites in hand specimens and
by petrographic and x-ray techniques.
Format: lectures/discussions, three hours a week; one three-hour laboratory each week; several field
trips including one all-day trip to central New Hampshire. Evaluation will be based on lab work, one
hour test, and a final exam.
Prerequisite: Geosciences 202. No enrollment limit (expected: 12).
Hour: 9:55-11:10 TR Lab: 1-4 W WOBUS
GEOS 401(F) Stratigraphy
Study of the composition, sequence, and correlation of layered sedimentary rocks is traditionally ap-
plied to geologic mapping and the reconstruction of ancient environments. Through the use of various
time scales, stratigraphy is the unifier of historical geology while also at the heart of conceptual de-
bates over the uniformism or episodicity of geological processes. During the first half of the course,
emphasis will be placed on the various methods of correlation based on physical means and the use of
fossils. The second half of the course will focus on plate migrations and the relationships between
climate and depositional environments as a model for the broad scale interpretation of sedimentary
sequences. This part of the course will be conducted as a seminar, with students responsible for topics
on the paleogeographic linkage of climate-sensitive facies and natural resources. As a final project,
students working individually or in pairs will present a detailed analysis of North-American strati-
graphic relationships during a specific interval of Cambrian to Cretaceous time. In sequence, these
class reports will provide highlights of the geologic history of the North-American continent through
Paleozoic and Mesozoic time.
Format: lectures, three hours a week; one three-hour lab per week during the first half of the course
(including field problems); independent projects during the second half of the course; one major field
trip. Evaluation will be based on weekly lab assignments during the first half of the semester, seminar
participation, and the completion of a final project during the second half of the semester, as well as a
midterm and a final exam.
Prerequisite: Geosciences 302 or consent of the instructor. No enrollment limit (expected: 12).

LANGUAGE STUDY
The department provides language instruction to enable the student to acquire all four linguistic
skills: understanding, speaking, reading, and writing. German 101-W-102 stresses basic communica-
tive competence and covers German grammar in full. German 103 combines a review of grammar
with extensive practice in reading and conversation. German 104 aims to develop facility in speaking,
writing, and reading. German 201 emphasizes accuracy and idiomatic expression in speaking and
writing. German 202 combines advanced language study with the examination of topics in German-
speaking cultures. Students who have studied German in secondary school should take the placement
test given during First Days in September to determine which course to take.
German

STUDY ABROAD
The department strongly encourages students wanting to attain fluency in German to spend a se-
mester or year studying in Germany, Austria, or Switzerland, either independently or in one of several
approved foreign study programs. German 104 or the equivalent is the minimum requirement for ju-
nior-year abroad programs sponsored by American institutions. Students who wish to enroll directly
in a German-speaking university should complete at least 201 or the equivalent. In any case, all stu-
dents considering study-abroad are advised to discuss their language preparation with a member of
the department.
LITERATURE IN TRANSLATION
The department regularly offers courses on German literature in translation for students who have
little or no knowledge of German, but who wish to become acquainted with the major achievements in
German literary and intellectual history.
ADVANCED STUDIES
The department offers a variety of advanced courses for students who wish to investigate German
literature, thought, and culture in the original. German 202 is given each year and is recommended as
preparation for upper-level courses.
THE CERTIFICATE IN GERMAN
To enhance a student's educational and professional profiles, the department offers the Certificate
in German. It requires seven courses--two fewer than the major--and is especially appropriate for
students who begin study of the language at Williams.
Students who enter Williams with previous training in German may substitute more advanced
courses for the 100-level courses; they can also be exempted from up to two of the required courses.
Students must receive a minimum grade of B in each course taken in the sequence. In addition, they
must score of at least 650 (out of a possible 800) on the ETS (Educational Testing Service) Proficiency
Test.
Appropriate elective courses can usually be found among the offerings of German, Art History,
History, Music, Philosophy, Political Science, and Theatre.
Required Courses
German 101
German 102

GERM 202(S) Berlin, Capital of the Twentieth Century (W)
Philosopher Walter Benjamin posited in 1935 that while Paris was the capital of the nineteenth centu-
ry, Berlin was the capital of the twentieth. With this idea in mind, we will examine texts from and
about Berlin throughout the last century. We will move from the turn of the century (when the city's
German
­ 187 ­
population had recently tripled in size) to the establishing of Berlin as a world capital in the 1920s,
then through Nazi-era transformations, wartime destruction, and the postwar East/West division of
the city. We will conclude with the fall of the Berlin Wall, the return of the German capital to the in-
creasingly multicultural city, and the Love Parade (the annual event for which Berlin is best known
among youth around the world). Films and readings may include Walter Ruttmann'sBerlin, die Sinfo-
nie einer Großstadt, Irmgard Keun's Das kunstseidene Mädchen, Peter Schneider's Der Mauer-
springer, Tom Tykwer's Lola rennt, and Thomas Brussig, Am kürzeren Ende der Sonnenallee, and

GERM 304(F) German Literature 1939-Present
This course will provide an overview of German-language literature from the Nazi era through the
present day. Beginning with the literature of intellectuals in exile, we will then examine the "rubble
literature" of the so-called "zero hour" of the immediate postwar era. We will trace the development of
literature in the two German states (with a sideways glance toward Austria), focusing on such topics
as the memory of fascism and the Holocaust, and the consequences of Germany's division and ulti-
mate reunification. Readings may include texts by Klaus & Erika Mann, Wolfgang Staudte, Wolfgang
Borchert, Gruppe 47, Heinrich Böll, Peter Weiss, Ingeborg Bachmann, Peter Schneider, Christoph
Hein, Patrick Süßkind, Jurek Becker, Christa Wolf, Bernhard Schlink, and Zafer Senocak. Readings

GERM 312(S) Gender and Sexuality from Fin-de-Siècle to Fascism (Same as Comparative
Literature 312)
A century ago the late and rapid industrialization of Germany and Austria resulted in the radical trans-
formation of society, including new and unstable configurations of gender roles and sexuality. Artists
and intellectuals throughout the English-speaking world avidly read the work of German sexologists
(who first coined the term homosexual), the psychoanalysis of Sigmund Freud, and the now nearly
forgotten sexual theories of Otto Weininger. In this course we will read these theories alongside the
literature of the era, beginning with the fin-de-siècle, moving through Expressionism, and culminat-
ing in the seemingly liberal Weimar era and its abrupt end in 1933. Readings may include theory by
Kraft-Ebing, Ulrichs, Freud, Weininger, and Hirschfeld; literature by Theodor Fontane, Frank Wede-
kind, Arthur Schnitzler, Carl Sternheim, Oscar Kokoschka, Thomas Mann, Klaus Mann, and Anna
Weirauch; and the films The Blue Angel by Joseph von Sternberg (Marlene Dietrich's breakthrough
film) and Girls in Uniform by Leontine Sagan. All readings and discussion in English.
Format: seminar. Requirements: one presentation, one shorter (6-8 pp.) paper, and one longer (~15

GENERAL STATEMENT OF GOALS
Although the History Department aspires to pursue a variety of goals, our core objectives remain
the cultivation in our students of a critical understanding and awareness of the past and the develop-
ment of our students' intellectual, analytical, and rhetorical abilities. In pursuit of the first objective,
through its curricular offerings the department seeks both to expose students to the richness, diversity,
and complexities of human history over long periods of time and in different geographic regions and
to provide students with the opportunity to explore aspects of the past in depth. At the same time, the
department endeavors to develop students' ability to think historically and to foster in them an ap-
preciation of the contested nature and the value of historical knowledge by confronting them with the
variety of ways in which historians have approached and interpreted the past, engaging them in issues
that provoke historical debate, and familiarizing them with the nature and uses of historical evidence.
By engaging students in the critical study of the past, finally, the department seeks to develop their
ability to formulate historically informed opinions and their analytical and rhetorical skills generally.
While members of the department attempt to accomplish these multiple objectives individually
through their particular courses and their other contacts with students, the department seeks to do so
collectively through the structure of the History curriculum and the requirements of the History major.
COURSE NUMBERS
The course numbering system used by the History Department reflects the different types and ob-
jectives of courses offered at each level. The different course levels are distinguished less by degree of
difficulty than by the purposes that the courses at each level are intended to serve and the background
knowledge they presume.
First-Year Seminars and Tutorials (102-199): These writing intensive courses introduce stu-
dents to the richness of historical approaches to the past and to the contested subjects on which
historians focus. They emphasize the acquisition of skills needed in the advanced study of his-
tory and are ideal for students contemplating a major in History. Each seminar is limited to
nineteen students, and each tutorial, to ten students. In the case of seminars, preference will be
given to first-year students and then to sophomores. First-year students and sophomores will be
given equal preference in the case of tutorials, to which the writing of five or six essays and the
oral presentation of five or six critiques of another student's essays are central. In any case,
first-year students will not normally be permitted to enroll in a tutorial during their first semes-
ter. Because first-year seminars and tutorials serve as an introduction to the study of history,
only one course of each type may count toward the History major; these courses can also be
used to meet the department's group and concentration requirements.
Introductory Survey Courses (202-299): These courses are open to all students and are intended to
provide a basic understanding of the history of peoples, countries, and geographic regions over rel-
atively long time-spans. Most of all, they will provide students with the background necessary for
more advanced study in history at the 300 and 400 level. They are offered in either small or large
formats, depending on the individual course.
History
­ 189 ­
Junior Seminars (301): Junior seminars offer a series of "reflections on history," are required for the
degree in History, and are normally restricted to junior History majors. Each seminar focuses in
depth on questions of methodology, historiography, and/or epistemology and is intended to
introduce students to various ways of thinking about and "doing" history, both in the present and in
the past. Each year several junior seminars will be offered; prospective majors must select two ju-
nior seminars at the end of their sophomore year and will then be assigned to one of their two
choices. If students are studying away from Williams during their junior year, they must enroll in a
junior seminar during their senior year.
Advanced Electives (302-399): These advanced, topical courses are more specialized in focus than are the
introductory survey courses (202-299) and are intended to follow such courses. Enrollment is often limi-
ted. Because these courses may presume some background knowledge, the instructor may recommend
that students enroll in an appropriate introductory course before registering for an advanced elective.
Advanced Seminars (402-479): These are advanced courses normally limited in enrollment to fif-
teen students. Each seminar will investigate a topic in depth and will require students to engage in
research that leads to a substantial piece of historical writing. All History majors are required to
complete either an advanced seminar (402-479) or a tutorial (480-492). Instructors may recom-
mend prior coursework in the area of the seminar. Priority will be given to senior History majors,
followed by junior History majors.
Advanced Tutorials (480-492): These are advanced reading and writing courses that offer an in-
depth analysis of a topic in tutorial format. Tutorials are limited in enrollment to ten students and
priority will be given to senior History majors. All History majors are required to complete either an
advanced seminar (402-479) or a tutorial (480-492). Instructors may recommend prior coursework
in the area of the tutorial. The writing of five or six essays and the oral presentation of five or six
critiques of another student's essays are central to tutorials.
Within each of these levels, courses are further divided by geographical area:
Africa and the Middle East 102-111 202-211 302-311 402-411
Asia 112-121 212-221 312-321 412-421
Europe and Russia 122-141 222-241 322-341 422-441

United States 152-191 252-291 352-391 452-471
Transnational/Comparative 192-199 292-299 392-396 472-479
ADVISING
Both majors and non-majors are encouraged to talk at any time with Professor Wagner, the depart-
ment chair, Mrs. Swift, the department administrative assistant, or any other member of the depart-
ment about the History major.
All majors will be assigned a faculty advisor. All majors must meet with their advisor, or the depart-
ment chair, during the first week of classes during the fall semester and at the time of the spring semes-
ter registration period in order to have their courses and plans for the History major approved. Stu-
dents who are interested in the senior honors program or graduate school should contact Professor
Wong. Prospective study abroad students should contact Mrs. Swift.
ADVANCED PLACEMENT
Beginning with the class of 2002, students will be granted one semester course credit toward the
course requirement in the History major if they receive a score of 4 or 5 on one or more of the Ad-
vanced Placement examinations in history. Even if two or more Advanced Placement examinations
are taken, and the student receives a 4 or 5 on more than one of them, only one semester course credit
will be applied toward the course requirement in the History major. Moreover, such credit may not be
used to satisfy the group requirements or concentration requirements.
THE MAJOR
The major consists of at least nine semester courses as follows:
Required Courses in the Major
One Junior Seminar (History 301)
At least one Advanced Seminar (History 402-479) or Tutorial (History 480-492)
Elective Courses
Seven (or more) additional semester courses in History, at least one of these to be chosen from each
of the following three groups:
Group A: History of the United States
Group B: European History (including Russian History)
History
­ 190 ­
Group C: History of Asia, Africa and the Middle East, and/or Latin-American and the Caribbean
In addition, students must take at least one course dealing with the premodern period (designated
Group D in the catalog); this may be one of the courses used to fulfill the group requirement (Groups
A-C).
A single course can meet the requirement for no more than one of Groups A through C. Only one
First-year seminar and one First-year tutorial (102-199) may be used to meet the group requirements.
Concentration in the Major
All students are required to adopt a concentration within the History major. The concentration
should be selected in consultation with a faculty advisor at spring registration during the sophomore
year. A list of concentrations is appended below and a list of the courses that fall within each con-
centration is available from the History Department office and can also be found on the department's
website. Students must choose to concentrate in one of these eighteen broad areas unless they petition
the department's Curriculum Committee to substitute a concentration of their own design. A con-
centration will consist of at least three courses linked by common themes, geography, or time period;
only one of those courses can be a 100-level seminar while at least one must be a 300- or 400-level
course. Courses in the concentration may be used to fulfill the group requirements. In selecting
courses to meet their concentration requirement, students should be aware that not every course is
offered every year. Courses taken abroad may be included in the concentration with the approval of
the chair.
Concentrations:
1. Africa and the African Diaspora
2. Asia and the Asian Diaspora
3. Comparative Slavery
4. Ancient, Medieval, and Renaissance Europe
5. Early Modern Europe
6. Modern Europe
7. Gender and Sexuality

18. War and Revolution
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN HISTORY
The History Department offers a thesis route to the degree with honors in History. This involves a
ten-course major as well as an independent WSP. Students wishing to undertake independent research
or considering graduate study are encouraged to participate in the thesis program and honors seminar.
Application to enter the honors program should be made by spring registration in the junior year
and should be based on a solid record of work of honors caliber, normally defined as maintaining at
least a B+ average in courses taken for the major. Students who intend to write an honors thesis must
submit a proposal to the History Department at this time. Students who will be away during the spring
semester of their junior year should make arrangements to apply before leaving. Normally, it is the
responsibility of the individual student to procure the agreement of a member of the department to act
as his or her thesis advisor, and the student must therefore consult with a member of the department
about a thesis topic and a possible thesis advisor prior to submitting a proposal to the department. A
student who is uncertain of which member of the department might be an appropriate advisor, or who
otherwise is unable to find an advisor, should contact the chair of the honors committee. An honors
thesis proposal must be signed by a member of the History Department. Normally, the thesis topic
should be related to course work which the student has previously done. Students should be aware,
however, that while the department will try to accommodate all students who qualify to pursue hon-
ors, particular topics may be deemed unfeasible and students may have to revise their topics accor-
dingly. Final admission to the honors thesis program will depend on the department's assessment of
the qualifications of the student and the feasibility of the project.
Once the student has been notified of admission to the honors thesis program, he or she should reg-
ister for History 493, Senior Honors Thesis Research Seminar, in the fall semester, for History 031
during winter study, and for History 494, Senior Honors Thesis Writing Seminar, in the spring. In
History
­ 191 ­
addition to doing the research for and writing a thesis of approximately 75-100 pages, students will
attend special presentations under the History Department's Class of 1960 Scholars Program.
During the fall, students should work regularly on their research and consult frequently with their
advisors. Throughout the semester, honors candidates will also present written progress reports for
group discussion to the seminar (History 493). Performance in the seminar will be evaluated on the
basis of class participation and completed written work and will determine if a student will continue in
the thesis program. For students proceeding to History 031 and History 494, performance in the fall
semester will figure into the thesis grade calculated at the end of the year.
Students who are deemed to be making satisfactory progress on their research and writing at this
point will be allowed to continue with the thesis. They will devote the entire winter study period to
thesis work. They should conclude their research during winter study and complete at least one chap-
ter of their thesis for submission to their advisor before the end of winter study. At the end of winter
study, the honors committee will formally consult with advisors and make recommendations to the
department concerning which students should be allowed to proceed with the thesis. During the early
weeks of the second semester, students will present a draft chapter of their thesis to the honors semi-
nar.
Completed theses will be due in mid-April, after which each student will prepare and present a
short oral presentation of his or her thesis for delivery at the departmental Honors Colloquium. Anoth-
er student who has read the thesis will then offer a critique of it, after which the two faculty readers of
the thesis will offer their own comments and questions. Finally, there will be a general discussion of
the thesis by students and other members of the department.
LANGUAGE
Study of a foreign language is basic to the understanding of other cultures. Particularly those stu-
dents who might wish to do graduate work in History are encouraged to enroll in language courses at
Williams.
COURSES
FIRST-YEAR SEMINARS AND TUTORIALS (102-199)
These writing intensive courses introduce students to the richness of historical approaches to the
past and to the contested subjects on which historians focus. They emphasize the acquisition of skills
needed in the advanced study of history and are ideal for students contemplating a major in History.
Each seminar is limited to nineteen students, and each tutorial, to ten students. In the case of seminars,
preference will be given to first-year students and then to sophomores. First-year students and sopho-
mores will be given equal preference in the case of tutorials, to which the writing of five or six essays
and the oral presentation of five or six critiques of another student's essays are central. In any case,
first-year students will not normally be permitted to enroll in a tutorial during their first semester. Be-
cause first-year seminars and tutorials serve as an introduction to the study of history, only one course
of each type may count toward the History major; these courses can also be used to meet the depart-
ment's group and concentration requirements.

HIST 112(F) The Mao Cult (W)*
The Great Helmsman of the People's Republic of China, Chairman Mao Zedong, is one the most con-
troversial figures in history. Did he save China or almost destroy it? Should he be revered as a hero or
defiled as a demon? In China of the 1990s, an entire cult has sprung up around Mao Zedong--perhaps
not as all-encompassing as the Mao Worship of the 1960s and early 70s, but still an intriguing and
important phenomenon. This course will look at the personal and public history of the Chairman and
the cults he continues to inspire. We will also explore personality cults in comparative perspective and
look at Mao Zedong's impact in other parts of the world (such as on the Shining Path guerrillas of
Peru).

Scandinavians on European civilization was more complex and constructive than portrayed by medi-
eval chroniclers. Vikings acted as merchants, craftsmen, farmers, settlers, and mercenaries, and they
colonized regions beyond the edges of the known world like Russia, Iceland, and North America. This
course explores the complicated relationship of the Vikings with the medieval world and examines
important developments within Scandinavian society such as kingship, trade, and Christianization. At
the same time, we will consider the methodological difficulties presented by the diverse and often
contradictory historical sources for the Vikings such as monastic chronicles, archaeology, inscrip-
tions, and Scandinavian sagas.

HIST 135T(S) The Great War, 1914-1918 (W)
During the nineteenth and early twentieth century Europeans and their immediate offspring created
the modern world. European industry, science, trade, weapons, and culture dominated the globe. Af-
ter a century of general peace the continual "progress" of Western Civilization seemed assured. Then,
in August, 1914, the major European powers went to war with one another. After four years of unprec-
edented carnage, violence, and destruction, Europe was left exhausted and bitter, its previous opti-
mism replaced by pessimism, its world position undermined, and its future clouded by a deeply
flawed peace settlement.
What were the fundamental causes of the Great War? How and why did it break out when it did and
who was responsible? Why was it so long, ferocious, wasteful, and, until the very end, indecisive?
Why did the Allies, rather than the Central Powers, emerge victorious? What did the peace settlement
settle? How was Europe changed? What is the historical significance of the conflict? History 135T
will explore these and other questions and issues about World War I in a tutorial setting designed for
first and second year students.

HIST 148(S) (formerly 102) The Mexican Revolution: 1910 to NAFTA (W)*
The first great revolution in the twentieth century, the Mexican Revolution was as dramatic and com-
pelling as later episodes in Russia, China and Cuba. Using a wide variety of sources--from films,
murals, and comic books to classic works of political and social history--this seminar will examine
the forces that exploded in over a decade of violence and produced the peculiar "institutional revolu-
tionary" government that ruled Mexico from the 1920s to the crises of the late 1990s. Was the Revolu-
tion a true social revolution or just a "palace coup"? Did workers, women, peasants, indigenous
peoples make real gains in social or political power during the after the Revolution? How democratic
or authoritarian is the Mexico that emerged from the brutal decade of the 1910s? Finally, in light of
globalization, the political scandals of the 1990s, and ongoing peasant rebellion in Chiapas, is the
Revolution dead or is its promise only now to be fulfilled?
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class participation, a series of short written assignments,
and a research paper.

HIST 152(F) "New Worlds for All": European-Indian Encounters in Colonial North America
(W)*
This course focuses on the interactions between Indians and Europeans in the contexts of Spanish,
French, Dutch, and British exploration and colonization of North America. Drawing upon our critical
reading of secondary and primary sources, we will explore the political, economic, social, and cultural
transformations visited upon both Indian and Euro-American societies as a result of European at-
tempts to control vast North American territories from the Saint Lawrence valley to Florida and from
the Lower Mississippi valley to California. Because of the large scope of our inquiry we will proceed
both chronologically and thematically. Our themes will include: Indian resistance and adaptation to
European invasions and evangelizing efforts; diplomacy, warfare, and the evolution of North Ameri-
can geopolitics; Frontier exchange economies and the transformation of material cultures; the trans-
formation and construction of colonial identities (Euro-American and Indian concepts of "self," the
racialization of Euro-American perceptions of Indians and Indians' perceptions of Europeans).
Over the course of the semester, students will write several response papers based on secondary read-
ings to help them assess how historians have addressed these themes. These papers will serve as the
basis for our discussion of the methodologies, theories, and sources historians use to reconstruct the
history of European-Indian encounters. Short response papers will also familiarize students with
some of the most important historiographical debates of colonial North American history and will
help them conceptualize and write an original research paper based upon a combination of primary
and secondary sources.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class attendance and participation, weekly response pa-
pers and the final research paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference given to first-year students, and
then sophomores. This course is writing intensive.

HIST 159(F) The Origins of the Cold War (W)
In August of 1945, World War II ended and America looked forward to a future of peace. Five years
later, not only was the country engaged in another war (albeit a "limited" one in Korea), but it had also
constructed the institutions and ideologies of a national security state for what had come to be called a
"cold war." The rapidity with which this happened and the global reach of American security interests
is breathtaking: in this writing-intensive seminar, we will slow down the historical clock to investigate
in-depth what happened in those five years, covering such subjects as the policy of containment, the
development of nuclear arms, domestic anti-communism, the division of Berlin, and our increasing
military commitments in Asia.
Format: seminar. Requirements: class participation, weekly response papers, peer editing, and book
reviews.

HIST 164(S) Slavery in the American South (W)*
No area of American social history has been more active and exciting in recent years than the study of
slavery. This seminar will introduce students to the most important aspects of the South's slave sys-
tem. We will begin by reading a number of key books in the field, and then we will turn to the College
library's extensive holdings of microfilm records dealing with both agricultural and industrial slavery.
In consultation with the instructor, each student will select the records of a slave-manned plantation or
industrial site for careful and detailed study. The most important piece of work in the seminar will be a
research paper that each student will prepare using the manuscript source materials.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class attendance and participation, several short prelim-

ical, and public policy perspectives that informed twentieth-century struggles for black civil rights.
Using a variety of sources (memoirs, photography, film, and music), we will consider historical de-
bates as well as the period's impact on our understanding of African American and American history.

HIST 203(F) Sub-Saharan Africa Since 1800*
This survey of sub-Saharan African history takes up the continuing saga of African political, social
and economic developments from the aftermath of the trans-Atlantic slave trade to the present. It is
divided into three sections. The first section of the course focuses on the consequences of the slave
trade on African societies and on the Africans' interaction with European merchants, explorers, and
missionaries in the decades preceding colonial conquest. The human consequences of the trade lin-
gered long after the abolition of the slave trade across the Atlantic ocean. Many African societies were
strengthened, often at the expense of their neighbors; other societies were weakened, thus setting the
stage for colonial conquest. During the second half of the nineteenth century, however, competition
among Europeans for control of raw materials for their nascent industries led to colonization, and in
some cases, to white settlement in Africa.
The second section of the course investigates the process of colonial conquest and the dynamics of
colonial rule in Africa. It looks especially at the ways in which colonialism affected various groups of
Africans, and at the ways, both subtle and overt, in which Africans resisted or collaborated with colo-
nial rule in order to achieve their goals. The colonial period, brief in time, yet profoundly significant in
its impact, was ushered out partly by the rising tide of African nationalism.
The last section of the course, then, examines the rise of new nation-states, their colonial legacies,
post-colonial economies, and systems of justice, education, and governance.
Format: discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, one exam, and two papers.

its subsequent evolution to the contemporary political and economic phenomenon we know today.
Tracing premodern legacies that have helped shape China, the course covers the decline and fall of the
Qing dynasty through the creation of Communist China and the unfolding of the post-Mao era. The
class uses primary and secondary sources (including literature and films) to examine the origins and
impact of major social and ideological trends such as foreign imperialism, nationalism, racism/cultur-
alism, feminism, communism, Maoism, and capitalism in China. The course considers the relation-
ship between political thought and practice and how these "-isms" affected the daily life of the indi-
vidual in China.

HIST 222(S) (formerly 216) Greek History (Same as Classics 222)
Ancient Greece has been thought to embody the origins of Western civilization in its institutions, val-
ues, and thought; it has been seen as the infancy of modern society, with the attributes of innocence,
purity, and the infant's staggering capacity for exploration and learning; it has been interpreted as an
essentially primitive, violent culture with a thin veneer of rationality; and it has been celebrated as the
rational culture par excellence. The study of ancient Greece indeed requires an interpretive frame-
work, yet Greek culture and history have defied most attempts to articulate one. We will make our
attempt in this course by investigating ancient Greece as a set of cultures surprisingly foreign to us, as
it so often was to its own intellectual elite. But we will also come to appreciate the rich and very real
connections between ancient Greek and modern Western civilization. The course will begin with
Bronze Age-Greece and the earliest developments in Greek culture, and will conclude with the spread
of Greek influence into Asia through the conquests of Alexander the Great. We will explore topics
such as the aristocratic heritage of the city-state, the effects of pervasive war on Greek society, the
competitive spirit in political and religious life, the confrontations with the East, the relationship of
intellectual culture to Greek culture as a whole, Greek dependence on slavery, and the diversity of
political and social forms in the Greek world. The readings will concentrate on original sources, in-
cluding historical writings, philosophy, poetry, and oratory. The class will meet once a week for a lec-
ture, and will divide into two discussion sections for the second meeting of the week.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on contributions to class discussions, a midterm,
a final exam, and a medium-length paper.

HIST 225(F) The Middle Ages (Same as Religion 216)
This course explores the development of European and Mediterranean civilizations during the thou-

massive empire that stretched from Britain to north Africa and from Spain to Iraq. A millennium later,
this classical and pagan world had broken apart into three successor civilizations: medieval Europe,
the Byzantine empire, and the Islamic world. This course investigates how this momentous trans-
formation occurred. We will examine such topics as relations between Romans and "barbarians," the
spread of Christianity and Islam, the development of kingdoms and empires, the Vikings and cru-
sades, saints and religious reformers, art and architecture, cities and trade, the persecution of Jews and
heretics, as well as the Black Death and Italian Renaissance.

HIST 230(S) Modern European Jewish History, 1789-1948
What does it mean to be a Jew? The vexed question of Jewish identity emerged at the end of the eigh-
teenth century in Europe and has dominated Jewish history throughout the modern period. Although
Jewish emancipation and citizenship followed different paths in France and the German states, in both
cases Jews were confronted by unprecedented opportunities for integration into non-Jewish society
and unprecedented challenges to Jewish communal life. Focusing primarily on France and Germany,
this course will introduce students to the major social, cultural, religious, and political transformations
that shaped the lives of Europe's Jews from the outbreak of the French Revolution to the aftermath of
World War II. We will explore such topics as emancipation, Jewish diversity, the rise of religious de-
nominations within Judaism, competing political ideologies, Jewish-gentile relations, the role of Jew-
ish women, Jewish responses to Nazism, and the situation of Jews in the immediate postwar period. In
addition to broad historical treatments, course materials will include memoirs and novels.

HIST 240(S) (formerly 232) Muscovy and the Russian Empire
Between the fourteenth and the seventeenth centuries the princes and political elite of Muscovy
created a vast multi-national empire in Eastern Europe and Asia. Over the next 150 years their imperi-
al heirs transformed and extended this empire, to the point that on the eve of the Crimean War
(1853-1855) many believed it to be the most powerful state in Europe. But defeat in the war exposed
the weakness of the imperial regime and helped to provoke a process of state-led reform that failed to
avert, and may well have contributed to, the collapse of the regime in the February Revolution of
1917. Using a combination of primary and secondary sources, this course will explore the character of
the Muscovite and the Russian empires and the forces, processes, and personalities that shaped their
formation, expansion, and, in the latter case, decline.
Format: discussion with some lectures. Evaluation will be based on class participation, a map quiz,
several short essays based on class readings, and a final self-scheduled exam.

HIST 243(S) Modern Latin America, 1822 to the Present*
This course will examine salient issues in the history of the independent nations of Latin America. The
first section of the course will focus on the turbulent formation of nation-states over the course of the
nineteenth century. In this regard the course will analyze the social and economic changes of the peri-
od up to World War I and the possibilities they offered for both political order and disorder. Key topics
addressed will include caudillismo, the role of the Church in politics, economic dependency and de-
velopment, and the place of indigenous and African Latin-American peoples in new nations. The sec-
ond section will move us to questions in twentieth-century Latin-American history, including indus-
trialization and urbanization; the emergence of workers' and women's movements and the rise of
mass politics; militarism, democracy, and authoritarian governments; the influence of the U.S. in the
region; and the construction of cultural modernism in these "Third World" societies. Here and
throughout the course we will strive for an understanding of how social conflicts shaped and were
shaped by economic and political forces.

HIST 301B(F) Autobiography as History: An American Character?
Historians have long debated whether it makes sense to speak of distinctive national characters--ten-
dencies to think and behave in particular ways that are endemic to specific nations or peoples. In the
United States, with its high degree of racial and ethnic diversity, such notions seem especially proble-
matic. Through a reading of selected autobiographies supplemented by other materials, we will seek
to test the validity of various conceptions of "American" national character by looking at how individ-
uals in different eras and circumstances have attempted to understand and interpret their own life ex-
periences. Readings will include autobiographies by William Bradford, Benjamin Franklin, Freder-
ick Douglass, Mary Chestnut, Jan Addams, Martin Luther King, Michael Herr, Richard Rodriguez,
Maxine Hong Kingston, and others.
Format: discussion. Evaluation will be based on a series of 3- to 5-page written assignments and a

HIST 301E(S) Barbarians, Saints, and Emperors: The Fall of Rome Reconsidered (W)
The fall of Rome has long fascinated historians. In his monumental Decline and Fall of the Roman
Empire (1776), Edward Gibbon argued that classical civilization collapsed under the weight of "bar-
barism and superstition" (i.e., Germanic invasions and Christianity), thus giving rise to the European
"Dark Ages." But in recent years scholars have reconsidered this period of "Late Antiquity" (roughly
AD 150-750), seeing continuity, complexity, and transformation where Gibbon saw only decline and
fall. This course explores how historians have tried to interpret this foundational period of European
civilization from political, military, economic, cultural, and social perspectives. We will consider such
topics as the rise of Christianity and Islam, relations between Romans and "barbarians," the function
of saints and relics, the formation of Germanic kingdoms and the Byzantine Empire, and changes in
early European economy and society. Throughout, we will pay particular attention to the topics, evi-
dence, methodologies, and assumptions historians use to recreate the history of the distant past.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class participation, bi-weekly book reviews, and a lon-
ger paper.

HIST 301G(S) Westward Expansion in American History
For historians of the United States, the Anglo-American settlement of the West has been a critical lens
for viewing the development of the nation. But historians have never reached any consensus on what
the process of westward expansion, or the influence of the West as a region, has meant to American
history. Did the frontier build American character, as Frederick Jackson Turner argued in 1893? Did it
establish patterns of conquest that shaped American policy toward other parts of the world, as some
current historians would argue today? Has the West been an exceptional place or representative of the
nation at large? How should we even define "the West" or "the frontier"? These are some of the ques-
tions we will explore as we survey the historiographical trajectory on the subject from the mid-nine-
teenth century to the present.

HIST 311(F) Women in the Middle East (Same as Women's and Gender Studies 311)*
This course examines the major developments, themes, and problems in women's history in the
Middle East from the advent of Islam to the present. By tracing women's legal status, sexual morality,
family and social life, and female economic and political participation, it seeks to shed light on the
process of women's roles in society and to challenge the notion that gender divisions and roles have
been static over time. The introductory week is designed to become familiar with theoretical perspec-
tives and debates on women and, in particular, women in the Middle East and Islam. The next segment
of the course, which is devoted to the early history of Islam, explores the important and much-debated
question of the origins of gender inequality in Islamic societies, and examines critical texts in the Is-
lamic tradition. The third segment examines the medieval period and investigates women's actual
place in society, as opposed to the idealist version. The fourth segment probes the Ottoman and Safa-
vid period (16th-18th c.), discussing the question of the harem and the influence of women in political
life. The fifth segment addresses the question of the challenges posed by the impact of the West, the
effects on women and female reactions to this challenge, with a focus on Egypt and Iran. The final
segment addresses questions relating to the "return" of Islam and its repercussions for women in
dress, employment, political participation and morality. Throughout the course, we will make use of

HIST 328(S) Sixteenth-Century European Intellectual History: Excavating the Early

After a quick look at the antecedent ideas of key Italian Renaissance writers, this course will focus on
important European thinkers from 1500 to 1600. The goal will be to develop an understanding of ma-
jor changes in human consciousness between the time of Machiavelli, at the beginning of this period,
and Montaigne and Shakespeare, at its end. Through discussions based largely on original sources, we
shall explore how such writers as Erasmus, More, Luther, Calvin, Bodin, Rabelais and others-seen
within the context of their time and place-transformed the terms in which Europeans viewed them-
selves and their role in the world.

movements of the sixteenth century that resulted in the division of Latin Christendom into two com-
peting traditions, catholic and protestant. First, we will investigate the religious histories of these
movements, examining such topics as the magisterial reformers (Luther, Zwingli, Calvin); the "radi-
cal Reformation"; and the Catholic resurgence and Counter Reformation. Second, we will study the
varied effects of these religious movements on early modern European politics, society, and culture.
Topics here will include the Peasant Revolution of 1525; the Wars of Religion; the formation of the
state and "social discipline"; and the impact of the Reformations on gender relations.

HIST 332(S) Witchcraft in Early Modern Europe
Historians estimate that between the fifteenth and eighteenth centuries some 50,000 women, men, and
children were executed in Europe for practicing witchcraft. Yet, scholars remain divided on how to accu-
rately account for this remarkable phenomenon. This course rests on two assumptions regarding early
modern European witchcraft beliefs and prosecutions: first, that they resist one single explanation, and,
second, that they must be seen as an integral part of European society rather than a strange aberration.
Thus, utilizing primary and secondary sources, we will examine how the peoples of early modern Eu-
rope--rich and poor, lay and religious, female and male, educated and uneducated, rural and urban--ex-
perienced witchcraft in their lives. As we proceed, we will pay close attention to the ways in which the
witchcraft phenomenon can inform our historical perspective on such issues as gender relationships, "pop-
ular" and "elite" religion, modern state formation, demonology, magic, and other important topics.
Format: discussion/lecture. Requirements: class participation, three short essays (3-5 pages), a research pa-

HIST 337(S) Ideology and Politics in Europe 1900-1939
In this post-cold war age in the West, when liberal democracy can be heralded to represent "the end of
history," in the sense that liberal democratic political and economic forms represent the apogee of
human organization, and when politics have seemingly become even more "non-ideological," it is
easy to assume the inevitability of the rise of liberal democracy in Europe. But especially in the first
half of the twentieth century, above all in the interwar years, the predominance of liberal democracy
appeared anything but assured. Indeed, many saw it as a spent force: an archaic set of ideas and prin-
ciples belonging to the previous century. In a number of countries, what appeared most vibrant, inno-
vative, modern-able to transcend the perceived political, social, economic and cultural malaise-were
above all Marxism and fascism. Drawing on primary as well as secondary sources, and using an initial
examination of both the ideals and the practices of liberal democracy in interwar Europe as a base, this
course will explore the political and social ideas and concepts that gave rise to Marxist and fascist
ideologies in the early twentieth-century Europe, the social and cultural visions projected by their re-
spective proponents, and the societies that they created in practice.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, several short papers, and a

HIST 338(S) The History of the Holocaust
In twenty-first century America, the murder of approximately six million European Jews by Nazi
Germany remains a central event in our political, moral, and cultural universe. Nevertheless, the Ho-
locaust still confounds historians' efforts to understand both the motivations of the perpetrators and
the suffering of the victims. In this course, we will study the origins and implementation of the Holo-
caust from the divergent perspectives of perpetrators and victims. Our goal will be to investigate deep-
ly the interaction of individual lives and world historical events. We will also examine the Holocaust
within the larger context of the history of World War II in Europe and the historians' debates about
Germany's exterminatory war aims. Course materials will include diaries, bureaucratic documents,
memoirs, films, and historical scholarship.

HIST 371(S) American Environmental Politics (Same as Environmental Studies 371)
The politics surrounding the environment today are a super-heated source of conflict, at the same time
that most opinion polls show that Americans widely embrace many environmental protections. While
environmental concerns have long been a part of local politics in America, this course will largely
explore the emergence and prominence of environmental issues in national politics, from the first or-
ganized conservation efforts in the late-nineteenth century to the present-day concerns with the global
environment. Throughout the course we will investigate both how changes in the environment have
shaped American politics and how political decisions have altered the American--an even world-
wide--environment.
Evaluation will be based on class participation, weekly critical writing, an analytical essay, and a final
exam.

HIST 372(S) (formerly 313) The Rise of American Business
An examination of the complex process that saw business enterprise move from a marginal position in
the largely agrarian society of the early colonial period to become, by the twentieth century, one of the
principal forces shaping American culture. Subjects to be considered: the business and political acti-
vities of colonial merchants, early-American attempts at industrialization, the business careers of
John D. Rockefeller and Andrew Carnegie, and the growth, since 1900, of multidivisional corpora-
tions like DuPont and General Motors. Readings will include historical studies, biography, autobiog-
raphy, and fiction.
Format: discussion. Students will write a series of short analytical papers and will have the choice of
either writing a longer, final essay or taking a final exam.
Enrollment limit: 25 (expected: 20-25). Open to sophomores and also to first-year students with Ad-
vanced Placement Credit in American History.

HIST 377(S) Women and Religion in American History (Same as Religion 377 and
Women's and Gender Studies 377)
This course explores the role religious belief has played in women's lives and how women have
shaped religion in America, from the colonial period to the present. We will examine a wide range of
religious belief, including Catholicism, Islam, Judaism, Mormonism, Protestantism, Spiritualism,
and female theologies, and look at women of various ethnic backgrounds, including African Ameri-
can, Native American, Anglo, and immigrant. We will look for ways in which attention to women
may change traditional narratives of religious history, and ways in which looking at religious belief
can add to our understanding of women's history. Some problems we will consider include the rela-
tion of religion to reform, understanding women in conservative religious traditions, and the connec-
tion between religious belief and issues of sexuality. We will explore the ways religion has served to
empower women, and conversely, how it has served to limit women's opportunities. And we will
probe how a serious consideration of women's religious commitment can complicate these catego-
ries.
Format: discussion/lecture.
Requirements: informed participation, several short papers (2-3 pages), and a longer review paper

This course examines the impact of the global economy on Latinas from 1945 to the present. Using
the garment industry as an example of a labor intensive industry that has gone global, we will ask a
series of questions regarding the impact on Latinas in their countries of origin and in urban areas in the
United States. What impact has the global economy and economic development had on Latinas' work
and their households in their countries of origin? How have economic changes and government poli-
cies fostered Latinas' migrations? How have Latinas been incorporated into the changing U.S. econo-
my? How have Latinas confronted the challenges created by a globalizing economy? Broadly com-
parative, this course includes Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, and Dominican women, as well as other

This course explores the history of Atlantic Slavery in the contexts of the Spanish, French, Dutch, and
British colonizations of the Caribbean and North America from the early sixteenth century to the late
eighteenth century. Based on our reading of primary and secondary material, we will seek to under-
stand the origins and transformation of the various forms of enslavement that emerged in association
with the rise of Euro-American empires. Why did racial slavery become an institution in all the Euro-
pean empires of the North Atlantic? How did different European colonial powers justify the enslave-
ment of Native peoples and Africans? How can we account for the diverse forms that slavery assumed
in the region? To what extent can we talk of a typically Spanish, French, British, or Dutch form of
colonial slavery? What were the factors shaping the individual experiences of slaves in Euro-Ameri-
can colonies?

HIST 402(F) African Political Thought (Same as African and Middle Eastern Studies 402)*
This course examines the ideas of major figures in the progressive tradition of African political
thought. This emancipatory tradition emerged in societies shaped by racial, cultural, and economic
exploitation, forcing both African men and women to address questions of identity and political ac-
tion. Most members of this tradition also considered the ways in which uneven power relations within
African communities shaped the personal and political landscapes. The Africans we will examine in
this course drew on resources as varied as Pan-Africanism, Nationalism, Classical Liberalism, Social
Democracy, Marxism, Black Consciousness, Negritude and Gender theory, yet each participated, at
least implicitly, in a common African intellectual project: the meaning of Africa and of being African.

tion of primary and secondary material, we will examine the variety of responses (political, intellectu-
al and cultural) to questions of modernization from the first response to European imperialism, to le-
gal reform, to the rise of nationalism, to contemporary varieties of Islamism in the Middle East. The
focus is on the intellectual, institutional and cultural threats posed by the process of modernization,
particularly to political elites and the religious establishment. We will approach this topic compara-

HIST 425(S) The First Crusade (Same as Religion 215) (W)
The First Crusade (1095-1131) was one of the most remarkable episodes in the history of the Middle
Ages. Responding to the call of Pope Urban II, a mass movement of armed pilgrims marched almost
2000 miles from western Europe to the Holy Land to reconquer Jerusalem from Turkish invaders. In
the eyes of these crusaders, they were undertaking a Christian pilgrimage and penitential war through
which they hoped to win salvation, glory, and treasure. In the eyes of others, however, the crusaders
were savage barbarians who understood little of the sophisticated civilizations they encountered and
who butchered innocent Jews, Muslims, and fellow Christians in God's name. This seminar explores
the origins, course, and impact of the First Crusade from social, cultural, theological, political, eco-
nomic, and military perspectives. Special attention will be given to analyzing, comparing, and con-
trasting different accounts of the First Crusade--not only those of western Christians, but also of
Jews, Byzantine Greeks, Muslims, and other witnesses. Through this study of the First Crusade, we
will examine one of the defining events of the Middle Ages and uncover the roots of much ethnic,
religious, and political conflict in our modern world.

HIST 435(F) A Comparative History of the First World War
The old saw "the twentieth century began in 1914" may seem tired, but, this course argues, it is not
only apposite, but merely hints at the enormous political, social, economic, and cultural importance of
the First World War for the combatant countries, and many non-combatant countries as well. To this
day, in countries such as France and Great Britain, even after the horrendous experience of the Second
World War, to speak of "the Great War" is to speak of the First World War. This course will thus ex-
amine the deep cultural resonance of the war that informs the books, films and television programs of
today, just as it did--though in different ways--the literature and art during and after the war. Yet the
course is not just a cultural enquiry. It aims to be "totalistic," examining equally the military, political,
economic, and social issues arising from the war. In this sense, the comparative perspective is critical:
to entertain thematically the broad issues in order to gain a greater perspective, but also to be aware of
the historical contexts of each combatant country. We will survey secondary and primary sources, as
well as contemporary and subsequent literature, fine arts, and film.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class participation, an oral presentation, three short pa-
pers, and a research paper.
Enrollment limit: 15. Preference will be given to History majors.

HIST 440(F) Reform, Revolution, Terror: Russia, 1900-1939 (W)
The Russian Revolution of 1917 and the establishment of the Soviet Union are among the most im-
portant and influential events of the twentieth century. Not surprisingly, almost every aspect of the
Revolution and the emergence of the Soviet system has aroused intense controversy, from the origins
of these events and processes, to their character and the forces driving them, to the nature and meaning
of their outcome. The purpose of this seminar is to enable students to explore the sources and process
of revolution in early twentieth-century Russia and the controversies the Revolution continues to pro-
voke through both common readings and a substantial independent research project. Class meetings,
therefore, will be devoted initially to the discussion of common readings intended to familiarize stu-
dents with the main aspects and interpretations of the Revolution (defined broadly as the period from
roughly 1900 to 1939), and then to helping students with their research. Topics for general discussion
will include the prospects for non-revolutionary change prior to 1914; the substance and significance
of Marxist-Leninist ideology and Bolshevik political culture; the interplay of social, political, ideo-
logical, and cultural forces in shaping the revolution and the new Soviet order; the process of cultural
revolution; and the origins and nature of Stalin's "revolution from above" and the "Great Terror" of
1937-1939. Research topics will be chosen by each student in consultation with the instructor and can

concern any aspect of Russian history during the revolutionary era.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on several short preliminary writing assignments, a final
research paper, oral presentations in class, and class participation. Although the common readings in
the seminar will be in English, the research project will provide an opportunity for students with read-
ing knowledge of Russian to use their language skills if they wish to do so.

HIST 452(S) Comparative Colonialism: The European Empires of North America,
1500-1800*
In the minds of most Americans, the history of "colonial America" is synonymous with the history of
the thirteen Anglo-American colonies that would eventually become the United States. Images of Pu-
ritan settlers and Virginia planters dominate the popular perception of European colonialism in North
America. That most of North America was actually claimed by French, Spanish, and Dutch colonists
often remains unexamined.
This course is designed to expand our understanding of European colonialism in North America
through a comparative study of the origins and development of the British, Spanish, French, and
Dutch North American empires. Each week, we will read and discuss a combination of primary and
secondary sources related to a particular theme. Our themes will include: the early rhetoric of Euro-
pean exploration and colonization; the variety and complexity of European-Indian relations; colonial
systems of government; religious and secular institutions; colonial slave systems; gender and race
relations.
In addressing these themes our objective will be to probe the distinctiveness of each European colo-
nial system and to assess the extent to which Europeans, Indians, and uprooted Africans shared a com-
mon history during the early modern period.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class participation, weekly response papers, a research

This course will explore the social, economic, and cultural lives of three cities, each of which at its
zenith seemed to contemporaries to represent definitive aspects of "American" development. We will
begin with Boston--the country's first "big" city and the nominal capital of Puritan New England--in
the colonial and early national periods. From there we will move to Chicago, the transportation and
commercial hub of the emerging national economy in the nineteenth century. Finally we will turn to
Los Angeles, "The City of Dreams" and the center of the popular entertainment industry in the twen-
History
­ 209 ­
tieth century. In each case, drawing on a variety of sources, we will examine the city's origins, the
factors that promoted its growth, and the distinctive society it engendered. Then we will consider
some of the city's cultural expressions--expressions that seem to characterize not only changing the
nature of urban life, but the particular meanings each city gave to the nation's experience at the time.
What made these cities seem simultaneously, as they did, so alluring and so threatening to the fabric of
national community and identity?
Format: seminar. Written work in the course will consist of two short papers and a longer essay ana-
lyzing selected primary texts. There will be no hour test or final exam.

HISTORY OF SCIENCE
(Div. II & III, see course descriptions)
Chair, Professor DONALD deB. BEAVER
Professor: D. BEAVER. Advisory Committee: Professors: D. BEAVER, V. HILL**.
A major in the History of Science is not offered, but the occasional Contract Major in it or a related
interdisciplinary field is possible. Courses in the History of Science are designed primarily to comple-
ment and strengthen work in other major fields. Although any of the courses may be taken separately,
studying related courses in other departments will enhance their value, because by nature, History of
Science is interdisciplinary.
The following will serve as examples: the 101 course is an introduction to science and technology
studies, and concentrates on key aspects of contemporary science and technology relevant to many
issues of living in a technological society. Scientific Revolutions (HSCI 224) deals with the emergence
of modern science in the 1600s and 1700s, and with subsequent revolutions in scientific thought; as
such it complements courses related to modern European history. Technology and Culture (HSCI
305), an introduction to the history of technology, offers materials which support work in a wide vari-
ety of fields: environmental studies, political science, history, philosophy, and the sciences. History of
Science 240 traces the influential role of science and invention in the shaping of American culture,
and complements offerings in American Studies and American History. HSCI 320, an historical over-
view of the ideas, practice, and organization of medicine, provides context for related coursework in
History, Philosophy, and the Premed Program.
HSCI 101(F) Science, Technology, and Human Values (Same as Science and Technology
Studies 101)
A study of the natures and roles of science and technology in today's society, and of the problems
which technical advances pose for human values. An introduction to science-technology studies.
Topics include: scientific creativity, the Two Cultures, the norms and values of science, the Manhattan
Project and Big Science, the ethics and social responsibility of science, appropriate technology,
technology assessment, and various problems which spring from dependencies engendered by living
in a technological society, e.g., computers and privacy, automation and dehumanization, biomedical

HSCI 224(S) Scientific Revolutions: 1543-1927
How much does science create the sensibilities and values of the modern world? How much, if any,
technical detail is it necessary to know in order to understand the difference between propaganda and
fact?
This course investigates four major changes of world view, associated with Copernicus (1543); New-
ton (1687); Darwin (1859); and Planck (1900) and Einstein (1905). It also treats briefly the emergence
of modern cosmogony, geology, and chemistry as additional reorganizations of belief about our ori-
gins, our past, and our material structure.
We first acquire a basic familiarity with the scientific use and meaning of the new paradigms, as they
emerged in historical context. We then ask how those ideas fit together to form a new framework, and
ask what their trans-scientific legacy has been, that is, how they have affected ideas and values in other
sciences, other fields or thought, and in society.
Knowledge of high-school algebra is presupposed.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on five problem sets, two short papers (3-5
pages), and two hour exams.

The interaction of science, technology, and society in the nineteenth century did much to form Ameri-
can identity: the machine in the garden, through the "American System of Manufactures" helped
America rise to technological prominence; the professionalization and specialization of science and
engineering led to their becoming vital national resources. Understanding these developments, as
well as the heroic age of American invention (1865-1914), forms the focus of this course: how science
and technology have helped shape modern American life.

A study of the growth and development of medical thought and practice, together with consideration
of its interaction with science and social forces and institutions. The course aims at an appreciation of
the socio-historical construction of Western medicine, from prehistory to the twentieth century. The
course begins with paleomedical reconstructions, and moves to Babylonian, Egyptian and Greek [not
only Hippocratic] medicine, Greek and Roman anatomy and physiology, Arabic medical thought,
Renaissance medicine, and the gradual professionalization and specialization of medicine from the
sixteenth century. Attention is paid to theories of health and disease, ideas about anatomy and physiol-
ogy, in addition to achievements such as anesthesia and internal surgery, and advances in instruments
such as obstetrical forceps and the stethoscope.
Format: seminar. Requirements: two papers (8-10 pages), midterm and final.

both to interdisciplinary conceptual focus and experimental pedagogical form. It provides support for
faculty and student efforts to develop a curriculum that creatively responds to intellectual needs and
modes of teaching/learning that currently fall outside the conventional pattern.

With the rapid spread of electronic, telematic and virtual technologies, the very conditions of experi-
ence as well as the social, economic, and political structures of our world are undergoing radical trans-
formation. The media hype about new technologies obscures contribution that modern and postmod-
ern artistic practices have anticipated and promoted many of these changes. In this course, we will
attempt to come to a better understanding of cyberspace by approaching this new territory from the
perspective of art, philosophy and religion. Issues to be considered include: the changing role of the
avant-garde, the relation between post-industrial capitalism and postmodernism, performance, post-
modern architecture, gender and technology, the cultural implications of television, video, computers,
internet, hypertext, artificial life, and virtual reality. The course also involves a Media Lab in which
students will learn how to navigate in dataspace as well as how to create hypertext, artificial life, and
virtual reality. The course also involves a Media Lab in which students will learn how to create hyper-
texts that use sounds, images and videos.

INTR 259(F) Culture, Society and Disease
Disease is one of the basic forces behind the growth, shape and vitality of human societies. Recogniz-
ing that understanding the effects of disease upon culture and society requires an approach that tran-
scends traditional academic disciplines, this course will examine the nature and importance of disease
from several perspectives. Focusing on the intersection of biology, economics and cultural study, we
will confront some of the most difficult and important issues of our time. How do we decide which
diseases deserve the resources required for vaccine development? Who gets the vaccine? In other
words, who lives, and who dies? How do we decide the value of a human life? How do we understand
and heal the wounds, individual and cultural, deriving from our confrontation with disease--with the
AIDS epidemic, for instance? In what ways has disease, as an agent of change, been a beneficial force
in our history? How do we define "health"? What, exactly, is disease? In exploring these issues, we
will use a number of different formats, including lecture, discussion, tutorial sessions, and guest lec-
turers. Texts studied will range from the scientific to the literary, and might include formal academic
papers, poetry, plays, films, historical works and cultural studies.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation: class participation, several short papers, and a final essay.
Prerequisites: Economics 101 or 110 or 120; Biology 101 or Chemistry 115 or Biology AP5; 100-lev-

INTR 333(F) Money (Same as Religion 333)
What is money? Where is money? Does money exist? We live in a culture obsessed with money but,
when we pause to think about it, money becomes very elusive. As the medium of exchange has
morphed from things, to precious metals, to paper, to electronic bits, currency has undergone a pro-
cess of dematerialization or virtualization. While few would deny the "reality" of money, what that
reality is and how it works its material effects is difficult to determine. To understand money, econom-
ic analysis is necessary but not sufficient; it is also necessary to examine the complex problem of rep-
resentation as it is articulated in philosophy, psychology, art, and religion. This course will take a thor-
oughly cross-disciplinary approach to the question of money. Works to be considered include: Edgar
Allan Poe, "The Gold Bug," Karl Marx, Capital, Norman O. Brown, Life Against Death, Jean-Joseph
Goux, Symbolic Economies, Georg Simmel, The Philosophy of Money, Jacques Derrida, Counterfeit
Money, Jean Baudrillard, Symbolic Exchange and Death, Lawrence Weschler, Boggs: A Comedy of
Values, George Soros, The Alchemy of Finance and Elinor Solomon, Virtual Money.

INTR 342(S) Science and Religious Experience (Same as Physics 342 and Religion 342)
The natural world seems very different than it did when the world's major religions developed. How
should our developing understanding of the physical world affect our religious experience? Are the
implications of science in conflict with religious concepts? Are science and religious experience en-
tirely separate domains of understanding? Is there useful dialogue between them and perhaps even the
possibility of integration?
We will draw our scientific examples from our current understanding of quantum indeterminism and
non-locality, from cosmology, and from evolutionary biology. Following William James, we will in-
terpret religious experience as personal affirmation of the meaning of existence, whether or not
guided by religious institutions. We will explore the relationship of science to religious experience
within the framework of conflict, separation, dialogue and integration developed by Ian Barbour.
Format: lectures, demonstrations, multimedia presentations and discussion. Limited mathematical
treatment of scientific concepts. Requirements: three short papers, a midterm exam, and a final paper.
No course prerequisites except that enrollment preference will be given to juniors and seniors having
some background in science, religion, psychology or philosophy. Enrollment limit: 30.
This course satisfies one semester of the Division II distribution requirement. It is recommended for
students interested in the implications of science for other disciplines, but it may not be used to satisfy
the Division III distribution requirement or the minimum requirements for the Physics major.

Williams offers a variety of courses specifically directed to students interested in Jewish Studies. In
addition, many other courses incorporate topics relevant to the study of Judaism. Students are encour-
aged to integrate courses from diverse disciplines with a focus in Jewish history, religion, literature,
language, and thought. Thus, rather than emphasizing a particular method of inquiry, Jewish Studies
courses bring together students from different departments who share interest in a common topic. As a
result, Jewish subjects are analyzed from a multitude of perspectives (religious, philosophical, politi-
cal, historical, psychological, literary, etc.). Williams offers two types of courses related to Jewish
Studies: Courses directly focusing on Jewish topics and courses partially devoted to some aspect of
Judaism. In order to receive a solid foundation in Jewish Studies, students are strongly encouraged to

Each year, in addition to the regular course offerings listed above, Williams sponsors the Croghan
Bicentennial Visiting Professor in Religion who offers one course in Judaism and/or Christianity. Past
Croghan Professors have taught courses on the Mishnah (Shaye Cohen), the historical Jesus (John
Dominic Crossan), and Ancient Mediterranean Religions (Ross Kraemer).
Overseas Studies
Studying in Israel is highly recommended for students interested in Jewish Studies. Many students

Funding
The Bronfman Fund for Judaic Studies was established in 1980 by Edgar M. Bronfman `50, Samu-
el Bronfman II `75, and Matthew Bronfman `80. The Bronfman Fund provides opportunities for the
Williams community to learn about Jewish history and culture, both within the College's formal cur-
riculum and through the planning of major events on Jewish themes.
The Morris Wiener and Stephen R. Wiener `56 Fund for Jewish Studies was established in 1997
through the estate of Stephen R. Wiener `56. The Wiener gifts have provided an endowment to sup-
port a faculty position in modern Jewish thought, and are used to underwrite an annual lecture, forum
or event relevant to contemporary Jewish life.

Leadership Studies is the exploration of the many facets of leadership in its many domains. The
discipline studies the ways people in groups respond to leaders or emerging leaders--often in a con-
text of conflict between different visions put forth by competing potential leaders. It examines how
interactions between leaders and followers move groups to make decisions and take actions that de-
fine and advance their personal values and goals. Leadership Studies, like leadership itself, is as much
concerned with followers and "followership" as it is with leaders. Importantly, it includes the consid-
eration of the ethical issues raised by the exercise of power, authority, and leadership.
Leadership Studies explores leader behavior and group decision and action at many levels--from
small groups such as a family or team to much larger collectives such as nations or even groups of
nations. It considers these issues in many historical, cultural, and institutional contexts, and in many
domains, including organizations, politics, the arts, sciences, business, mass culture, athletics,
religion, public policy and international cooperation.
To complete the recommended curriculum, students must complete the sequence outlined below (6
courses total). Students interested in developing a contract major in Leadership Studies should consult the
chair of the department.

Advisory Committee: Professors: JACKALL, JACOBSOHN, JUST, L. KAPLAN**, KASSIN, W.
WAGNER. Associate Professor: NOLAN.
Legal Studies is an interdisciplinary program designed to give students a background and frame-
works for understanding the law as a means of regulating human behavior and resolving disputes
among individuals, groups, and governments. Emanating from a liberal arts tradition, and not specifi-
cally aimed at preparing students for law school, this program provides the tools needed to think and
argue critically about how laws work, how they evolved in the course of history and in different parts
of the world, how they are enforced, and how they affect our everyday lives.
The courses in this program address a wide range of subjects, including the philosophical, moral,
historical, social, and political underpinnings of law; the U.S. Constitution; law enforcement and oth-
er aspects of criminal justice; methods of scientific proof; psychological influences on evidence,
trials, and decision-making; cultural perspectives and non-western legal traditions; and the use of law
to regulate environmental policy. Courses are taught by faculty in the Sciences, Social Sciences, and
Humanities, whose work centers on legal processes, and by visiting professors from various law
schools.
THE CONCENTRATION
The concentration in legal studies consists of six courses, including an interdisciplinary introducto-
ry course, four electives taken from at least two departments, and a senior seminar on a contemporary
topic in the law. Electives may vary from year to year according to course offerings. In addition, the
program offers local, alumni, and professional contacts for summer and WSP internships in a wide
range of government and private law-related settings.
REQUIRED COURSES
LGST 101(S) Processes of Adjudication
How are disputes resolved within social systems? Focused on this question, this interdisciplinary
course presents different perspectives on trials and other methods of adjudicating crimes, settling mat-
ters of public policy, and resolving civil disputes among individuals, groups, governments, and orga-
nizations. Topics to be addressed include the historical and Constitutional bases for juries and jury
trials; alternative means of adjudication, as seen in American drug courts and military tribunals; ad-
versarial, inquisitorial, and consensus-building approaches to dispute resolution used in past and non-
western cultures; methods of gathering and evaluating evidence; the role of forensic sciences and
technology.
Format: Lectures and discussion, three hours per week. Evaluation is based on two exams, a 10- to
15-page paper, and class participation. Enrollment limit: 50.

LINGUISTICS (Div. I)
Coordinator: CORNELIUS C. KUBLER
Courses in linguistics enable students to explore language from a variety of perspectives: the inter-
nal workings of language as a system of communication, the role of language in society, the history of
language groups and specific languages, and the applicability of scientific knowledge about language
to various human endeavors.
Linguistics offers neither a major nor a concentration, but its courses complement study in several
other disciplines: Anthropology, Psychology, Sociology, English, Comparative Literature and all the
foreign languages. Anthropology majors can receive major credit for Linguistics 101. Majors in Ger-
man Studies may receive major credit for a linguistics course with the special permission of the de-
partment chair.
Knowledge of foreign languages is helpful but not required for Linguistics 101.

Mathematics 312 Abstract Algebra or Mathematics 315 Groups and Characters
Completion (three courses plus colloquium)
The Senior Major Course is any 400-level course taken in the senior year. In exceptional circum-
stances, with the prior permission of the department, a student may be allowed to satisfy the Senior
Major Course requirement in the junior year, provided that the student has completed three 300-lev-
el mathematics courses before enrolling in the Senior Major Course (if it is a statistics seminar, one
of the 300-level courses may be replaced by Statistics 201).

Two electives from courses numbered 300 and above or Statistics 201.
Weekly participation as a senior in the Mathematics Colloquium, in which all senior majors present
talks on mathematical or statistical topics of their choice.
NOTES
In some cases, an appropriate course from another department may be substituted for one of the
electives, with prior permission of the Mathematics and Statistics Department. In any case, at least
eight courses must be taken in mathematics and statistics at Williams. These can, with prior permis-
sion, include courses taken away. Students with transfer credit should contact the department about
special arrangements.
APPLIED MATHEMATICS OR OTHER SCIENCES
Students interested in applied mathematics or other sciences, including economics, should consid-
er Mathematics 209 (formerly MATH 210), 210, 251, 305, 306, 315, 323, 342, 354, 361, 433, or Statis-
tics 201, 231, 346, 442, and additional appropriate courses from outside Mathematics and Statistics,
including possibilities such as Chemistry 301, Computer Science 256, Computer Science 361, Eco-
nomics 255, Physics 201, Physics 202, Physics 210 or more advanced physics courses.
BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Students interested in careers in business or finance should consider Mathematics 170, as well as
courses in statistics and related areas such as Statistics 101, 201, 231, 331, 344, 346, 442, 443. Since
these courses address different needs, students should consult with the instructors to determine which
seem to be most appropriate for individuals.
ENGINEERING
Students interested in engineering should consider the courses for applied mathematics immediate-
ly above, with Mathematics 209 (formerly MATH 210) and 305 especially recommended. Williams
has exchange and joint programs with good engineering schools. Interested students should consult
the section on engineering near the beginning of the Bulletin and the Williams pre-engineering advi-
sor for further information.
GRADUATE SCHOOL IN MATHEMATICS
Students interested in continuing their study of mathematics in graduate school should take Mathe-
matics 301 and 312. Mathematics 302 and 324 are strongly recommended. Many of the 400-level
courses would be useful, particularly ones that involve algebra and analysis. Honors theses are en-
couraged. Reading knowledge of a foreign language (French, German, or Russian) is helpful.
STATISTICS AND ACTUARIAL SCIENCE
Students interested in statistics or actuarial science should consider Mathematics 341, Statistics
201, 231, 331, 346, 442 and Economics 255. Additionally, students should consider taking some
number of the actuarial exams given by the Society of Actuaries, which can constitute part of an hon-
ors program in actuarial studies (see section on honors below).
TEACHING
Students interested in teaching mathematics at the elementary or secondary school level should
consider Mathematics 285, 313, 325, 381, Statistics 201 and practice as a tutor or teaching assistant.
Winter study courses that provide a teaching practicum are also highly recommended.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN MATHEMATICS/STATISTICS
The degree with honors in Mathematics/Statistics is awarded to the student who has demonstrated
outstanding intellectual achievement in a program of study which extends beyond the requirements of
the major. The principal considerations for recommending a student for the degree with honors will
be: Mastery of core material and skills, breadth and, particularly, depth of knowledge beyond the core
material, ability to pursue independent study of mathematics or statistics, originality in methods of
investigation, and, where appropriate, creativity in research.
An honors program normally consists of two semesters and a WSP (031) of independent research,
culminating in a thesis and a presentation. Under certain circumstances, the honors work can consist
of coordinated study involving a regular course and one semester plus a WSP (030) of independent
study, culminating in a "minithesis" and a presentation. At least one semester should be in addition to
the major requirements.
An honors program in actuarial studies requires significant achievement on four appropriate ex-
aminations of the Society of Actuaries and giving a second colloquium talk. Written work is a possible
component.
Highest honors will be reserved for the rare student who has displayed exceptional ability, achieve-
ment or originality. Such a student usually will have written a thesis, or pursued actuarial honors and
written a minithesis. An outstanding student who writes a minithesis, or pursues actuarial honors and
writes a paper, might also be considered.
Mathematics and Statistics
­ 221 ­
Prospective honors students are urged to consult with their departmental advisor at the time of reg-
istration in the spring of the sophomore or at the beginning of the junior year to arrange a program of
study that could lead to the degree with honors. By the time of registration during spring of the junior
year, the student must have requested a faculty member to be honors advisor and must have obtained
the department's approval of formal admission to the honors program. Such approval depends on both
the record and the promise of the applicant. It is conditional on continuing progress.
The recommendation for honors is usually announced at the end of the spring term. Participation in
the honors program does not guarantee a recommendation for honors. The decision is based not only
on successful completion of the honors program but also on the merit of the student's overall record in
mathematics. If the student completes the program during the fall or winter study, the decision may be
announced at the beginning of the spring term, conditional on continuing merit.
ADVANCED PLACEMENT
The Mathematics and Statistics Department attempts to place each student who elects a mathemat-
ics course in that course best suited to the student's preparation and goals. The suggested placement in
an appropriate calculus course is determined by the results of the Advanced Placement Examination
(AB or BC) if the student took one, and any additional available information. A student who receives a
3, 4, or 5 on the BC examination or a 4 or 5 on the AB examination is ordinarily placed in Mathematics
105. A student who receives a 1 or 2 on the BC examination or a 2 or 3 on the AB examination is
ordinarily placed in Mathematics 104. Students who have had calculus in high school, whether or not
they took the Advanced Placement Examination, are barred from Mathematics 103 unless they obtain
permission from the instructor. Students who take an Advanced Placement Exam in statistics should
consult the department for placement. In any event, students registering for mathematics and statistics
courses are urged to consult with members of the department concerning appropriate courses and
placement. In general, students are encouraged to enroll in the most advanced course for which they
are qualified: it is much easier to drop back than to jump forward. The department reserves the right to
refuse registration in any course for which the student is determined to be over-prepared.
GENERAL REMARKS
Divisional Requirements
All courses may be used to satisfy this requirement.
Alternate Year Courses
Core courses Mathematics 301, 305, 312, and 315 are normally offered every year. Other 300-level
courses may be offered in alternate years. Senior seminars (400-level courses) are normally offered
every two to four years. Students should check with the department before planning far into the future.
Course Admission
Courses are normally open to all students meeting the prerequisites. Students with questions about
the level at which courses are conducted are invited to consult members of the department.
Course Descriptions
Descriptions of the courses in Statistics follow the descriptions of Mathematics courses. More de-
tailed information on all of the offerings in the department is available in the Informal Guide to Mathe-
matics Courses at Williams that can be obtained at the departmental office.
Courses Open on a Pass/Fail Basis
Students taking a mathematics or statistics course on a pass/fail basis must meet all the require-
ments set for students taking the course on a graded basis.
With the permission of the department, any course offered by the department may be taken on a
pass/fail basis. Permission will not be given to mathematics majors to meet any of the requirements of
the major or honors degree on this basis. However, with the permission of the department, courses
taken in the department beyond those requirements may be taken on a pass/fail basis.
Graduate School Requirements
An increasing number of graduate and professional schools require mathematics and statistics as a
prerequisite to admission or to attaining their degree. Students interested in graduate or professional
training in business, medicine, economics, or psychology are advised to find out the requirements in
those fields early in their college careers.
MATHEMATICS COURSES
Note: Statistics course listings follow the Mathematics course listings.
MATH 100(F) Quantitative Studies
This course is intended for all students--(first-year students and upperclass students)--who want to
strengthen their basic arithmetic and algebraic skills, and to understand the central concepts of ele-
mentary mathematics. Topics will include: signed numbers, fractions, decimals, percentages, expo-
nents, logarithms, scientific notation, polynomials, algebraic fractions, linear and quadratic equa-
Mathematics and Statistics
­ 222 ­
tions, and graphing. Concepts will be stressed in classroom lectures and discussions; techniques will
be developed through daily assignments.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on performance on quizzes and exams.
Prerequisite: permission of the instructor.
Depending on his or her performance on the diagnostic test administered at the beginning of the aca-
demic year, a student may be required to take Mathematics 100 or Mathematics 101 as a prerequisite
for Biology 101, Chemistry 151, Chemistry 153, Chemistry 155, Computer Science 134, Economics
110 or 120, Mathematics 103, Statistics 101, or Physics 131, 141. However, a student need not be
planning to take one of these additional courses in order to take Mathematics 100 or 101. No enroll-
ment limit (expected: 6).

MATH 101(F,S) Pre-Calculus
The elementary functions--algebraic, logarithmic, and trigonometric--from both a graphical and
analytic point of view.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on homework, quizzes, and/or exams.
Prerequisite: permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 15 (expected: 15).
Hour: 11:00-11:50 MWF, 12:00-12:50 MWF First Semester: S. JOHNSON
12:00-12:50 MWF Second Semester: CHKHENKELI
MATH 103(F,S) Calculus I (Q)
Calculus permits the computation of velocities and other instantaneous rates of change by a limiting
process called differentiation. The same process also solves "max-min" problems: how to maximize
profit or minimize pollution. A second limiting process, called integration, permits the computation of
areas and accumulations of income or medicines. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus provides a
useful and surprising link between the two processes. Subtopics include trigonometry, exponential
growth, and logarithms. This is an introductory course for students who have not seen calculus before.
Students who have previously taken a calculus course may not enroll in MATH 103 without the per-
mission of the instructor.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on homework, quizzes, and/or exams.
Prerequisite: Mathematics 101 (or demonstrated proficiency on a diagnostic test; see Mathematics
101). No enrollment limit (expected: fall, 60; spring 50). This is a quantitative/formal reasoning
course.
Hour: 12:00-12:50 MWF First Semester: CHKHENKELI
11:00-11:50 MWF Second Semester: WITTWER
MATH 104(F,S) Calculus II (Q)
Mastery of calculus requires understanding how integration computes areas and business profit and
acquiring a stock of techniques. Further methods solve equations involving derivatives ("differential
equations") for population growth or pollution levels. Exponential and logarithmic functions and trig-
onometric and inverse functions play an important role. This course is the right starting point for stu-
dents who have seen derivatives, but not necessarily integrals, before. Students who have received the
equivalent of advanced placement of AB 4 or BC 3 may not enroll in Mathematics 104 without the
permission of the instructor. Students who have higher advanced placement must enroll in Mathemat-
ics 105 or above.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on homework, quizzes, and/or exams .
Prerequisite: Mathematics 103 or equivalent. No enrollment limit (expected:fall, 70; spring, 50). This
is a quantitative/formal reasoning course.

MATH 105(F,S) Multivariable Calculus (Q)
Applications of calculus in mathematics, science, economics, psychology, the social sciences, in-
volve several variables. This course extends calculus to several variables: vectors, partial derivatives,
multiple integrals. There is also a unit on infinite series, sometimes with applications to differential
equations. This course is the right starting point for students who have seen differentiation and in-
tegration before. Students with the equivalent of advanced placement of AB 4, BC 3 or above should
enroll in Mathematics 105.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on homework, quizzes, and/or exams.
Prerequisite: Mathematics 104 or equivalent, such as satisfactory performance on an Advanced
Placement Examination. No enrollment limit (expected: 45). This is a quantitative/formal reasoning
course.

MATH 143(F) Elementary Statistics and Data Analysis (See Statistics 101) (Q)
MATH 170(S) Mathematics of Finance (Q)
This course investigates the mathematics underlying various problems that arise in personal, consum-
er, and business finance. Topics include simple and compound interest, periodic loans (such as home
Mathematics and Statistics
­ 223 ­
mortgages and auto loans), present value, future value, bank discounting and rediscounting, amortiza-
tion, sinking funds, corporate and municipal bonds, perpetual annuities, taxes (including itemization),
life annuities, depreciation, inflation, and the basic mechanics of life insurance. Students are required
to carry out several spreadsheet projects; instruction on the use of these systems is provided as needed.
Although the course does not prepare students for the examinations of the Society of Actuaries, it is
basically actuarial in approach, not a course in "how to invest."
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on performance in class quizzes, spreadsheet ex-
ercises, and exams.
Prerequisite: Mathematics 103 or equivalent. Not open to first-year students. Not open to junior or
senior Mathematics majors except by permission of the instructor. Not open on a pass/fail basis. En-
rollment limit:42 (expected: 42). This is a quantitative/formal reasoning course.

MATH 209(S)(formerly MATH 210) Differential Equations and Vector Calculus (Q)
Historically, much beautiful mathematics has arisen from attempts to explain heat flow, chemical
reactions, biological processes, or magnetic fields. A few ingenious techniques solve a surprisingly
large fraction of the associated ordinary and partial differential equations. The mystical Pythagorean
fascination with ratios and harmonics is vindicated and applied in Fourier series and integrals. Inte-
grating vectorfields over surfaces applies equally to blood flow, gravity, and differential geometry.
Format: lectures/discussion, three hours a week; problem sets. Evaluation will be based on problem
sets, hour tests, and a final exam.
Prerequisite: Mathematics 105. No enrollment limit (expected: 31). Students may not normally get
credit for both Mathematics 209 and Mathematics/ Physics 210. This is a quantitative/formal reason-
ing course.

MATH 210(S) Mathematical Methods for Scientists (Same as Physics 210) (Q)
(See under Physics for full description.)
MATH 211(F,S) Linear Algebra (Q)
Many social, political, economic, biological, and physical phenomena can be described, at least
approximately, by linear relations. In the study of systems of linear equations one may ask: When does
a solution exist? When is it unique? How does one find it? How can one interpret it geometrically?
This course develops the theoretical structure underlying answers to these and other questions and
includes the study of matrices, vector spaces, linear independence and bases, linear transformations,
determinants and inner products. Course work is balanced between theoretical and computational,
with attention to improving mathematical style and sophistication.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on homework and exams.
Prerequisite: Mathematics 105 or 209 or 210 or 251, or Statistics 201. No enrollment limit (expected:

MATH 251(F,S) Discrete Mathematics (Q)
As a complement to calculus, which is the study of continuous processes, this course focuses on the
discrete, including finite sets and structures, their properties and applications. Topics will include ba-
sic set theory, graph theory, logic, counting, recursion, and functions. The course serves as an
introduction not only to these and other topics but also to the methods and styles of mathematical
proof.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on performance on homework and exams.
Prerequisites: Mathematics 104 or Mathematics 103 with Computer Science 134 or one year of high
school calculus with permission of instructor.No enrollment limit (expected: fall, 35; spring; 20). This

The real and complex number systems. Elementary topology of the real line and plane. Functions of a
single variable: limits, continuity, differentiability, the Riemann and Riemann-Stieltjes integrals. Se-
quences, series and uniform convergence. Elementary topology of metric spaces and functions on
metric spaces with emphasis on R.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on performance on problem assignments, pro-
jects, and exams.
Prerequisite: Mathematics 105, 211 or permission of instructor. No enrollment limit (expected: 25).
This is a quantitative/formal reasoning course.
Hour: 10:00-10:50 MWF O. BEAVER
MATH 302(S) Complex Analysis (Q)
The calculus of complex-valued functions turns out to have unexpected simplicity and power. As an
example of simplicity, every complex-differentiable function is automatically infinitely differenti-
able. As examples of power, the so-called "residue calculus" permits the computation of "impossible"
integrals, and "conformal mapping" reduces physical problems on very general domains to problems
on the round disc. The easiest proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, not to mention the first
proof of the Prime Number Theorem, used complex analysis.
Evaluation will be based primarily on classwork, homework, and exams.
Prerequisite: Mathematics 301 or 305. (With prior permission of the instructor, senior math/stat ma-
jors may take Math 302 as a Senior Seminar. Such students will delve more deeply into the material
and should expect additional assignments, projects and/or papers.)
This is a quantitative/formal reasoning course.

MATH 305(S) Applied Real Analysis (Q)
In this course, we will take a more rigorous look at the limit, the integral, and how they interact. This
will give us the background to explore Fourier series and possibly Fourier integrals. Fourier series are
fundamental in the study of many differential equations, such as the wave equation and the heat equa-
tion.

MATH 312(S) Abstract Algebra (Q)
Algebra gives us the tools to solve equations. Sets such as the integers or real numbers have special
properties which make algebra work or not work according to the circumstances. In this course, we
generalize algebraic processes and the sets upon which they operate in order to better understand,
theoretically, when equations can and cannot be solved. We define and study the abstract algebraic
structures called groups, rings and fields, as well as the concepts of factor group, quotient ring, homo-
morphism, isomorphism, and various types of field extensions.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on problem sets and exams.
Prerequisites: Mathematics 211 and one or more of the following: Mathematics 209 (formerly MATH

MATH 316(F) Protecting Information: Applications of Abstract Algebra and Quantum
Physics (Same as Physics 316) (Q)
Living in the early decades of the information age, we find ourselves depending more and more on
codes that protect messages against either noise or eavesdropping. We begin this course by studying
the history of this subject, including, for example, the story of the enigma code from World War II. We
then examine some of the most important codes currently being used to protect information, including
linear codes, which in addition to being mathematically elegant are the most practical codes for error
correction, and the RSA public key cryptographic scheme, popular nowadays for internet applica-
tions. Looking ahead by a decade or more, we show how a "quantum computer" could crack any RSA
code in short order, and how quantum cryptographic devices will achieve security through the Hei-
senberg uncertainty principle. Evaluation will be based on homework sets and exams.
Prerequisites: Phys 210 or Math 211 (possibly concurrent) or permission of the instructors. (Students
not satisfying the course prerequisites but who have completed Math 209 or Math 251 are particularly
encouraged to ask to be admitted.)
This is a quantitative/formal reasoning course.
Hour: 11:00-11:50 MWF LOEPP and WOOTTERS
MATH 321(S) Knot Theory (Q)
Take a piece of string, tie a knot in it, and glue the ends together. The result is a knotted circle, known
as a knot. For the last 100 years, mathematicians have studied knots, asking such questions as, "Given
a nasty tangled knot, how do you tell if it can be untangled without cutting it open?" Some of the most
interesting advances in knot theory have occurred in the last ten years.
This course is an introduction to the theory of knots. Among other topics, we will cover methods of
knot tabulation, surfaces applied to knots, polynomials associated to knots, and relationships between
knot theory and chemistry and physics. In addition to learning the theory, we will look at open prob-
lems in the field.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based on problem sets, midterms, and a final exam.

MATH 326(F) Counterexamples in Topology (Q)
Two geometric objects are topologically the same when one object can be bent and twisted, but not
ripped, into another one. Determining when two objects are topologically the same is incredibly diffi-
cult and is still the subject of a tremendous amount of research. The creative process of mathematics
may be described as postulating conjectures and then either proving them, or constructing counter
examples that disprove them. In this course students will study topology through the creative search
for counterexamples. This process is as lively and creative an activity as can be found in mathematics
research. Students will develop their critical reasoning and analytical skills by working in teams on
construction and revision of counterexamples.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based on homework assignments, oral and written presentations,
and exams.
Prerequisites: Mathematics 301, or Mathematics 305 with permission of the instructor, or Mathemat-

MATH 402(S) Measure Theory and Probability (Q)
The study of measure theory arose from the study of stochastic (probabilistic) systems. Applications
of measure theory lie in biology, chemistry, physics as well as in economics. In this course, we devel-
op the abstract concepts of measure theory and ground them in probability spaces. Included will be
Lebesgue and Borel measures, measurable functions (random variables). Lebesgue integration, dis-
tributions, independence, convergence and limit theorems. This material provides good preparation
for graduate studies in mathematics, statistics and economics.
Evaluation will be based primarily on performance on homework assignments and exams.

MATH 415(F) Geometric Group Theory (Q)
Groups were first invented to study symmetry. In this course, the connection between groups and ge-
ometry is initiated by the symmetry groups of the Platonic solids, and then extended to geometric re-
flection groups (spherical, Euclidean, hyperbolic). This naturally leads to beautiful spaces (called
Coxeter complexes) tiled by polygons, polyhedra, and polytopes. Concrete geometric examples will
continually motivate our ideas, as well as provide connections to topology, combinatorics, and phys-
ics.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on problem sets and exams.

MATH 433(F) Mathematical Modeling and Control Theory (Q)
Mathematical modeling is concerned with translating a natural phenomenon into a mathematical
form. In this abstract form the underlying principles of the phenomenon can be carefully examined
and real-world behavior can be interpreted in terms of mathematical shapes. The models we investi-
gate include feedback phenomena, phase locked oscillators, multiple population dynamics, reaction-
diffusion equations, shock waves, morphogenesis, and the spread of pollution, forest fires, and dis-
eases.
Often the natural phenomenon has some aspect we can control- such as how much pollution, electric
charge, or chemotherapeutic agent we put into a river, circuit, or cancer patient. We will investigate
how to operate such controls in order to achieve a specific goal or optimize some interpretation of
performance.
We will employ tools from the fields of differential equations and dynamical systems.
The course is intended for students in the mathematical, physical, and chemical sciences, as well as for
students who are seriously interested in the mathematical aspects of physiology, economics, geology,
biology, and environmental studies.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on performance of problem sets and exams.
Prerequisites: Mathematics 209 (formerly 210) or Physics 210 and Mathematics 301 or 305 or per-

STATISTICS COURSES
STAT 101(F) (formerly MATH 143) Elementary Statistics and Data Analysis (Q)
It is nearly impossible to live in the world today without being inundated with data. Even the most
popular newspapers feature statistics to catch the eye of the passerby, and sports broadcasters over-
whelm the listener with arcane statistics. How do we learn to recognize dishonest or even unintention-
ally distorted representations of quantitative information? How are we to reconcile two medical stud-
ies with seemingly contradictory conclusions? How many observations do we need in order to make a
decision? It is the purpose of this course to develop an appreciation for and an understanding of the
interpretation of data. We will become familiar with the standard tools of statistical inference includ-
ing the t-test, the analysis of variance, and regression, as well as exploratory data techniques. Applica-
tions will come from the real world that we all live in.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on performances on quizzes and exams.
Prerequisite: Mathematics 100 (or demonstrated proficiency on a diagnostic test; see Mathematics
100). Students who have had calculus, and potential Mathematics majors should consider taking Sta-
tistics 201 instead. No enrollment limit (expected: 40). Not open for major credit to junior or senior
Mathematics majors. This is a quantitative/formal reasoning course.
Hour: 11:00-11:50 MWF R. DE VEAUX
STAT 201(S) (formerly MATH 243) Statistics and Data Analysis (Q)
Statistics can be viewed as the art (science?) of turning data into information. Real world decision-
making, whether in business or science is often based on data and the perceived information it con-
tains. Sherlock Holmes, when prematurely asked the merits of a case by Dr. Watson, snapped back,
"Data, data, data! I can't make bricks without clay." In this course, we will study the basic methods by
which statisticians attempt to extract information from data. These will include many of the standard
tools of statistical inference such as the t-test, analysis of variance and linear regression as well as
exploratory and graphical data analysis techniques.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on performance on quizzes and exams.
Prerequisite: Mathematics 105 or equivalent. Students without any calculus background should con-
sider Statistics 101 instead. No enrollment limit (expected: 65). This is a quantitative/formal reason-
ing course.
Hour: 9:00-9:50 MWF R. DE VEAUX
STAT 231(F) (formerly 244) Statistical Design of Experiments (Q)
What does statistics have to do with designing and carrying out experiments? The answer is, surpris-
ingly perhaps, a great deal. In this course, we will study how to design an experiment in order to obtain
the most information from it in the fewest number of observations. The efficient design of experi-
ments is important not only in the sciences: it has been credited for helping Japanese industry achieve
its success. The examples from this course will be primarily from the physical sciences and industry,
but will apply to the biological and to some extent the social sciences as well. The culmination of the
course will be a project where each student designs, carries out, analyzes, and presents an experiment
of interest to him or her.
Evaluation will be based primarily on performance on the project, homework, and exams.
Prerequisite: some knowledge of statistics or permission of instructor. This is a quantitative/formal
reasoning course.

STAT 346(S) Regression and Forecasting (Q)
This course focuses on the building of empirical models through data in order to predict, explain, and
interpret scientific phenomena. The main focus will be on multiple regression as a technique for doing
this. Through no fault of its own, regression analysis has perhaps the most used of all data analysis
methods. We will study both the mathematics of regression analysis and its applications, including a
discussion of the limits to such analyses. The applications will range from predicting the quality of a
vintage of Bordeaux wine from the weather to forecasting stock prices, and will come from a broad
range of disciplines.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on performance on the project, homework, and
exams.

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN MUSIC
Three routes toward honors and highest honors are possible in the Music major:
a. Composition: A Composition thesis must include one major work completed during the senior year, a
portfolio of smaller works completed during the junior and senior years, and a 10- to 15-page discus-
sion of the student's work.
b. Performance: A Performance thesis must include an honors recital given during the spring of the
senior year and a 15- to 20-page discussion of a selection of the works performed. The student's
general performance career will also be considered in determining honors.
c. History, Theory and Analysis, or Ethnomusicology: A written Historical, Theoretical/Analytical, or
Ethnomusicological thesis between 65 and 80 pages in length and an oral presentation based on the
thesis is required. A written thesis should offer new insights based on original research.
To be admitted to the honors program, a student must have at least a 3.3 GPA in Music courses (this
GPA must be maintained in order to receive honors), and have demonstrated ability and experience
through coursework and performance in the proposed thesis area. A 1- to 2-page application to the
honors program, written in consultation with a faculty member, must be made to the chair of Music
before or during spring registration in the junior year.
Honors candidates must enroll in Music 493(F)-W031-494(S) during their senior year. A student
who is highly qualified for honors work, but who, for compelling reasons, is unable to pursue a year-
long project, may petition the department for permission to pursue a thesis over one semester and the
winter study term. If granted, the standards for evaluating the thesis in such exceptional cases would
be identical to those that apply to year-long honors projects. Final submission of the thesis must be
made to the Music Department by April 15 of the senior year. The department's decision to award
honors will be based on the quality of the thesis.
LESSONS
Courses involving individual vocal or instrumental instruction involve extra fees which are subsi-
dized by the department. (See Music 251-258 and Studies in the Musical Art 325, 326, 427, 428). For
further information contact the Department of Music.
________________________________
There are two introductory courses in music at Williams College. The student is urged to read the
descriptions of Music 101 and 103, and to consult the instructors to determine which course will best
assist his or her growth in understanding music.
100-LEVEL COURSES
MUS 101(F) Listening to Music: An Introduction
Intended for non-major students with little or no formal training.
When you listen to music--on the radio, on a CD, at a concert--how much do you really hear? This
course has two goals: to refine listening skills, thus increasing the student's understanding and enjoy-
ment of music, while at the same time providing a survey of the major composers and musical styles
of the Western classical repertory to be encountered in concert halls today. Students will be introduced
to music from the Baroque, Classical, Romantic, and Modern periods, including works by composers
such as Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Brahms, Mahler, and Stravinsky. Genres to be covered include the
symphony, chamber music, opera, song, and choral music. Attendance at selected concerts on campus
required.
Evaluation based on two tests, two concert reports, and a final exam.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 40.

MUS 104(S) Music Theory and Musicianship I (See under "Theory and Musicianship")
NOTE: Prerequisites for Music 106 through 141
For each course, varying degrees of musical experience are necessary. Students may consult with
the instructor or simply attend the first class meeting. (Successful completion of Music 101 automati-
cally qualifies the student for Music 106 through 141.)
MUS 106(S) Opera
An introduction to the history of opera, from the genre's birth c. 1600 to the present. At various points
in its 400-year development, opera has been considered the highest synthesis of the arts, a vehicle for
the social elite, or a form of popular entertainment. Opera's position in European cultural history will
be a primary focus of our inquiry. We will also study the intriguing relationship between text and mu-
sic, aspects of performance and production, and the artistic and social conventions of the operatic
world. The multidimensional nature of opera invites a variety of analytical and critical perspectives,
including those of music analysis, literary studies, feminist interpretations, and political and sociolog-
Music

MUS 109(S) Music for Orchestra
An introductory survey of music written for the symphony orchestra from the Classical period
through the present day. The course will trace the development of orchestral genres such as the sym-
phonic (or tone) poem, suite, variations, ballet music and concert overture, with examples written by
major composers such as Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, Berlioz, Liszt, Mendelssohn, Smetana,
Brahms, Richard Strauss, Elgar, Ravel, Bartok, Crumb, Carter and Joan Tower. Development of the
musical styles since 1780, the place of the composer in society, and the relationship of program music
to the text are among the subjects to be considered. Emphasis on listening.
Format: two lectures per week. Evaluation will be based on two hour-exams or quizzes from listening
assignments and readings, one short paper and a final exam.
No prerequisites. No enrollment limit (expected: 25).
Hour: 2:35-3:50 MR D. MOORE
MUS 110(F) Chamber Music
An introductory survey of chamber music from the early-eighteenth through the twentieth centuries.
Defined for this course as ensemble music for from three to eight players, we will consider string quar-
tets, works for strings and piano, and examples of wind and brass chamber music by Bach, Haydn,
Mozart, Beethoven, Bartok, Mendelssohn, Beach, Hailstork and many others. Several live perform-
ances will be presented in class by faculty and visiting chamber musicians.
Format: two lectures per week. Evaluation will be based on several listening quizzes or short exams, a
paper based on research or listening, and a final exam.
No enrollment limit (expected: 25).
Hour: 9:55-11:10 TR D. MOORE
MUS 111(F) Popular Music: Revolutions in the History of Rock
This course will trace the history of rock music from the 1950s to the present, focusing on those musi-
cians who revolutionized the genre in various periods. Such "revolutions" are discovered in the use of
new sounds and musical forms, in the relationship between lyrics and musical setting, and in the con-
ception of rock's role in society. Three objectives will underpin our studies: to develop listening skills
with music that one often hears, but perhaps rarely listens to intently; to determine in what ways popu-
lar music can be interpreted as reflecting its cultural context; and to encounter the work of several of
the more innovative musicians in the history of rock. Finally we will interrogate our own activities by
asking why the study of the "merely popular" should be pursued in a liberal arts education, whether
new approaches can be developed for this endeavor, and what makes music "popular."
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on two tests, two papers, and a final exam.
No prerequisites or musical background assumed. Enrollment limit: 35.
Hour: 8:30-9:45 TR A. SHEPPARD
MUS 114(S) American Music
This lecture and discussion course focuses on American music in its cultural context. Students will
explore a range of issues concerning music's relation to national and ethnic identity, historical events,
societal conflicts, and philosophical, literary, and artistic movements. The class will study works from
a variety of musical traditions: e.g., Native American, religious, classical, patriotic, blues, jazz, folk,
Broadway, rock, and rap.
Evaluation will be based on class participation, two short papers, a midterm exam, and a final exam.

there is no prerequisite, students are expected to be proficient in reading at least one clef. Stu-
dents should take a placement exam during First Days.
Prepares the student for the study of common-practice harmony with a review of the fundamentals of
music theory and an introduction of triadic harmony through figured bass realization at the keyboard,
composition of harmonic progressions, harmonization of melodies, and extensive eartraining exer-
cises.
The first half of the course reviews the basic principles of pitch and rhythmic notation, key signatures,
modes, scales and intervals and triads, as well as the fundamentals of triadic harmony. The remainder
of the course emphasizes triadic progression through written assignments and figured bass realization
at the keyboard including inversions and some altered chords.
Sightsinging, sightreading, eartraining, and harmonic structural analysis are pursued concurrently
with keyboard and written theory. Students are required to attend musicianship labs and to develop,
outside of class, their vocal, aural, and keyboard competence through regular practice. Music soft-
ware may be used for some written assignments as well as eartraining drill. The software will be avail-
able both on the network and in the Bernhard Music Technology Lab.
Format: three lectures and two eartraining skills labs per week. Evaluation will be based on assign-
ments, quizzes, and a final exam. All will have both written and aural components. Students with pre-
vious theory training or Advanced Placement credit may be permitted to go directly into 104; see de-
partment.

NEUROSCIENCE (Div. III)
Chair, Professor BETTY ZIMMERBERG
Advisory Committee: Professors: G. GOETHALS, P. SOLOMON, H. WILLIAMS, ZIMMERBERG,
ZOTTOLI*. Assistant Professor: N. SANDSTROM.
Neuroscience is a rapidly growing interdisciplinary field concerned with understanding the rela-
tionship between brain, mind, and behavior. The interdisciplinary nature of the field is apparent when
surveying those who call themselves neuroscientists. Among these are anatomists, physiologists, che-
mists, psychologists, philosophers, computer scientists, linguists, and ethologists. The areas that neu-
roscience addresses are equally diverse and range from physiological and molecular studies of single
neurons, to investigations of how systems of neurons produce phenomena such as vision and move-
ment, to the study of the neural basis of complex cognitive phenomena such as memory, language,
and consciousness. Applications of neuroscience research are rapidly growing and include the devel-
opment of drugs to treat neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's
disease, the development of noninvasive techniques for imaging the human brain such as PET scans
and MRI, and the development of methods for repair of the damaged human brain such as the use of
brain explants. Combining this wide range of disciplines, areas of research, and application for the
study of a single remarkably complex organ--the brain--requires a unique interdisciplinary ap-
proach. The Neuroscience Program is designed to provide students with the opportunity to explore
this approach.
THE PROGRAM
The program in neuroscience consists of five courses including an introductory course, three elec-
tives, and a senior course. In addition, students are required to take two courses, Biology 101 and
Psychology 101, as part of the program.
Introduction to Neuroscience (Neuroscience 201) is the basic course and provides the background
for other neuroscience courses. Ideally, this will be taken before the end of sophomore year. Either
Biology 101 or Psychology 101 serves as the prerequisite. Electives are designed to provide in-depth
coverage including laboratory experience in specific areas of neuroscience. At least one elective
course is required in Biology (Group A) and one in Psychology (Group B). The third elective course
may also come from Group A or Group B, or may be selected from other neuroscience related courses
upon approval of the advisory committee. Topics in Neuroscience (Neuroscience 401) is designed to
provide an integrative culminating experience. Most students will take this course in the senior year.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN NEUROSCIENCE
The degree with honors in Neuroscience provides students with the opportunity to undertake an
original research project under the supervision of one or more of the Neuroscience faculty. In addition
to completing the requirements of the Neuroscience Program, candidates for an honors degree must
enroll in Neuroscience 493-W031-494 and write a thesis based on an original research project. Pre-
sentation of a thesis, however, should not be interpreted as a guarantee of a degree with honors. Stu-
dents interested in pursuing a degree with honors should contact the Neuroscience Advisory Commit-
tee in the spring of their junior year.

NSCI 401(F) Topics in Neuroscience
Neuroscientists explore issues inherent in the study of brain and behavior. The overall objective of this
seminar is to create a culminating senior experience in which previous course work in specific areas in
the Neuroscience Program can be brought to bear in a synthetic, interdisciplinary approach to under-
standing complex problems. The specific goals for students in this seminar are (1) to evaluate original
research and critically examine the experimental evidence for theoretical issues, and (2) to gain an
understanding of this discipline through group work, and oral presentations. Topics and instructional
formats will vary somewhat from year to year, but in all cases the course will emphasize an integrative
approach in which students will be asked to consider topics from a range of perspectives including
molecular, cellular, systems, behavioral and clinical neuroscience. Previous topics have included
memory, autism, depression, alcoholism, language development, and stress.
Format: student-led discussions and presentations, three hours a week. Evaluation will be based on
presentations, participation in class discussion, and a term paper.
Prerequisite: This course is open only to seniors in the Neuroscience program. Enrollment limit: 24
(expected: 16). Preference given to seniors in the neuroscience program.

Performance Studies provides an opportunity to inhabit a place where the making of artistic and
cultural meaning intersects with critical reflection on those processes. The program has as its primary
goal the bringing together of those students and faculty engaged in the creative arts, i.e., studio art,
creative writing, dance, film and video, music, and theater with those departments that reflect in part
on those activities, e.g., Anthropology and Sociology, Art History, Classics, foreign languages, Com-
parative Literature,English, History, Music, Philosophy, Psychology, Religion and Theater.
The program allows faculty and students to conduct intensive and focussed interdisciplinary stud-
ies in performance. The central ideas which performance studies confronts--action, body, frame, rep-
resentation, race, ethnicity, gender, politics, history and transcultural experience--circulate within
and through the subjects and fields upon which the program draws.
Students in Performance Studies are encouraged to do four things: 1) take Theatre 328, Approach-
ing Performance Studies; 2) try different artistic media, both in the curriculum and beyond; 3) move
Performance Studies, Philosophy
­ 240 ­
between the doing of art and performance and thinking about that process; and 4) prepare a portfolio
of their work in different media. The list of courses below is divided between doing courses (practica)
and reflection/criticism courses. Voluntary portfolios are entirely optional. What we suggest is that
portfolios should draw on at least four projects or productions. They should show critical self-reflec-
tion on the creative processes, a comparison of the artistic media employed and also demonstrate per-
formance criticism on the work of others. Preparation of the portfolio should normally begin in the
second semester of the junior year. It will be done under the supervision of a member of the advisory
committee and will be presented in the senior year to faculty and students interested in the program.

PHILOSOPHY (Div. II)
Chair, Professor ALAN WHITE
Professors: GERRARD, SAWICKI, WHITE. Assistant Professors: CRUZ, DUDLEY*, MLADE-
NOVIC, WILBERDING.
To engage in philosophy is to ask a variety of questions about the world and our place in it. What
can we know? What should we do? What may we hope? What makes human beings human? These
questions, in various forms, and others like them are not inventions of philosophers; on the contrary,
they occur to most people simply as they live their lives. Many of us ask them as children, but later
either ignore them, or accept answers we can live with. Philosophers, however, seek to keep such
questions open, and to address them through reasoned discussion and argument, instead of accepting
answers to them based on opinion or prejudice.
The program in philosophy is designed to aid students in thinking about these issues, by acquaint-
ing them with influential work in the field, past and present, and by training them to grapple with these
issues themselves. The program emphasizes training in clear, critical thinking and in effective writing.
Philosophy courses center around class discussions and the writing of interpretive and critical essays.
MAJOR
Philosophy is a discipline with a long and intricate history, a history that remains an integral part of
the discipline. In this way, it differs dramatically from the natural sciences: for example, although no
contemporary physicists or biologists embrace Aristotle's physics or biology, among philosophers
there continue to be champions of Aristotle's metaphysics and of his ethics. Because of the richness
and continuing importance of the history of philosophy, the program is designed to give majors a his-
torical background that will acquaint them with a wide variety of approaches in philosophical issues,
and will provide them with a basis for evaluating and contributing to contemporary debates.

A total of nine courses is required for the major in Philosophy. Students should begin with Philoso-

to historical figures and themes that continue to be influential in many contemporary discussions in
the two major areas of philosophical inquiry, i.e., practical inquiry into issues of ethics and politics,
and theoretical inquiry into issues of knowledge, belief, understanding, and reality. Following 101
and 102, students should take 201 and 202 again in either order; neither is required for the major, but
both are prerequisites for many upper-level courses and both are strongly recommended for students
who think they may be interested in pursuing graduate study in philosophy. The final required course
is the Senior Seminar, Philosophy 401.
Following your completion of 201 and 202, you will have the background you need in order to
decide which four additional courses will, along with the Senior Seminar, best complete your major.
Members of the department will gladly advise you, but you will have discovered which areas, topics,
and figures are most important to you. Non-majors are invited to ask the chair for advice on course
selection.
Students considering graduate study in philosophy are strongly urged to develop reading compe-
tence in German, French, or Greek before graduation.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN PHILOSOPHY
The degree with honors in Philosophy is awarded to the student who has demonstrated outstanding
achievement in a program of study that extends beyond the requirements of the major. The extension
beyond major requirements may take the form either of independent work culminating in a senior
essay or thesis (the independent-study route) or of additional course work (the directed-study route).
Candidates must have GPAs of 3.6 or higher in their courses in philosophy, both at the time of apply-
ing for candidacy and at the end of senior year. Juniors interested in pursuing honors should so inform
the Department Chair no later than mid-April.
The independent-study route to honors requires the completion and defense of either a senior essay
produced in the fall semester plus winter study period (maximum 40 pages) or a year-long senior the-
sis (maximum 75 pages). Plans for either essay or thesis (including a brief proposal and bibliography,
worked out in consultation with an advisor) must be submitted to the department in April of the junior
year. A recommendation for graduation with honors will be made on the basis of the thoroughness,
independence, and originality of the student's work.
The directed-study route to honors required the completion of two courses in philosophy in addi-
tion to the nine required for the major. Candidates taking this route must also submit to the department
revised copies of two term papers (10 pages or longer) written for philosophy courses they have taken;
each student will be assigned an adviser to help guide the process of revision. A recommendation for
graduation with honors will be made on the basis of the scope of the student's course work, the quality
of the student's participation in Philosophy 401, and the thoroughness, independence, and originality
reflected in the submitted papers.
PHIL 101(F,S) Introduction to Moral and Political Philosophy (W)
Throughout the history of Western philosophy, there have been debates concerning how human be-
ings should live: What should we do both with our lives as wholes and in specific problematic situa-
tions? The debates have addressed us both as individuals and as members of political communities.
This course aims to aid us in responding to these debates, and in living our lives, on the basis of rea-
soned conclusions rather than from unrecognized presuppositions. The course concentrates on Plato's
Republic, the most influential ethical and political text within Western philosophy, but we assess the
Republic in light of elaborations and criticisms that have developed over the past 2500 years, in works
by Aristotle, Kant, and Mill.
Emphasis on class discussion and the writing of critical papers.
Requirements: frequent short papers, totaling 20-30 pages.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 per section (expected: 19 per section). Preference to first-year
students and sophomores. This course is writing intensive.

PHIL 102(F,S) Introduction to Metaphysics and Epistemology (W)
Metaphysics and epistemology are the two core pursuits of theoretical philosophy (as opposed to
practical philosophy, the focus of Philosophy 101). Metaphysics is concerned with the ultimate char-
acter of reality. The metaphysician seeks to develop knowledge (as opposed to mere opinion or belief)
of all things natural, human, and divine. She asks, for example: Are we free, or are our acts deter-
mined? Is there a God? If so, what must God be like? Epistemology is concerned with how we deter-
mine the difference between knowledge and mere opinion. The epistemologist thus asks: What does it
mean truly to know something? How can we acquire such genuine knowledge? Answers to these
epistemological questions are essential if we are to have any confidence in the methods and results of
our metaphysical investigations. This course will emphasize the established historical classics that
provide the basis for understanding contemporary work on metaphysics and epistemological issues;
we will consider, among others, the work of Descartes, Hume, and Kant.

PHIL 103(S) Logic and Language (Q)
Logic is the study of reasoning and argument. More particularly, it concerns itself with the difference
between good and bad reasoning, between strong and weak arguments. We all examine the virtues
and vices of good arguments in both informal and formal systems. The goals of this course are to im-
prove the critical thinking of the students, to introduce them to sentential and predicate logic, to famil-
iarize them with enough formal logic to enable them to read some of the great works of philosophy,
which use formal logic (such as Wittgenstein's Tractatus), and to examine some of the connections
between logic and philosophy.
Requirements: a midterm, a final, frequent homework and problems sets.
No prerequisites. This course is a prerequisite for Philosophy 109, Philosophy of Science. This is a
quantitative/formal reasoning course.

PHIL 201(S) Continental Philosophy: From Hegel to Poststructuralism
This course is designed to introduce students to the complicated history of post-Kantian philosophical
thought in continental Europe. Figures to be considered may include Hegel, Marx, Kierkegaard,
Nietzsche, Husserl, Heidegger, Sartre, Habermas, Gadamer, Derrida, and Foucault; movements dis-
cussed may include phenomenology, existentialism, hermeneutics, continental feminism, and post-
structuralism. By introducing students to main currents and figures in the modern continental tradi-
tion, Philosophy 201 will prepare them for more advanced courses drawing from this tradition; rele-
vant courses are offered in a variety of departments, including Anthropology and Sociology, English,
Comparative Literature, Philosophy, Political Science, and Religion.
Requirements: attendance, participation, and frequent short papers, totalling 20-30 pages.
No prerequisites, although Philosophy 102 (and/or 101), or relevant upper-division theory courses in
other departments, are highly recommended.

PHIL 202(F) Analytic Philosophy--Language and Mind (W)
This course is designed to introduce students to twentieth-century philosophy by focusing on two of
its premier research areas, language and mind. Each of these topics been studied independently of the
other, with the philosophy of language dominating the first half of the century and the philosophy of
mind surging in the second half. Research on language and mind have also enjoyed a fruitful liaison,
as much of the technical apparatus of the philosophy of language has been used to illuminate the mind.
The other side of this coin is that language is something that minds achieve, and some prominent theo-
ries of linguistic meaning have emphasized psychological elements of language use.
The course will begin with the work of Frege, Russell, and Wittgenstein, and end with the work of
Putnam, Dennett, Fodor and Churchland. The course is intended to prepare students for more ad-
vanced research on either language or mind. At the same time, the course aims to offer an overview of
the methods and intellectual style of analytic philosophy. Thus, it will also serve as preparation for
advanced work in epistemology, philosophy of science, metaphysics, and ethics. The syllabus can be
found at: http://www.williams.edu/philosophy/fourth_layer/faculty_pages/jcruz/courses/

systems: Kant's Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals and J. S. Mill's Utilitarianism. Each week
in the second half of the course we will examine a different area where morality and the law meet, and
our readings here will consist mainly of court cases and law review articles. All the topics for this part
of the course will concern such gender issues as battered women, pornography, and gay rights. Re-

PHIL 209(F) Philosophy of Science
It is a generally held belief, in our times and culture, that science is the best source of our knowledge of
the world, and of ourselves. The aim of this course is to examine the origins, grounds, and nature of
this belief. We will analyze and discuss various accounts of scientific method, structure and justifica-
tion of scientific theories, scientific choice, change, and the idea that scientific knowledge is progres-
sive. The course will begin with the "received view" of scientific theories, methods, and knowledge,
advanced by logical positivists, which assumes the objectivity and the rationality of science. We will
then discuss philosophies of science that emerged out of various criticisms of this view-especially
those of Popper, Lakatos, Kuhn and Feyerabend-and the challenges to the assumptions of scientific
objectivity and rationality their works provoked. This discussion will naturally lead us to the relativist
and social-constructivist views developed within contemporary science studies. Finally, we will ana-
lyze the current debate about the cognitive credentials of science and the proper approach to the study
of science, which came to be known as "the science wars."
Requirements: frequent short assignments, class presentation, class participation, and a longer (5-7

concerns in health care and biotechnology. Through cases, readings, and discussions, we will analyze
such core notions as death, illness and disability, and develop a framework of central principles for
conceptualizing and resolving practical ethical problems that arise in the medical context. Much of the
term will focus on questions surrounding (1) the care of the terminally ill (including, for example, the
use of advance directives, withholding and withdrawing life-sustaining treatment, and physician-as-
sisted suicide and euthanasia), (2) the management of medical information (e.g., privacy in health
care, mandatory reporting, and genetic testing), (3) the use of human subjects in research, and (4) hu-
man gene transfer for purposes of therapy or enhancement. Students need not have a background in
life sciences or in philosophy, but the course is analytic and rigorous.

PHIL 262(S) Hellenistic Ethics
Moral theory was a central concern of the three schools of Hellenistic philosophy, Epicureanism, Sto-
icism and Scepticism. These schools defended a wide variety of positions, yet they were all very prac-
tice-oriented and shared the common goals of happiness (eudaimonia) and `freedom from distur-
bance' (ataraxia). They disagreed on how this was to be achieved. In this course we will begin with the
Epicureans and their philosophy of hedonism. Why did they think that pleasure was the key to happi-
ness, and what was their strategy for maximizing pleasure? The course will then turn to Stoic moral
theory. Claims central to Stoic theory include: virtue is sufficient for happiness; nothing but virtue is
genuinely good; all emotions are bad. Particular attention will be paid to Stoic claim that their moral
philosophy (ethics) is derived from their philosophy of nature (physics). Finally, we will end with the
Stoic's fiercest critics, the Sceptics. The Sceptics not only provided many powerful objections to Stoic
moral philosophy, but also used sceptical exercises to achieve some of the same goals that Stoic moral
philosophy itself sought. All reading will be in translation, and no knowledge of Greek or Latin is
necessary. Primary texts will form the majority of the reading, but some secondary literature will be
assigned.

PHIL 315(F) Phenomenology
Early in the twentieth century, Edmund Husserl initiated the phenomenological movement in philoso-
phy by advocating a turn away from arguments and theories, a turn "back to the things themselves," to
phenomena as we encounter them. Husserl's student Martin Heidegger transformed phenomenology
by focusing not on things but on being, and on us not as knowers of things, but as beings who dwell
within the world; he thereby gave powerful impetus to the development of existentialism. We will
begin our study of phenomenology with Robert Sokolowsky's Introduction, then proceed through
selections from Husserl, Heidegger, and French phenomenologists, beginning with Maurice Mer-
leau-Ponty.
Format: seminar. Requirements: regular class presentations, a short mid-term paper (c. 5 pages), and a

PHIL 316(S) Schopenhauer and Nietzsche
Before Nietzsche, Western philosophers tended to view the history of philosophy as a linear, progres-
sive development toward a goal shared by all. Arthur Schopenhauer believed himself to have attained
that goal, and he came close enough that Freud deemed him "one of the half dozen or so greatest men
who have ever lived," Wittgenstein judged him to be "basically right," and Nietzsche counted himself
"among those readers of Schopenhauer who know quite definitely after reading the first page that they
will read every page, and will listen to every word he had to say." Having read every page, however,
Nietzsche turned not only against Schopenhauer, but against the metaphysical project itself, thereby
helping to initiate the postmodern rejection (or transformation) of the Western philosophical project.
In the first half of this course, we examine the metaphysics of Schopenhauer's The World as Will and
Representation. In the second half, we examine the non-metaphysical alternative developed by
Nietzsche in Thus Spoke Zarathustra.
Requirements: regular class presentations, two papers 8- to 10-pages.

PHIL 331(F) Contemporary Epistemology (W)
Epistemology is one of the core areas of philosophical reflection. In this course, we will study the
literature in contemporary philosophy on the nature of knowledge and rational belief. Epistemologists
seek answers to the following kinds of questions:
--When is it rational to have a particular belief?
--What is knowledge (as opposed to mere opinion)?
--In order to be justified in holding a belief, must someone know (or believe) that she is justified in
holding that belief?
--What, if anything, justifies our scientific knowledge?
These questions are typically asked within a framework where the overarching goal is attaining truth
and avoiding falsity. Beyond this common ground, however, epistemologists are much divided. Some
maintain that these issues are solely the provinces of philosophy, using traditional a priori methods.
Others maintain that these questions will only yield to methods that incorporate our broader insight
into the nature of the world including, perhaps, feminist thought or science. Both stances face severe
difficulties. Further, even where there is agreement as to the proper way of answering epistemological
questions, there is a stunning variety of possible answers to each question. The syllabus can be found
at: http://www.williams.edu/philosophy/fourth_layer/faculty_pages/jcruz/courses/episty.html

PHIL 332(S) Plato's Metaphysics and Epistemology (W)
In this course we will investigate the central issues of Plato's theories of being and knowledge through
an examination of crucial passages from a wide range of texts. While the focus will be on the so-called
`later' dialogues (Theaetetus, Sophist, Statesman, Parmenides, Philebus and Timaeus), other texts
will figure prominently in the course. We will grapple with the basic questions: What are Plato's
Forms (or forms)? Of what things are there Forms and to what extent does Plato have a `theory' of
them? How do they help us know and/or explain things--and equally important, how do they still
allow for error? What does it mean to say that sensible particular things `participate in' Forms? How
much variation is there in the dialogues on these issues--is it fair to say that his thought developed, or
could any detected differences be due to differing philosophical agendas? Finally, we will look at
some more historical questions: In what way is Plato reacting to his Presocratic predecessors, and how
fair are Aristotle's criticisms of Plato's theory? All reading will be in translation, and no knowledge of
Greek is necessary. Primary texts will form the majority of the reading, but some secondary literature
will be assigned.

and both intellectually and socially influential sciences. Philosophical interest in its concepts, scientif-

­ 246 ­
ic methodology, and reliability of its results is now probably greater than it ever was before. In order to
understand philosophical significance of contemporary biology, we will focus on the theory of evolu-
tion, and discuss the following questions and problems: What are the main claims of the theory of
evolution, and how are we to interpret them? For example, what is an "adaptationist explanation" and
under which conditions are such explanations satisfactory? What is `fitness,' and how should the con-
cept be employed to help us provide good evolutionary explanations? What is natural selection acting
upon--a species, an organism, or organism's genes? And how are we to define `species,' faced with
different definitions used in different biological sciences? Darwin, and other evolutionists after him,
firmly reject teleological explanations in biology--yet to explain the emergence and stability of par-
ticular traits in organisms and species we must say what purpose do these traits serve, which seems
like a teleological explanation after all. How are we to resolve this apparent tension in the heart of the
evolutionary theory?--Finally, in the last segment of the course, we will examine some aspects of the
influence biology had on other disciplines, by studying the methods, assumptions and some specific
claims of sociobiology and evolutionary psychology.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: class participation, two short quizzes, three 5-pages long

PHIL 401(F) Senior Seminar: The Philosophy of Hilary Putnam
As the capstone seminar, this course is required of all senior majors. For 2002-2003, the seminar will
focus on the philosophy of Hilary Putnam, considered by many (including the professor of this
course) to be the world's foremost living philosopher. Putnam is famous for both changing his mind
and for the breadth of his interests. He was one of the earliest proponents of the view that human be-
ings are importantly analogous to computers, and then later, one of the chief critics of that view. Put-
nam's works range from the philosophy of logic and physics to the philosophy of education and histo-
ry. He has written on philosophers from Aristotle and Kant to Levinas and Dewey. He has examined
both the consistency of mathematics and the consistency of religion. Students will be responsible for
giving presentations and for a major final paper.

educational experience. As a part of the liberal arts concept, the program develops the mind-body
relationship, which is dependent upon the proper integration of physical and intellectual capacities.
The main objective of the physical education program is to develop in each student an appreciation of
physical fitness and wellness, and to expose them to a variety of activities that are suitable for lifetime
participation.
Four credits of Physical Education represent one of the requirements for the College degree. There
are five physical education units during the year. In the fall academic semester, there are two six-week
physical education quarters. Winter Study is another unit, and there are two physical education quar-
ters in the spring academic semester. Four sections meet two times per week in seventy-five minute
periods and two sections meet three times per week in fifty-minute periods.

What is light? How does a transistor work? What is a black hole? Why are metals shiny? What is
wave/particle duality? There are people for whom questions like these are of more than passing inter-
est; some of them become Physics or Astrophysics majors. A physics student experiments with the
phenomena by which the physical world is known and explores the mathematical techniques and
theories that make sense of it. A Physics or Astrophysics major serves as preparation for further work
in physics, astrophysics, applied physics, other sciences, engineering, medical research, science
teaching and writing, and other careers involving insight into the fundamental principles of nature.
ASTROPHYSICS MAJOR
The Physics Department, in cooperation with the Astronomy Department, offers a major in astro-
physics consisting of (at least): 6 or 7 courses in Physics, 3 or 4 in Astronomy, and 1 in Mathematics.
The core sequence of the Astrophysics major is the same as the Physics major described below (ex-
cept that Physics 302, although strongly recommended, is not required). Students intending to pursue
graduate study in astrophysics will need to take upper-level physics electives beyond the basic re-
quirements for the major. Honors work in Astrophysics may be in either physics or astronomy. Stu-
dents majoring in Astrophysics are expected to consult early and often with faculty from both depart-
ments in determining their course selections. The detailed description of the Astrophysics major is
given under "Astronomy," along with a description of the Astronomy major also offered by that de-
partment (see page 90).
PHYSICS MAJOR
Introductory courses
Students considering a major in physics should take both physics and mathematics as first-year
students. A student normally begins with either Physics 131 or Physics 141:
1) Physics 131 Particles and Waves. This is designed as a first course in physics. It is suitable for
students who either have not had physics before or have had some physics but are not comfortable
solving "word problems" that require calculus.

2) Physics 141 Particles and Waves--Enriched. Students in this course should have solid back-
grounds in science and calculus, either from high school or college, including at least a year of high
school physics.
The Department of Mathematics will place students in the appropriate introductory calculus
course. The physics major sequence courses all make use of calculus at increasingly sophisticated
levels. Therefore, students considering a Physics major should continue their mathematical prepara-
tion without interruption through the introductory calculus sequence (Mathematics 103, 104, and
105). Students are encouraged to take Physics 210 as early as possible. Physics 210 is cross listed as
Mathematics 210 for the benefit of those students who wish to have the course listed with a MATH
prefix.
Advanced Placement
Students with unusually strong backgrounds in calculus and physics may place out of Physics 141
and either: 1) begin with the special seminar course Physics 151 in the fall (typically followed by
Physics 210 in the spring), or 2) begin with Physics 142 in the spring (possibly along with Physics
210). Students may take either 151 or 142 but not both. On rare occasions a student with an exception-
al background will be offered the option of enrolling in Physics 201.
Placement is based on AP scores, consultation with the department, and results of a placement
exam administered during First Days. The exam can also be taken later in the year by arrangement
with the department chair. The exam covers classical mechanics, basic wave phenomena, and in-
cludes some use of calculus techniques.
Requirements for the Major
A total of ten courses in physics and mathematics are required to complete the Physics major.
Students who place out of both Physics 141 and Physics 142 and begin their studies in Physics
201 are required to take a total of nine courses.
Required Physics Sequence Courses
Physics 141 Particles and Waves--Enriched
or Physics 131 Particles and Waves
Physics 142 Foundations of Modern Physics
or Physics 151 Seminar in Modern Physics

Required Mathematics Course
Mathematics 105 Multivariable Calculus
Students entering with Advanced Placement in mathematics may obtain credit toward the major for
the equivalent Mathematics 105 taken elsewhere.
At least two more physics or other approved courses must be taken, bringing the total number of
courses for the major to ten.
Options
1) Mathematics 104 may be counted if taken at Williams
2) Mathematics 209 may substitute for Physics 210.
3) Astronomy 111 may count in place of Physics 141 if a student places out of 141 (see below).
4) An additional Astronomy or Astrophysics course above the introductory level that is acceptable for
the astrophysics major may be counted.
5) Two approved Division III courses above the introductory level may be substituted for one Physics
course. Approval is on an individual basis at the discretion of the department chair.
6) Honors work is in addition to completion of the basic major so Physics 493 and 494 do not count
towards the ten courses in the major.
Preparation for Advanced Study
Students who may wish to do graduate work in physics, astrophysics, or engineering should elect
courses in both physics and mathematics beyond the minimum major requirements. The first-year
graduate school curriculum in physics usually includes courses in quantum mechanics, electromag-
netic theory, and classical mechanics that presuppose intermediate level study of these subjects as an
undergraduate. Therefore, students planning graduate work in physics should elect all of the follow-
ing courses:
Physics 402T Applications of Quantum Mechanics
Physics 405T Electromagnetic Theory
Physics 411T Classical Mechanics

Advising
Both majors and non-majors are encouraged to consult with the department chair or course instruc-
tors about course selections or other matters.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN PHYSICS
The degree with honors in Physics will be awarded on the basis of a senior thesis presenting the
results of a substantial experimental or theoretical investigation carried out under the direction of a
faculty member in the department. There is no rigid grade point average required for admission to the
program or for the awarding of the degree with honors, but it is normally expected that honors students
will maintain at least aBaverage in physics and mathematics. Students will normally apply for admis-
sion to the program early in the spring of their junior year and during senior year these students will
normally elect Physics 493, W031, and 494 in addition to the usual requirements for the major. At the
end of winter study, the department will decide whether the student will be admitted to honors candi-
dacy. Both a written thesis and a colloquium presentation of the results are required. The degree with
honors will be awarded to those who meet these requirements with distinction. The degree withhigh-
est honors will be awarded to those who fulfill them with unusually high distinction.
Honors candidates will also be required to participate in departmental colloquium talks.
OPTIONS FOR NON-MAJORS
Many students want to take a self-contained and rigorous full-year survey of physics. For such stu-
dents, the most appropriate sequence will be either Physics 131 or Physics 141 followed by Physics
132, depending on the student's background in science and mathematics (see Introductory Courses
above). Either of these sequences satisfies the physics requirement for medical school.
The department also offers one semester courses designed for non-majors. This year there are three
such offerings: Physics 100, Physics 109, and Physics/Religion 342.
PHYS 100(S) Physics of Everyday Life (Q)
How do things work? What makes a car go or a bird fly? Why do microwaves heat food? How does a
CD player work? Why are diamonds hard and metals shiny? How do we see?
Science is all around us. From common objects to high technology, science is part of our everyday
lives. Amazingly, with a few powerful principles we can understand the materials that make up our
world and the rules that govern their behavior--that's physics.
In this course we will explore the world we know and the microscopic components from which it is
made, and we will extract from this exploration the central concepts underpinning contemporary
physics. The mathematics used in the course will be basic algebra and trigonometry.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; home experiments. Evaluation will be based on weekly home-
work, a midterm, a project, and a final exam, all with a significant quantitative component.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 120 (expected: 75). This is a quantitative/formal reasoning
course.
Hour: 1:10-2:25 TF WHITAKER
PHYS 109(F) Sound, Light, and Perception (Q)
Light and sound allow us to perceive the world around us, from appreciating music and art to learning
the details of atomic structure. Because of their importance in human experience, light and sound have
long been the subject of scientific inquiry. How are sound and light related? How do physiology and
neural processing allow us to hear and see the world around us? What are the origins of color and
musical pitch? This course introduces the science and technology of light and sound to students not
majoring in physics. We will start with the origins of sound and light as wave phenomena, and go on to
topics including color, the optics of vision, the meaning of musical pitch and tone, and the physical
basis of hearing. We will also discuss some recent technological applications of light, such as lasers
and optical communications.
The class will meet for two 75-minute periods each week for a variable mixture of lecture, discussion,
and hands-on, interactive experiments.
Format: mixed lecture/lab/discussion, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on class partici-
pation, 7 problem sets, one in-class exam, a short oral presentation, and a final exam, all with a quanti-
tative component.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 24 (expected: 24). This is a quantitative/formal reasoning
course.
Hour: 9:55-11:10 TR MAJUMDER
PHYS 131(F) Particles and Waves (Q)
We focus first on the Newtonian mechanics of point particles: the relationship between velocity, ac-
celeration, and position; the puzzle of circular motion; forces; Newton's laws; energy and momen-
tum; and gravitation. The historical context in which these ideas developed will be discussed. We then
turn to the basic properties of waves, such as interference and polarization, with emphasis on light
waves. Finally, we bring the two strands together with a brief discussion of the wave-particle duality
of modern quantum mechanics.
This course is intended for students who have not studied physics before or who have had some phys-
Physics
­ 250 ­
ics, but are not comfortable solving "word problems" that require calculus. (Students with strong
backgrounds in the sciences are encouraged to consider taking Physics 141 instead.) Physics 131 can
lead to either Physics 132 (for students wanting a one-year survey of physics) or Physics 142 (for
students considering a physics or astrophysics major).
Format: lectures, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours every other week. Evaluation will be
based on weekly problem sets, hour tests, labs, and a final exam, all of which have a substantial quanti-
tative component.

tive/formal reasoning course.
Hour: 11:00-11:50 MWF Lab: 1-4 M,T,W MAJUMDER
PHYS 132(S) Electromagnetism and the Physics of Matter (Q)
This course is intended as the second half of a one-year survey of physics. In the first half of the semes-
ter we will focus on electromagnetic phenomena. We will introduce the concept of electric and mag-
netic fields, and study in detail the way in which electrical circuits and circuit elements work. The
deep connection between electric and magnetic phenomena is highlighted in a discussion of Fara-
day's Law of Induction. In the second half of the semester, we introduce several of the most central
topics in twentieth-century physics. We will discuss Einstein's theory of special relativity as well as
aspects of quantum theory. We will end with a treatment of nuclear physics, radioactivity, and uses of
radiation.
Format: lectures, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours every other week. Evaluation will be
based on weekly problem sets, labs, hour tests, and a final exam, all of which have a substantial quanti-
tative component.
Prerequisite: Physics 131 or 141 or permission of the instructor, and Mathematics 103. No enrollment
limit (24/lab section); expected: 60. This is a quantitative/formal reasoning course.

PHYS 141(F) Particles and Waves--Enriched (Q)
This course covers the same topics as Physics 131, but with a higher level of mathematical sophistica-
tion and more emphasis on waves. It is intended for students with solid backgrounds in the sciences,
either from high school or college, who feel comfortable solving "word problems" that require calcu-
lus. Physics 141 can lead to either Physics 132 (for students wanting a one-year survey of physics) or
Physics 142 (for students considering a physics or astrophysics major).

Hour: 11:00-11:50 MWF Lab: 1-4 M,T,W AALBERTS
PHYS 142(S) Foundation of Modern Physics (Q)
The twentieth century has been an extremely productive and exciting time for physics. Special relativ-
ity has extended physics into the realm of high speeds and high energies. Quantum mechanics has
successfully described phenomena at small energies and small distance scales. Our understanding of
atoms, molecules, and solids has developed from a few revolutionary ideas into a sophisticated frame-
work which today supports technologies that were unimagined in 1900.
This course will introduce many important developments in physics, including special relativity, the
Bohr model of the atom, Schrodinger's wave mechanics in one dimension, the chemical bond, energy
bands in solids, and nuclear physics.
Format: lectures, three hours per week; laboratories, three hours every other week; conferences; one
hour every other week.
Evaluation will be based on weekly problem sets, labs, two hour tests, and a final exam, all of which
have a substantial quantitative component.
Prerequisites: Physics 141 and Mathematics 103, or equivalent. Students may not take both Physics
142 and Physics 151. Physics 131 may substitute for Physics 141 with the permission of the instructor.
Enrollment limit: none (24/lab section); expected: 50. This is a quantitative/formal reasoning course.
Hour: 11:00-11:50 MWF Lab: 1-4 T,W,R WOOTTERS
PHYS 151(F) Seminar in Modern Physics (Q)
Why does a hot coal glow red rather than blue or green or some other color? Remarkably, this simple
question could not be answered before the year 1900, because the answer depends on a radical as-
sumption introduced in that year by Max Planck. His work on thermal radiation marked the beginning
of a revolutionary era in the history of physics that culminated in a new framework for our understand-
ing of the physical world. The two pillars of this framework, quantum mechanics and relativity, to-
gether with the ideas of statistical physics that allow us to apply quantum mechanics to macroscopic
objects (such as hot coals), constitute the core of this course. As we study this material, we will also be
exploring the process of research in physics, partly by doing a few experiments of our own in class.
We will discuss the interaction between experiment and theory, as well as the roles of simplicity, ele-

gance and unity in the search for explanations.
This is a small seminar designed for first-year students who have placed out of Physics 141. Teams of
students will be responsible for leading some of the class sessions, and at the end of the semester each
student will give a short oral presentation.
Format: lecture and discussion three hours a week; occasional lab experiments done in class. Evalua-
tion is based on class participation, weekly problem sets, an oral presentation, two hour-exams and a
final exam, all of which have a substantial quantitative component.
Prerequisite: placement by the department (see advanced placement above). Students may take either
Physics 142 or Physics 151 but not both. Enrollment limit: 20 (expected: 14). This is a quantitative/
formal reasoning course.
Hour: 8:30-9:45 TR WOOTTERS
PHYS 201(F) Electricity and Magnetism (Q)
In this course, we study electromagnetic phenomena and their mathematical description. Topics in-
clude electromagnetic induction, alternating circuits, and the electromagnetic properties of matter.
We also introduce Maxwell's equations, which express in remarkably succinct form the essence of the
theory.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on
weekly problem sets, labs, two hour tests, and a final exam, all of which have a substantial quantitative

PHYS 202(S) Waves and Optics (Q)
Wave motions are characteristic of almost every type of material, including strings, springs, water,
and solids. They also describe the behavior of electromagnetic fields and elemental matter. Despite
these diverse settings waves exhibit many common characteristics, so that the understanding of a few
simple systems can provide insight into a wide array of phenomena. In this course we begin with the
study of oscillations of simple systems with only a few degrees of freedom. We then move on to study
transverse and longitudinal waves in continuous media in order to gain a general description of wave
behavior. The rest of the course focuses on electromagnetic waves, and in particular on optical exam-
ples of wave phenomena. In addition to well known optical effects such as interference and diffrac-
tion, we will study a number of modern applications of optics such as short pulse lasers and optical
communications. Throughout the course mathematical methods useful for higher-level physics will
be introduced.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on
weekly problem sets, labs, a midterm exam, and a final exam, all of which have a substantial quantita-
tive component.

enrollment limit (16/lab section); expected: 25. This is a quantitative/formal reasoning course.
Hour: 10:00-10:50 MWF: Lab: 1-4 T,R K. JONES
PHYS 210(S) Mathematical Methods for Scientists (Same as Mathematics 210) (Q)
This course covers a variety of mathematical methods used in the sciences, focusing particularly on
the solution of ordinary and partial differential equations. In addition to calling attention to certain
special equations that arise frequently in the study of waves and diffusion, we develop general tech-
niques such as looking for series solutions and, in the case of nonlinear equations, using phase por-
traits and linearizing around fixed points. We study some simple numerical techniques for solving
differential equations. A series of optional sessions in TrueBasic will be offered for students who do
not already have a background in programming.
Format: lecture, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on weekly problem sets, a midterm
exam and a final exam, all of which have a substantial quantitative component.
Prerequisites: Mathematics 105 and familiarity with Newtonian mechanics at the level of Physics
131. No enrollment limit (expected: 20). This is a quantitative/formal reasoning course.
Hour: 9:55-11:10 TR AALBERTS
PHYS 301(F) Quantum Physics (Q)
This course serves as a one-semester introduction to the history, formalism, and phenomenology of
quantum mechanics. We begin with a discussion of the historical origins of the quantum theory, and
the Schroedinger wave equation. The concepts of matter waves and wave-packets are introduced.
Solutions to one-dimensional problems will be treated prior to introducing the system which serves as
a hallmark of the success of quantum theory, the three-dimensional hydrogen atom. In the second half
of the course, we will develop the important connection between the underlying mathematical formal-
ism and the physical predictions of the quantum theory. We then go on to apply this knowledge to
several important problems within the realm of atomic and nuclear physics.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on
weekly problem sets, labs, a midterm exam, and final exam, all of which have a substantial quantita-

PHYS 302(S) Statistical Physics (Q)
The natural world is built with many small components interacting in a simple but coordinated way.
With a statistical view, we may make sense of the cooperative phenomena which emerge.
For example, we can associate macroscopic thermodynamic properties with ensembles of microscop-
ic states. With calculations and simple numerical exercises we shall probe a wide variety of physical
phenomena: magnetism, gasses, heat engines, thermal radiation, electrons in solids, polymers, ran-
dom walks in fluids or in the stock market, and genomic information.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; computer lab 1&1/4 hours per week. Evaluation will be based
on weekly problem sets, quizzes, labs and a final exam, all of which have a substantial quantitative
component.

PHYS 316(F) Protecting Information: Applications of Abstract Algebra and Quantum Physics
(Same as Mathematics 316) (Q)
Living in the early decades of the information age, we find ourselves depending more and more on
codes that protect messages against either noise or eavesdropping. We begin this course by studying
the history of this subject, including, for example, the story of the enigma code from World War II. We
then examine some of the most important codes currently being used to protect information, including
linear codes, which in addition to being mathematically elegant are the most practical codes for error
correction, and the RSA public key cryptographic scheme, popular nowadays for internet applica-
tions. Looking ahead by a decade or more, we show how a "quantum computer" could crack any RSA
code in short order, and how quantum cryptographic devices will achieve security through the Hei-
senberg uncertainty principle. Evaluation will be based on homework sets and exams.
Prerequisites: Physics 210 or Mathematics 211 (possibly concurrent) or permission of the instructors.

the Division III distribution requirement or the minimum requirements for the Physics major.
PHYS 402T(S) Applications of Quantum Mechanics (Q)
This course will explore a number of important topics in quantum mechanics such as perturbation
theory and the semiclassical interaction of atoms and radiation. Research or review articles from the
physics literature will be assigned to supplement standard texts and to help motivate discussion. Ap-
plications and examples will be taken mostly from atomic physics with some discussion of precision
measurements and fundamental symmetries.
The class as a whole will meet once a week for 50 minutes to discuss questions on the reading. Each
student will also be assigned to a tutorial meeting with the instructor and one or two other students, at
which the students will take turns presenting solutions to assigned problems. Written solutions to se-
lected problems will be due a few days later.

POLITICAL ECONOMY (Div. II)
Chair, Associate Professor DOUGLAS GOLLIN
Advisory Committee: Professor: JACOBSOHN. Associate Professors: GOLLIN, C. JOHNSON**,
ZIMMERMAN. Assistant Professor: OAK.
The Political Economy major is designed to give students a grasp of the ways in which political and
economic forces interact in the shaping of public policy. The major includes substantial study of the
central analytical approaches in both political science and economics and seeks to surmount the
sometimes artificial barriers of specialization that may characterize either discipline taken by itself. In
Political Economy
­ 254 ­
the junior and senior years a conscious merging of the approaches in the two fields is undertaken in the
three required Political Economy courses. (These courses are designed by, and usually are taught
jointly by, political scientists and economists.) Political Economy 301 examines major writings in
political economy and analyzes economic liberalism and critiques of economic liberalism in the con-
text of current policy issues. Political Economy 401 examines interactions of political and economic
forces in contemporary international affairs. Political Economy 402 examines such interactions in se-
lected current public policy issues. Background for these senior courses is acquired through courses in
international economics, public finance, and domestic and international/comparative politics and
policy.
Students in Political Economy 402 visit Washington, D.C. Sunday night through Wednesday of the
first week of spring vacation to conduct interviews relating to their Political Economy 402 group proj-
ects. This is a course requirement.

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN POLITICAL ECONOMY
Due to the special demands of this interdisciplinary major, the only route to honors in Political
Economy is the thesis. Seniors may pursue the honors thesis course (Political Economy 493-W031)
during the fall semester and winter study period. The third course contributing to such an honors pro-
gram would normally be an elective in Political Science or Economics taken during the junior year.
This course, which may be one of the required electives, must be closely related, indeed must prepare
the ground for the honors thesis.
Juniors in the Political Economy major with at least a 3.5 GPA in the program may apply for the
honors thesis program by means of a written proposal submitted to the chair before spring registration.
Written guidelines for such proposals are available in the chair's office or on the program website. The
Political Economy
­ 255 ­
proposal should have been discussed with at least two faculty members, and at least one faculty advi-
sor from each discipline should be solicited by the student prior to submission of the proposal.
Final decisions about admission to the honors program will be made in early summer, when spring
grades become available.
To achieve the degree with honors in Political Economy, the thesis must be completed by the end of
winter study period and be judged of honors quality by a committee consisting of the two advisors and
a third reader. A thesis judged to be of particular distinction will qualify its author for the degree with
highest honors.

Science 333)
This course explores the relationship between politics and economics by surveying influential works
of political economy. Its first part examines three major systems of thought in relation to the historical
development of capitalism in Western Europe: the classical liberalism of Adam Smith, Karl Marx's
revolutionary socialism, and the reformist ideas of John Stuart Mill, R. H. Tawney, and John Maynard
Keynes. The second part considers more recent writings that revise and critique liberalism from a va-
riety of perspectives. The historical focus of the course permits you to appreciate the ongoing dialogue
between classical and contemporary views of political economy, while classroom discussion involves
frequent reference to current public policy issues. Required in the Political Economy major but open
to non-majors.
Format: discussion/lecture. Requirements: eight 2-page papers and a final exam.
Prerequisites: one course in Economics and either Political Science 201 or 203 or AP credit in Ameri-
can Politics (or permission of the instructor). Enrollment limit: 35 (expected: 32). Preference given to
Political Economy majors and sophomores intending a Political Economy major.

Politics is most fundamentally about community--it is how we manage to live together and craft a
common destiny. Communities, however, need power, and political science therefore attends to the
ways power is grasped, maintained, challenged, or justified. The contest over power gives politics its
drama and pathos. Since power may be used wisely or foolishly, rightly or cruelly, politics affects our
lives most profoundly. No matter whether we find it distasteful, inspiring, appalling or alluring, poli-
tics is for high stakes. For this reason, the effort to understand politics aims not only to describe and
explain, but also to improve political life.
The Political Science major is structured to allow students either to participate in the established
ways of studying politics or to develop their own foci. To this end, the department offers two routes to
completing our major, both requiring nine (9) courses. On the one hand, we invite students to organize
their major through the subfields that structure the discipline of political science (American politics,
international relations, political philosophy, and comparative politics). On the other, we encourage
students to develop individual concentrations reflecting their particular interests regardless of sub-
fields.
MAJOR
SUBFIELD CONCENTRATION ROUTE: Upon declaring a major, students choose a subfield
from American politics, international relations, political theory, and comparative politics. The sub-
field concentration draws at least four (4) of the nine courses from one subfield, and includes the ap-
propriate core course from 201-204, two electives at the 200 or 300 level of the student's choice and
the senior seminar (or an individual project) in the student's subfield. (A degree with honors in Politi-
cal Science requires two (2) additional courses which DO NOT count toward the nine (9) major requi-
rements.) With permission of the department chair, students may take a senior seminar in a different
subfield, providing the student takes a third elective in the subfield of concentration. In addition, stu-
dents must take courses in two subfields outside the subfield of concentration to satisfy the breadth
requirement (all courses at the 100 level and all methods courses also count toward the breadth re-
quirement).
INDIVIDUAL CONCENTRATION ROUTE: Alternatively, students may devise a concentration of
their own. In this event, the student prepares a curricular plan in consultation with a faculty advisor,
explaining the nature of the concentration and the courses the student will take. The individual con-
centration also requires nine (9) courses, with at least five (5) thematically linked courses constituting
the concentration. Of these five courses, four are electives at the 200 or 300 level, including one from
201-204, and one is a senior seminar or individual project. In addition, students pursuing an individual
concentration must take at least two other courses that illustrate breadth in political science. To com-
plete the requirement, the student has his or her choice of any two other courses within the Political
Science Department. The faculty advisor and the department chair must approve the student plan.
ADVISEMENT
When a student chooses to major in Political Science (usually at the end of the sophomore year), he
or she may register with any Political Science faculty member at the designated time and places. The
registering faculty member will ask for preferences for a permanent faculty advisor and will assist
undecided students in finding an advisor whose interests match theirs. In all cases students will be
paired by the end of their sophomore year with an advisor who will continue with them through gradu-
ation.
COURSE NUMBERING
The course numbering used by the Political Science Department reflects the format and specializa-
tion of a course more than its level of difficulty. The 100-level courses are designed to address ques-
tions of broad political interest. The courses are pitched both to those considering and not considering
political science as a major. The 200-level courses are divided between our core courses and our elec-
tives. The core courses, numbered between 201-204, serve as introductions both to the substance of
the politics and the subfields organizing the study of politics. The core courses, which were previously
numbered at the 100 level, are open to all students, including first-year students and non-majors. The
200-level elective courses provide general overviews of political processes, problems and philoso-
phies in a way generally accessible without prerequisites. 300-level courses are more specialized and
usually require prerequisites. 400-level courses are senior seminars offered for students in the major;
senior seminars also are open to juniors and to non-majors.

WINTER STUDY PROJECT
The department welcomes relevant WSP 99 proposals that can make important contributions to the
student's understanding of public affairs and politics. Majors, seniors, and students without previous
WSP 99 experience have preference.
THE JUNIOR YEAR ABROAD
A major in Political Science can be readily and usefully combined with study in a foreign country.
Normally, no more than two semester courses taken abroad in a program approved by the College
may be counted toward the requirements for a degree in Political Science.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE
The Political Science Department grants honors to candidates who, (1) complete the Senior Semi-
nar, (2) receive at least a grade of 3.50 on a Senior Thesis (493-W031-494), and (3) have a minimum
GPA of 3.5 in Political Science.
To become a candidate for honors the student must, (1) apply in the second semester of the junior
year, (2) submit a research proposal acceptable to the department's honors committee and for which
an appropriate advisor is available, and (3) have a minimum GPA of 3.5 in Political Science for the
first six semesters. (Political Science 493-W031-494 DO NOT count toward the total of nine required
of all majors.)
ADVANCED STUDY IN AMERICAN POLITICS
The Department of Political Science provides the opportunity for an unusually gifted student to
engage in an entire year's advanced research in American politics under singularly favorable condi-
tions. Supported by income derived from an endowment fund, the student, designated the Sentinels of
the Republic Scholar (after the name of the fund), receives a substantial research stipend to cover costs
associated with the proposed project.
This unique research course (Political Science 481-W033-482) is designed to encourage the pur-
suit of excellence among the most talented Williams students of Political Science. Admission to it is
awarded to the most distinguished candidate on the basis of demonstrated capacity for outstanding
work and of the project's promise for creative contributions to the understanding of American politics,
political institutions and thought.
PSCI 100(F) (Section 01) Asia and the World (Same as Asian Studies 201)*
Asia looms large in contemporary world politics: Japan is gradually assuming an expanded regional
national security role; The People's Republic of China is emerging as a multifaceted Great Power;
India is challenged by rising ethno-nationalism; and Indonesia is wracked by the economic disloca-
tions of the 1997 financial crisis. This course will explore both the historical background and current
dynamics of political and economic issues in these four countries, drawing on themes of imperialism,
nationalism, and globalization.
Format: lecture. Requirements: two short papers and a final exam.
No prerequisites. It is an introductory class and, therefore, no prior coursework in Political Science or
Asian studies is necessary. Enrollment limit: 60 (expected: 60).

PSCI 101(S) (Section 02) Seminar: Moral and Political Reasoning (W)
How do we make difficult moral decisions: from empathy and concern, or impartial reason? How
should we make moral decisions? Do justice and morality require that we give equal consideration to
everyone in society? And what about concern for the lives and conditions of people outside one's
country? Moral and political thinkers have always disagreed on the motives and considerations that
should guide people's judgements. Nowhere is this disagreement more apparent than in political
theory and practice. When considering whether a public policy is fair and just, some say we should
consider only whether it contributes to the overall or public good. Others say we should pay attention
to how a policy affects specific groups--or even how a policy or action affects those we love. This
course examines these and other dilemmas in our moral and political reasoning and decision-making
by examining both classic texts in moral and political theory and recent readings on concrete issues,
such as abortion, the morality of public officials, refugee policy, and human rights.
Seminar style, discussion based format.

PSCI 120(F) America and the World After September 11
The terrorist attacks of September 11 and the war in Afghanistan raised fundamental questions about
the past and future course of American foreign policy. While virtually no one defended the terrorist
attacks, many academics argued that the root causes of September 11th were supposedly to be found
in the flaws of the American approach to the world. In this view, America is an arrogant, unilateralist
country that ignores the views and perspectives of the rest of the world community, relies far too much
on its overwhelming military power, and often acts against its ideals and values by supporting repres-
sive and unpopular regimes. This course has three primary objectives. First, we will assess important
critiques of contemporary American foreign policy from both the left and right of the political spec-
trum. Second, we will examine the historical and intellectual background of both supporters and crit-
ics of American foreign policy in the post Vietnam War era. Third, in the aftermath of September 11
we will attempt to answer the most important question of all for any analysis of American foreign
policy: What is to be done? While current issues of American foreign policy will be addressed in this
class, potential students should note that its primary focus is not placed on the technical/military ele-
ments of combating terrorism.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: assignments will include weekly response papers, two 5-
to 7-page papers, and a comprehensive in-class final exam. Students will also be required to obtain

PSCI 201(F,S) (formerly 110) Power, Politics, and Democracy in America
A survey of American politics critically examining and questioning the vitality and viability of de-
mocracy in the United States. It begins by examining what kind of political system the founders had in
mind and reviews recent theories of power and of how and whether the people rule. We will consider
how important it is to broaden participation and to include groups, such as women and minorities, who
have been historically excluded from politics. After an overview of the politics of American national
institutions--elections, Congress, the presidency, and the Supreme Court--the course concludes by
addressing three questions: How well does American democracy anticipate, assess, and solve prob-
lems? Does everyone have some power in the political process? Does democratic practice produce
public policy which has equitable outcomes?
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: participation in class discussion, a midterm and/or final

PSCI 202(F,S) (formerly 120) World Politics: An Introduction to International Relations
International politics differs from domestic politics in the absence of centralized, legitimate institu-
tions. Anarchy characterizes the world of sovereign states--there is no world government, nor agree-
ment that one is desirable or even possible. This lack of a common authority means that any dispute
among countries is up to the countries themselves to settle, by negotiating, appealing to shared norms,
or using force. For this reason, while international relations involves many of the same topics that
consume domestic politics--ethnic antagonisms, spending on aid, war, national identity, inequality,
weapons manufacture, finance, loans, pollution, migration--it shares few of the same processes for
dealing with them. This course covers problems central to international relations. It considers the im-
portance that this radical decentralization has for achieving values we hold, and examines processes
that might undermine or support the anarchical system in which we live.

PSCI 203(F) Introduction to Political Theory
What is justice? What does it entail for individuals and communities? How can it be secured, socially
and politically? Who decides? On what basis? These questions have been controversial since their
earliest formulations, and they remain controversial now. This course introduces the study of political
theory by exploring some of the key controversies. Drawing on both contemporary and classic theo-
ries, and using practical examples from today's world, we will examine justice in relation to such
themes as authority, equality, democracy, power, oppression, liberalism, capitalism, bureaucracy,
community, cultural pluralism, and rights. Specific theorists will vary from year to year, but may in-
clude such thinkers as Plato, Aristotle, Hobbes, Machiavelli, Locke, Rousseau, Marx, Mill,
Nietzsche, Weber, Arendt, Rawls, and Foucault.

PSCI 204(F) (formerly 140) Introduction to Comparative Politics: Dodging the Apocalypse in
South Africa*
The forces of nationalism, democracy, and capitalism dominate contemporary politics. Nations help
organize political communities, identifying who belongs with whom. Democracy sets forth a just and
legitimate way of governing the communities organized by nations. And capitalism sets terms for al-
locating resources, providing opportunities and discipline. We like to think these forces are compat-
ible, that each uniquely reinforces the other. But such is not necessarily the case, as shown by the re-
cent experience of South Africa. Capitalism and nationalism are not new to South Africa. Now they
are pillars of constitutional democracy, but before they were pillars of apartheid. This course will use
the rise, demise and aftermath of apartheid in South Africa to examine the relationship of nationalism,
democracy, and capitalism. What was apartheid and how does democracy work against the back-
ground of entrenched poverty inherited from apartheid? What is nationalism in South Africa, what is
its connection to "racism" and "racialism," and what do "democracy" and "nations" mean in a multi-
cultural and radically unequal society?

PSCI 207(F) Political Elections
Elections in American politics are dynamic events in which many different groups struggle to gain
control of political institutions at the local, state, and federal levels. During the campaigns, candidates
and their supporters move across the land, appear on television, radio, and through the printed press.
Simultaneously, various organizations and interest groups attempt to gain influence with the candi-
dates and with public opinion by raising money, making endorsements, running political appeals in
the various media, and supplying activists to work for the candidates they favor. This course explores
the factors that shape the outcome of political elections in America. Among the factors we will consid-
er are: the state of the economy, international events, the role of political parties at the state and nation-
al levels, the current partisan balance, ideology, media, special interests, money, candidates, the "hot"
issues of the moment and long enduring issues, campaign debates, media, and campaign polling and
public opinion. We will consider in detail the 2002 national elections both at the Federal level (Senate
and House) and State.
Format: lecture. Requirements: a midterm, a final, and a research paper.

PSCI 210(S) The Politics of U.S. Social Movements in the Twentieth and Twenty-First
Centuries
This course familiarizes students with the theoretical and conceptual issues that are central to the
study of social movements. It examines U.S.-based social movements that have gained salience in
U.S. politics, including those centered on civil rights policy, identity (race, gender, sexual orientation),
health, anti-war and peace efforts, students, free speech, labor, environmental justice, and anti-global-
ization activities. The course is concerned with how such efforts influence the larger political process,
public policy preferences, and the institutional political arena. It looks at pioneering sociological and
psychological explanations and more recent interpretations grouped under the broad topic of "new"
social movement theory. The course considers in detail the alternative (labor) movement in the United
States, beginning in the early twentieth century and continuing to the present, and will draw on the
research and theory in works by Piven and Cloward, Tarrow, Morris, Castelles, Garner, Freeman,
Touraine, Melucci, Boggs (Carl), and Lynd.

During most of American history, Congress dominated politics at the national level. But over the last
century, Congress has become weaker vis-à-vis the presidency at the same time that political profes-
sionals bent on winning reelection and power have taken over the institution. Has the rise of political
professionals undermined Congress' ability to function? In this course we will explore this controver-
sy and many others like it. Topics will include the evolution of Congress over the twentieth century,
congressional elections, the committee and subcommittee system, congressional leadership and the
legislative process. Questions will include the following: Have recent reforms produced a fundamen-
tal change in the way the Congress works? Why do representatives win reelection at such an astound-
ing (and some say, alarming) rate? Do Senate legislative staffs have more power over legislation than
Senators themselves? Are the committee system and television the primary causes of the seemingly
ongoing expansion of the Federal Government? Requirements: two critical essays and a self-sched-

enough negative adjectives for the bureaucracy. But are they really that bad? Whether bad or good,
virtually all that government does in modern democracies is done by bureaucracies. The administra-
tive branch of government is a powerful institution that both makes and implements public policy.
This class will consider several important questions concerning bureaucracy and democracy, includ-
ing: What are the sources of power for the bureaucracy? In what ways and to what extent is that power
limited, and by whom? How does the bureaucracy make and implement public policy? And to whom
and to what extent is the bureaucracy accountable for its actions?

Constitutional Law is offered in two courses. Students are encouraged to take them in sequence but

of politics: interpreting and applying the nation's fundamental rules. The emphasis is on the United
States Supreme Court and the exercise of judicial review. In this class we examine the ways in which
the Constitution protects individual rights while accommodating the often competing claims of
groups and communities. Some of the topics to be considered include: equal protection under law,
substantive and procedural due process, freedoms of speech and religion, and privacy. Under these
rubrics are to be found such issues as affirmative action, capital punishment, hate speech, property
rights, abortion, and gender discrimination. Much of the reading is of Supreme Court opinions that
highlight the politics of constitutional development.

A comprehensive overview to introduce students to a consolidating sub-field of study--Black Poli-

politics, both protest and conventional. Special attention will be devoted to black leadership--its
character, functions and changing influence--and sociopolitical organizations. Texts analyzed in the
course will draw from the work of Dubois, Myrdal, Jones, Carmichael and Hamilton, and Barnette.
We review theories of black participation: the political context variable, deracialized electoral cam-
paigns, cooptation and political incorporation, critical elections theory, linkage theory, and the black
utility heuristic. Among the cases to be examined in the course are Jesse Jackson's 1984 and 1988
presidential campaigns, black mayoralties, the Million Man March, and the emergence and growth of
the Black Caucus activity in congress and legislatures.
Format: discussion/lecture. Requirements: several short critical response papers, and one 12-15 page

PSCI 218(F) Presidential Politics
The American president is commonly seen as the focal point of American politics and the most pow-
erful person in the federal government. Yet, presidential power is severely limited by other political
actors and institutions (Congress, government agencies, foreign governments, the media and interest
groups, to name just a few), and an administration's success is far from guaranteed. Only three of the
ten presidents after FDR remained in office for two full terms. Three were defeated during reelection
bids; two did not bother trying to run for reelection; one resigned to avoid impeachment; another bare-
ly survived removal by the Senate and one was assassinated. In this course we will study why the
modern president is at once so powerful and so weak. Topics will include the dynamics of presidential
power, the presidential selection process, the ongoing struggle between the White House and Con-
gress, and the presidential relationship with the mass media. While the primary focus will be on the
modern presidency, there will also be consideration of the historical development of this office. Re-
quirements: two critical essays and several group simulations. No prerequisites. Open to first-year

ment limit: 24 (expected 24).

PSCI 223(S) International Law
International law embodies the rules that govern the society of states. It spells out who can be a state
and how to become one, what states can do, what they cannot do, and who can punish transgressions;
it also determines the status of other actors, like international organizations, heads of state, refugees,
transnational religious institutions and multinational corporations. International law is like domestic
law, with one difference: the same group that makes the law enforces it. In other respects it is the same:
it protects the status quo, including the distribution of power among its members; it spells out legiti-
mate and illegitimate ways of resolving conflicts of interest; it is biased toward the powerful; it tells its
members how to act to coordinate their interests and minimize direct conflict; some of it is laughable
and purely aspirational, some of it necessary for survival. And like domestic law, it is enforced only
some of the time, and then against the weak more than the strong. Yet law is still where we look first
for justice. This course will examine the historical bases of contemporary international law, its devel-
opment since World War II in the context of American hegemony, and current dilemmas in its prac-
tice. Students will study historical materials as well as cases.

PSCI 225(S) International Security
What is security? While international security once primarily referred to military conflict and the
threat of nuclear war, today it often refers to the environment, the movement of peoples, biological
and chemical weapons, and other non-traditional sources of insecurity. This class examines a wide
range of conceptions and problems of international security, traditional and non-traditional, and con-
siders the prospects for cooperation to overcome these threats. It first asks whether the focus of securi-
ty studies should be individual human beings, states, the world as a whole, or something else. It then
asks whether security should be seen as primarily competitive, so that one's security can only be en-
hanced by threatening the security of another, or primarily cooperative, so that one's security is best
protected by increasing the security of others. It also evaluates the various mechanisms by which
states and non-state actors can act to increase the security of individuals, groups, and the world, as well
as the extent to which they are likely to act in these ways.

PSCI 229(F) Global Political Economy
Thirty years ago the production, distribution, consumption and accumulation of goods, services and
capital were predominantly national, organized by nation-states and within national territories. Today
they all are increasingly global in scope, and nation-states find themselves more and more the subjects
of mobile transnational corporations, international trade tribunals, global currency markets and natu-
ral resources cartels than their masters. All of these developments have direct and far-reaching effects
on the power of states, the wealth of societies, and the life chances of billions of people around the
world. This course offers a broad introduction to the politics of global economic relations, emphasiz-
ing the inherent and inseparable intertwining of politics and economics, power and wealth, the state
and the market. It begins with a short overview of liberal, economic Nationalist, Marxist and green
theoretical traditions (including Smith, Keynes, List, Marx, Polanyi and others) and a study of the
emergence of the contemporary global order. We will examine both global trade and global finance,
along the way focusing on important issues of current interest including free trade and the WTO, the
spread of transnational corporations, dollarization, international labor standards, uneven develop-
ment and the cultural underpinnings of consumerism.

range of issues, including the character of, and intersections between, modernity, liberalism, and the
market, as well as how women and the property-less are figured by these texts. We begin by outlining
the origins of modernity as developed in the works of More, Machiavelli and Luther; second, we trace
the impact of the Reformation in England, focusing on the Putney Debates and on the social contract
theories of Hobbes and Locke; third, we look at the extension and eventual subversion of the social
contract in the work of Rousseau and Hume; the course concludes with a series of revisions to the
modern, liberal tradition, from the rights of man to a liberalism without rights, as developed in the
work of Paine, Burke, Wollstonecraft and Bentham. Through all of these discussions, we consider the
nature of political theory.

PSCI 234(S) Rhetoric, Politics, Demonology
Given a contemporary political context defined by a nearly ubiquitous, that is global, use of a rhetoric
of evil and of evildoers, the course offers a critical look at the rhetorical connections between demon-
ology and politics. The course begins with the practice of demonology in a variety of historical peri-
ods and through the work of various authors, including God, Dante, Milton, Luther, Nietzsche, Mel-
ville, Publius, Tocqueville, Ronald Reagan and G.W. Bush. We ask: Why do politicians regularly use
religious imagery in their political rhetoric? What is it about religious rhetoric that seems to have an
enduring appeal for established politicians as well as for would-be reformers and reactionaries? Is
there something in the very structure of political and rhetorical argumentation that makes religious
demonology a `natural' partner? And should we feel at all uncomfortable when we hear sacred imag-
ery invoked in the `profane' world of politics? The course, then, concludes with a more general set of
theoretical questions on the nature and value of rhetorical speech: Does rhetoric, by definition, contra-
dict truthful speech? If so, what is at stake when we use rhetorical figures in speaking politically? Or,
in contrast, does rhetoric play a more substantial, even constructive, role in the life of the citizen, espe-
cially the citizen of a democracy? Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: regular class participa-

PSCI 236(S) Latin American Political Thought: A Survey*
The main objective of this course is to explore various traditions in Latin American political theoriz-
ing. Generally, the canon in the discipline of political theory/philosophy is limited to European and
North American contributions. Moreover, most courses in Latin American politics focus on empirical
problems. In this course we shall address these two concerns by examining key texts in the history of
political theory in the Spanish-American continent. In this way we will see how the unique experience
of Latin American theorists draws on both indigenous and European sources to create something new.
We will begin by considering the work of Bartolomé de las Casas, Francisco de Vitoria, and other
Catholic thinkers of the Colonial period. As we consider Latin American republican thought, we shall
see how Simon Bolívar was influenced by the European continental republican tradition. We will ex-
plore the thought of José Martí, Rodó, and Sarmiento. The Marxist tradition, in dialogue with the Eu-
ropean experience, will also be examined as we read Mariátegui and the later work or Ernesto Ché

the post-modern `indigenismo' of Subcomandate Marcos.

PSCI 300(S) Research Design and Methods
In social science research, clear rules govern how cases can be chosen, how causation can be inferred,
and how disconfirming evidence can be recognized and assessed. This course teaches those rules.
Every week, students will learn, apply, and evaluate a research technique. We will discuss how to state
a researchable question and how to determine what counts as an answer to that question. We will con-
sider what constitutes valid evidence, how to identify and evaluate alternative explanations for the
same event, and how to separate coincidence from cause. Students will do interviews, surveys, archi-
val research, case studies and field studies. The course assumes no statistics, nor will it teach statistics;
instead, our focus will be on the other issues involved in conceiving and executing a research project
in the social sciences.
Class will meet 3 times a week and one class will be a lab.
Format: lab. Requirements: weekly papers applying a method or research problem to a topic chosen
by the student or class.

PSCI 303T(S) Opening Pandora's Box?: Moral and Political Issues in Genetic Research
(W)
Recent developments in genetic research, particularly those involving the potential cloning of hu-
mans, raise profound and distinctive moral and political questions. This tutorial proposes to engage
both kinds of questions. Morally, we will consider how to think about the consequences of genetic
research, the extent to which scientists should have considerable autonomy in these matters, the diffi-
culty of making decisions about the costs and benefits of genetic engineering when both are unknown,
and the implications of trying to decide questions of the definition and limits of human life in the ab-
sence of widely agreed ethical standards. Do issues raised by genetic research require the government
to regulate science and, if so, how extensively and on what basis? Politically, this tutorial will consider
some of the factors that underpin and influence the moral decisions. How does American politics typi-
cally deal with issues of "slippery slopes," where most of the public wants the benefits provided by a
certain endeavor yet deeply fears some of the eventual outcomes? And how, in the particular case of
genetic engineering, is public opinion and public policy being influenced by the biotechnology indus-
try? To those ends, we will consider the sources of public opinion and examine the interests and influ-
ence of the biotechnology industry in the United States. Finally, we will consider whether these issues
can be addressed adequately by any nation state. Does the fact of globalization obstruct governments

come of the research can be found?

PSCI 305T(F) The Challenges of Knowing: The Holocaust
Although we may be mistaken about something we have ourselves experienced, we often take direct
experience to be valid on its face. How do we know about events that occurred outside our ken? The
distinction between knowledge as truth, based on direct knowledge, and mere opinion unhinged from
direct observation, has a long lineage. It has given birth to the field of epistemology, the study of truth
and how best to obtain and represent it. The tutorial will consider the matter of truth and its telling
using a variety of case studies from the Holocaust. How can we, who have no memories of the events
of the Holocaust, come to know it? There is a wide variety of ways of seeking and representing truth:
memoir, testimony, documents of the time, oral history, each derived from participants. There are also
accounts given by non-participants: documentary producers, historians, sociologists, and others using
the tools of their disciplines. In addition to concerns about inaccuracy and misrepresentation, truth is
often altered by the purpose of the inquiry. For example, legal proceedings consider testimony and
evidence under specific rules to determine issue of guilt and punishment standards. How do criteria
for truth and validity differ for a serious historian, or a casual reader? One case we shall consider is that
of Adolph Eichmann. What role did he play in the "final solution"? We have a variety of sources we
can examine for the facts: a film of his trial in an Israeli court; philosopher Hannah Arendt's contem-
poraneous account of that trial and her interpretation; Eichmann's published interrogation by the Is-
raelis before the trial; and, his own memoir written during and after his trial. In additional we will
examine documentaries of various kinds and approaches, fictional accounts, and books by historians
and others. In all of the instances we shall explore what it means to determine facts; gain comprehen-
sion, assign blame (legal or moral, or both); and, the challenge of point of view (contrasting objective
historical depiction at a distance as against subjective intimate experience as a participant). By the end
of the tutorial, students will have gained a fuller understanding of the challenges of knowing. Students
will discover how rich experience can be distorted and compressed even when those seeking are do-
ing so with the best of intentions (though we will also consider instances of misrepresentation both
intentional and not).
Format: tutorial. Each student will write and present orally an essay of approximately seven double-
spaced pages every other week on an assigned topic (the written essays will be briefer in the first
month, 5-6 pages, somewhat longer in the second, 6-7, and 7-9 in the third). Students not presenting
have the responsibility of critically reviewing the work of the colleague. There will be a final written
exercise and students will be evaluated on this exercise, their essays, and their critical reviews.

PSCI 310(S) Political Psychology (Same as Psychology 345)
Political psychology studies the heart of politics. For example, many political philosophers begin their
political programs with foundational claims about "human nature." These claims are then used to sup-
port their vision of politics. Claims about progress presume that human nature will be improved with
the right political change. For example, the enlightenment held that rationality would be strengthened
by progress, and thereby make democracy more viable. Those who defend authoritarian regimes
often do so by proclaiming that the general public is incapable of self-rule and must accept rule by
their betters. Many of these arguments turn on how rational people are and their capacity and willing-
ness to pursue justice for all people. We explore what psychology tells us about people as political
citizens and leaders. Political psychology explores how people understand and act in and on the world
around them. More specifically, when people attend to politics and how people make political judg-

PSCI 315(S) American Political Parties
Political parties are critical to the workings of modern, mass democracy. They significantly simplify
voting decisions for most people, and they act as a bridge between the institutions of government and
the mass public that the state is supposed to represent. But they are also organizations riddled with
inconsistencies. To be effective, parties must remain united and present a consistent ideology. Yet,
especially in American politics, many factors push them towards disunity: The government is divided
into different and often conflicting institutions; parties run candidates in many different individual,
winner-take-all district and state elections, and ideological leanings in America vary widely by loca-
tion; and these parties must act as umbrella organizations for a wide range of interest groups. Thus, the
Democrats try to gain support in both Massachusetts and Mississippi while the Republicans attempt to
hold together a fragile alliance of libertarians and social conservatives. In this course, we will explore
the contradictory demands on parties and attempt to uncover how they resolve these political dilem-
mas. We will also scrutinize American parties from a comparative perspective; we will study the pos-
sibilities for, or plight of, third parties in the United States; and we will examine the evolution of major
parties in America over the past two centuries.

Why have Islamic movements become so powerful in the last 30 years? What are their real political
goals? Is political Islam a rejection of modernity, a reaction to Western culture, or an ideology aimed at
specific political objectives? Does the rise of political Islam herald an inevitable "clash of civilization-
s" with the West, or can Islam and the West peacefully co-exist? Questions such as these have become
increasingly urgent since September 11. This course will examine the emergence, development, and
substantive content of Islamist political movements in the twentieth century. The tutorial focuses
upon the emergence of Islamist movements within distinctive political, economic, social and cultural
conditions in the Middle East. It will juxtapose analytical readings on specific states or aspects of the
Islamic trend with the writings of Islamists and other primary sources. We will look both at Islamist
movements active in single states, the wider phenomenon of transnational Islamist politics, and the

PSCI 327(F) The Global Politics of Development and Underdevelopment*
Consider a photograph of the Earth at night taken from space. What will you see? Great agglomera-
tions of light in some parts of the world (North America, Western Europe, parts of East Asia) con-
trasted with vast expanses of darkness in other parts (much of Central and South America, Southeast
Asia and nearly all of Africa). This pattern of light and darkness depicts a vastly unequal global dis-
tribution of technology, urban infrastructure, capital accumulation--in short, the global patterns of
development and underdevelopment. What makes some areas `light' and some areas 'dark'? More
importantly, how are these areas connected--both within and across national boundaries--through
commodity chains, capital mobility, migration, political authority and the natural environment? What
are the relations between development and underdevelopment?
This course is an investigation of political, economic and societal growth (or lack thereof) and change
in the Global North and Global South through the lenses of International Political Economy and Polit-
ical Ecology. Thus we will focus in particular on the global factors influencing development and un-
derdevelopment, political-economic connections across national borders, and the intersections of
power, production and nature. During our course of study we will cover topics such as theories of
development and industrialization, urban-rural relations, urban bias in development policy, industrial
agriculture, global agricultural trade, food security and hunger, international development organiza-
tions (WTO, World Bank, UNCTAD, Food and Agriculture Organization), peasant rebellions, `re-
source wars,' sustainable development and `eco-imperialism'.

What does it mean to be "equal" in society today? Why has equality increasingly come to be seen as a
requirement of basic justice in liberal democracies? This course serves as an introduction to the sub-
ject of equality and its importance to liberal and democratic political theory and practice. Some central
questions posed in the course include: Is it is enough to be formally equal in the eyes of the law, or do
people require equal resources, opportunities and capacities in order to be truly "equal"? Can liberal
democratic states deliver on promises of justice and fairness in the absence of comprehensive social
equality and equitable economic distribution? Is it the state's role to foster such equality? The course
disentangles different forms of equality (such as economic, political, sexual, racial and cultural equal-
ity) and assesses the merit of several concrete solutions to inequality, such as affirmative action and
policies promoting multiculturalism.

PSCI 334(S) Critical Theory
Compelling political theories often arise in response to real-world crises. The early twentieth century
witnessed not one, but a series of world-historical crises, from Fascism and Stalinism, to the vagaries
of imperial capitalism. What, then, was the theoretical reply? The course explores one of the more
influential responses, as developed in the thought of Walter Benjamin, T.W. Adorno, and Herbert
Marcuse, members of the Frankfurt School of critical theory. We begin with a brief primer on Hegel
and Marx, with special emphasis on key concepts that are subsequently developed or challenged by
our three theorists. The balance of the course examines how critical theory has pursued such themes as
bourgeois art and architecture, mass media and the culture industry, technological administration and
alienation, aesthetic transcendence and genuine communication-themes that are connected by a
shared effort, made by all three men, to understand, and to offer means of escaping, assorted patholo-
gies of twentieth-century life, especially those generated by National Socialism and by advanced in-
dustrial capitalism. The course concludes with a critical look at our critical theorists and their rele-
vance for our own pathological early twenty-first century. Format: seminar, with a weekly introducto-
ry lecture and discussion. Requirements: Regular class participation; weekly précis assignments (one
pg.); one essay (20-25 pgs.), which includes an in-class presentation on the essay topic.

The "public sphere," one of the core concepts of modern democratic thought, has taken on renewed
significance in intellectual life today. This writing-intensive seminar looks briefly at the evolution of
the term, but concentrates on its relevance to contemporary politics. Our investigations will center on
the character and meanings of public space. We will look at space both as a key metaphor in political
theory and as a medium of everyday practical struggle: that is, we will examine not only some of the
most influential conceptions of public life, but also the political forces shaping and shaped by the
practical design and use of the built environment. These examinations will combine critical reading
and analytical writing with field observations, group work, and oral presentations. Our primary focus
will be on the following topics: the relationship between ideas of citizenship and models of the public;
the racing, gendering, and class-stratification of spaces (civic, residential, commercial, etc.); urbanity
and suburbanization; the kinds of spaces and politics opened and closed by the internet and contempo-
rary mass media; the effects of contemporary processes of globalization on political identity and dem-
ocratic practices. Likely authors include Arendt, Berman, Davis, Delany, Foucault, Fraser, Gamson,
Habermas, Hall, Harvey, Holston, Sennett, Sunstein, Virilio.

positivist, sociological, natural law, and realist schools of jurisprudence. Students become acquainted
with the contributions of such crucial figures as Marshall, Lincoln, Pound, Holmes, Cardozo, Frank-
furter, Hart, Fuller, and Dworkin. Case materials illustrate the various perspectives on the law. An
important object of the course is to consider and evaluate the application of the contrasting approaches
to actual problems of constitutional abjudication. Among the broader issues discussed in the context
of these considerations are the legal enforcement of morality, the moral grounds for disobedience to
law, the nature and limits of judicial lawmaking, and the rationale for legal punishment.

This class analyzes the general political-economic contours of the world economy since 1945 and
considers how several states in East Asia have worked within this context to secure national wealth
and power. The first half of the course considers global flows of trade, production, direct investment
and finance and how these create both constraints and opportunities for national development. The
second half of the semester is devoted to a more detailed study of how Taiwan, South Korea and other
East-Asian states have responded to globalization: How "developmental states" have fostered eco-
nomic transformation; how that economic change has, in turn, promoted democratization; and how
democracy and globalization have ultimately undermined the foundations of the developmental state.

SENIOR COURSES
PSCI 410(S) Senior Seminar in American Politics
The focal point of this research seminar will be on the state of American democracy early in its third
century. Two elements provide a basis for judging the state of American politics: first, we begin with a
comparison of politics at the founding of the Republic with the state of politics in our own time; sec-
ond, each seminar participant will engage in research on a particular aspect of American politics.
Among the topics that will be considered are: the competing conceptions of democracy; the appropri-
ate roles of the various institutions of politics (the press, political parties, local, state, and national poli-
tics); and, the social and economic systems and their diverse effects. Combined, these two elements
will enable the seminar to consider how the American political system has changed and whether it has
changed for the better and/or worse. Has the increasing diversity of the American population, the
growth of imperial responsibility, the impact of the world economy on America (and of the American
economy on the world), the pace of technological change, among other modern features, made demo-
cratic politics more or less possible?
Format: discussion. Requirements: a research paper and oral presentations in the seminar.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15 (expected: 10-12). Senior majors have precedence.
Hour: 1:10-3:50 T MARCUS
PSCI 420(F) (Section 01) Senior Seminar in International Relations: Sovereignty
International relations theory takes multiple sovereignty to be the defining feature of world politics. In
this capstone seminar, we will throw into question the two main assumptions underlying this conten-
tion, that international boundaries decisively affect the way that global issues are conceived and
solved, and that international boundaries are a permanent, or natural, fact of life. We will begin by
analyzing the consequences that boundaries have for achieving human values in a variety of areas,
and will then examine what creates and maintains those boundaries in the first place. Readings will
include works on the origins and functions of the state and on challenges to its legal and practical
omnipotence posed by such developments as intercontinental and spaced-based weapons delivery
systems, Western cultural hegemony, the idea of universalism as encapsulated in human rights law
and in ecology, global finance, and so on. Our focus is not only on what the state does, but also, simul-
taneously, on what it is.
Format: seminar. Requirements: Students are required to submit a biweekly summary and critique of
the readings, and have the choice in addition of either completing two seven-page papers on assigned,
common topics or submitting a fifteen-page research paper on a unique topic. Each student will also
co-lead the seminar twice during the term.
Prerequisites: senior standing; political science major; two classes in international relations. Permis-
sion of the instructor is required for this course. Enrollment limit: 16 (expected: 16). Permission of the
instructor is required for this course.
Hour: 9:55-11:10 TR SHANKS
PSCI 420(F) (Section 02) Senior Seminar in International Relations: Politics of Human
Rights
If the state is matter, then the idea of human rights is antimatter. Legally and analytically, multiple
sovereignty and universal human rights cannot coexist. Human rights, or indeed any universal, im-
plies a standard over and above that of the state, from which one can judge state behavior--but the
state cannot, by definition, be sovereign if a higher standard exists. Similarly, if states are truly sover-
eign, there can be no such thing as human rights, but merely "rights" that each government separately
accords its subjects. These two ideas, human rights and sovereignty, should explode when they touch
Political Science
­ 272 ­
each other. But they don't. Instead, they not only coexist, but are jointly embedded in the UN Charter.
In practice, states, individuals, groups and international organizations appeal to both ideas as a way to
protect their interests. This course will cover the history of human rights as an ideal, then will focus on
the way the idea is used in international and domestic politics: who benefits from the idea that there are
human rights? What are the relationships between human rights and American hegemony, and human
rights and global capitalism? Under what circumstances do human rights appeals affect state behav-
ior? To what extent are human rights a discardable tool, to what extent a permanently embedded fea-
ture of the contemporary world?
Format: seminar. Requirements: Students are required to submit a biweekly summary and critique of
the readings, and have the choice in addition of either completing two seven-page papers on assigned,

PSCI 420(S) (Section 03) Senior Seminar in International Relations: Globalization and
Terror
This seminar will critically examine whether or not the recent war on terrorism has fundamentally
altered trends of globalization that have been unfolding for the last thirty years or so. Class work will
proceed in two parts. First, we will read about globalization. We will not read everything there is to
read about globalization; nor will we attempt to survey all theoretical perspectives on globalization.
Rather, we will plumb a particular line of thought, drawn mostly from neo-Marxists writers, to famil-
iarize ourselves with some of the major issues. The second part of the course will center on individual
student research projects. Each student will choose some facet of the recent war on terrorism (e.g.,
whether it is a "war" or not; how "terrorism" is defined; how it has affected the movement of goods
and people around the world; whether it has had important cultural effects; etc.) and, throughout the
entire semester will comb journalistic and academic sources for information.
Format: seminar. Requirements: All students will write a 5-page paper on one of the books we read
together. Each student will make a presentation to the class on the topic of his or her research and,
finally, each will write a 20-page research paper engaging the question of how that particular aspect of
the war on terrorism has influenced larger processes of globalization.

sion of the instructor is required for this course. Enrollment limit 16; expected 16.

PSCI 420(S) (Section 04) Senior Seminar in International Relations: American Hegemony
and the Future of the International System
Since the time of Thucydides, world politics has always been a story of several great powers compet-
ing for power, wealth, and security. The collapse and dissolution of the Soviet Union, however, left the
United States in a position of dominance that has no parallel in history. This course examines how
international relations theorists and American policymakers have grappled with the dilemmas and
opportunities of global hegemony since 1989, with a particular focus on the challenges that have
emerged in the aftermath of September 11. Will other powers, such as China or a united Europe, inevi-
tably challenge American dominance? Should America actively seek to promote its ideas and values
throughout the world? Does a hegemon have unique and special responsibilities for advancing inter-
national justice? What kind of grand strategy should the United States pursue, both now and in the
future? Why does so much of the world seem to resent American hegemony?
Format: seminar. Requirements: course assignments will include weekly papers and a 25- to 30-page
research paper.
Prerequisites: two courses in international relations. Course enrollment strictly limited to senior polit-
ical science majors. Permission of the instructor is required for this course. Enrollment limit:16 (ex-
pected: 16).

PSCI 430(F) Senior Seminar in Political Theory: Body, Man, Citizen: An Anatomy of
Thomas Hobbes
His contemporaries called him the "Monster of Malmsbury," and accused him of every manner of
godlessness and of profanity, while Karl Marx apparently once mumbled that he was "the father of us
all," a paternal affiliation regularly repeated by modern-day political scientists. What is it about the
work of Thomas Hobbes that elicits such strong, yet mutually contradictory, responses, even into our
own day? In exploring that question, this seminar offers an in-depth look at Hobbes's writings and
attempts to identify the pathology of his monstrous paternity. Through a kind of textual dissection, we
take three cuts at the monster: first, we strip away his more well-known political and psychological
theories, and expose his scientific ideas on mechanical bodies in motion; second, we graft onto this
Political Science
­ 273 ­
mechanical body Hobbes's psychological egoism, which posits an endlessly ravenous human nature;
and third, we complete the reanimation of the monster with the addition of Hobbes's more explicitly
political theories, on contract, on authority and obligation, and on state sovereignty. Through this ana-
lytical division and reconstitution, the seminar exposes the student not only to a fearsome synthetic
thinker but to some of the enduring themes in western political thought, for Hobbes's synthesis of the
political, economic and scientific developments of his day helps to illuminate the ongoing quest for a
science of politics in our time.
Format: seminar. Requirements: regular class participation; weekly written précis assignments (one
page); and three essays (5-7 pgs.).
Prerequisites: junior or senior standing and two courses in political theory. Permission of the instruc-
tor is required for this course. Enrollment limit: 16 (expected: 8-12). Preference to Political Science

PSCI 481(F)-W033-482(S) Advanced Study in American Politics
A year of independent study under the direction of a member or members of the Political Science
faculty, to be awarded to the most distinguished candidate based upon competitive admissions. Can-
didates submit a research proposal to the department prior to May of their junior year. The successful
candidate, designated the Sentinels of the Republic Scholar, receives a substantial research stipend to
cover costs associated with the proposed project. The Sentinels Scholar may submit her/his essay for
consideration for honors in Political Science.
Admission is awarded on the basis of demonstrated capacity for distinguished work and on the pro-
posal's promise for creative contributions to the understanding of topics on: the federal system of gov-
ernment; the American political economy; civil liberties; state, local, and federal relationships; or the
philosophical foundations or problems of American constitutional democracy. Proposals that deal
with these topics from a variety of perspectives (such as domestic, comparative, international, or phil-
osophical) are welcome. Anyone with a prospective proposal should contact the department chair for
further guidance.
PSCI 493-W031-494 Senior Thesis
The senior major, having applied for and been accepted into the honors program during the second
semester of the junior year, will devote the senior year to researching and writing a substantial and
original work of scholarship, under the supervision of a faculty mentor to be assigned by the depart-
ment. The final work will be submitted for evaluation by a committee made up of the faculty supervi-
sor and two additional readers to be chosen by the department, in consultation with the supervisor.
Thesis writers will not only work with their advisors but will participate in a weekly honors seminar
supervised by a faculty member in political science. The seminar (which is one component of the
493-W031-494 designation and not a separate course) will meet for the entire year and will provide a
focused forum for the exchange of ideas among the honors students. Students will regularly circulate
sections of their theses-in-progress for peer review and critique. The faculty seminar leader's primary
role is one of coordination and guidance, not evaluation.

PSYC 322(S) Concepts: Mind, Brain, and Culture
How does conceptual knowledge differ across cultural groups? How do the categories of experts dif-
fer from the categories of novices? Do children have the same kind of conceptual knowledge as
adults? How are categories represented in the brain? In this course, we will explore various empirical
findings from cognitive psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and anthropology that address these
questions. In doing so, we will consider how our conceptual knowledge is a function of our mind,
brain, and culture.

PSYC 326(F) Decision-Making
Why does our ability to reason sometimes fail us? Why do we occasionally make choices that are bad
for us? We address these questions by surveying experimental approaches to understanding reasoning
and decision-making processes in human behavior, and by solving and analyzing problems that
psychologists have used to investigate these processes. Class discussion focuses on cognitive theories
of rational and irrational thinking as well as behavioral theories of suboptimal choices. Topics include
impulsiveness and self-control, the subjective values of short-term versus long-term rewards, addic-
tions and bad habits, probability judgments, gambling, and moral reasoning. Students may conduct
original research in one of these areas.

This course draws on research and theories from the fields of developmental, social, and educational
psychology to examine the interrelated processes of teaching and learning. We consider how children
learn in several different contexts (at home with parents, in classrooms, with peers). We examine a
variety of educational practices as well as exploring the child's experience of being in school. We
identify factors that influence educational outcome, such as economic status and educational practic-
es, look at differences among children and between cultures, and discuss seminal philosophies of
education such as those of Rousseau, Dewy, and Bruner.
Format: seminar. Requirements: regular reading assignments, participation in class discussions, two

This course will examine social psychological theories and research that are relevant to the under-
standing of stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination. We will take a variety of social psychological
perspectives, emphasizing sociocultural, cognitive, personality, or motivational explanations. We
will examine the impact that stereotypes and prejudice have on people's perceptions of and behaviors
toward particular groups or group members and will explore a variety of factors that tend to exacer-
bate or weaken this impact. We also will consider some of the sources of stereotypes, prejudice, and
discrimination and some of the processes through which they are maintained, strengthened, or revi-
sed. In addition, we will examine some of the effects that stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination
can have on members of stereotyped groups, as well as some implications of the social psychological
research findings for issues such as education and business and government policies. A major compo-
nent of this course will be the examination of classic and ongoing empirical research.

This course considers "the self" from a social-psychological perspective. We read and evaluate cur-

tion, judgment, and behavior. Among the many questions we consider are: Why do we both overesti-
mate the extent to which others are like us and exaggerate our personal uniqueness? Why do we over-
estimate the extent to which others notice us and pay attention to us? Why is it so difficult to accurately
recall what we used to think, and predict what we will think and do in the future? When we have a
choice of receiving information about ourselves that is accurate versus information that is flattering,
which do we choose--and why? Finally, we consider ways in which the self is conceived differently
in non-Western cultures. As part of this course, students may conduct original research in the area.
Format: seminar. Requirements: short daily thought papers, formal paper proposal, and a written/oral

RELIGION (Div. II)
Chair, Professor GEORGES DREYFUS
Professors: DARROW, DREYFUS, TAYLOR. Assistant Professors: BUELL, LEVENE, ROBSON.
MAJOR
The major in Religion is designed to perform two related functions: to expose the student to the
methods and issues involved in the study of religion as a universal phenomenon of psychological,
sociological, and cultural/historical dimensions; and to confront students with the beliefs, practices,
and values of specific religions through a study of particular religious traditions. It is a program that
affords each student an opportunity to fashion his/her own sequence of study within a prescribed basic
pattern constructed to ensure both coherence and variety. It consists of at least nine semester courses
as follows:
Required sequence courses
Religion 101 Introduction to Religion
Two seminars (courses numbered 301-309)
Religion 402 Issues in the Study of Religion
Elective courses
Five additional courses in Religion are to be selected in such a way that at least one course is taken
in both the Western and non-Western traditions. Students will construct their sequence in consultation
with departmental advisors and subject to their approval. In order to achieve a deep coverage of a
particular religious tradition or set of related problems in the study of religion, students are urged to
select three electives that together have some kind of coherence, be it cultural, historical, or topical.
Related courses from other departments or programs may be included among the three courses, and
the point of coherence can be the subject of research papers in the senior seminar.
Students are advised to elect additional courses in related fields (e.g., psychology, sociology, an-
thropology, art, history, philosophy) in order to gain a clearer understanding of the social and cultural
contexts in which religions appear.
For those who wish to go beyond the formally-listed courses into a more intensive study of a partic-
ular religious tradition, methodological trend, or religious phenomenon (e.g., ritual, symbol-forma-
tion, mysticism, theology, etc.), there is the opportunity to undertake independent study or, with the
approval of the department, to pursue a thesis project.
The value of the major in Religion derives from its fostering of a critical appreciation of the com-
plex role religion plays in every society, even those that consider themselves non-religious. The major
makes one sensitive to the role religion plays in shaping the terms of cultural discourse, of social atti-
tudes and behavior, and of moral reflection. But it also discloses the ways in which religion and its
social effects represent the experience of individual persons and communities. In doing these things,
the major further provides one with interdisciplinary analytical tools and cross-cultural experience
and opens up new avenues for dealing with both the history of a society and culture and the relation-
ships between different societies and cultures. What one learns as a Religion major is therefore re-
markably applicable to a wide range of other fields of study or professions.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN RELIGION
The degree with honors in Religion requires the above-mentioned nine courses and the preparation
of a thesis of 75+ pages with a grade of B+ or better. A thesis may combine revised work done in other
courses with new material prepared while enrolled either in Religion 493-W031 or Religion
W031-494. Up to two-thirds of the work in the thesis may be such revised work, but at least one-third
must represent new work. The thesis must constitute a coherent whole either by its organizing theme
or by a focus on a particular religious tradition. Candidates will also be expected to present the results
of their thesis orally in a public presentation. Students who wish to be candidates for honors in
Religion will submit proposals and at least one paper that will be included in the thesis to the depart-
ment in the spring of their junior year. Students must have at least a 3.3 GPA in Religion to be consid-
ered for the honors program.
The chair will serve as advisor to non-majors.
REL 101(F,S) Introduction to Religion
As an examination of the structure and dynamics of certain aspects of religious thought, action, and
sensibility--employing psychological, sociological, anthropological, and philosophical modes of in-
quiry--the course offers a general exposure to basic methodological issues in the study of religion,
and includes consideration of several cross-cultural types of religious expression in non-literate and
literate societies.

(Not offered 2002-2003)
(See under Classics for full description.)
REL 203(F) Introduction to Judaism (Same as Classics 203) (W)
A proselyte once asked both Rabbi Shammai and Rabbi Hillel to explain Judaism while standing on
one foot. Shammai drove the person off with a stick while Hillel gently reduced Judaism to one
principle. The difficulty of defining such a complex religious system explains Shammai's anger and
renders Hillel's over-simplification suspect. This course seeks to provide a more sure-footed under-
standing of the Jewish religion. While recognizing the value of an essentialist approach, the course
also conveys the multifaceted, indefinable character of Judaism. Therefore we will examine Juda-
ism from four different yet complementary aspects: history, theology, text, and ritual. The examina-
tion of Jewish ritual and practice will especially help to integrate our understanding of Jewish histo-
ry, theology, and text just as Jewish ritual itself incorporates these elements into Jewish life.
Classes will combine lecture and discussion, and students will be required to engage in "fieldwork"
involving the observation of a communal as well as a home ritual. Evaluation will be based on four
3-page papers, a 6- to 8-page final paper, a 2-page write-up of the fieldwork, and 2 major quizzes.
Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 16). This course is writing intensive.

REL 205(F) Zion: Perspectives, Narratives, Desires
The concept of Zion is one of the more rich and complex in the Jewish tradition. It is at once an idea,
a time, a place, and a dream; it can be approached historically, philosophically, theologically, and
politically; and it is a notion both central and peripheral, heavenly and worldly, orthodox and het-
erodox, unifying and contested. Zion is part of the dual structure that, with Sinai, constitutes the
covenant, the constitution, of Israel. If Sinai is the promise to Israel that it will flourish, Zion is the
fulfillment of this promise: the space of Israel's sovereignty, the place where the covenant can be
enacted, the idea of redemption, and the dream of peace. These are the two poles that have oriented
the Jews through history. And yet, if Sinai has been a stabilizing force over time, Zion has given rise
to a great deal more insecurity. Where is it? What is it? This course will pursue some of the many
threads that spin out from this insecurity, in particular the dimensions of Zion as both a messianic
ideal and a political reality. These dimensions are not as far apart as might be thought. In some mes-
sianic visions, the political plays a prominent role and, by the same token, in some political Zion-
isms, the utopian and/or messianic dimension is very strong. We will therefore not be pursuing the
distinction between religion and politics per se but rather the continuities and disjunctions between,
for example, the secularized messianism of the early socialist Zionists and the messianic politics of
medieval, modern, and postmodern Jewish thinking. Complicating these tropes will help to shed
light both on the variety of responses in the tradition as a whole, as well as on contemporary
religious and political issues. Readings will include Bible and rabbinic materials, Halevi, Maimo-
nides, sixteenth century Kabbalah, Abarbanel, Hess, Herzl, Ahad Ha-Am, Leo Pinsker, Buber,
Kook, Leibowitz.

REL 245(S) Tibetan Civilization*
Often depicted in novels and movies as Shangrila, a mythical and ideal country, Tibet has had the
dubious privilege of being a focus of Western orientalism. In recent years, this fascination has given
rise to a veritable craze, which has affected particularly the entertainment culture. One cannot but
wonder about the motives and sources of this mythology. But, rather than focus narcissistically on
"our" representations, this course mostly looks at "them," examining more particularly the cultural
and historical aspects of Tibetan civilization. We first consider the early history of Tibet, the introduc-
tion of Buddhism in this country, the relations between Buddhism and the indigenous religion, and
some of the stages in the development of Tibetan Buddhism. In this way we see how Buddhism in
Tibet, like in other Buddhist countries, is integrated in an overall religious system that comprises
much more than the doctrines and practices often essentialized as "Buddhism." We also examine the
historical developments that led to the development of the institutions (such as the Dalai-Lama)
unique to Tibet and consider the more recent tragic events and what they augur for the future of the
Tibet. Throughout the course we examine the unusually central role that the complex interreaction
that religion and politics has had in Tibetan history. In this way, we get a footing in the Tibetan world
and the final part of the course, the assessment of Western representations of Tibet, becomes not just
an exercise in self-reflection but also a gate to a better understanding of a remarkable civilization.

REL 251(F) Zen History, Culture, and Critique*
This course provides an introduction to the religious history, philosophy and practices of Zen Budd-
hism. Zen is the Japanese pronunciation of the Chinese word Chan, which is itself a transcription of
the Sanskrit word dhyâna, meaning meditation. While meditation is no doubt the backbone of the Zen
tradition, this course will highlight the fact that Zen has a number of different faces, including a radical
antinomian side that challenged the role of meditation (and all forms of mediation). This course will
examine the rich diversity of the Zen tradition as it developed in China, Korea, and Japan, with the
first part providing an overview of the historical development of Zen and situating it within the Bud-
dhist tradition that it emerged out of. The second part of the course will challenge and critically evalu-
ate much of what is presented in the first half by exploring some less well known facets of Zen practice
that on first glance appear to run counter to what the Zen tradition says about itself. We will explore the
role of language in Zen from the enigmatic and abstruse use of koans to questions about why a tradi-
tion which took pride in "not being dependent on words" nonetheless produced a voluminous textural

record. We will study both the crazy antics of inspired Zen monks and the structure life of Zen monas-
tics and their rituals. Consideration will also be given to why a seemingly iconoclastic tradition like
Zen also has a long tradition of mummifying and venerating its masters. Why was Zen appealing to
the Japanese warrior class and what has been its role in modern nationalistic movements in Japan?
This course is designed to be as much an ongoing critical reflection on the history of the study of Zen
as it is about Zen history.

REL 253(F) The Taoist Religion: Immortals, Elixirs, and Revelations*
This is a course on what has been called "the unofficial high religion of China." Most popular treat-
ments of Taoism tend to present it as a kind of "go with the flow" orientation to life that can ensure
success in love, work, and even the stock market. Taoism is, however, a fully developed religion that is
not merely limited to philosophical texts like the Laozi and Zhuangzi, which have been the sources for
much of the popular imagination of Taoism. Significant as those religious classics are to Taoism, they
are just one facet of a diverse and complex religious tradition. Throughout its near two thousand year
history, Taoism developed highly structured institutions, complex liturgies and rituals, and sophisti-
cated conceptions of the body, self-cultivation, cosmology, and the natural world. In this course we
will explore the developments and transformations of the Taoist religion in its historical, cultural and
social contexts by looking at the ways that Taoism interacted with the authority of the Chinese state,
with Buddhism and with Chinese popular religion. We will have the opportunity to hone our critical
analytical skills by exploring the rich array of Taoist sacred literature, which ranges from revealed
scriptures to esoteric manuals. We will conclude the course with a critical assessment of the ways that
Taoism has been appropriated by "Western" academics, philosophers, and spiritual seekers in order to
try and understand why and how certain misconceptions and distortions of Taoism have persisted and
continue to attract popular attention despite much recent research.

COMPARATIVE INQUIRY
REL 270T(S) Father Abraham: The First Patriarch (W)
The figure of Abraham in the Hebrew scriptures is interesting for at least two reasons: he comes first
and seems more universal rather than particular. He first received the covenant and the promise of the
land of Israel, but before the full revelation of the Torah to Moses. He fathers both the Jewish people
and the Arabs and the significance of that wider identity was later captured both by Christianity in the
work of Paul and in the Qur'an where Muhammad identified with Abraham as the prototypical and
non-sectarian monotheist prophet. This course will trace the figure of Abraham by a close and multi-
disciplinary reading of the Jewish, Pagan, Christian and Muslim sources on Abraham. Our task is not
to decide on the historicity of Abraham, but rather to explore the history of the figure and his continu-
ing relevance for today in understanding Jewish/Christian/Muslim conflict and cooperation. We will
begin with an intensive reading of the Genesis material on Abraham (12-25), where the issues of idol-
atry and mono-theism, the covenant and circumcision, relations of the patriarch to his women and
sons, and primal model of faith all are articulated. We will then turn to later Jewish developments in
the figure of Abraham in midrash and apocalypse. We will then explore the view of Abraham in the
classical world, the uses made of Abraham by Christianity as it broke from an emerging Rabbinic
Judaism and the development of Abraham's specific connection with the view of the afterlife. We will
then treat the figure of Abraham in the Qur'an and later Islamic traditions. We will conclude with an
examination of the cult surrounding Abraham in the city of Hebron, a currently-contested site on the
West Bank where we will consider the current religious practice regarding Abraham by both Jews and
Muslims. The purpose of this tutorial is to read closely a variety of primary religious texts and to ex-
plore the variety of tools available for the reading of those texts.
Each student in the tutorial will write and present orally five 5- to 7-page essays every other week on
the readings for the week and a final 7- to 10-page essay. Students not presenting an essay will be
responsible for offering an oral critique of the work of their colleague. Students will be evaluated on
their written work and their critiques.

CONTEMPORARY PHILOSOPHICAL AND CRITICAL INQUIRY
REL 281(F) Atheism, Theism and Existentialism
This course is an introduction to several major thinkers in the modern Christian and Jewish West
through their views on faith and doubt. The modern period in European philosophy and theology is
usually considered to begin with a set of challenges to traditional religious world views, especially the
belief in God. While the nature and meaning of God's existence stimulated countless rich debates in
earlier centuries, these debates take on a new dimension towards the middle of the seventeenth centu-
ry. In the context of the close of the religious wars spurred by the Reformation and the emergence of a
new experimental attitude towards nature and the cosmos, many thinkers felt a need to clarify the con-
tents and parameters of religious belief and knowledge. While virtually all thinkers in this period con-
tinued to express theistic beliefs, many nevertheless struggled openly with what these beliefs entailed,
setting the groundwork for arguments against God's existence altogether and eventually stimulating
the creation of alternative ways of securing human meaning. Throughout the course we will be asking
at least two kinds of questions. First, we will pursue such conceptual questions as how have various
thinkers grappled with inherited notions of reason, revelation, nature, tradition, good and evil? What
role have doubt, skepticism, and uncertainty played in modern world views and how have these expe-
riences been related to faith? Second, we will subject the historical premises of the course to scrutiny,
asking about the very assumption that atheism inaugurates modernity. What is the validity of this
claim? Are there other events, ideas, or experiences we might identify as uniquely modern? How do
terms such as "enlightenment," "science," "freedom," "authority," and the "self" determine how we
characterize, and thus value, this period? Reading list: Pascal, Descartes, Spinoza, Mendelssohn,
Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Freud, Dostoevsky, Buber, Rosenzweig, Rilke, Sartre.

Haunting offers a powerful way to speak about forces that affect us profoundly while remaining invis-
ible or elusive. "What is it that holds sway over us like an unconditional prescription?.The distance
between us and that which commands our moves-or their opposite, our immobility-approaches us: it
is a distance that closes in on you at times, it announces a proximity closer than any intimacy or famil-
iarity you have ever known" (Avital Ronell, Dictations: On Haunted Writing [1986] xvi-xvii). The
figure of the ghost has been developed by those seeking to grapple with the ongoing effects of modern
slavery, colonialism, state-sponsored terrorism, the holocaust, and personal trauma and loss. Building
upon the insights about memory, history, and identity that haunting has been used to address, this
course will challenge students to explore the study of religion by way of its "seething absences." We
shall ask how the study of religion has endeavored to address loss, trauma, and its persistent effects,
what "holds sway" over various approaches to the study of religion, as well as how "religion" consti-
tutes its own ghostly presence, haunting other domains.
Format: tutorial. Meeting in pairs, each student will either write and present a paper or respond to their

REL 286(S) Anthropological Approaches to Religion
Anthropologists have increasingly used their methodological tools to analyze the religious practices
of particular cultures (including our own), and scholars of religion have also turned to anthropology
for methodological insights. What does an anthropological approach offer to the study of religion?
Anthropological approaches to religion have long been at the heart of the study of religion, but have
undergone dramatic shifts in orientation in recent years. We will explore how the primary concerns of
Religion
­ 286 ­
the "ancestors" of the discipline ("origins" and "primitive religions") have given way to approaches
that have been influenced by theoretical developments taking place in other academic disciplines. We
will see that it is no longer possible, for example, for anthropological studies of religion to ignore is-
sues of power, resistance, ideology, and semiotics in the study of religious institutions, ritual processes
and systems of meaning. While studies of religion have generally tended to focus more on ideas and
doctrines than on practices, we will consider how an anthropological approach to the topic can open a
window onto what people do in addition to (or as opposed to) what they say or believe. In this course
we will engage a range of anthropological theorists of religion and focus on a few key themes. Special
attention will be given to the topics of possession and exorcism, ritual, symbols and their interpreta-
tion, and tricksters. Readings will include a mixture of theoretical reflections on the field as well as
cross-cultural case studies that aim to "find the strange in the familiar and to find the familiar in the
strange." Authors considered in this course include (among others): I.M. Lewis, Mary Douglas, Roy
Rappaport, J.Z. Smith, James Boon, Arnold van Gennep, Robert Hertz, Marc Augé, Gilbert Lewis,

REL 288(S) Monasteries, Yeshivas, and other Universities: Religion and the Nature of
Education
This seminar examines traditional religious education across cultures and the role of intellectuals
therein. We start with a brief view of the social nature of education as argued by Durkheim and Weber.
We then raise the following question: Is education about the development of rationality in the intellec-
tual and moral domains as argued by Piaget, or is it more a matter of internalizing habits in the context
of institutional constraints as argued by Foucault and Bourdieu? To answer, we examine religious
education as it is found in the Christian, Jewish and Islamic traditions and discover that these tradi-
tions have been preoccupied with the same issue. We examine the different answers and models that
these traditions propose and raise further questions concerning the nature of religious education:
What is traditional religious education about: knowledge, indoctrination or the development of a
religious character? Is there a special type of knowledge or rationality in religious traditions? How
different is traditional religious education from our modern liberal arts education? We conclude by
considering the role that intellectual technologies play in education, particularly the implications of
literacy, both in the past and in the present. Reading list: Berger, The Sacred Canopy. Olson,The World
on Paper. Ong, Orality and Literacy. Street, Literacy in Theory and Practice. Halberthal, People of

tion of the contingency of events, and a form of story-telling. We will focus particularly on the rela-
tionship between truth and narration, and on the role of the human actor as the subject of analysis. The
course will examine both writers that seek to link history with some larger purpose (e.g., providence)
as well as those that seek to limit its scope to the genealogy of values, or the telling of true stories.
Particular attention will be paid to such issues as interpretation, temporality, objectivity, representa-
tion, and perspective.
Authors may include Plato, St. Augustine, Vico, Rousseau, Hegel, Nietzsche, and a selection of more
recent writers (e.g., Michel Foucault, Hayden White, Paul Veyne, Dominick LaCapra).

MAJOR--French Language and Literature
The French major consists of nine courses above the 103-104 level with optimally one course each
from the following areas:
1) Poetry and Poetics
2) Prose Narrative and Fiction
3) Theatre and Dramatic Literature
4) Thematics, Special Topics, Survey Courses
Students must also take a 400-level capstone seminar which may count toward any of the four
required areas.
Working with the major advisor, the student will formulate a curricular plan that will ensure balance
and coherence in courses taken. Such balance and coherence will be based on the above areas of liter-
ary and cultural investigation. Prospective majors should discuss their program with the major advisor
by the end of their sophomore year. This is especially imperative for students who are planning to
spend a part or all of their junior year in France.
The major seeks to provide training in literary and cultural analysis and linguistic expression
through the study of selected texts. Emphasis is placed on the changes in form and subject matter from
the Renaissance to the modern era.
Inasmuch as all courses in French assume the active participation of each student in discussions
conducted in the foreign language, regular attendance at class meetings is expected.
MAJOR--French Studies
The major in French Studies is an interdisciplinary program that provides students with the oppor-
tunity to acquire skills and knowledge embracing the cultural, historical, social, and political heritage
of France. The program allows for an individualized course of study involving work in several depart-
ments and the opportunity to study abroad.
Students electing the French Studies major should register with the French Studies faculty advisor
during their sophomore year. At that time they should submit a feasibility plan that articulates their
projected program.
The French Studies major consists of ten courses satisfying the following requirements:
1) at least two courses in French language and/or literature above the French 103 level;
2) a senior seminar;
3) Electives: The remaining courses needed to complete the major must be drawn from at least
three different departments and relate primarily to an aspect of the culture, history, society, and poli-
tics of France. These courses will be selected in consultation with members of the Department of Ro-
mance Languages. Appropriate electives might include:
History 307 The French and Haitian Revolutions
Religion 301 Psychology of Religion
All courses in French literature and language above the 103 level.
In addition, students should take at least two non-language courses that are taught in French.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN FRENCH
Two alternative routes are available to those who wish to apply for the degree with honors.
The first of these involves the writing of a senior thesis. Honors candidates are required to devote to
their theses two semesters of independent study (beyond the nine courses required for the major) and
the winter study period of their senior year (493-W031-494). The thesis will be written in French and
will usually be in the range of from forty to sixty pages. Candidates are expected to submit thesis pro-
posals in May of their junior year. By the end of the first semester of the senior year, students will
normally have finished the research for the thesis. By the end of the winter study period, candidates
will submit to the department an outline and rough draft of their work. At this time, the student will
make a presentation of his project at a departmental colloquium. The thesis will be discussed and eva-
luated to determine whether or not the student should continue in the honors program. The second
semester of independent thesis work will be spent revising and rewriting the thesis. The completed
Romance Languages
­ 290 ­
dissertation in its final form will be due at the end of April. The second route is a group of three clearly
related courses (offered by the Department of Romance Languages or by other departments, such as
History, Art, Philosophy, English, etc.), only one of which may be counted in the nine courses com-
prising the major. One of the courses will be an Independent Study (plus senior year WSP 030). At the
end of the spring semester the student will write an essay that synthesizes the content of the three re-
lated courses. Students may apply for this route by November 2 of the senior year.
In the case of both routes to the degree with honors, the department's recommendation for gradua-
tion with honors will be based on the originality and thoroughness of the finished project.
PLACEMENT
A placement test in French is administered at Williams at the opening of the fall semester. Incoming
first-year students who register for any French course above the 101-102 level must take this test,
regardless of their previous preparation.
STUDY ABROAD
French majors are strongly advised to complete part of the requirements for the major by studying
abroad either during the academic year or the summer. Most American study-in-France programs re-
quire applicants to have completed a fifth-semester, college-level French course (French 105, for ex-
ample) before they go abroad. A special affiliation with the Hamilton Junior Year in France program
enables Williams students (who have completed 105) to participate in a comprehensive academic and
cultural experience in a French-speaking environment. Major credit for study abroad will normally be
assigned as follows: up to 1 credit for one semester and up to 3 credits for a full year or two semesters.
The final assignment of credit will be authorized in consultation with the student's major advisor once
the student has returned to Williams. Such credits can only be determined by review of course format,
course materials, and evidence of satisfactory academic performance. Students interested in studying
abroad need to consult with faculty members in French by the second semester of their first year. Early
planning is essential. Because the academic quality of certain programs of study in France may well
be beneath the pedagogical standards normally associated with a Williams education, students will
receive credit for only those programs recommended by the department. Please consult a faculty
member to find out which programs are acceptable. Normally, the department does not administer
proficiency exams (for study abroad) to any student who has not completed a French course at Wil-
liams.

LITERATURE COURSES
RLFR 109(F) Introduction to French Literature: The Literature of Desire and
Repression
A study of representative French texts from the seventeenth to the twentieth centuries in which the
issues of desire and repression help the reader to understand authorial intention and its relation to the
process of writing. Among the topics to be discussed: the transposition of male and female voice, the
rhetoric of desire and sexuality, Platonism and the sublimation of desire, the salon as a venue of power,
provincial and city life as settings for the elaboration of gender themes and conflicts, language and its
relation to money and desire, and levels of aggression and passivity. Texts to be read and discussed:
Phèdre (Racine), Manon Lescaut (Prévost), Eugénie Grandet (Balzac), Madame Bovary (Flaubert),
L'Amant (Duras), La Lectrice (Jean). Conducted in French.
Requirements: class participation, a midterm exam, and several short papers.
Prerequisite: French 104 or 105 or by placement text, or permission of instructor.

RLFR 110(S) Introduction to French Literature: The Search for Identity
"We are so used to disguising ourselves for others," wrote the seventeenth-century author, La Roche-
foucauld, "that we wind up disguised to ourselves." Through the study of short masterpieces of the
seventeenth, eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth centuries, we will study a variety of authors' differ-
ent approaches to questions of self-deception, self-discovery, and self-understanding. Writers to be
studied include Pascal, La Rochefoucauld, Mme. de La Fayette, Chateaubriand, Mme. Claire de Du-
ras, Balzac, Maupassant, Mauriac, Colette, and Camus. Conducted in French.

RLFR 208(F) Rites of Lust, Blood, Power, and Words: French Tragedy in the Age of
Absolutism
To read and understand French classical tragedy is to penetrate a rhetorical code that reduces myth and
history to certain powerful common denominators. Against a backdrop of absolutist notions of state-
craft Pierre Corneille and Jean Racine wrote plays that transcend their particular historical moment to
uncover deep, primal truths about the human psyche and its relation to the cosmos. This course will
examine some of the most profoundly troubling and challenging works of these two seventeenth-cen-
tury playwrights in order to reach a clearer understanding of why their resonance as literature came to
be refracted through the richest inflections of modern criticism: Goldmann and neo-Marxism, Barthes
and the French New Criticism, psychoanalysis, and structuralism. Among the works to be read are:
Corneille's Le Cid, Horace, Cinna, and Polyeucte, and Racine's Iphigenie, Phedre, Andromaque, and
Mithridate. Conducted in French. Requirements: class participation, two papers, an oral presentation,
and a one-hour exam. Prerequisite: French 109, 110, 112, or permission of instructor.

RLFR 216(S) French Romanticism
This course traces the history of French romanticism, from its origins in the late eighteenth century
and its apogee during post-revolutionary and post-Napoleonic France to its influence on the subse-
quent literary movements of the nineteenth century. We will study the philosophical, ideological, and
aesthetic issues at the core of the romantic revolution, focusing specifically on the period's obsessive
emphasis on introspection and its celebration of nature as manifested in poetry, theater, and the novel.
We will also consider the place of romanticism in the art and music of the first half of the century.
Authors to be studied include Rousseau, Chateaubriand, Constant, Hugo, Musset, Lamartine, Vigny,
Stendhal, and Balzac. Conducted in French.
Requirements: class participation, oral presentations, three short papers and a final paper.

The seminar will examine the literary culture of France in the sixteenth century through selected mas-

neoclassicism, French society is engaged in a process of vigorous experimentation in such themes and
issues as individualism, spontaneity, inspiration, eroticism, literary genre, poetics, the visual arts, and
social conflict. We will give particular attention to the shift from oral to printed culture and the setting
of individual works within the context of modern theories of language and writing. Authors to be stu-
died: Rabelais, Du Bellay, Ronsard, and Montaigne. Conducted in French.
Requirements: class participation, two short papers, an oral presentation, and a final exam.

woman's destiny is defined in terms of spatial, social, and psychological confinement in mysticism or
sexuality, excluding her from marriage and society. Convents and brothels, schools that teach ambig-
uous sexuality, subversion, and revolt, may be more interchangeable than antithetical. Texts include
Diderot's La Religieuse, Prévost's Manon Lescaut, Laclos's Les Liaisons Dangereuses, Mme. de La-
fayette's La Contesse de Tende, Mme. de Duras's Ourika, Maupassant's La Maison Tellier, Zola's

RLFR 312(S) Between the Two World Wars
The period from 1913 to 1939 was an adventurous time for the French novel. In this course, we will
study novels by Gide, Proust, Colette, Camus, Martin du Gard, Mauriac, Malraux, and Sartre. Al-
though there is great diversity among these authors, they were all reacting to the aftermath of the First
World War and the breakdown of traditional French culture. Through the popular character of the re-
bellious adolescent, they experimented with revolt against the stifling social order of Church and fam-
ily. The real challenge of the period, however, concerned not a break with the past or discoveries of
new levels of consciousness and freedom, but rather the mature acceptance of responsibility for the
future and the articulation of fresh spiritual and political visions. Conducted in French.

SPANISH
The Spanish major consists of nine courses above the 103-104 level. These nine courses include
301, any 200 level or above (excluding RLSP 205 and RLSP 303), and 403.
The major seeks to provide training in literary analysis and linguistic expression, as well as an
appreciation of Hispanic civilization, through the study of the major writers of the Spanish-speak-
ing world.
Students majoring in Spanish may replace one of their Spanish electives with a course in Com-
parative Literature, with one course in Latin-American Studies that is 200-level or higher, or with a
course in Linguistics.
Inasmuch as all courses in Spanish assume the active participation of each student in discussions
conducted in the foreign language, regular attendance at class meetings is expected.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN SPANISH
Candidates for a senior thesis must have maintained a 3.5 GPA in the major by the time of proposal
submission. Two alternative routes are available to those who wish to apply for the degree with honors.
The first of these involves the writing of a senior thesis. Honors candidates are required to devote
to their theses two semesters of Independent Study (beyond the nine courses required for the ma-
jor--and the winter study period of their senior year (493-W031-494). The thesis will be written in
Spanish and will usually be in the range of from forty to sixty pages. Candidates are encouraged to
submit thesis proposals in May of their junior year. By the end of the first semester of the senior year,
students will normally have finished the research for the thesis. By the end of the winter study peri-
od, candidates will submit to the department a completed first draft of their work. At this time, the
student will make a presentation of his project at a departmental colloquium. The thesis will be dis-
cussed and evaluated to determine whether or not the student should continue in the honors pro-
gram. The second semester of independent thesis work will be spent revising and rewriting the the-
sis. The completed dissertation in its final form will be due at the end of April.
The second route is a group of three clearly related courses (offered by the Department of Ro-
mance Languages or by other departments, such as History, Art, Philosophy, English, etc.), only
one of which may be counted in the nine courses comprising the major. One of the courses will be an
Independent Study (plus senior year WSP 030) in the spring of the senior year, at the end of which
the student will write an essay that synthesizes the content of the three related courses. Students may
apply for this route by November 2 of the senior year.
In the case of both routes to the degree with honors, the department's recommendation for gradu-
ation with honors will be based on the originality and thoroughness of the finished project.
THE CERTIFICATE IN SPANISH
The Certificate in Spanish Language and Culture consists of a sequence of seven courses for
which the student must earn a cumulative grade average of B or higher. In addition, the student must
take a proficiency test and achieve a score of "Advanced." The test will be administered by the de-
partment once a year during the month of April to all students desirous of obtaining the Certificate.
Those so interested should express their intent to the chair of the department by March 1 or earlier.
For students with no prior Spanish background, the course sequence will consist of Spanish
101-102, Spanish 103 and 104, and three courses in Spanish above the 104 level, with at least one of
these courses at the 200-level or higher taken at Williams. If the student starts out the sequence at
Spanish 103, in addition to the three courses in Spanish beyond the 104 level (including a 200-level
course or higher), two electives may be taken in other departments. One elective should be in Span-
ish or Latin-American cultural history (art, literature, drama, music) and the other in Spanish or
Latin-American intellectual, political, or social history. Spanish 200, 201, or 208 can be counted for
the elective requirement.

coming first-year students who wish to register for any Spanish courses above the 101 level must
take this test.
STUDY ABROAD
Spanish majors, as well as non-majors interested in further exposure to the language and the cul-
ture, are strongly encouraged to include study in Spain or Latin America as part of their program at

ment offers a comprehensive linguistic and cultural experience in a Spanish-speaking environment,
for periods either of a semester or a year. Credit for up to four courses can be granted at the discretion
of the Department for study overseas. Students interested in study abroad should consult with a
member of the department at their earliest convenience.

RLSP 201(F) (formerly 111) The Cultures of Spain
Each of the many cultures and civilizations that has settled in Spain has left its mark. Linguistically,
culturally, and historically Spain is a composite of the groups that have inhabited the peninsula in the
past, which include Iberians, Celts, Phoenicians, Greeks, Carthaginians, Romans,Visigoths, Arabs,
and Jews. The contributions of these different groups, combined with other factors such as geography
and climate, will be our starting point in understanding Spain's past. Today, Spain's cultural diversity
also reflects the many distinct autonomous regions of which the country is composed, such as Cata-
luña and the Basque country, and the recent influx of immigrants from all over the world. In this
course we will consider Spain past and present. We will study periods of tolerance and cultural bril-
liance, such as the co-existence of Arabs and Jews in Medieval Cordoba, as well as times of censor-
ship and repression such as the Inquisition and the post Civil War under Franco. Materials will include
representative works from literature, art, architecture, music, and film. Secondary texts will also be
provided for historical and socio-political background and reference.
Conducted in Spanish.
Requirements: active participation in class discussions, an oral presentation, several short writing as-
signments, a midterm and a final.
Prerequisite: Spanish 105, permission of the instructor, or results of the Williams College Placement
Exam. Enrollment limit: 20 (expected: 20).

tic and intellectual concerns of each writer, but also the ways in which the works relate to one another.
Conducted in Spanish.

signments, and a final paper. At least two of the short assignments will be edited and re-written; the
final paper will be handed in as a draft first and then edited.

RLSP 219(F) Humor in Spanish-American Literature
From the sixteenth century to the twenty-first, humor has been an essential element of Spanish-Amer-
ican cultural discourse, frequently mixing entertainment with sharp criticism of repressive political
regimes and social institutions. This course will examine the role of humor in Spanish-American liter-
ature with emphasis on the colonial period and the nineteenth century, considering the use of satire,
parody and farce to diagnose social ills ranging from the oppression of indigenous and African Amer-
icans to administrative corruption, promiscuity and sexual hypocrisy, and sadism among medical
practitioners. Drawing on theorists including Erasmus, Henri Bergson and Mikhail Bahktin, we will
discuss various categories of literary comedy and their functions as subversive or transgression dis-
courses. Spanish-American authors to be read may include Juan Rodríguez Freile, Sor Juana Inés de
la Cruz, Catalina de Erauso, Juan del Valle Caviedes, Alonso Carrió de la Vandera, José Milla, Ricar-
do Palma, and Tomás Carrasquilla. For students with little or no background in early Spanish-Ameri-
can literature, we will also read selected works of "serious," canonical official literature. We will con-
clude by considering colonial and nineteenth-century satire as precursors of the anti-authoritarian dis-
course in contemporary texts such as Gabriel García Márquez's Los funerales de la Mamá Grande.
Evaluation will be based on contribution to class discussions, three short papers, and mid-term and
final exams.
Prerequisites: Spanish 105 or above, or permission of instructor, or results of the Williams College
placement exam. Enrollment limit: 22 (expected: 22).
Hour: 1:10-2:25 TF FRENCH
RLSP 301(S) Cervantes' Don Quijote (W)
This course is an in-depth study of Cervantes' masterpiece Don Quijote. With this novel, Cervantes
forever transformed the European literary landscape and the future of prose fiction. We will consider
the singularity of Cervantes' achievement from the perspectives of language, literature, and culture.
The literary and social background of the period will also shape our understanding of the work's his-
torical context. Additional reading will include a selection of major critical studies. Conducted in
Spanish.
Format: seminar. Requirements: evaluation will be based on meaningful class participation and 20-25
pages of writing divided into several discrete assignments, some of which will include rewriting, and
a final paper.
Prerequisite: any 200-level Spanish course. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 15). This course is writing

RLSP 306T(S) Latino Writing: Literature by U.S. Hispanics (Same as Comparative
Literature 302T) (W)*
Writing by U.S. Hispanics constitutes a new voice in American letters. In this tutorial, we will read
and discuss work by U.S. Latinos and examine the social backgrounds to their texts. The experiences
of immigration and assimilation, and the specific complexities of being both Hispanic and North
American will be addressed. Authors to be studied: José Antonio Villarreal, Tomás Rivera, Richard
Rodríguez, Sandra Cisneros, Rudolfo Anaya, Piri Thomas, Edward Rivera, Oscar Hijuelos, Cristina
García, and historical texts by Carey McWilliams, and Rodolfo Acuña. Given the absence of a critical
consensus around these recent titles, our task is to gain some sense of their common traits as a tradi-
tion, and place them within the larger body of literature of the Americas and the world.
The tutorial will examine one work or set of authors per week. A student will bring, written out in full,
an oral presentation focusing on the artistic features and sociocultural content of the assigned reading.
Questioning of the presenter, on the part of the second tutee and the tutor, will follow. The course is
designed to accommodate both Spanish and English speaking students. A student able to read and
speak Spanish will be paired with another student of similar proficiency. Students who neither read
nor speak Spanish will be paired together.
Requirements: five short oral presentations/papers (about 20-25 minutes) and a final longer one
(about 40-45 minutes).
Prerequisite: some previous course work in any literature beyond the 100 level is helpful. Students
selecting the Spanish option for credit toward the Spanish major must have taken at least one 200-lev-
el Spanish course or seek permission of the tutor. This course is writing intensive.

RLSP 403(F) Senior Seminar: Studies in Literature*
This is a variable topics course. For 2002-2003, the topic will be "Power, Repression, and Dictator-
ship in the Latin-American Novel." Military dictatorship is among the most crucial factors in Latin-
American society and history, and some of the continent's leading novelists have taken it upon them-
selves to depict the experience in their work. In this course we will examine both the fact of dictator-
ship itself and the diverse representation thereof in Spanish-American fiction. Novels by García
Márquez, Carpentier, Fuentes, Poniatowska, and Tomás Eloy Martínez will be closely studied. Stu-
dents will also read Absalom! Absalom! by Faulkner, whose influence on Latin-American authors'
techniques of representation has been decisive and profound. Conducted in Spanish.
Format: seminar. Requirements: three papers based on the readings, one oral report on the life and
personality of a given dictator, and a final exam.
Prerequisite: any 300-level course of two 200-level courses or permission of the instructor. Enroll-
ment limit: 15 (expected: 8). Preference given to Spanish majors, and students with a background in
literature.

LANGUAGE STUDY
The department provides language instruction to enable the student to acquire all four linguistic
skills: understanding, speaking, reading, and writing. Russian 101-W088-102 covers the basics of
Russian grammar. Russian 103 and 104 offer additional instruction in grammar and provide extensive
practice in reading and conversation. Russian 201 and 202 aim to develop facility in speaking, writ-
ing, and reading.
STUDY ABROAD
The department strongly encourages students desiring to attain fluency in Russian to spend a se-
mester or year studying in Russia or one of the former Soviet republics. Students generally apply to
one of several approved foreign study programs. Russian 104 or the equivalent and junior standing are
normally prerequisite for study abroad.
LITERATURE AND CULTURE IN TRANSLATION
The department regularly offers courses on Russian literature and culture in English for those stu-
dents who have little or no knowledge of Russian, but who wish to become acquainted with the major
achievements in Russian literary and cultural history.

THE CERTIFICATE IN RUSSIAN
To enhance a student's educational and professional profiles, the Certificate in Russian offers a use-
ful tool for using the language in a wide variety of disciplines. The sequence of language and culture
courses is designed to supplement a student's major at Williams by enabling the student to expand his
or her knowledge in a related field.
The course of study for the certificate gives credit for Russian 101 and 102, which do not count
toward the major. Students who enter Williams with previous training in Russian may substitute more
advanced courses for the 100- and 200-level courses; they can also be exempted from up to two of the
required courses. Thus, in order to earn a certificate a student must take no fewer than five courses
(including three language courses) after enrolling at Williams.
Students must receive a minimum grade of B in each course taken in the sequence. In addition, they
must receive a score of at least 85% on a standardized language proficiency test administered by the
department.

changes that swept over Russia during the last one hundred years and their impact on the country's
literature. In this course, we will focus on the development of prose fiction in general, and the Russian
novel in particular, in several historical periods, placing emphasis on the Russian revolutions at the
beginning and end of the twentieth century and their reflection in the country's literature. Special
attention will be paid to the pre-Revolutionary avant-garde, the rise and fall of Soviet literature, and
the emergence of Postmodernism in Russia. Readings by Belyi, Bulgakov, Pasternak, Nabokov, Solz-
henitsyn, and others. Knowledge of Russian is not required. All readings will be in English.

RUSS 206(S) Topics in Russian Culture: Feasting and Fasting in Russian History
This course will use the methodology of food history to explore the broader historical, economic, and
artistic conditions that gave rise to Russian culture. We will examine culinary practice as well as the
social context of cooking and eating in Russia. In order to elucidate the important interplay between
culture and cuisine, we will discuss such issues as the domestic roles of women and serfs, the etiquette
of the table, the role of drinking and temperance movements, and the importance of feasts and fasts in
the Russian Orthodox Church calendar. Short stories, memoirs, and cookery books will provide in-
sight into class and gender differences, cooking techniques, and the specific tastes that characterize
Russian cuisine. This class will present Russian culture from a predominantly domestic point of view

This course offers a survey of Russian art from the first to the third millennia, from religious icons to
commercial ones. We will look at early broadsides, society portraits, landscapes, and genre paintings,
as well as a wide range of Russian handicrafts. Special emphasis will be placed on the halcyon period
from 1910 to 1930, when Russian Cubo-Futurists, Suprematists, and Constructivists profoundly in-
fluenced the development of art throughout the Western world. After examining the Socialist Realism
of the Stalin era, we will progress through Moscow conceptualism to the current appropriation of
Western style into a post-Soviet aesthetic.

RUSS 307(F) Music and Nineteenth-Century Russian Literature
Albeit distinct art forms, music and literature have enjoyed a very fruitful relationship in a number of
artistic traditions, and this was particularly true in the rich and varied cultural life of nineteenth-centu-
ry Russia. Musicians, composers, or even specific compositions, sometimes became the subject of
literary masterpieces. Other times it was a celebrated work of literature that inspired incidental music,
romances, and operas. In this course we will examine the broad and fascinating relationship between
literature and music in short works by Odoevsky, Pushkin, Turgenev, Tolstoy, Kuprin, and Chekhov.
We will study the role that music played in belles lettres as thematic element, cultural commentary,
and structuring principle. All primary texts will be read in the original, but some secondary readings
will be in English. Class will be conducted entirely in Russian.

Chair, Professor DONALD deB. BEAVER
Advisory Committee: Professors: ALTSCHULER, D. BEAVER, DETHIER, L. KAPLAN**.
Science and Technology Studies (SCST) is an interdisciplinary program concerned with science and
technology and their relationship to society. In addition to being concerned with the historical development
and a philosophical understanding of the ideas and institutions of science and technology; Science and
Technology Studies also examines their ethical, economic, social, and political implications.
The role that science and technology have played in shaping modern industrial societies is general-
ly acknowledged, but few members of those societies, including scientists and engineers, possess any
understanding of how that process has occurred or much knowledge of the complex technical and
social interactions that direct change in either science or society. The Science and Technology Studies
Program is intended to help create a coherent course of study for students interested in these questions
by providing a broad range of perspectives. At the present time courses are offered which examine the
history or philosophy of science and technology, the sociology and psychology of science, the eco-
nomics of research and development and technological change, science and public policy, technology
assessment, technology and the environment, scientometrics, and ethical-value issues.
To complete the requirements of the program, students must complete six courses. The introducto-
ry course and senior seminar are required and three elective courses are chosen from the list of desig-
nated electives. Students may choose to concentrate their electives in a single area such as technology,
American studies, philosophy, history of science, economics, environment, current science, or current
technology, but are encouraged to take at least one elective in history, history of science, or philoso-
phy. The sixth course necessary to complete the program is one semester of laboratory or field science
in additiontotheCollege'sthree-coursesciencerequirement.Othersciencecoursesofparticularinter-
est include Chemistry 110 and Biology 134.
The program is administered by a chair and an advisory committee of faculty who teach in the pro-
gram. Students who wish to enroll normally register with the chair by the fall of their junior year.

WILLIAMS PROGRAM IN TEACHING
Director, SUSAN L. ENGEL
The program in teaching is designed to enable Williams Undergraduates to study the ideas, questions,
and practices involved in good teaching at all levels. The program seeks to promote and facilitate an ex-
change of ideas about teachers, learners and schools, within and beyond the Williams campus. The pro-
gram offers a range of opportunities including courses on education, intensive supervised student teaching,
workshops, advising, lecture series, and ongoing peer groups for those who teach. Students may participate
in a variety of ways, ranging from taking one course to a sustained in-depth study of teaching and learning
geared to those who want to become teachers, or educational psychologists. We seek to connect students
with one another, to bring in expert teachers to provide mentoring, and to create links across the curriculum
so that students can see the vital connections between what they study (French, Algebra or Biology for
instance) and the process of teaching those topics to elementary and high school students. The program is
open to any student interested in education and offers opportunities for all levels of interest, including those
who want to find out about certification and graduate study. Students seeking certification through an ar-
rangement with the Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts (MCLA) should consult with Susan Engel be-
fore the end of their sophomore year.
The following provides a sample outline of the sequence of courses and experiences that an inter-
ested student might take
zPsychology 101 Intro to Psych (required for further psychology courses);
zPsychology 232 Developmental Psychology and/or
zPsychology 242 Social Psychology;
zPsychology 334 Psychology of Education (with supervised teaching practicum as a recom-
mended, but optional component);
zPsychology 336 Adolescence;
zAt least one Winter Study in an intensive teaching practicum. The major programs are in Berk-
shire County (under PSYC) or in New York City (under SPEC), although other opportunities
may be listed elsewhere in the Winter Study section of the course catalogue.
No specific major is required to participate in the program--although some lend themselves easily
to certification, such as Mathematics, English, Biology, American history, or French, almost all of our
majors can provide the basis of teacher certification. Alternately, students can major in Psychology,
take a concentration of courses in a different field, and then pursue that content area more intensively
in graduate work.

THEATRE (Div. I)

Assistant Professor: SALAMENSKY. Lecturers: BROTHERS, CATALANO, B. SHEPARD§.
As a reflection of the theatre's historical relationship to literature and the arts, stage production is
studied in the context of the literary and artistic movements which have informed theatrical endeavor.
The major in Theatre emphasizes the collaborative nature of the discipline by drawing upon courses
offered by faculty of the Language, Literature, Music, and Art Departments. Although students will
be equipped to proceed to graduate and professional schools in theatre, the major is primarily directed
toward those interested in studying the theatre as an artistic phenomenon and as an interpretive tool.
Because a deep understanding of theatre requires training and experience with the synthesis on stage,
the major includes curricular study of production and performance, as well as continued participation
in departmental stage production.
Williamstheatre, the production arm of the Department of Theatre, operates under the supervision of the
departmental faculty. Major departmental productions as well as laboratory and experimental productions
of all kinds are mounted on both the MainStage of the Adams Memorial Theatre, and the DownStage
Theatre. Participation in acting or technical work is open to all members of the Williams College commu-
nity. Students majoring in Theatre will be asked to consult regularly with departmental advisors in devising
the sequence of courses and production participation that will constitute their major.

The department strongly recommends that students elect additional collateral courses in dramatic
literature taught by the English and modern language departments, and courses in opera taught by the
Music Department. Students with an interest in theatre design should particularly elect Art Studio
courses in drawing.
Production requirement for the major: All majors in Theatre are required to participate in a mini-
mum of eight productions in addition to the laboratory requirement for Theatre 102. Participation in at
least three of the eight must be in technical production, and one must be in stage management. Assign-
ment to productions is normally made in consultation with the department and chair.

Theatre majors are strongly urged to include dance and fencing in fulfilling their Physical Educa-
tion requirements.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN THEATRE
Candidates for Honors will apply for admission through the submission of a portfolio to the Depart-
ment Chair by February of their junior year, as well as a description of their proposed project. The
portfolio will be comprised of four parts:
1. The first part will include a list of the courses students have taken relevant to their work towards the
major, This list will include courses offered by the Theatre Department, but may also include classes
taken other Departments. Students should also list and describe relevant independent studies and pro-
duction credits.
2. The second part of the portfolio will include a selection of materials developed for these courses and
productions listed in Part 1. The selection should include at least three papers or samples of other
written work, and might also include design projects, directors notebooks, studio art projects, actor's
journals or other forms of documentation of the candidate's work. For students who have taken a
semester away, it is particularly important that they provide the Department with a detailed picture of
their activities while studying off-campus. Course descriptions and syllabi should be submitted in
addition to a list of courses taken and activities performed.
3. The third part of the portfolio is a annotated bibliography of dramatic texts which the student has
read, drawn from a list supplied by the Department. Annotations should reflect a particular angle of
engagement with the text, that reflects the area or areas that the student has chosen to emphasize in
their theatrical training. For instance, one might choose to write from the point of view of an actor, a
designer, a director, a playwright, or a dramaturg.
4. The portfolio should conclude with a retrospective essay that reflects on the materials that are being
submitted. Students should look for connections between the various aspects of their work, state any
theoretical positions that they have come to embrace, assess their strengths and weaknesses, and dis-
cuss their educational goals for their work with the Department during their Senior year.
The portfolio will be examined alongside the student's record and their project description; a deter-
mination will then be made as to their admission into the Honors program. Students intending to apply
for Honors, should meet with the Department Chair by the end of the fall semester of their junior year.
THEA 101(F) Introduction to Theatre
The course will look at dramatic texts in relation to their production potential. Students will read 10 to 12
plays taken from various periods and cultures, and `see' them on the stages of their imaginations. The plays
to be studied will also be seen in the context of some of the important theatrical traditions and theories from
which they emerged or which they helped influence.
There will be a practical element to the course--a Wednesday lab during which students will work in
groups on various theatrical assignments. There will be some acting (you do NOT have to be an actor or
even WANT to be an actor to take this course), some directing, and some designing--all at the basic level.
Format: lecture course with a practical lab. Students will be assessed on their level of participation, their
attendance in class and their collaboration within smaller groups. There will be 2 two-page papers--re-
sponses to the productions seen at the AMT during the semester, and a final assignment--either practical
or paper.
This course is a prerequisite for Theatre 203 and 301. No enrollment limit (expected: 50-70).
Hour: 9:55-11:10 TR Lab: 1-4 W EPPEL
THEA 102(S) Introduction to Technical Theatre
As an overview of performance spaces, play technologies, and production, the course will examine
how and where plays are performed, produced, and designed. Students will attend lectures, participate
in labs in drafting and technical production, and will be required to participate on the production crew
of one or more departmental productions.
Prerequisite: Theatre 101. This course is a prerequisite for Theatre 201.
Hour: 9:55-11:10 TR Lab: 1-4 W CATALANO
THEA 201(F) The Design Response (W)
A study of theatrical design modes and concepts. This course will deal with the formation of a design
response to playtexts and other dramatic materials, and the translation of that response into scenery,
lighting and costumes. Students will study the development of images that communicate with other
theatre artists and the audience to convey feeling and meaning.
The course will aim to develop overall visual design skills, study the techniques employed in devising
set, costume and lighting, as well as the ways in which they can interrelate to form a unified design. To
this end, we will stress the development of verbal and visual communication skills to convey design
ideas, and study process (individual and collaborative) as well as product.
Evaluation will be based on weekly projects, a larger final project and class participation in discus-
sions and labs. All visual presentations will be accompanied by short written assignments.

THEA 212(S) Drama/Trauma: Theatres of the Psyche (Same as Comparative Literature
212 and English 214)
The inspiration for psychoanalysis arose through visits by Freud to the theatre. Meanwhile, in Western
medical circles of the time, "hysterics"--most often, troubled women--were displayed as theatrical
objects themselves. What do the spaces of the theatre and the psyche have in common? In what ways
is theatre just a more legitimate form of "insanity"? How, and why, does Western theatre, from the
Classical period onward, progress from models of tragedy to individual trauma and wider cultural
disaster? How might non-Western theatres, and productions by women and artists of color, approach
psychic issues differently? How do the realms of theatre and performance function, creatively, psy-
chically, and politically, to re-enact, rework--and even induce--trauma? Materials studied might in-
clude: writings by psychoanalytic critics Charcot, Freud, Lacan, Melanie Klein, Foucault, and others;
classic through contemporary plays based on the stories of Oedipus and Electra, and on psychoanalyt-
ic notions, by Sophocles, Shakespeare, O'Neill, Hélène Cixous, Paula Vogel, Suzan-Lori Parks, and
others; and recorded performance works by Robert Wilson, Chris Burden, Karen Finley, Ron Athey,
Bill T. Jones, Min Tanaka, and more.
Requirements: brief weekly writings, two longer written projects, and a final exam.
Prerequisites: none, but one Theatre, English, Comparative Literature, or Psychology course pre-
ferred. Enrollment limit: 15.

THEA 323(S) Theatre of Images (Same as ArtS 323 and Women's and Gender Studies 323)
This course will investigate what Bonnie Marranca, editor of Performing Arts Journal, describes as
theatre"in which the painterly and sculptural qualities of performance are stressed transforming this theatre
into a spatially-dominated one activated by sense impressions, as opposed to a time-dominated one ruled
by linear narrative." This class will examine the work and methodology of some of the practitioners of this
form, including Robert Wilson, Meredith Monk, Ping Chong, and Mabou Mines. This study will prepare
class members to create their own short pieces, which will take a Theatre of Images approach to a specific
theme to be determined by the class.
Evaluation will be based on class participation in discussion and labs, one major paper and class presenta-
tion of the material covered in the paper, and a final project which will be a short performance piece.
Prerequisite: completion of a 200-level course in any of the performing or fine arts, or permission of the

THEA 325(F) Decadence and Modernity (Same as Comparative Literature 325 and English
385)
Why were Chekhov's plays condemned by both Czarists and Revolutionaries? Why was Oscar Wilde
imprisoned? (Not just for the reason you think.) Why were Sarah Bernhardt and other "Jewess" divas
at once beloved and reviled? Why were Asian and African cultures at once adulated, mocked, and
subjugated? Why was Mahler charged with conducting German music in a "Negroid" manner? What
did Hitler see on his few theatre outings, and why did he send the avant-garde dramatists, actos, direc-
tors, painters, designers, musicians, and filmmakers of his time to exile and death? The early modern-
ist period was marked by explosive artistic innovations, along with deep anxiety over civilization's
racial, sexual, gender, governmental, economic, and even biological "decay" or "degeneration," tying
"mere" theatre and other, often lighthearted, performance and arts, in both content and form, to issues
from chatty "gay" banter to Holocaust genocide. Materials might include: Gilbert & Sullivan's light
opera Patience; transcripts of Oscar Wilde's "sodomy" trials; histories of the London, Paris, Berlin,
and Vienna stages, as well as cabarets, salons, cafés, and world expositions; plays and productions by
Chekhov, Ibsen, Strindberg, Wilde, Symbolists, Futurists, Dadaists, Expressionists, and others;
women's, "queer," exoticist, Jewish ghetto, concentration camp, and Nazi performance and arts; writ-
ings and critiques by Emile Zola, Henry James, and Hitler.
Format: weekly lecture/seminar. Requirements: short weekly papers; group research presentations;
two longer written projects; and a final exam. An optional research tour of NYC's Neue Galerie of
decadent-era culture will be arranged.
Prerequisite: one 100-level course in Theatre, English, Comparative Literature, or Art History; or per-
mission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 20. Preference to Theatre, English, and Comparative Lit-

THEA 329(S) Performing Identity: Popular Entertainment in America (Same as
American Studies 207 and Comparative Literature 209)
Arguably, any "culture" is just a sum of its representations. Is the very idea of "Americanness" a theat-
rical construction? Can we really speak of national--not to mention racial, ethnic, sexual, class, or
individual--"identity"? How has "America," historically, "performed" itself into being? We will ex-
amine American popular entertainments from the 1920s through the 1970s, a period in which "light"
amusements mirrored intensive social turbulence over women's rights, sexual freedoms, civil rights,
immigration, class struggles, war and peace, and international rights and responsibilities. What are we
seeing when we see the individual or identity group publicly represented? To what extent do different
group histories and legacies affect our senses of "identity" in the present? Can an viewer or artist from
Theatre
­ 309 ­
one group effectively and ethically "identify with" or portray another? What happens when one view-
er's or artist's multiple gender, racial, etc. "identities" come into conflict? How do different produc-
tion and performance choices reinforce, counter, or unsettle identity paradigms? Are we "all one," "all
different," or something in-between? Topics studied will include: American World's Fair and Expo
exhibits; the Woman onstage, including the burlesque, May West, and the beauty pageant; minstrelsy
and other mainstream through radical stagings of "Blackness" ; Asian and other "foreign" ethnicities
in the circus sideshow and WWII and Cold War comedy; the Jew onstage, including vaudeville, the
Marx Brothers, and standup; gender, Latino/a, African-American, Asian, and other ethnicity, as well
as economics, war, peace, and nationhood in the Broadway musical (including "South Pacific,"
"Porgy and Bess," and "West Side Story") and in "stagy" TV variety and comedy (including Milton
Berle, Ed Sullivan, "I Love Lucy," and "The Jeffersons.")
Format: weekly tutorial. Requirements: short weekly papers; two longer written projects; final exam.

THEA 330(S) Contemporary Latino/a-American Theatre & Performance: The Aesthetics
of Resistance (Same as American Studies 330)*
This course explores the theories and current practices of Latin American theatre and performance as
it has developed within and against contexts of dictatorships and neocolonialism. We will analyze
how Latino/a American theorists and practitioners use the scripted and the performative to intervene
in social spaces as they construct counter-public spheres, and how these performances create aesthet-
ics of resistance. The first part of the course concentrates on Latin America; the second half introduces
how Latin America extends through and beyond the US/Mexican border. At the beginning of each
class the instructor will offer a brief discussion/response to relevant aspects of the texts. Brief student
presentations will follow. The second half of the class will be devoted to open discussion of the text,
presentation and/or screening. Students are expected to visit the Hemispheric Institute of Performance
and Politics website (http//hemi.ps.tsoa.nyu.edu).
Format: seminar. Requirements: one class presentation about one of the readings and film/videos dis-
cussion in class (or about the Hemispheric site), a midterm and final take home exam.
Prerequisites: THEA 331F or 200 level course in areas relating to Latino cultural or political studies

This course concentrates in the various forms of expressive Afro-Latin identities manifested in the
production of music and dance; particularly those from Cuba, Brazil, Puerto Rico in "mainland" and
once translocated into the US. We will create a theoretical framework based on the notions of transcul-
turation and mestizaje, both fundamental to understand the production of music and dance as practic-
es and as representational discourses of class, race and gender in the Caribbean and in the Diaspora.
Format: seminar. Requirements: Two in-class presentations, a take home midterm, and a final, plus a
short final presentation.
Prerequisites: A 200 level course in the performing or visual arts or in areas relating to Latin American
cultural studies (i.e., History 249, History 242, Music 122) and permission of instructor.

To complete the degree in theatre, majors are required to complete an independent project for their
senior year, either in fall (THEA 401) or in the spring (THEA 402). In the fall of the junior year, stu-
dents should propose several possible projects to the Department, which may or may not include a
production component. Part of THEA 301 (The Junior Seminar) will be devoted to guiding senior
project proposals. By the end of the fall semester in the junior year, final proposals should be sub-
mitted for consideration by the Department. Collaborative projects between two or more seniors are
preferable. A collaborative project involving the entire class is also a possibility, and this should be
discussed with the Chair of the Department early in the junior year. The schedule in the junior year for
proposals for the senior theatre project is:
1) Initial, BRIEF proposals (several per student) submitted to the Department by October 16, 2002.
2) Proposals reviewed by the Department and returned to the students for revision by November 1.

THE NATIONAL THEATRE INSTITUTE
The Department of Theatre is affiliated with the National Theatre Institute, which offers addi-
tional theatre study through its resident semester program. The Institute is fully accredited by Con-
necticut College and is a member of the Twelve-College Exchange. Limited numbers of Williams
students can therefore be selected to take a full semester of intensive theatre study at the NTI, lo-
cated at the Eugene O'Neill Memorial Theatre Centre in Waterford, Connecticut. During the se-
mester, students from participating colleges live and work as members of a theatre company gain-
ing experience with professional theatre artists in a workshop environment. Early application is es-
sential.
WOMEN'S AND GENDER STUDIES (Div. II)
Chair, Professor JANA SAWICKI
Advisory Committee: Professors: SAWICKI, SWANN. Associate Professor: ROUHI. Assistant Pro-
fessors: BUELL, M. DEVEAUX**, HICKS, L. JOHNSON, KENT, WHALEN. Lecturer:
DIGGS§§. Affirmative Action Officer: MCINTIRE. Librarian: MENARD. Health Educator: DE-
NELLI-HESS. COLLINGSWORTH (MCC).
Women's and Gender Studies can be defined as the study of how gender is constructed, how it is
inflected by differences of race, ethnicity, sexuality, class, and so on, how gender affects the experi-
ences and situations of men and women, and how assumptions about gender influence the construc-
tion of knowledge and experience. Scholarship in Women's and Gender Studies has brought ne-
glected material into established fields and raised important methodological questions about sex and
gender that cross disciplinary boundaries and challenge established intellectual frameworks. The pro-
gram in Women's and Gender Studies thus includes courses from a wide variety of disciplines that
focus in a coherent way on gender issues, as well as core courses that acquaint students with the inter-
disciplinarity of the field.
A major in Women's and Gender Studies will be available to students declaring majors in the spring
of 2002. Students interested in declaring a major should contact the chair of the Program (x2305). A
five course concentration in Women's and Gender Studies is still available to all students graduating
in 2003.
THE MAJOR
The Women's and Gender Studies major encourages exposure to the interdisciplinary character of
feminist scholarship. In addition, majors are required to gain some knowledge of methods within a
field or discipline (3 courses in one of the categories listed below), to appreciate the importance of
diversity (racial, sexual, class, ethnic, national, etc.) in scholarship on gender, to gain exposure to fem-
inist theory, and to pursue work at an advanced level (3 courses at the 300-level).
In order to ensure that students reflect about the paths that they choose through the major, each
major will be assigned to an advisor in the spring of the sophomore year. With the advisor, the student
will establish a revisable course of study for the following two years.
[ ] Courses not offered in 2002-2003 are listed in brackets.
Required Courses
The major consists of at least 9 courses. The following are required:
Women's and Gender Studies 101 Introduction to Women's and Gender Studies
Women's and Gender Studies 402 Junior/Senior Seminar in Women's and Gender Studies (The semi-
nar explores topics in Women's and Gender Studies, and varies from year to year. Majors may take
more than one seminar, space permitting.)

2. Disciplinary Concentration
At least three of the seven electives must be in one of the following categories, with one of the
three at the 300 level:
a. Literary or artistic expression (English, comparative literature, film and video studies, fine or per-
forming arts)
b. Historical perspectives (includes history, music, religion, classics, art history)
c. Forms of political and social organization (includes political and social sciences)
d. Science studies (includes natural, physical, and mathematical sciences, and philosophy of science,
history of science, sociology of science, neuroscience, and cognitive psychology)
3. Three of the seven electives must be at the 300 level.
THE CONCENTRATION
Students graduating in 2003 may still declare a concentration in Women's and Gender Studies. To
fulfill the requirements for a concentration, students will take five courses in the Program: Women's
and Gender Studies 101, Introduction to Women's and Gender Studies; three Women's and Gender
Studies electives from at least two departments (these will vary according to the course offerings each
year); and the Women's and Gender Studies junior/senior seminar, in which they will write a substan-
tial essay or develop a project in an area of special interest. (The seminar explores topics in Women's
and Gender Studies, and varies from year to year; prerequisites include Women's and Gender Studies
101 and two electives, one of which may be taken concurrently with the seminar.) Under exceptional
circumstances, the chair can allow an Independent Study to substitute for the seminar. Students may
take more than one seminar, space permitting.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN WOMEN'S AND GENDER STUDIES
Honors in Women's and Gender Studies may be granted to concentrators or contract majors after an
approved candidate completes a thesis (493-W031, W031-494) or honors project (491-W030,
W030-492), delivers a public presentation of the work, and is awarded an honors grade by her/his
advisor and one other reader from the Women's and Gender Studies Program.
The honors project may be one semester (plus winter study) or a year-long project. It may consist of
a conventional research thesis of 40-70 pages or of other modes of presentation (e.g., art, music,
poetry, theater, fiction). Proposals for non-thesis projects may include evidence of experience and
competence in the chosen mode.
Women's and Gender Studies
­ 312 ­
A student may become a candidate for honors in Women's and Gender Studies after the following
criteria are met:
1) in April of the junior year, submission and Women's and Gender Studies Committee approval of a 4- to
6-page project proposal, in which the ideas, aim, general methodology, and preliminary bibliography for
the project are outlined and a faculty advisor is named;
2) at the end of the junior year, cumulative grade point average of B+ from courses in two of the three
academic divisions (humanities, social science, natural science);
3) on the first day of classes of the senior year, submission and approval by the faculty advisor of a 5- to
10-page prospectus for the project.
All honors work, including the public presentation will be graded by at least two faculty members-a
third will be consulted if there is a significant discrepancy between the first two graders. Readers' grades
will be averaged and honors will be awarded as follows: A+/A Highest Honors; A-/B+ Honors.

CROSS-LISTED COURSES (INCLUDING SEQUENCE COURSES)
WGST 101(F,S) Introduction to Women's and Gender Studies (W)
This team-taught lecture and discussion course introduces a range of feminist issues, theories, and
controversies. It has several aims: to provide critical and analytical tools for thinking about gender as
it is inflected by race, class, sexuality, and culture; to explore key issues confronting women in Ameri-
can society, and to discuss strategies for addressing them. The course will examine issues such as:
body politics, sexuality, reproductive freedom, sexual violence, gender and work, motherhood and
family.
Requirements: one 2-page paper, two 5- to 6-page essays, class presentations, and an 8- to 10-page
research paper, with revisions. Evaluation based on these assignments and class participation.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 18 per section (expected: 15 per section). This course is writing
intensive.
Required course for the Women's and Gender Studies major and concentration.

WGST 206(S) Gender and Race in Recent Art Practice (Same as ArtH 206)
Art practice in this country since the l970s has dealt forthrightly with basic social problems, initially
ones rooted in gender and race. These basic issues of course are also intimately tied to class, econom-
ics and access to representation. With the opening of Womanhouse in L.A., women especially began
producing work that dealt with their own lives--initially, with what went on in domestic space and
relations, but expanding out into their roles in larger social relations. African-American, Asian, and
Native American artists, both women and men, produced complex works that intertwined their con-
cerns about their place in the mainstream culture, reflections on how they are seen, and declarations
about who they are. This course will investigate artists' works since the 1970s which deal with gender
and race, as well as class and economics as they tie to those principal concerns. We will emphasize
research and presentation of art works, but will also reach out to a number of artists directly. Before
meeting with artists in New York and Boston, as well as initiating conference calls with artists else-
where, we will develop and direct questions about their work. Intentionality is one area to pursue with
them, but other areas of inquiry will be devised by the class.
Requirements: readings; weekly short/small written or visual responses to artists presented; research
on and presentation of work by one artist; research on the work of one artist whom we will contact,
along with principal responsibility for that contact.
Prerequisites: ArtH 101-102. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19).

(See under Economics for full description.)
WGST 212(S) Ethics and Reproductive Technologies (Same as Philosophy 212) (W)
In her groundbreaking book, The Tentative Pregnancy, Barbara Katz Rothman writes that "[t]he tech-
nological revolution in reproduction is forcing us to confront the very meaning of motherhood, to ex-
amine the nature and origins of the mother-child bond, and to replace--or to let us think we can re-
place--chance with choice." Taking this as our starting point, in this course we'll examine a number
of conceptual and ethical issues in the use and development of technologies related to human repro-
duction, drawing out their implications for such core concepts as "motherhood" and "parenthood,"
family and genetic relatedness, exploitation and commodification, and reproductive rights and soci-
ety's interests in reproductive activities. Topics will range from consideration of "mundane" technol-
ogies such as in vitro fertilization (IVF), prenatal genetic screening and testing, and surrogacy, to the
more extraordinary, including pre-implantation diagnosis (PID), post-menopausal reproduction,
post-mortem gamete procurement, reproductive cloning and embryo splitting, and in utero medical
interventions. Background readings include sources rooted in traditional modes of bioethical analysis
as well as those incorporating feminist approaches.
Format: discussion. Requirements: active participation in class discussions, short weekly reflection
papers, and two longer papers (app. 10 pp).
Prerequisites: none, but introductory-level course in Philosophy and/or Women's and Gender Studies
highly recommended. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference given to Women's and Gender
Studies majors and concentrators. This course is writing intensive.

WGST 282(S) Feminist Approaches to Religion (Same as Religion 306) (W)
What does feminist theory have to offer the study of religion? How have participants in various
religious traditions helped to produce and enact feminisms? Feminism and religion have a long but
often troubled history of interconnection. In this course, we shall explore a range of feminist theoreti-
cal perspectives that have either emerged out of particular religious contexts or have been applied to
the study of religious traditions and practices. We shall consider how conflicts within feminism-espe-
cially those pertaining to issues of sexuality, race, class, nationality, ethnicity, and religious affiliation-
make a difference for the ways that religion as a category is interpreted. Authors considered in this
class will include: Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Mary Daly, Elisabeth Schussler Fiorenza, Katie Cannon,
bell hooks, Judith Butler, Judith Plaskow, Ada Maria Isasi-Diaz, Kwok Pui Lan, Rachel Adler, M.
Elaine Combs-Schilling, Adrienne Rich, Patricia Williams, Sallie McFague, Melanie Morrison, and
Marijas Gimbutas.
Format: seminar. Requirements: brief weekly writings assignments; one class presentation; one
5-page essay; one 15-page research paper.
Open to all classes without prerequisite. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 15). This course is writing

WGST 402(S) The Personal and the Political: Confessional Narrative and Feminist Politics
(W)
This course is designed to enable advanced Women's and Gender Studies students to engage in com-
mon research on vital interdisciplinary topics. Confessional practices have played a central role in
second wave feminism whether in the form of consciousness raising in the early seventies, lesbian
coming out stories, or revealing the truth about one's history as a survivor of rape or sexual abuse. In
this course we explore the historical roots of confession in women's lives and literature as well as its
personal and political functions. Readings may include confessions of witches at the Salem witch
trials, females slave narratives, coming out stories, as well as theoretical and critical essays investigat-
ing issues related to authority, authenticity, power, identity formation and self-recovery. Require-
ments for the course include weekly 1- to 2-page critical response essays and one substantial research
paper (15-20 pages).
Format: discussion oriented. Students will present work in progress, read and discuss one another's
papers and be asked to write at least two drafts of their research papers.
Prerequisite: Women's and Gender Studies 101 and two electives (one of which may be taken during
the spring term in which the seminar is held). Enrollment limit: 15 (expected: 10). This course is writ-
ing intensive.

CRITICAL REASONING AND
ANALYTICAL SKILLS (CRAAS) COURSES
To one degree or another, every class at Williams goes beyond its subject--be it mathematics, Ma-
chiavelli, or modernism--to teach intellectual skills that have wide application in other fields as well
as outside of the academy: scientific reckoning, expository writing, rhetorical analysis, oral presenta-
tion, and so on.
Courses offered under the CRAAS initiative foreground such analytical skills. While each CRAAS
class covers a different topic, all are aimed particularly at developing the processes necessary for ex-
Critical Reasoning and Analytical Skills Coruses, Peoples and Cultures Courses
­ 317 ­
cellence in a range of fields: techniques for analyzing ideas, data, texts or artworks; approaches to
interpreting, synthesizing, and developing arguments; strategies for presenting ideas and results.
CRAAS classes typically emphasize the practices of meta-analysis--self-criticism, editing, and re-
vision--with the goal of constant improvement. Many classes feature peer tutoring, small group
work, and intensive one-on-one engagement with the professor. Students should leave a CRAAS
course with a substantially heightened ability to approach problems, analyze texts, and craft argu-
ments in whatever discipline they may go on to explore.
A few CRAAS courses are restricted to advanced students, but the majority are open to all, and
some are specifically targeted for first year students. Most have strictly limited enrollment. Because
these classes cultivate the general strategies of effective scholarship, students are encouraged to con-
sider taking a CRAAS course early in their academic careers.

PEOPLES AND CULTURES COURSES
The peoples and cultures requirement is intended to help students to begin to understand the cultur-
al diversity of American society and the world at large, so that, as citizens of an increasingly intercon-
nected world, they may become better able to respond sensitively and intelligently to peoples of var-
ied social backgrounds and cultural frameworks. Courses which fulfill this requirement are thus de-
signed to familiarize students with some dimension of American cultural diversity or that of the non-
Western world. Each student must complete one graded semester course primarily concerned with:
(a) the peoples and cultures of North America that trace their origins to Africa, Asia, Latin America,
Oceania, or the Caribbean; Native-American peoples and cultures; or (b) the peoples and cultures of
Africa, Asia, Latin America, Oceania, or the Caribbean. Although this course, which may be counted
toward the divisional distribution requirement, may be completed any semester before graduation,
students are urged to complete the course by the end of the sophomore year.

QUANTITATIVE / FORMAL REASONING COURSES
Williams students should be adept at reasoning mathematically and abstractly. The ability to apply
a formal method to reach conclusions, to use numbers comfortably, and to employ the research tools
necessary to analyze data lessen barriers to carrying out professional and economic roles. Prior to their
senior year, all students must satisfactorily complete a Quantitative/Formal Reasoning (QFR)
course--those marked with a "(Q)." Students requiring extra assistance (as assessed during First
Days) are normally placed into Mathematics 100/101, which is to be taken before fulfilling the QFR
requirement.
The hallmarks of a QFR course are the representation of facts in a language of mathematical sym-
bols and the use of formal rules to obtain a determinate answer. Primary evaluation in these courses is
based on multistep mathematical, statistical, or logical inference (as opposed to descriptive answers).

RELATED COURSE LISTINGS
There are a number of significant areas of studies in which Williams offers many relevant courses,
yet no formal program. To alert students to the opportunity for integrating courses from diverse disci-
plines into a focus area and to encourage them to do so, the courses in this section are organized as lists
of topic-related courses. For their full descriptions, see the respective departmental sections.

Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual Studies
Gay, lesbian, and bisexual studies focuses on the social construction of sexuality, past and present.
Although, at present, Williams does not have a formal concentration in gay, lesbian, and bisexual
studies, the College offers a number of courses which examine how social, cultural, and political insti-
tutions shape sexualities, as well as the responses and resistances thereto, through a variety of texts
and contexts. The following courses include significant components on gay, lesbian, and bisexual
studies (at least two weeks out of the semester).

WRITING-INTENSIVE COURSES
Courses designated as "writing intensive"--those marked with a "(W)"--stress the process of
learning to write effectively. Such courses include a substantial amount of writing (a minimum of 20
pages), usually divided into several discrete assignments. Instructors pay close attention to matters of
style and argumentation. Enrollments are limited to 19.
All Williams College students are required to take two writing-intensive courses: one by the end of
the sophomore year and one by the end of the junior year. Students will benefit most from writing-in-
tensive courses by taking them early in their college careers and are therefore strongly encouraged to
complete the requirement by the end of the sophomore year.

Williams College sponsors a one-semester interdisciplinary program which includes credit for one
winter study in American Maritime Studies in cooperation with Mystic Seaport Museum. Courses are
taught as part of the College's off-campus program in Mystic, Connecticut. Students apply for either
the fall or the spring semester and take four of five courses offered. Students also take part in a non-
credit maritime skills class of their choice, choosing from celestial navigation, sailing, music of the
sea, ship smithing, and the outdoor demonstration squad. Students live in cooperative houses at Mys-
tic Seaport and participate in field seminars to the Pacific Coast and Nantucket Island as well as an
11-day offshore trip as part of their coursework. Interested students may obtain further information
and an application through the Dean's Office. An open house is held bi-annually in November and
March. A personal interview is required. Admission is competitive. Students must meet Williams
College and Williams-Mystic application deadlines.

HALL
WILLIAMS-OXFORD PROGRAMME
Director, Professor CHRISTOPHER M. WATERS
THE PROGRAMME
Williams College offers a year-long programme of studies at Oxford University in co-operation
with Exeter College, Oxford. Based at Ephraim Williams House in North Oxford, the Programme is
designed to integrate students into the intellectual and social life of one of the world's greatest univer-
sities. It uses the Oxford tutorial system and follows the Oxford three-term calendar. The resident di-
rector administers Ephraim Williams House, oversees the academic programme, and serves as both
academic and personal advisor to the students.
Students in the Oxford Programme enroll for the full academic year, which consists of Michaelmas,
Hilary, and Trinity terms. These are each eight-weeks long (running from early October to early De-
cember, mid-January to mid-March, and late April to mid-June), although students are also expected
to be in residence to write their first tutorial papers before each term begins and to sit final exams after
they end. Between the three terms there are two intervening four-five week vacations during which
students may be expected to continue reading as preparation for upcoming tutorials.
Over the course of the three terms, students are expected to take a minimum of four full tutorials and
one half tutorial. Some students choose to substitute a fifth full tutorial for the half tutorial and a few
even take more than five tutorials (see below for further details).
THE CURRICULUM
In addition to extensive opportunities to pursue British and Commonwealth studies, the Pro-
gramme offers instruction in other fields for which Oxford is particularly noted or which are repre-
sented only marginally or infrequently in the Williams curriculum. Special provision is made for ac-
commodating student interests or curricular needs that extend beyond the fields of study listed below.
No disciplinary or departmental interest, therefore, is necessarily excluded. Instruction is by tutorial,
often supplemented by attending a programme of lectures or seminars from among the rich array
sponsored by the University each term.
TUTORIALS
Students elect a minimum of four full tutorials and one half tutorial--and sometimes five full
tutorials, or more--during the academic year. A full tutorial consists of eight tutorial sessions, and a
half tutorial of four tutorial sessions. These are weekly meetings of one or two students with an Ox-
ford tutor at which the student presents an essay on an assigned topic with discussion focusing on
that topic. Eight essays in all will be written for each full tutorial subject and four for each half-tuto-
rial subject. At the start of the term tutors will assign a list of readings, which students will be ex-
pected to complete on their own during term time and the vacation. Students may be encouraged to
follow a pertinent lecture course offered by the University in the general area of the tutorial subject.
What follows is a list of tutorials normally available to students studying with the Williams Col-
lege Oxford Programme. The tutorials listed below (WIOX 211-282) represent a selection of some
of the standard `papers' (courses) that comprise the Oxford degrees in various subjects and that are
taught in tutorial format. Normally (but not always) tutors can be secured who can teach these tuto-
rials to Williams students in Oxford, although demand, leave patterns, and other constraints some-
times mean that not all of these tutorial subjects can be staffed in all terms. WIOX 290 (described in
more detail below) differs from the other tutorials listed here in that it is a general rubric for more
specialized tutorial work.
WIOX 211 Art History: English Architecture 1660-1720
A study of the principal buildings of Wren, Hawksmoor, Jones and Vanburgh in relation to the con-
temporary historical background. Field trips to London and Blenheim in addition to inspection of im-

WIOX 290 Specially Arranged Subjects
Specially arranged tutorial work in some subject areas other than those covered by the WIOX 211-282
tutorials--or in some non-listed subfields of the areas covered--might also be possible. It should be
stressed, however, that a WIOX 290 is not simply what would be called an `independent study' course at
Williams. Rather, a WIOX 290 is normally a `paper' (course) regularly offered at Oxford as either a re-
quired or optional part of the degree in various disciplines. For a list of the `papers' that make up the degree
Williams-Oxford Programme
­ 330 ­
requirements in certain fields, you should consult the University of Oxford Examination Decrees and Reg-
ulations, a recent copy of which can be found in the Dean's Office. You might also consult the various
faculty websites at Oxford (go to the Oxford University home page--www.ox.ac.uk--and then click on
`departments'), some of which list the papers taught as part of the degree offerings by that faculty. It is often
easier to find tutors for a 290 in some fields (Classics, English, History, Philosophy, Religion, etc.) than in
others (Economics, Psychology, many of the sciences, etc.). Students requesting a specially arranged sub-
ject must indicate as a backup choice one of the tutorial offerings from WIOX 211-282 and realize that it
might not always be possible to accommodate their requests.
A sample list of specially-arranged subjects (WIOX 290) staffed during the past two years in-
cludes the following:

Grades and Credits
Grades for each tutorial reflect the mark assigned to all eight (or four) tutorial sessions, including
their related essays, considered together, as well as the mark for the final examination on work ac-
complished in the tutorial and supplementary reading. Final examinations are three hours in the
case of full tutorials and two hours in the case of half tutorials. The final grade recorded on the Wil-
liams transcript is calculated by counting the tutorial mark as two-thirds and the final examination
mark as one-third. For some tutorials, tutors may offer the student the option of a final paper or proj-
ect rather than examination.
Upon satisfactory completion of the requirements for the Williams College Oxford Programme
students receive academic credit for a full Williams academic year. Grades are incorporated into
their Williams transcript and are included in the computation of their GPA.
Williams-Oxford Programme
­ 331 ­
Tutorials may be used toward fulfilling the divisional distribution requirement; a student may earn
a year maximum of three distribution credits, with no more than one from each division, for the year.
NON-CREDIT FOREIGN LANGUAGE STUDY
In addition to their required tutorials, students may begin or continue the study of a wide range of
foreign languages on a non-credit basis through a variety of arrangements available through the
University as well as a number of other educational and cultural institutions in the city of Oxford.
The Programme normally subsidizes such study.
STUDENT LIFE
The Williams College Oxford Programme offers students every opportunity to integrate fully into
life at Oxford. The University offers access to an exceptional variety of sports, societies, interest
groups, activities, and cultural events. Students are closely associated with their counterparts at Exeter
College, are able the share in the social life of the College, to use its athletic facilities, and to dine in
Hall during the week. They have access to the University's athletic events, concerts, theatrical produc-
tions, museums, and to some of its many libraries. All may become members of the Oxford Union
Debating Society, which, in addition to its debating activities and club rooms, possesses dining facili-
ties and the largest lending library in the University. Students are housed (in doubles) at Ephraim Wil-
liams House, which is equipped with its own library, computer lab, and common rooms as well as with
laundry and dining facilities, and which serves one catered dinner a week during the term. The house
is within easy walking distance of the University Parks, convenient to the Summertown complex of
shops and restaurants, and about five minutes by bicycle to the heart of the University.
There is an orientation period in October before the beginning of the academic year to help ac-
quaint students with Oxford and the opportunities and challenges they will meet during the year.
Throughout the academic year, provision will be made for trips to a number of sites of historical,
cultural, or political interest as Stratford, Stonehenge, Bath, Wells, Chepstow Castle and Tintern
Abbey, and Parliament in London. Students will also attend a number of theatre productions and
other cultural events. In addition, Oxford's proximity to London gives students ready access to that
city's multiple attractions and resources. The Oxford-London train service is an hourly one, and the
journey takes just over an hour. Buses run even more frequently, and the journey takes about an hour
and a half.
ILLNESS AND INSURANCE
You must be covered either by the Williams College student health insurance policy or some oth-
er comprehensive insurance plan (generally your family's health insurance). While in the U.K., you
will be covered under the National Health Service (NHS) for routine visits at the Exeter College
group medical practice and for emergency hospital treatment. Prescription drugs are available
through the NHS at a nominal fee. There are only limited outpatient psychological counseling ser-
vices available through the NHS and the Oxford Programme. Any extensive or long-term counsel-
ing would have to be covered by your personal health insurance policy. Finally, you are not likely to
be covered under the NHS for medical services received in other foreign countries, especially non-
European Community countries.
FEES
The tuition and room fees for the Programme are equivalent to those for a year at Williams. Stu-
dents are responsible for their own transportation, most of their meals, and personal expenses. For
planning purposes, students and their parents should expect the cost of a year on the Williams Col-
lege Oxford Programme to be about the same as a year at Williams. Financial aid eligibility will be
figured on the usual basis of tuition, fees, room, board, and personal and book expenses just as if the
student were at Williams. Similarly, the normal self-help contribution would be expected. Since the
academic year ends later at Oxford than at Williams, the summer earning expectation for the fol-
lowing year will be reduced by one half and the difference made up by additional Williams aid.
APPLICATION
Admission to the Programme is on a competitive but flexible basis. Students must apply to the
Dean's Office by the prescribed deadline (normally in February) and, prior to applying, should con-
sult with the chair of their major department. They can expect to be notified of acceptance before
Spring break. It is the normal expectation that they will have completed the College's distribution
requirement by the end of their sophomore year. The Admissions Committee takes the GPA into
account and expects applicants to have demonstrated capacity for independent work. Applicants
must identify two Williams faculty members who are willing to provide references (the committee
will not request those faculty members to write letters but will contact them). Because of the empha-
sis at Oxford on written work, at least one of these faculty members should be able to offer an assess-
ment of the applicant's writing ability.

All students who will be on campus during the 2002-2003 academic year must register for WSP.
Registration will take place in the early part of fall semester. If you are registered for a senior thesis in
the fall which must be continued through Winter Study by departmental rules, you will be registered
for your Winter Study Project automatically. In every other case, you must complete registration.
First-year students are required to participate in a Winter Study that will take place on campus; they
are not allowed to do 99's.
Even if you plan to take a 99, or the instructor of your first choice accepts you during the registration
period, there are many things that can happen between registration and the beginning of Winter Study
to upset your first choice, so you must list five choices. You should try to make one of your choices a
project with a larger enrollment, not that it will guarantee you a project, but it will increase your
chances.
If you think your time may be restricted in any way (ski meets, interviews, etc.), clear these restric-
tions with the instructor before signing up for his/her project.
Remember, for cross-listed projects, you should sign up for the subject you want to appear on your
record.
For many beginning language courses, you are required to take the WSP Sustaining Program in
addition to your regular project. You will be automatically enrolled in this Sustaining Program, so no
one should list this as a choice.
The grade of honors is reserved for outstanding or exceptional work. Individual instructors may
specify minimum standards for the grade, but normally, fewer than one out of ten students will qualify.
A grade of pass means the student has performed satisfactorily. A grade of perfunctory pass signifies
that a student's work has been significantly lacking but is just adequate to deserve a pass.
If you have any questions about a project, see the instructor before you register.
Finally, all work for WSP must be completed and submitted to the instructor no later than Thursday,
January 30th. Only the Dean can grant an extension beyond this date.
WINTER STUDY 99'S
Sophomores, juniors and seniors are eligible to propose "99's," independent projects arranged with
faculty sponsors, conducted in lieu of regular Winter Study courses. Perhaps you have encountered an
interesting idea in one of your courses which you would like to study in more depth, or you may have
an interest not covered in the regular curriculum. In recent years students have undertaken in-depth
studies of particular literary works, interned in government offices, assisted in foreign and domestic
medical clinics, conducted field work in economics in developing countries, and given performances
illustrating the history of American dance. Although some 99's involve travel away from campus,
there are many opportunities to pursue intellectual or artistic goals here in Williamstown.
99 forms are available online:
http://www.williams.edu/Registrar/winterstudy/99direct.html
The deadline for submitting the proposals to faculty sponsors is Thursday, 26 September.

origin of laws that protect trademarks, patents, and copyright, the ways in which they create new
forms of property, and their contemporary crisis of legitimacy in the face of resistance to globaliza-
tion. The first half of the course will consist of regular class meetings, the latter half of directed inde-
pendent study of some aspect of intellectual property. Readings will include works by legal scholars,
sociologists, anthropologists, and activists in indigenous rights and environmental conservation.
Requirements: 10- to 15-page paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20.
Meeting time: mornings.

ANSO 011 Berkshire Farm Internship
A field placement at Berkshire Farm Center and Services for Youth in Canaan, New York. Berkshire
Farm Center is a residential treatment facility for troubled, at-risk adolescent boys who have been
remanded to the Farm by the Family Court. These youths come primarily from lower socio-economic
strata, are very ethnically diverse, and hail from both urban and rural areas throughout New York
State. The problems that they bring to Berkshire Farm are multiple. These include: the psychological
scars of dysfunctional families, including those of physical, emotional, and sexual abuse; chemical
dependency; juvenile delinquency; inability to function in school settings; and various other issues.
Residential treatment is a multi-modal approach that includes anger-replacement training, social
skills training, and behavioral modification.
Williams students will commute to Berkshire Farm and work under supervision in one of the follow-
ing areas: school, cottage life, chemical dependency unit, research, recreation, performing arts, or in
individual tutoring. Students will keep a journal reflecting on their experiences. A weekly seminar
with the instructor will draw on service learning experience. Students will also be required to submit a
final 10-page paper at the end of the course.
Prerequisites: placement is only through interview with instructor before registering for course.
Enrollment limit: 13. (All queries about this course should be directed to the instructor, who can be

mandates have not successfully addressed this crisis. This course allows students to observe the Mas-
sachusetts Department of Social Services attorney in courtroom proceedings related to the care and
protection of children. Students will have access to Department records for purposes of analysis and
will also work with social workers who will provide a clinical perspective on the legal cases under
study. The class will meet regularly to discuss court proceedings, assigned readings, and the students'
interactions with local human services agencies.
Evaluation will be based on the journal and a final 10-page paper. Full participation in the course is
expected.
Requirements: access to an automobile is desirable but not required; some transportation will be pro-

ANSO 013 Subsistence and Development: Special Issues in Alaska Native Economy and
Society (Same as Environmental Studies 021)
With the settlement of aboriginal land claims in 1971, Alaska Native people became owners of 44
million acres of land and shareholders in business corporations. The traditional hunting and fishing
way of life, known as "subsistence," remains a vital foundation to village life in rural Alaska, while
Alaska Native corporations have engaged in a wide variety of resource development ventures. This
course explores the cultural, legal, and economic dimensions of two particularly controversial issues.
In 1980, based on lobbying by Alaska Natives, Congress passed legislation establishing a priority for
rural subsistence uses in fish and wildlife management. However, sport hunter opposition, and con-
flicting state and federal regimes, make this one of the most significant controversies in Alaska today.
Oil development on the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is vigorously supported by the Inupiat people
of the North Slope, while the Gwitch'in people of the southern Brooks Range fear this would be dev-
astating to the Porcupine caribou herd, upon which they rely. The alliances of Native people with in-
dustry and environmentalist have elevated this to a national issue. Films, web-sites, readings, and dis-
cussion will provide insight into the paradox of continuity and change facing Alaska Native society.
Requirements: 10- to 15-page paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20.
Meeting time: mornings.
Cost to student: approximately $40.

ARTH 010 To Outwit Time Is No Small Feat: Exploring Regional Museums
This course will introduce the holdings of selected regional museums through weekly museum excur-
sions. All aspects of museums will be discussed, though an emphasis will be on discussing the delicate
balance between preservation of, and access to, museum objects. Art conservation and preservation
methods will be described, and at least one tour of an art conservation laboratory will be included in
the class. The class will begin with a tour of the Williams College Museum of Art, and will continue
with four, weekly day-long museum excursions. Tours will include exhibitions, and behind-the
scenes views at MASS MoCA, the Chapin Library, the Tang Teaching Museum and Art Gallery, the
Clark Art Institute, Historic Deerfield, and the Albany Institute of History and Art. The class will trav-
el to New York; the museums selected will depend on the current exhibition schedules.
Evaluation will be based on participation in all museum visits and one researched presentation and
accompanying 10-page paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 10.
Cost to student: $100-$125, for books, handouts, costs associated with admission to museums, and

ARTH 012 The Ramayana in Art (Same as Asian Studies 012)
The Ramayana, or "Travels of Rama," is one of the most popular epics of Idia. It is a heroic tale in-
volving romance, sacrifice, villainy, and warfare on both the human and the cosmic or heavenly sca-
les. To know the Ramayana is to grasp the essentials of Hindu religion, culture, and values. This
course will explore the exciting visual and performing arts inspired by the Ramayana in India, where
the story originated, as well as the lands of Southeast Asia where it spread. Arts to be explored will
include the great temple sculptures in stone and bronze, large scale and miniature painting, plays,
dance and musical drama, batik, puppet shows, even modern day comic books, and film and televi-
sion productions of the Ramayana. Social and aesthetic issues to be considered may include the role
played by the arts in society; methods and aims of artistic expression; ideals of beauty and of virtue;
social status and gender; the various transformations of the Ramayana in both literature and art in vari-
ous parts of India and by various levels of society ("folk" art vs. "high" art), as well as the various
different cultures of southeast Asia. The course will consist partly of art history lectures, and partly of
studio art practice.
Evaluation will be based on attendance (mandatory), participation in class discussions based on read-
ings, and the production of painted illustrations to the story.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15.
Meeting time: mornings, two three-hour sessions per week.

ARTS 010 Marble Carving
The marble carving workshop introduces the student to the tools and traditional techniques of marble
sculpture. This course is suitable for students of all levels of ability. The instructor will demonstrate
the techniques and then help each student with their work. Instruction will include roughing out the
work in planes, modeling with tooth chisels, carving the final form and finishing the surface. There
will be demonstrations on the use of the diamond saw and air hammer (if a compressor is available.
We will work with hand tools and each student should bring a model (maquette) of the sculpture they
wish to carve. We will use local Vermont marble for the workshop.
Evaluation will be based on class participation, effort, attendance, the quality of work produced and
the final exhibition of work.

ARTS 013 Pastel: A Study of Color and the Figure
A studio course for those who have a keen interest in exploring their artistic potential. The instruction
will be individualized but all will benefit from gentle but constructive group critiques. Pastel is one of
the best media for learning about color as it can only be mixed directly on the painting surface; the
range of color and hue that results from the mixing of just a few pastels is remarkable. The class will
focus primarily on drawing and painting the figure. With the use of fabrics we will partially clothe the
figure and the background in a variety of colors from neturals to brilliant hues in order to explore the
range of colors that pastel accommodates. Students will need to purchase or provide a medium-sized
set of pastels. Other items that are needed are easels, drawing boards, 1" to 2" wide bristle brushes,
pastel paper, glassine paper and a simple portfolio.
Evaluation will be based on class participation, effort, attendance, the quality of work produced and
the final exhibition of work.
No prerequisites. Some studio experience is helpful but not required. Enrollment limit: 12.
Meeting time: mornings, six hours per week.

ARTS 014 Artforum Summer 1967: An Exhibition
This course will consider a moment in recent art history from the point of view of a studio artist. Like
anthropologists from another planet, students in this class will look for meaning in every inch of a
cultural artifact, in this case, an Artforum magazine from the summer of 1967. What was so special
about the summer 1967 issue of Artforum? The issue contains a dramatic clash between two distinct
critical points of view: the critic Michael Fried contributed a landmark essay, "Art and Objecthood"
and the artist Sol LeWitt published his now famous, "Paragraphs on Conceptual Art." In this issue we
see the end of one modernist view of art, and the beginnings of the many mixed art practices to come.
We will consider everything between the covers: essays, reviews, projects by artists, even advertise-
ments as we consider this hinge moment in contemporary art practice. Our goal is to create a compre-
hensive (yet physically small) exhibition based on the art depicted between these pages. Students will
build scale models, make drawings and paintings or otherwise engage art on view in the magazine.
No particular aptitude for these techniques is required, though a willingness to learn is essential.
Evaluation will be based on journal entries, class participation, and the successful completion of art-
work for the end-of-class exhibition.
Prerequisite: any 100 level art history or studio art course. Enrollment limit: 16. Open to all, but pref-
erence will be given to Art majors.
Meeting time: mornings.
Cost to student: approximately $75 for materials.

ARTS 015 Large-Format Photography
The course is designed to introduce students to studio/view cameras, to processing the sheet-film neg-
atives made in them, and to making contact and projection prints. Studio exercises will include careful
analysis of camera movements to teach their use, and a consideration of lighting techniques; dark
room exercises will include the tray development of sheet film, determination of effective film speed,
and control of contrast through development time. The subject matter of the photographs produced in
the course will not be prescribed; it is limited only by the participants' imagination and the weather in
January. Working with subjects of their own choosing, students will be instructed in the principles of
traditional photographic image making by producing large-format negatives and translating them into
effective black-and-white prints in 4x5 and 8x10 formats.
Each student will be expected to make exhibition-quality prints, which may be enlargements or con-
tact prints from 4x5 negatives, or contract prints from 8x10 negatives. The prints will be exhibited in a
group show at the end of Winter Study.
Evaluation will be based on commitment to the course, participation in discussion sessions, and the

visual materials, such as ancient Chinese paintings and murals, which are rich in this regard, and vid-
eotapes. Students will be given reading materials related to the mythology and sociopolitical and cul-
tural context and significance of the dances to be taught. The dances include, for instance, fan dance,
ribbon dance, and the Bayi, a ritual dance performed at the temples of Confucius since ancient times,
which is still performed in Taiwan on Confucius' birthday.

month of January when we need signs of renewal. "Greenhouse Drawing" will meet for nine hours a
week in this campus oasis to draw the plants and architecture. We will also use studio space in Spencer
to enlarge and abstract our life studies into large scale compositions that involve pattern and color.
Beginning and advanced students are welcome, since the small class size allows for personalized in-
struction. The class will focus on the careful observation of nature and should be of interest to both the
scientist and the artist.
Evaluation is based on successful in-class projects and weekly homework and participation in an ex-

JAPN 011 Embodied Learning (Same as Theatre 011)
Performance has outgrown its rather narrow theatrical meaning and has come to serve as a paradigm
for the means by which we participate in our culture and in our world. With that sea change in under-
standing comes a necessary rethinking of the roles of "learning" and "training." The notion of "em-
bodied learning" describes the vivid interplay between the intellect and the viscera, necessary to suc-
cessfully engage in any number of performances, from combat, to dance, to participating in the lan-
guage and behavior of a target culture.
While the goals of the course (and the reading materials) are far-reaching, the methods of the studio
activity are comparatively focused. The instructor will draw on experiences training with artists asso-
ciated with the Japanese butoh dance movement. These exercises provide an intensive physical chal-
lenge, while inviting the imaginative release necessary to successfully improvise within a carefully
defined subtextual structure.
This is an experience-based course that explores ways in which the body participates in learning. To
Winter Study Program
­ 339 ­
be considered is the body's relationship (1) to itself: i.e., the interrelation of structure and posture; (2)
to an object, whereby the physical exigencies of an object external to the body take on the role of
`teacher'; (3) to an architectural context (inclusive of spatial and cultural pressures); and (4) to an oth-
er or group of others.
The class will meet 12 hours per week (in four 3-hour installments, or according to the availability of
space). It will be a highly physical class, consisting of exercises that move through the space, and
those that require direct physical interaction among students and between instructor and student. Each
class will be structured to account for the students' physiological progression from hour to hour (i.e.,
we will not attempt to stretch cold muscles or begin with activities that are highly aerobic, but rather
will follow a sequence that accounts for the participants' evolving bodily state). Loose, comfortable
and layered (to account for climate) clothing is also a must.
Evaluation will be based on the quality and timely completion of outside assignments and on daily
commitment to in-class activities. Assignments will include reading materials addressing issues of
embodied learning from a variety of viewpoints; written summaries of one or more of those selec-
tions; regular journal writing; and a short, in-class presentation.
No prerequisites, but students are encouraged, however, to make an honest assessment of their own
health, conditioning and readiness to respond to the physical demands of the course.

ASTRONOMY
ASTR 010 Cosmology: The History of the Universe
Every culture has a creation story about the beginning (and often the end) of the Universe. Over the
last 50 years, scientists have developed a modern story, involving the Big Bang, the creation of the
elements, the formation of stars and galaxies, and the expansion of the cosmos. The great advantage of
the modern story is that it is based on solid and specific evidence. In this introductory course, meant
for non-majors, we will recount the history of the Universe as a whole, from its fiery beginning to its
possible fate over billions of years. Our emphasis will be on understanding the evidence. How do we
know the age of the Universe? How do we measure the distance to the galaxies? We will discuss the
concepts of space-time and radiation, and phenomena such as quasars and gravitational lenses, using
no mathematics beyond basic algebra and trigonometry. We will also discuss those parts of the mod-
ern creation story that are still mysterious, such as the nature of "dark matter," the
apparent acceleration of the Universe's expansion, and the reason why the Big Bang banged.

ASTR 011 Leadership in Astronomy: From Copernicus and Galileo to Hubble and the Age of
the Universe (Same as History of Science 011 and INTR 011)
Progress in understanding our Universe has undergone major steps as the result of sweeping new
ideas introduced by major scientists. Copernicus, in his book of 1543, shook the foundations of an-
cient science; Tycho, a few decades later, revolutionized the idea of observing the heavens; and Kep-
ler, in 1603-1618, completed the Copernican Revolution by removing the ancient idea that perfect
circles were necessary for orbits. Galileo's discoveries endorsed Copernicanism observationally.
Halley and Newton, starting in the 1680's, led the world to comprehend the universality of gravity and
linked comets with planets in obeying the law of gravity. In the twentieth century, Shapley moved the
Sun out of its central place in the Universe and Hubble, in the 1920's, found that our galaxy was only
one out of many and that the Universe is expanding all around us. In addition to studying the contribu-
tions of these leaders, we will see how Hubble's law of the expanding Universe was studied as a Key
Project of the Hubble Space Telescope and how astronomers know more accurately the cosmic dis-
tance scale and the age of the Universe. We will investigate various observations from the Hubble
Space Telescope, the Chandra X-ray Observatory, and other telescopes on the ground and in space to
show how they help us understand the universe. We will consider the cosmic distance scale back to its
roots in Captain Cook's expedition to the South Pacific in 1769 to study the transit of Venus and dis-
cuss plans for observing the forthcoming transit of Venus, a rare event that has not been viewed by
anyone now alive on Earth but that will occur in 2004. We will consider the role of NASA, the space
shuttle, and astronaut/astronomers in shaping scientific goals. Biographies and other readings, videos,
and visitors will help shape the discussion. In the rare book library, we will examine first editions of
epochal books by the authors listed above, from Copernicus's 1543 volume on upward toward the
present, and some students may wish to make their reports or carry out other projects with those vol-
umes.
Evaluation will be based on a final 10-page paper and presentation.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 12. If over-enrolled, selection will be made on the basis of interest

BIOL 011 Envisioning a Sustainable Future (Same as Environmental Studies 011)
If humanity is to survive the next century, a massive movement towards ecological sustainability must
occur. What is a sustainable lifestyle like? Will we have to sacrifice? How do we get there from here?
In this course, we will first look at key technologies and resource management issues required for (and
also driving!) the movement towards sustainability, including energy, water and agricultural practic-
es. By considering the ramifications of these issues, it will be possible to envision in some detail what
a sustainable lifestyle must be like. We will then consider how the mindset and practices of the devel-
oped world must evolve to allow the sustainability movement to truly take hold. Students will read
several short background papers before each class.
Each student will write a 10-page paper or complete an equivalent project on a topic of their choice,
and, in the last week of Winter Study present a 15-minute summary of this independent research.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 16. Preference will be given to Environmental Studies concentra-
tors.
Meeting time: Monday, Wednesday and Thursdays from 10a.m.-12p.m., and Tuesdays should be held
open for all-day field trips.

BIOL 012 Science in the Media (Same as Chemistry 012)
(See under Chemistry for full description.)
BIOL 013 Mapping the Natural Landscape (Same as Environmental Studies 013 and
Geosciences 013)
Cartography, while rooted in the rigors of science, is very much an aesthetic exercise. A map that is
successful aesthetically provides the best medium for communicating information to the user. Natural
landscapes provide some of the most compelling and rewarding material for a cartographer to practice
with. This project-oriented course will address both the scientific and aesthetic domains of cartogra-
phy, while developing maps of natural areas of interest to individual students. Introductory material
will include the cartographic fundamentals of geodesy and projections, geographic data research, and
the compilation and manipulation of data. We will then turn our attention to cartographic design, with
an emphasis on depicting natural landscapes as exemplified in the work of the great mountain cartog-
raphers of Switzerland as well as some closer to home. We will explore and utilize techniques that
have become widely accessible with modern technology, such as digital elevation model manipula-
tion and shading, and multi-layered artwork composition in raster and vector graphics environments.
Students will design and complete a project involving the depiction of a landscape (with or without
overlaid thematic content) on a map or cartographic illustration which may be static, animated or in-
teractive.
Evaluation will be based on the completed project and a final exhibition.
Prerequisite: familiarity with computers--graphics experience recommended but not required. En-
rollment limit: 10. Preference should be given to students already already having some familiarity
with mapping and computer graphics.
Meeting time: three class meetings per week--two 10a.m. classroom sessions and one 1p.m. lab ses-
sion.

BIOL 014 Orchids! (Same as Environmental Studies 014)
This course explores the world of orchids. First we will consider the aesthetics of orchids and how this
fueled both the exploration for new species in the nineteenth century and the production of modern
hybrids. Next we will study the biology of orchids particularly the structural and physiological
adaptations that have permitted these plants to inhabit sites as diverse as the treetops of tropical forests
and the frozen meadows of New England. The complex relationship between flower structure and the
behavior of pollinators is of special interest. The fascinating world of the orchid hybridizer will be
examined. How is it possible to combine four genera to make one plant? The commercialization of
orchids led to the destruction of many natural populations. Is it possible to protect and possibly rees-
tablish endangered species through the cultivation and propagation of orchids from seed? Orchid hy-
bridization and the discovery of methods for the tissue culture of rare plants have revolutionized the
commercial availability of orchids. Globalization has affected the orchid industry. We will discuss
these recent trends and what it means for those hoping for a career with orchids.
Students will be given the opportunity to examine living plants and flowers of various orchid genera.
We will demonstrate the techniques for growing the plants in the greenhouse and within the home.
Mature specimens will be repotted and students will deflask seedlings and set up community pots.
Students will be required to write a 10-page paper or develop an equivalent presentation on the orchid
topic of their choice, to be shared with the class during a final session o the last day of Winter Study.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 14.
Meeting time: mornings, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday 10a.m.-12p.m.; two field trips are
planned--one to J&L Orchids in Easton, CT., a leader in growing species orchids from seed and the
second to Conway Orchids in Conway, MA., a grower of championship Cattleya hybrids.

BIOL 016 Natural Science Illustration (Same as ArtS 016)
Natural science illustration combines art with careful attention to the details of plant and animal life.
Drawing or painting biological subjects is an important way to discover the true nature of an organism
or habitat. In publications, illustrations clarify information and draw attention to the text. In this
course, the instructor will present demonstrations and examples of natural science illustration, but the
students will spend the bulk of their time creating their own illustrations. The goal will be for each
student to research, illustrate, and write text for one comprehensive illustration about an aspect of nat-
ural science such as habitat, ecology, pollution or life-cycle. The class will meet twice a week in the
morning for three hours and students will be expected to spend significant time outside class working
on their illustrations and research.
Students will be evaluated on the basis of their class participation and the effort they put into their
illustration for the final show. This course is open to anyone with a comfortable level of drawing
ability.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 14.
Meeting time: mornings.
Cost to student: approximately $75.

BIOL 017 The New England Forest (Same as Environmental Studies 017)
This field-oriented course explores (first-hand and through readings and discussions) the ecology,
natural history, utilization and conservation of New England's most abundant natural resource: the
forest. A comparative approach to forest communities will be taken: we will visit different forest types
across the New England landscape delving into some of the reasons why they may vary. Specific top-
Winter Study Program
­ 343 ­
ics will include community dynamics, tree and shrub identification, adaptation, wildlife, threats to the
forest, forest management and conservation issues. There will be up to four meetings per week, at
least two of which will be in the field (some field trips may require that students are engaged in the
class beyond normal WSP class hours). The course will culminate in a two to three day trip to more
thoroughly investigate a remote forest region. Accordingly, students should be prepared to spend
many hours in the outdoors coping with the elements.
Evaluation: a 10-page paper, technical report or comparable creative product on a topic relevant to the
course.
No prerequisites: this course is appropriate for any student who possesses a healthy interest in natural
history and the outdoors. Enrollment limit: 12.
Meeting time: mornings, with occasional all-day field trips.

BIOL 020 Evolution and Creationism (Same as History of Science 020 and Religion 020)
Despite the central place that Darwin's theory of evolution occupies in modern biology, many Ameri-
cans insist that the theory is flawed, false, or simply unscientific. This course provides an overview of
the controversy, touching on its historical, scientific, philosophical, theological, and political aspects.
Students will acquire the facts and scientific literacy necessary to evaluate the major arguments in-
volved in the debate over evolutionary theory, and will critically examine a wide variety of view-
points. These viewpoints will be presented and evaluated in lecture sessions and in group discussions.
Students will also be required to participate in the public debate by taking part in on-line bulletin
boards, and will develop their own perspectives in written assignments.
Course evaluations will be based on participation in class discussions and in on-line fora, and on
completion of one long (12-page) and four short (4-page) analyses of particular aspects of the contro-
versy.
Evaluations will emphasize a mastery of basic literacy in science and evolutionary theory, good criti-
cal-thinking skills, and the willingness and ability to engage and understand the diverse positions on
this topic.
This class will meet for three two-hour sessions each week as well as one three-hour session devoted
entirely to discussion.

THE DEPARTMENT
BIOL 023 Science Through Technology in an Elementary School Classroom
Would you like to work with children to create a meaningful, lasting, scientific and educational tool?
Small teams of students enrolled in this course will be assigned to a 3rd, 4th or 5th grade classroom at
the Williamstown Elementary School. Working closely with the classroom teacher, the team will de-
sign an investigative project for students, centered on a topic in the science curriculum for a particular
grade level. The project will guide the students in an inquiry-based activity that uses the internet to
Winter Study Program
­ 344 ­
guide their investigations of a particular topic or phenomenon. The model for these projects will be the
"WebQuest" approach developed at San Diego State (http://webquest.sdsu.edu/webquest.html). In
these activities, most of the information used by the students is drawn from the web; however, the
designer of the project 1) defines the basic question the students are to address; 2) gives background
information for the project and poses questions to guide learning; and 3) directs the students to useful
sources of information. A well-designed "WebQuests" uses learners' time well, allowing them to fo-
cus on using information rather than looking for it, and supports elementary students efforts to evalu-
ate, analyze, and synthesize information.
Evaluation will be based upon the completed project and ancillary materials (equivalent to a 10-page
paper).
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 12.
Meeting time: Meetings and school visits will be within elementary school hours 9 a.m.-3 p.m.

CHEMISTRY
CHEM 011 Science for Kids (Same as Special 011)
Are you interested in teaching? Do you enjoy working with kids? Do you like to experiment with new
things? Here is a chance for you to do all three! The aim of this Winter Study Project is to design a
series of hands-on science workshops for elementary school children and their parents. Working in
teams of 2-4, students spend the first two and a half weeks of Winter Study planning the workshops.
This involves deciding on a focus for each workshop (based on the interests of the students involved)
followed by choosing and designing experiments and presentations that will be suitable for fourth-
grade children. On the third weekend of Winter Study (January 25, 26) we bring elementary school
kids with their parents to Williams to participate in the workshops.
You get a chance to see what goes into planning classroom demonstrations as well as a sense of what
it's like to actually give a presentation. You find that kids at this age are great fun to work with because
they are interested in just about everything and their enthusiasm is infectious. You also give the kids
and their parents a chance to actually do some fun hands-on science experiments that they may not
have seen before, and you are able to explain simple scientific concepts to them in a manner that won't
be intimidating. It is a rewarding experience for all involved.
Format: lecture/discussion/laboratory. Evaluation is based on participation in planning and running
the workshops. Each group is expected to prepare a handout with descriptions of the experiments for
the kids, parents, and teachers.
No prerequisites: You need not be a science major; all that is needed is enthusiasm. Enrollment limit:
25.
Meeting time: mornings. Classes meet three times a week for approximately three hours each session.
The workshop is run on the third weekend of Winter Study (January 25, 26) and attendance from 9
a.m. to 3 p.m. is mandatory that weekend. There are also one or two brief meetings held in the fall term
for preliminary planning.
Cost to student: none.

CHEM 012 Science in the Media (Same as Biology 012)
A good science writer takes specialized technical material and makes it clear, understandable, and
compelling. A great science writer may even make it beautiful. In this course we will read examples of
the best science writing for the general public in newspapers, magazines, books, museums, TV, and
radio. In addition to discussing the science that informs each, we will talk about what the public needs
to know about science and why, and look at the variety of ways scientific ideas are communicated to
the public. We will investigate how good science writers interweave narrative and exposition, and
how individual writers develop unique voices. In addition to a lot of reading, we also will do a lot of
Winter Study Program
­ 345 ­
writing. By emulating good science writers in your own writing, and by discussing your own work as
well as others, you will develop skills in the art of explanation, skills that will serve you well outside
the class.
In addition to a number of short essays, each class member will write a longer essay popularizing a
scientific topic of his or her choosing.
The goals of the course, in short, are to develop an appreciation of good writing about science, and by
practicing the techniques of the masters, to help students develop skills in communicating scientific
ideas to a variety of audiences.
Format: discussion. Evaluation is based on class participation and completion of all reading and writ-
ing assignments.
Prerequisite: One Div. III course at Williams prior to this course or permission of the instructor. En-
rollment limit: 8.
Required reading: "The Best American Science Writing 2002"; Science Tuesday, NYTs. In addition,
selections from newspapers, magazines, and books will be handed out in class and/or placed on re-
serve as readings for specific classes.
Meeting time: afternoons, three times a week for two hours each session.
Cost to student: $25 for book and newspapers.

CHEM 015 Epidemiology, Epidemics, and Human Health (Same as Biology 015)
Epidemiology is about the distribution of and determinants of disease in human populations. While
the discipline first developed around epidemics of infectious diseases, its low technology approaches
have been usefully employed to study most of the major acute and chronic non-infectious disease epi-
demics of the last 50-100 years, including pellagra, coronary heart disease, and lung cancer, and some
of the minor epidemics, for example, occupational asbestos exposure and lung disease, and even the
use (and misuse) of C-section in delivering babies.
The main purpose of this course is to stimulate critical thinking and impart an understanding of the
logic and scientific methods of epidemiology in answering questions or hypotheses related to the
etiology of specific human diseases, their prevention, their early detection, their prognoses, and the
effectiveness of treatments used to cure or alleviate their effects.
For future health professionals, an understanding of epidemiologic methods will make it easier for
you to keep up with the rapid pace of knowledge, and help you deliver the best, evidence-driven care.
For others, the course will deepen their understanding of the forces that affect human health.
By means of lectures, individual meetings, and class discussion, including unknown exercises pre-
sented by groups of students working collaboratively, the review of current papers in the medical and
public health literature, and readings, we will come to an appreciation of the rules of evidence in epi-
demiologic research. While some explanation of biostatistical applications will be necessary to un-
derstand the literature, this will not be a course in biostatistics.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation is based on class participation and a circa 10-page paper cen-
tered on a mutually agreeable health issue in the current public health and medical literature. Students
will present their conclusions to the whole group at the final sessions.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15.
Meeting time: afternoons. The course will meet three times a week with occasional extra meetings for
special projects.
Cost to student: approximately $40 for books and copied materials.

CLASSICS
CLAS 010 Gender in Talmud and Midrash (Same as Women's and Gender Studies 010)
Despite numerous debates about the origins, composition, purpose, and social and historical context
of rabbinic literature, we can definitively state that these texts were produced by a male scholarly class
about and for a male scholarly class. If the center of the Talmudic and Midrashic world is male, inves-
tigations of gender provide a unique vantage point for understanding this center and its literature. This
course explores selections from the Talmud and Midrash that explicitly deal with a variety of gender
issues and applies the conclusions derived from this analysis to an interpretation of marginalized char-
acters in rabbinic literature--the ignoramus, the holy man, and the gentile. Thus, in addition to deep-
ening our knowledge about rabbinic attitudes towards women and gender, we will consider whether
the rabbis have an engendered reading of Otherness.
Since rabbinic texts require a reading strategy, the course will also develop the skills for reading the
Talmud and Midrash. Therefore, the course will be conducted in Chevruta, the traditional method for
studying rabbinic literature. Study in Chevruta involves four-hour units consisting of close reading of
text with a partner followed by group discussion. The course has three four-hour units per week; there
will be some preparation outside of class, but most of the work will be during class hours.
The course concludes with an 8- to 10-page final paper that analyzes a selection from the Talmud or
Midrash.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20.
Meeting time: morning.
Cost to student: approximately $10.
KRAUS
CLAS 011 Writing with Wedges: Language and Literature of Mesopotamia
This course will present an introduction to cuneiform writing, including overviews of Sumerian, the
language for which the script was invented around 4000 BCE, and Akkadian, the Semitic language
written on millions of clay tablets and stone monuments from 2500 BCE until the turn of the era. For-
gotten for two millennia, cuneiform was rediscovered in the nineteenth century and deciphered by a
painstaking process. We will recreate that process and look at examples of the major literary genres of
Mesopotamia. Texts will include myths (the Epic of Gilgamesh and the Babylonian Creation Story),
legal material (the Code of Hammurapi and signed contracts), omens and rituals (such as procedures
to avert the evil portended by the appearance of a ghost), and royal inscriptions and correspondence
(including King Sennacherib's description of the siege of Jerusalem, also described in the Bible). We
will see how a basic understanding of the original languages can enhance our ability to understand the
texts--and therefore the culture--that were fundamental to the later development of Western civiliza-
tion.

CLAS 012 Love and Sex in the Ancient World
Are the ways we feel and express romantic emotions natural and diachronic, or are they conditioned
by specific historical, social and cultural circumstances? What are the ancients' and our attitudes to-
wards homosexuality, extramarital affairs, and pederasty? This course addresses such questions
through a survey of Ancient Greek and Latin literary works which feature love relationships, includ-
ing works by Homer, Sappho, Plato, Vergil and Ovid. Students will get an insight into the depiction of
romantic feelings and practices in antiquity, and will be asked to explore topics like: the objectifica-
tion of the female as beloved and Muse, the identification of an author with the tormented lover speak-
ing in the first person, the supposed emasculation of men in homosexual relationships etc. Students
will be expected to attend all classes and to make use of discussion topics and visual material on the
Blackboard web page.
Evaluation will be based on class attendance and participation, and on a final 10-page paper.

COMPARATIVE LITERATURE
COMP 010 Living by Words: Surviving and Thriving in the Art and Sport of Rhetoric (Same
as English 010, INTR 014, and Special 016)
Whether dealing in the realms of public life, commerce, or academe, the speaker who can clearly and
cogently define or defend a policy, product, or theoretical position is usually the most successful. De-
pending on the venue and the aim of the speaker, the words might be artful and poetic, cajoling and
competitive, formally read from the page or seemingly delivered impromptu. This course will briefly
examine some of the classic styles of oratory from Aristotle's Rhetoric to MTV's advertising cam-
paigns, make visits to a variety of venues that employ a special style of professional discourse, and
give participants a range of methods and ample practice in the basics of effective spoken communica-
tion. The practical intent of the course is for participants to develop confident, cogent, and dynamic
presentation styles, to reinforce tight organizational focus and relaxed, natural delivery, and to devel-
op creative approaches to speaking in front of a group. The course will guide participants through the
presentation process from conception, outlining, and devising the message, to development of visual
aids, message delivery, and handling question and answer sessions. Methods employed will include
vigorous pursuit of improvisational theater techniques and some athletic training. Participants will
receive intensive personal coaching and a videotaped record of their personal progress. The final proj-
ect will be a group presentation at a public forum.
Evaluation will be based on active participation in the class, a written evaluation of a public presenta-
tion the student has attended, and successful completion of mini-presentations during Winter Study
and the final group presentation at the end of term.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 12.
Meeting time: mornings, three meetings of two hours each and 2-3 field trips outside of Williams-

COMPUTER SCIENCE
CSCI 010 C, UNIX and Software Tools
This course serves as a guided tour of programming methods in the UNIX operating system. The
course is designed for individuals who understand basic program development techniques as dis-
cussed in an introductory programming course (Computer Science 134 or equivalent), but who wish
to become familiar with a broader variety of computer systems and programming languages. Students
in this course will work on UNIX workstations, available in one of the Department's laboratories. By
the end of the course, students will have developed basic proficiency in the C programming language.
The increasing success of UNIX as a modern operating system stems from its unique ability to "proto-
type" programs quickly. Students will use prototyping tools, such as Awk and "shell scripts" to write
"filters" for transforming data from a variety of sources. It will become clear that in many cases the
overhead of programming in languages such as C, Pascal, or FORTRAN is unnecessary. Moreover,
students will learn to effectively use software tools such as debuggers, profilers, and make files.
Evaluation will be based on several programming assignments and shell scripts due throughout the
term. While none of the projects in the course will be particularly large, the successful student will de-
velop a tool chest, which will extend their computing "effectiveness" in their particular field. Students
with computing needs particular to their field are encouraged to advise the instructor before the first
meeting.
Prerequisite: Computer Science 134 or equivalent programming experience. Enrollment limit: 20.
Meeting time: mornings.
Cost to student: texts.

CSCI 011 The Dynamic Duo: Cold Fusion and SQL Server
This course provides an introduction to relational databases, dynamic, data-driven web page design
and SQL, the standardized language for querying databases. Using Microsoft SQL server and Macro-
media Cold Fusion, students will learn how to create a relational database and use dynamic web pages
to display and manipulate information.
Evaluation will be based on the completion of a finished project and its presentation to the class. At-
tendance in class and participation in the design group will also be factors.
We will meet twice a week for two-hour sessions in the classroom, and once a week in the lab. Much
of the actual implementation of the project will happen outside class hours. Students will work in
small groups to design a project that each student will then complete individually.
Enrollment limit: 12. Prior experience with coding web pages, databases, and programming or
scripting is strongly preferred.

ECONOMICS
ECON 010 East Asia: Miracle and Crisis
This course is intended to help CDE fellows integrate the material they studied in the first semester by
applying it to the circumstances of a particular group of countries. During the 2003 Winter Term ses-
sion we will focus on a case study of what are widely perceived to be successful development exper-
iences--those of the East and Southeast Asian "miracle" economies. We will consider issues such as
the desirability of the economic transformations that have taken place in these countries, the condi-
tions that may have made such transformations possible, the roles that specific policies may have
played in bringing them about, the causes of the recent economic crisis in the region and its implica-
tions for future growth in the affected countries, as well as the lessons that the East and Southeast
Asian experience may hold for other developing countries.
Requirements: two 10-page papers.
Undergraduate enrollment is by permission of the instructor.
Meeting time: mornings, Mondays and Wednesdays.
Cost to student: approximately$60 for the purchase of textbook and reading packet.
MONTIEL
ECON 011 Surveys and Polls
We are bombarded on a daily basis with assertions based on data, opinion polls, and statistical analy-
ses. From soft drink commercials, to political speeches, to economic and political reporting, data are
used (and sometimes misused) to sway our opinion, earn our dollar, and set public policy. As responsi-
ble citizens and consumers, we need to be able to evaluate the data and statistics presented to us in
order to make informed decisions. How are data collected and how is public opinion measured? How
do policymakers and researchers learn facts about social and economic activity? This course will offer
the basic tools needed for evaluating data and will explore the issues and controversies surrounding its
myriad uses. Topics to be covered will include the basics of data collection and survey methods, issues
and problems policymakers face when collecting and using data (representativeness, response rates,
confidentiality), the politics of data collection, and public opinion polls and their use. Working in
groups, students will use what they learn to field their own survey or poll of the local or college com-
munity.
Evaluation will be based on active participation in class discussions and a data collection and analysis
project. This project will include construction of a survey instrument, selection of an appropriate sam-
ple, implementation of the survey or poll, and analysis of the results in a 10-page paper. Students will
present their results to the college community in a poster session on the last day of Winter Study.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15.
Meeting time: mornings. The class will meet every day during the first week of Winter Study to pro-
vide students with the tools necessary to get their surveys into the field. Meetings in the second and
third weeks will be less frequent as students implement and analyze their surveys.
Cost to student: approximately $60 for books and photocopies.
SHORE-SHEPPARD
ECON 012 Business Risk Analysis: Inside the Mind of a Banker
So you think that business and finance are a big mystery and potentially boring? Discover how easy it
is to understand how a company works and how interesting risk analysis can be. Do you feel that a
career in business is not for you, but want to know enough to invest your millions wisely? Or are you,
perhaps, considering business or finance as a career and would like a head start (not to mention a leg
up in the interview process)? Or maybe you picture yourself as the boss someday, no matter what your
field. Then this is the course for you! This experience will provide a basic overview of financial analy-
sis with a particular emphasis on the banker's perspective. Among the topics that we will discuss are:
the qualitative and quantitative aspects of risk analysis, understanding financial statements, how busi-
nessmen and bankers manage and mitigate the risks in their businesses, and how bankers decide on
the structure and pricing of loans.
Attendance in class is important for this course, as a lot of material is covered, and the class will meet
about 10 hours per week. Required readings, however, are minimal.
Evaluation will be based on attendance, classroom participation, and group and individual assign-
ments, including a final group project and presentation involving the analysis of a company.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20. Preference given to juniors and seniors. Not intended for stu-
dents with extensive prior financial experience.
Meeting time: mornings and afternoons, Mondays and Tuesdays.
Cost to student: approximately $40 for texts and reading packet.

ECON 013 Introduction to Indian Cinema (Same as Comparative Literature 013)
Though the Indian film industry is the world's most prolific, American audiences have little exposure
to it. This course provides an introduction, focusing on Hindi cinema, and showing how its themes
have evolved in response to broader changes in Indian society. In particular, we will examine ways in
which Hindi films reflect the threats perceived by the nation, and the resolutions attempted. We will
also compare its norms and conventions with those used in Hollywood cinema.The films will be sub-
titled in English.
We will meet twice a week for three-hour sessions. Some film viewing will be required outside class
hours. Evaluation will be based on a 10-page paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15.
Meeting time: afternoons.
Cost to student: $50 for readings.

ECON 015 Philanthropy and the Social Entrepreneur
When one hears the word "philanthropy," it likely conjures up the stereotype of rich people, families
or foundations who donate their money to worthwhile causes, but it is only the beginning of today's
modern philanthropic world. Indeed, there are two sides to philanthropy, donating and receiving, and
a myriad of ways in which individuals and organizations can be philanthropic. This Winter Study
Course will focus on both sides of the philanthropic world, with the goal of educating students to con-
sider careers or involvement in either the donating side of the equation or as social entrepreneurs, us-
ing traditional capitalistic and business principles to start, sustain, and/or expand non-profit organiza-
tions and charitable endeavors.
The class will be broken down into two basic components. The first will be about the donor side of
philanthropy. We will discuss the various types of foundations and funds that exist, the processes by
which they make grants, the importance of volunteerism as philanthropy, and individual philanthropy.
As part of this section, the class will break up into three or four different "foundations," and have to
decide what their funding priorities are, how they would solicit grant proposals from worthwhile orga-
nizations, and then go through the process of reviewing grant proposals to decide which receive fund-
ing. The students will have homework assignments that require them to research philanthropic orga-
nizations on the internet, to write sample "Requests for Proposals" for the money their foundations
have to donate, and to evaluate sample grant proposals.
The second half of the class will have the students switch gears and look at philanthropy from the view
of the social entrepreneur who starts and runs a non-profit organization. The students will break into
groups of one, two or three, decide what type of organization they want to start, write a business plan, a
needs assessment statement and a mission statement, research philanthropic organizations, endeavors
and individuals who would be likely funders, prepare grant proposals, and go through simulated inter-
views for the grants.
Many of the class materials will be actual grant proposals, business plans, and requests for proposals.
There is also a wealth of information on the internet from which many assignments will be fashioned,
and there will be additional articles about philanthropy for the students to read.
Students will be evaluated on their overall efforts and contributions to the class, as well as their written
work products described above.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20.
Meeting time: three times per week, for approximately two hours per session.
Cost to student: none.

ECON 016 Entrepreneurism
This course will use interactive case studies, guest appearances from those in the trenches, and exten-
sive discussion to learn about entrepreneurism, how small business operates, and the different stages
and issues small businesses face as they move forward. "Small" means start-up companies up to sales
of $30 million. Emphasis will be on the role of the entrepreneur and the different issues he/she faces in
starting, focusing, directing, and managing a small business through its different stages, but attention
will also be given to the position of the firm in the middle of the network of supporting organizations-
banks, venture capitalists, consultants, investment bankers, lawyers, accountants, etc.
Students should expect to make a significant time commitment to the course. Classes will meet an
average of three times per week for three hours in the morning. For those who desire, discussion and
conversations will continue over lunch. Guests will be involved with the day's cases and will arrive
the night before class to socialize with students over dinner, and stay through lunch after class the next
day to discuss their professions and their daily work lives.
Students will be evaluated 85% discussion, 15% final 10-page paper or equivalent.

ECON 017 Business Economics
In this course, the class will carry out a real-time forecast of the U.S. economy and explore its implica-
tions for the bond and stock markets. The course will build upon principles of both macro and micro-
economics. It will provide an introduction to the work done by business economists and the tech-
niques they use. An economic database, chart-generating software and a statistical analysis program
will be available to each student on the Jessup computers and, if necessary, on a disk for IBM-compat-
ible computers.
The first week will focus on becoming familiar with the database, looking for relationships between
key economic variables, and studying movements in interest rates over the period 1960-2001. Early in
the first week, the class will be divided into teams of 2 students with each team choosing a particular
aspect of the economy to forecast.
During the second and third weeks, the class will work with various leading indicators of economic
activity and will prepare forecasts of the key components of gross domestic product and other key
variables. The fourth week will feature a formal presentation of the economic forecast with invited
guests from the Wall Street investment world.
To put the forecasting exercise in context, there will be class discussions of business cycles, credit
cycles, long waves in inflation and interest rates and the impact of the Internet on the economy and the
stock market.
There will also be a 3-page paper summarizing the result of the forecast project. Because essential
concepts and tools are covered during the first week, all students are expected to attend the first class.
No prerequisites, but Economics 110 or another semester course in Economics is strongly recom-
mended. Enrollment limit: 22.
Meeting time: mornings, 3 times per week. There will be two afternoons of workshops lasting approx-
imately 30 minutes with hands-on instruction for each team. Each student should expect to spend a
reasonable amount of time on homework, and to participate in short presentations of their analyses as
the work progresses as well as in the formal presentation during the last week.
Cost to student: $25 for text and other materials.

ECON 025 The Razor-Edged Path to South Africa's Socio-Economic Transformation
This travel course will explore the dilemma facing South Africa as the nation grapples with the pro-
cess of democratic transformation. Apartheid grossly skewed the distribution of social investment
(housing, health care, education, job opportunities). Yet addressing this problem requires careful
attention to the economic resources available for fostering economic growth and improving social
equity. Unsustainable spending on social investment undermines confidence and deters needed in-
vestment, yet too much fiscal constraint fuels social and political instability. How can South Africa
redress the inequities created by apartheid while expanding economic opportunities, thus mobilizing
further resources for redistribution?
Since South Africa's first democratic elections eight years ago, the country has implemented a re-
markable political transition. Socio-economic progress, however, has been much more difficult. This
project will explore how public policy shapes the distribution of social investment as the nation grap-
ples with the imperatives of equity and growth while maintaining political and economic stability.
South Africa is a country of contrasts: international polls rank Cape Town as one of the world's three
most pleasant cities, yet minutes from the central business district smolder huge pockets of abject ur-
ban poverty. This course will investigate how such a skewed distribution of resources has been perpe-
tuated, and why redressing the problem has been so difficult. The learning process will involve visit-
ing poor townships created as economically nonviable entities, investigating inequities in the provi-
sion of education and health care, and comprehending the predicament of the rural poor. The paucity
of public resources for the majority stands in stark contrast to the abundance provided by the apart-
heid-era policies to the privileged minority: a health care system that achieved the world's first heart
transplant, public schools comparable to the world's best private educational institutions, and first-
rate urban amenities.
The course will examine why one of the world's most unequal societies is so resistant to change, and
what role public policy can serve in fostering redistribution and growth. Meetings--with policy-mak-
ers and community activists, with teachers and labor leaders, with economic researchers and social
workers, with public health advocates and bankers--will provide insight into the historical and struc-
tural causes of the extreme inequality that characterizes South African society, and the options avail-
able for redressing past imbalances and inequities while promoting economic growth and job cre-
ation. The theme of social investment unifies the course: how apartheid created one of the world's
most skewed distributions of human capital, whose inertial force resists substantive change, and the
critical role that public investment in social infrastructure must serve in transforming the economy.
First-hand experiences combined with education presentations and discussions will illuminate the
challenges, opportunities, and policy options facing South Africa as the country rebuilds political,
social, and economic institutions.
Evaluation will be based on a 10-page research paper and an oral presentation.
No prerequisites. Interested students must consult the instructor before registration (email mi-
chael.samson@williams.edu). Not open to first-year students.
Cost to student: $3,480 (includes round-trip airfare from New York City to Cape Town, hotel accom-

with an emphasis on the post-Stonewall (post-1969) period. Questions we will explore will include:
Why is the "happy ending" such a conflicted question in lesbian/queer writing? Do representations of
"transgressive" desires require "transgressive" literary forms? Or should queer literature seek to rep-
resent queer life as "realistically" as possible? What does it mean to create a "positive" or "negative"
image of lesbians? We will also debate the difference that race/ethnicity, class, and gender might make
in representing lesbian/queer women's sexualities, as well as the ways in which contemporary queer
writing seeks to trouble gender itself as a category. Readings may include works by the following
authors: Gertrude Stein, Radclyffe Hall, Ann Bannon, Audre Lorde, Adrienne Rich, Cherríe Moraga,
Jeannette Winterson, Aleída Rodriguez, Monique Wittig, Minnie Bruce Pratt and Achy Obejas
Requirements: In addition to the reading, students will be expected to turn in regular journal/list-serv
assignments, lead class discussion once, and write a 8- to 10-page final paper.
Prerequisites: a 100-level English course other than English 150. Enrollment limit: 18. Preference
given to seniors.
Meeting time: mornings, two times a week for three hours.
Cost to student: approximately $80 for books.

ENGL 012 Writing Non-Fiction
This is a course for students interested in writing a long, non-fiction essay. We shall begin by reading
together the work of some contemporary practitioners such as David Foster Wallace, Adam Gopnik
and Janet Malcolm and by considering the distinctive styles of several general-interest magazines in-
cluding Harper's, Rolling Stone and The New Yorker. Throughout the course, students will work inde-
pendently on their essays, which should run between 2,500 and 3,000 words and reflect extensive
research or reporting. Students will be expected to have selected a topic before the first class meeting.
Requirements: completion of a long, researched, non-fiction essay.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 14. Priority to English majors.
Meeting time: afternoons, three times a week for two hours.
Cost to student: $50-$75.

(See under Special for full description.)
ENGL 014 Hardboiled
They took murder out of the country house and gave it back "to the kind of people that commit it for
reasons," as Raymond Chandler said. With the Continental Op and Sam Spade, Dashiell Hammett
invented the tough, spare, hardboiled detective novel. In Philip Marlowe, Raymond Chandler created
the genre's battered poet laureate. This course will examine three novels by Hammett (The Maltese
Falcon, The Thin Man, and either The Dain Curse or The Glass Key), and three by Chandler (The Big
Sleep, The Long Goodbye, and either The Little Sister or The High Window). We'll read criticism and
short stories by Ernest Hemingway, Jorge Luis Borges, Ross Macdonald, W. H. Auden, Steven Mar-
cus, and others. And we'll look at several films, including Howard Hawks' The Big Sleep, John Hus-
ton's The Maltese Falcon, and W. S. Van Dyke's The Thin Man.
Requirements: regular attendance and a 10-page paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15. Preference will be given to English majors and those more
interested in style than in crime.
Meeting time: mornings, three times a week for two hours.
Cost to student: approximately $65 for books.

ENGL 015 Writing, Illustrating, and Publishing Children's Books (Same as ArtS 020)
This seminar is for those fascinated with children's books, those who want to learn about this old and
distinguished genre, and those who want to create a children's book. Since it is often the same person
who writes and illustrates a children's book (or a team of two people working closely together) the
seminar explores all aspects of children's literature-writing, illustrating, and publishing. Why do cer-
tain books endure and become classics while others enjoy only a brief lifespan? What is the difference
between writing for and writing about children? How does one approach writing a children's picture
book or a book for teenagers? Are fairy tales important? How does one connect words and images?
Through lectures, discussions and assignments, writers and illustrators develop the skills to start a
book project or continue a project they have already started. Practical aspects such as author-publish-
er-agent relationships, book financing, and the realities of the current market will be explored.
Requirements: either completion of the draft for a children's book text or of illustrations for a picture
book dummy.
Prerequisite: serious enthusiasm for writing and/or visual arts. Enrollment limit: 15. Preference to jun-
iors and seniors.
Meeting time: mornings, twice a week for three hours.
Cost to student: none.

ENGL 016 Critiquing the Critics
Before we pick up a new novel, rush to see a movie, travel to a concert or museum, buy a CD, make a
restaurant reservation or just flip on the television, we must make judgments about whether we want
to spend our time and money on these pursuits. To help us make those judgments, we usually depend
on the opinions of reviewers and critics. But how do these experts form their opinions? Who are they,
and how are they trained to make judgments? Why do we trust the work of any particular reviewer or
publication? Is bias bad? Whose opinions do we depend on, and why? In this course, we'll examine
reviewing, both as consumers and as critics ourselves. We will discover if there is a common process
used by all reviewers when they approach their subject, and what writing techniques they need to
make a telling argument. Course work will require learning how to think clearly, analyze carefully,
and then write deliberate and persuasive reviews for different audiences. Guest speakers, reviewers
themselves, will discuss their craft. We will also hear from actors, musicians, artists and writers to find
out how they react to reviews of their work--if, in fact, they pay attention to them at all. What is the
symbiosis between art and criticism?
Requirements: several short and long reviews.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 12.
Meeting time: mornings, three times a week for two hours. There will be weekly film screenings or
performances, offered in the afternoon and evening.
Cost to student: $35 -$40 for newspapers, magazines and printed materials.

ENGL 017 Looking at Contemporary Documentary Photography (Same as ArtH 017)
This course explores the evolution of modern documentary photography. We will start with Robert
Frank's The Americans, and how Frank's singular vision deeply shaped the next generation of pho-
tographers working the American streets and landscape. Diane Arbus, Bruce Davidson, Lee Freid-
lander, Danny Lyon, Gary Winogrand are some of the photographers whose work we will get to know
well. Discussions will include the new wave of independent and Magnum photojournalists (Phillip
Jones Griffiths, Josef Koudleka, Susan Meiselas, Gilles Peress, Sebastio Salgado, & Alex Webb) and
the wars from Vietnam to Iraq to Bosnia they cover as well as the personal visions they explore. In-
sight into the diverse currents of documentary photography will be explored through the work of Rob-
ert Adams, Bill Burke, Larry Clark, Lois Conner, Linda Connor, Larry Fink, Nan Goldin, Emmet Go-
win, Sally Mann, Mary Ellen Mark, Nicholas Nixon, and Abelardo Morell. We will also explore the
gray areas between photographic fact and personal fiction through the work of Duane Michaels, Joel
Peter Witkin, Josef Saudek, and Carrie Mae Weems and the large scale epic photographs of Gregory
Crewdson, Jeff Wall, Philip-Lorca diCorcia, and Andreas Gursky. The class will meet three mornings
a week for two hours. Slide presentations will occupy half of the first meetings and give way to discus-

sion of issues in documentary photography. Students will be encouraged to work on individual pro-
jects of their own choice.
Each student will be required to make a brief presentation to the class on a documentary topic of their
choice. A final 10-page paper expanding on this documentary topic will be due at the end of the
course. Students will be evaluated on their classroom presentation, general participation and their
written work. A field trip to New York will let us see first hand works from the collections at the Mu-
seum of Modern Art, Whitney Museum of American Art and the International Center of Photography
and meet with curators of photography at these institutions.

ENGL 018 Artist of Empire: Rudyard Kipling Now
In 1907, when Kipling became the first Englishman to win the Nobel Prize for Literature, his critical
reputation was already in decline. George Orwell, anti-imperialist extraordinaire, summed up the par-
adox in 1942: "During five literary generations, every enlightened person has despised him, and at the
end of that time nine-tenths of those enlightened people are forgotten and Kipling is in some sense still
there." But in what sense? Edward Said reads his novel Kim as "belonging to the world's greatest liter-
ature," "rich," "absolutely fascinating." Yet he finds it "profoundly embarrassing" as well. Salman
Rushdie struggles with conflicting emotions of "anger and delight" reading stories which possess "the
power simultaneously to infuriate and entrance." There is scarcely one among the proliferating stud-
ies of colonial "Orientalism" that leaves Kipling undiscussed. And every newspaper reminds us that
India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan are much nearer than we thought. This course will focus on a reading
of Kim, with detours into The Jungle Books, Stalky & Co., and assorted stories of India, as we seek to
discover for ourselves in what sense Kipling is still there.
Requirements: faithful attendance, active participation, a continuing journal, and a 10-page final pa-
per.

ENGL 019 Science-Fiction and Fantasy Workshop
This writing workshop is intended for a small group of dedicated students. Participants will be ex-
pected to produce short stories, in a number of styles--a minimum of two stories a week for the length
of the course. Together we will puzzle out a schedule of assignments that depends partly on your inter-
est and taste, but the idea is to produce work in a range of subjects and techniques, some of which will
not have naturally occurred to you. Possible examples are high fantasy, world-building, cyberpunk,
horror, space opera, technobabble, and steampunk. Everyone should write at least one parody. Stu-
dents will read their work aloud in class, and I will lead discussions. Genre writers are known for their
productivity, and the goal here is to produce a volume of words and ideas. My hope is that each student
will end the class with a half-dozen or so workshopped drafts, which can then be polished at leisure.
At the end of the course, I'll throw in an optional class to discuss the SF marketplace, submission
guidelines, etc. This is an intensive schedule and a lot of work, for students who are serious about
writing.
Requirements: frequent workshop drafts.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15.

ature, and drawing. Students will spend time outdoors learning the ecosystem of the Williamstown
area and time indoors doing observational drawing, reflective writing, and reading and discussions of
nature literature. The month's work will be contained in a nature journal, to be displayed and dis-
cussed as part of a final project. Designed for students with interests in environmental studies, natural
history writing, and drawing.

ENVI 011 Envisioning a Sustainable Future (Same as Biology 011)
(See under Biology for full description.)
ENVI 012 Environmental Risk Assessment: Risk Perception, Reality and Assessment
Risk is a fact of life. However, we have different perceptions and reactions to various types of risk.
Some of our reactions are rational, some are not. How do we put risk into perspective? Can we make
rational decisions, or quantitative assessments? Is it possible to "manage" risk? How can we translate
what we have learned about risk into good practices and policies? The course will focus on environ-
mental risk assessment, but in the context of the many risks we deal with as individuals and a society.
Course meetings will emphasize group activities and projects. Selected handouts from a variety of
sources will be used for reading assignments. Students will be encouraged to evaluate the risks in their
lives and how they deal with them. Group exercises will also be used to consider the role of risk in
society and our collective responses to threats ranging from pesticides in food to terrorism. The main
elements of quantitative risk assessments for exposure to radioactivity and chemicals in the environ-
ment will be developed and utilized.
Evaluation based on a paper of at least 10 pages and an oral presentation.

ENVI 015 Land Conservation in Massachusetts
Open space preservation is the fastest growing component of the environmental movement across the
United States, and, increasingly, a significant professional opportunity in the nation's 1400 nonprofit
land trusts. Massachusetts has been a leader in this sphere. This course examines how 20 percent of
the commonwealth has been preserved as open space. Land is the base for other environmental re-
sources: habitat for wildlife and plants, groundwater and surface waters; scenic views; and recreation.
We'll look at the history of land protection, sources of funding, institutional methods such as ease-
ments, estate planning, and tax policy. Selection of critical parcels for acquisition will be considered.
Current projects from Cape Cod and the Berkshires will be studied.
Evaluation is based upon participation in classes and field trips, and a 10-page paper.

on biological aspects of human population growth, exploitation of wild populations, environmental
impacts of agriculture, and the strategies of conservation biology. The course will explore the ques-
tion "what sort of species are we?" and how deeply are our woes and excesses embedded in "Human
Nature"?

ENVI 019 Food Security and Agriculture in the Northeastern U.S. (Same as Biology 019)
Food security is an umbrella phrase for a range of issues in agriculture, including the sustainability of
current and proposed farming practices, and the direct and hidden costs (and insecurities) in transport-
ing food worldwide, and centralizing crops and processing facilities. Other issues are the loss of farm-
land, farmers, and farm infrastructure, and hunger and malnutrition (even in the U.S.). This course
will examine these issues in New England and New York from both a scientific and political perspec-
tive. We will look at what the region produces and by what methods, including an examination of
barriers to organic (or sustainable) farming methods. We will also ask if biotechnology has a role to
play in food security. Policies which influence agriculture, including the Farm Bill and the Communi-
ty Food Projects program, will be studied. The students will visit local farms and processing facilities
on 2 full-day field trips, and they will hear from farmers, agricultural experts and retailers. Students
will be expected to research and present a topic of their choosing (which may involve field work), and
the final project will be a 10-page paper or grant application.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20.

GEOSCIENCES
GEOS 010 Creating Maps...and Lying!
Including maps for the visual presentation of data is often an effective means of getting your point
across, but are the data accurately represented?
Students will learn the basics of mapping software, how to find and import data sets, the elements of
generating professional looking maps and printing techniques. We will also study how maps are used
to encourage people to draw incorrect conclusions about data.
Specific topics will include:
SColor use and perception
SData classification
SAggregation of data
SMaking the point
Evaluation will be based on class attendance, a 10-page paper including student generated maps and a
class presentation supported by visual displays including maps.

GEOS 011 Dinosaurs and the Mesozoic World
Dinosaurs are forever popular with children and college students alike. Movies such as the "Jurassic
Park, I, II, and III" and Disney's "Dinosaur" have changed the image of these animals in the public
eye. Never again will a student volunteer the definition that dinosaurs are huge, slow-witted, extinct
animals. How do we actually define a dinosaur? What do we factually know about them and what is
merely interpretation?
This course will consider the various facts and interpretations of how dinosaurs functioned--their
reproduction, digestive system, metabolism, locomotion, defense and attack systems, and intelli-
gence. To understand dinosaurs better, we will also consider their world--the plants and animals they
lived among and interacted with and a geography and climate radically different from our own.
Students are expected to pair up and do research from the paleontological and geological literature on
one type of dinosaur in its environment and present the result as a 15-page paper for evaluation and
group discussion. There will be a course packet with relevant scientific articles that the students are
expected to read and discuss in class.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 12.
Meeting time: mornings, three times a week for two hours each session.

HISTORY
HIST 010 Hollywood and American Political Life
This course will explore the role of filmmaking in twentieth-century American politics, approaching
the topic from several angles. First, we will analyze films that take on the subject of American politics,
such as Mr. Smith Goes to Washington and Nashville, and ask what kinds of civic values they seem to
embrace and reject. Second, we will look at how American film has handled the politics of wartime,
paying particular attention to the role of the Office of War Information on World War II-era movies.
Finally, we will explore the rise of Hollywood institutionally as a force in American politics and how
the tropes of late-twentieth century American films wended their way into American political dis-
course.
Students will be expected to attend class and do weekly readings that go along with our films and
submit discussion questions before our meetings. Either two 5-page papers or one 10-page paper will
constitute the formal grounds for evaluation, along with class participation.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 30.
Meeting time: afternoons, two three-hour meetings a week on Tuesday and Thursday; required view-
ings will occur both in and out of class.

HIST 011 African-American History Through Film (Same as African-American Studies 011)
This course will address some of the major themes in African-American History through film. We will
focus on how certain films have addressed such issues as African-American urbanization, political
activism, and everyday social life. Viewing the work of filmmakers from Oscar Micheaux to Julie
Dash, the course will pay particular attention to how the political and social context of particular eras
influenced films made by, for, and about African Americans.
Evaluation will be based on class participation, an oral presentation, and a final 10-page paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20.
Meeting time: mornings, twice a week for three hours.
Cost to student: $30 for Xeroxes.

HIST 012 Imagining the Shtetl: Jewish Life and Culture in Nineteenth-Century Eastern
Europe
Amidst political and religious restrictions that circumscribed their every move, Jews in nineteenth-
century Eastern Europe carved out a vibrant civilization. In this course, we will survey how writers,
artists, poets, musicians, anthropologists, historians, philosophers and filmmakers have portrayed the
vital, self-contained universe of the Old World shtetl. Writers and artists referred to may include Sho-
lem Aleichem, Isaac Bashevis Singer, I. L. Peretz, Abraham Joshua Heschel, Marc Chagall, Eva Hof-
fman and the klezmer group Budowitz.
Evaluation will be based on regular class attendance and participation. A 10-page paper will be re-

HIST 013 Landscape as History in the American West (Same as Environmental Studies 016)
America's most dramatic river, the Colorado, begins in the snow-capped mountains of the Wind River
Range in Wyoming and ends 1,700 miles distant in the hot sands of the delta at the head of the Sea of
Cortez. Along the way the river both drains and gives life to the American West. Most of the water is
diverted to agricultural and urban users in California, whose fractured landscape has been punctuated
Winter Study Program

by racial conflicts and natural disasters. By evoking the landscape of the Colorado River, the essential
aridity of the West, and coastal California's history of natural and human disasters with films, read-
ings, and discussions, an argument will be made that the natural environment has determined, to a
great extent, the human history of this region. In a final project or paper, students will choose an area to
describe, evoke, explain, and come to their own conclusions about the power of place in the American
West and the usefulness of this type of environmental history to evaluate other landscapes.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class participation and a final project that can be either
an imaginative oral/visual presentation to the class or the more traditional 10-page paper.

HIST 014 The Evolution of the Women's Counseling Movement (Same as Psychology 019 and
Women's and Gender Studies 014)
This course will explore the women's counseling movement, from grassroots efforts to establish
women's services in the 1960's and 1970's to present-day organization efforts. The course will begin
with a brief overview of the counseling movement in historical context, focusing on the history of the
women's movement from the mid-nineteenth century to the 1960's and the history of counseling in
the United States from World War I to the 1960's. Subsequent classes will explore the issues of vio-
lence towards women and the goals of the women's counseling movement towards addressing do-
mestic violence and sexual assault. To connect the theoretical and historical background of the course
with practical experience, students will gain exposure to domestic violence and rape crisis counseling
in Berkshire County through attendance at clinical and administrative staff meetings at a local
women's services agency.
Evaluation will be based on class participation, 2 short reflective papers, and a 5- to 7-page final paper.
No prerequisites, but it is recommended that students have taken at least one regular semester course
in Psychology or one course in Women's and Gender Studies. Enrollment limit: 15.
Meeting time: mornings; Mondays, Tuesdays and Fridays.

HIST 015 Hands-On Investigative Reporting (Same as English 020)
So, you've always wanted to be an investigative reporter--or at least wondered how they dig up all
that stuff.
Students will learn how to obtain information--confidential and otherwise--in a moral, responsible
and effective fashion. First, the course will provide a hands-on approach to how investigative report-
ers gather information. What methods are actually used?
Second, this course will first take a hard look at investigative reporting in the U.S. Increasingly, Amer-
ican journalists are delving into topics in politics, in business, and in the lives of individuals that pre-
viously have been off-limits. At what point will the media have gone too far? Do prying journalists
make for a better or worse American society?
The course will include case studies, movies, outside readings and a visit from a working investigative
journalist.

HIST 017 History in Pieces (Same as ArtS 017)
Burgoyne Surrounded, Mexican Cross, Log Cabin, Texas Star, Mariner's Compass, Storm at Sea,
Drunkard's Path, Underground Railway are just a few of the many quilt patterns designed by our
American ancestors, representing events, political or social, in this country in the eighteenth and nine-
teenth centuries.
In this course, students will study American history through quilts. At the same time, they will learn
traditional and contemporary methods of quilt making. Each student will select a traditional Ameri-
can quilt pattern and reproduce that pattern into a 45" x 60" quilt. In addition, each student will design
either an original pattern representing an event in late-twentieth- early-twenty-first-century history or
keep aJanuary journal of life as a twenty-first-century quilter. The completed quilts will be the basis of
a quilt show to be scheduled during the second semester.
Evaluation will be based on regular participation in class and completion of the quilt and original de-
sign or journal. Students should understand that these are time-consuming projects and they must be
prepared to put in considerable time beyond actual class hours.
No prerequisite, but sewing experience is useful. Enrollment limit: 15.
Meeting time: mornings; Mondays, Wednesdays, Thursdays.
Cost to student: $120 for quilting supplies and reading materials. Students need to supply their own
portable sewing machines.

HIST 018 American Strategy in World War II: War Plans and Execution
During the Second World War, the United States fought a global conflict. By late 1943, for example,
American forces were in combat in Italy, New Guinea, the Solomon Islands and the Central Pacific.
The war against the U-Boat threat and the air war against Germany continued with increasing intensi-
ty, and the allied staffs were engaged in planning the 1944 invasion of France.
To achieve the nation's basic political objective--the unconditional surrender of Germany and Ja-
pan--the United States devised a series of strategic and operational war plans for both the European
and Pacific areas of operation. A number of factors including inter-allied and inter-service disputes,
logistics, and enemy actions frequently led to results that were quite different from the planner's ex-
pectations.
The course will examine the major U.S. war plans using selected readings and a number of actual
plans. The course will then explore the realities of battle and the differences between plans and execu-
tion.
Requirements: class participation and attendance. Class will meet once a week on Friday mornings
and afternoons for a total of six hours. A 10-page essay will be required.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 25.
Meeting time: six hours on Fridays, three hours in the morning and three hours in the afternoon
(schedule for last week of winter study to be determined).
Cost to student: $30 for books and Xeroxes.

the intimate academic and social community of a small liberal arts college in New England? The Wil-
liams Jewish History Project investigates and gathers data about Jews and Judaism at Williams with
the ultimate goal of a published work on the subject. Studying the history of Jews at Williams prom-
ises to add to the familiar story of assimilation and accommodation nuanced insight into the formation
of both religious and collegiate identity. The Williams Jewish History Project will shed light on the
ways in which the College managed to cultivate school spirit among students while affirming their
sense of distinctiveness, allowing them to be simultaneously both children of Abraham and sons (and
daughters) of Eph. This winter study course seeks to involve students in the early stages of this project
by having them engage in archival research and conduct oral interviews. Students will be instructed in
the techniques of archival research and conducting interviews of faculty and alumni and then will be
assigned to investigate various topics in the Williams Archives or through oral interviews. Travel to
other archives may also be necessary and the Winter Study may include field trips to archival collec-
tions in Boston, Mt. Holyoke, and Worcester. Thus, students will both develop general skills in archi-
val research and oral history and contribute to a specific and fascinating chapter in the history of Wil-
liams. The research conducted by students will be used in a published history of Jews and Judaism at
Williams.
Students are expected to spend at least 20 hours/week on research and attend weekly meetings to dis-
cuss their work. Also required for the course is a final project presenting the results of individual re-
search--such as an 8- to 10-page paper, a poster, a web-page and/or a public presentation.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 10.

INTR 026 Panama: Leadership at the Crossroads of the World (Same as Political Science
026)
At the "crossroads of the world," Panama provides an ideal venue from which students can study lead-
ership in a multicultural and international context. As a gateway, Panama and its canal are symbols of
globalization that can help students understand many of the forces affecting the contemporary world.
Students will spend nearly the entire January term in Panama, where they will reside in newly reno-
vated apartments at the Ciudad del Saber or the City of Knowledge, located near the Pacific entrance
of the Panama Canal and within a short distance from Panama City (www.ciudaddelsaber.org.pa). A
former military base for U.S. forces during their administration of the Canal Zone (and with all the
recreational resources of a former command post of high import), the area now serves as a research
center, technology park and residence for visiting universities from around the world.
During their stay, students will be engaged in classes and field trip with ample time for independent
exploration. Topics include: Latin American History; Society and Politics; The New World Economy;
The Social and Ecological Ramifications of Globalization; and New Technologies and Future Oppor-
tunities. The course is team-taught by Professors from Williams, professionals in Panama, and visit-
ing experts from the Smithsonian Tropic Research Institute based in Panama. Field trips include such
itineraries as a visit to Parliament and other government building in Panama City, a transit of the Pan-
ama Canal (and a visit to the Panama Canal Authority and Museum), an overnight to the archeological
site Cerro Juan Diaz on the Pacific side of the country, and a visit to the new Galeta Marine Laboratory
in Colon at the Atlantic entrance of the Canal. Opportunities for interaction with students from other
universities will be offered, both in the classroom setting, and in less formal, social outings.
Evaluation will be based on class participation and a 10-page paper at the conclusion of the course.
No prerequisites, and while a working knowledge of Spanish isn't required, familiarity with the lan-
guage will enhance a student's experience while in Panama. Enrollment limit: 10. Preference will be
given to students with course work in Leadership Studies. Not open to first-year students.
Cost to student: $1,375 (includes airfare). Students will be responsible for most meals.

MATHEMATICS and STATISTICS
MATH 012 The Dance of Primes
Prime numbers are the building blocks for all numbers. Though there are an infinite number of primes,
how they are spread out among the integers is still quite a mystery. Even more mysterious and surpris-
ing is that the current tools for investigating prime numbers involve the study of infinite series. Some-
how function theory tells us about the primes. We will be studying one of the most amazing functions
known: The Riemann Zeta Function. Finding where this function is equal to zero is the Riemann Hy-
pothesis and is viewed as one of the great open problems in mathematics. Somehow where these zeros
occur is linked to the distribution of primes. We will be concerned with why anyone would care about
this conjecture. More crassly, why should solving the Riemann Hypothesis be worth one million dol-
lars (which is what you will get if you solve it, beyond the eternal fame and glory). This course is
aimed for people who want to get a feel for some current mathematics.
Evaluation will be based on problem sets and/or a ten page paper.

MATH 014 Fantasy Novels of C.S. Lewis and Charles Williams (Same as English 028)
Both Lewis and Williams were members of The Inklings, the remarkable group of British authors and
thinkers who met regularly at "The Eagle and Child" Pub in Oxford, where writers (including Tol-
kien) read their works in progress to one another. Lewis is well-known; the works of Williams have
received less recognition, but were admired by W.H. Auden, Dorothy L. Sayers, and T.S. Eliot. Both
Lewis and Williams approached their work as staunch Anglican Christians, and their point of view
will be respected in this course; however, their novels can speak to the lives of all readers who are
sensitive to their own world and to human relationships.
Readings will include the Ransom Trilogy of Lewis: Out of the Silent Planet, Perelandra, and That
Hideous Strength (often called "the Charles Williams novel written by C.S. Lewis"), and Williams's
War in Heaven and Descent into Hell (which Lewis listed as one of the ten books which most in-
fluenced his own thinking). The month will conclude with Lewis's final novel Till We Have Faces.
Evaluation will be based on attendance and participation in all discussions. The final project will be a
10- to 20-page short story in the style of, incorporating some ideas of, or using literary techniques of
the novels read. Alternatively, students may choose to write an expository or critical paper of about 15
pages relating some or all of the novels read to other fiction by these two authors or to works of com-
parable writers such as George MacDonald, Madeleine l'Engle, or J.K. Rowling.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 13.
Meeting time: mornings.
Cost to student: $40-50 for books.

We will explore the social, evolutionary and physiological aspects which influence dog behavior and
dog-human interactions. Class will involve both discussions of readings and hands-on experiences,
including trips to animal shelters, and working with/observing dogs.
Readings will include 2-3 books per week. Possible selections include: The Dog Who Loved Too
Much by Dr. Nicholas Dodman; The Dog's Mind by Dr. Bruce Fogel; Good Owners, Great Dogs by
Brian Kilcommons; The Truth About Dogs by Stephen Budiansky; Dog Behavior by Dr. Ian Dunbar;
How to Speak Dog by Stanley Coren; and Man Meets Dog by Konrad Lorenz.
Evaluation will be based on participation and a 10-page final paper.

MUSIC
MUS 010 Isn't it Good, Norwegion Wood?: Storytelling in Music
The Beatles song "Norwegian Wood" tells the story of a mysterious encounter between a man and a
woman that either does or doesn't culminate in sex and/or arson. How does the music underpinning
the lyrics communicate the dramatic events, emotions, and characters? How do the text and music
interact? More generally, how have stories been told in music through the centuries, and why do some
narratives retain a grip on our imagination? Even without text, music can communicate compelling
narratives, such as the heroic struggle for transcendence suggested by Beethoven's Fifth Symphony.
What purely musical means do composers employ to tell stories?
This course explores a range of archetypal narratives communicated in music: star-crossed lovers;
heroes and heroines; Faustian bargains; revenge, murder, and suicide; and humorous parables. Genres
covered include medieval morality plays, madrigals, opera, song cycles, tone poems, and ballet, as
well as popular ballads from country and western, the blues, and rock 'n roll.
Evaluation based on class presentations, participation, and a final project.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20, with preference given to seniors and juniors.
Meeting time: mornings. three times a week.
Cost to student: no more than $100 for at least 2 required field trips.

Students will take part in an ensemble course primarily devoted to studying and playing the music of
Charles Mingus. Instrumentalists needed include piano, bass, drums, trumpet, saxophone, trombone,
etc. as well as voice, but all are welcome. In addition to performing the music, the course will give
students an in-depth look at the life of Charles Mingus as a composer and bassist. Each composition
will be explored as to its structure and improvisational concepts. The focus of improvisation will be
from an historical point of view (taking in the music of Dixieland, New Orleans traditional jazz, etc.)
and will lead to collective improvising, using the Mingus Jazz Workshop as an example. Music to be
presented and performed will include: "Better Get Hit In Your Soul," "Goodbye Porkpie Hat," "Hai-
tian Fight Song," "Nostalgia in Times Square" and "Duke Ellington's Sound Of Love." "Triumph of
the Underdog," a video by filmmaker Don McGlynn, will be shown and discussed.

MUS 013 Handbell Choir
A performance Winter Study project, the Handbell Choir will rehearse two hours per day, four days a
week, from 10:15 a.m. until noon. A five-octave set of English handbells will be used. Repertoire will
be wide-ranging, from the classics to popular music, from original compositions to arrangements.
Difficulty of repertoire will depend on the skill of the ensemble as it develops.
The final week of Winter Study will consist of several performances of materials mastered during the
previous three weeks of rehearsals. This will include a final concert on the last afternoon of Winter
Study.
A "Pass" will be earned by attendance at all rehearsals unless excused only for reason of illness. A
"High Pass" may be earned by completing a written arrangement for handbells of a tune of the stu-
dent's choice. The instructor will approve that choice and assist in arranging if necessary. These ar-
rangements will be read by the choir, and may be performed on the final concert.
Ringers must be able to read music, but no prior experience playing handbells is required. Bells are
quite easy to play; ringers will be taught various handbell ringing techniques, and go on to experience
the process and teamwork necessary to build a musical ensemble. Current ringers welcome, as are
others willing to learn. Enrollment limit: 11.

PHILOSOPHY
PHIL 010 The Philosophy of Chess
Chess is one of the noblest and most fascinating of human endeavors. We will examine chess in many
of its facets: its history, philosophy, literature and psychology. We will look at the art of chess and the
art that chess has inspired. Above all, we will work together on improving our playing skills: we will
study chess openings, middle games and endgames, and engage in continual tournament play.
Evaluation will be based on class participation and problem assignments.
Prerequisites: All students should know the rules of chess and be able to read chess notation. Enroll-
ment limit: 20. If the class is overenrolled, students will be selected according to playing strength, as
indicated by United States Chess Federation ratings, results in the College chess club, or other mea-

Winter Study Program
­ 370 ­
tigate these kinds of questions by looking at the political, economic, cultural, and climatic factors that
have shaped the diet and culture of New Englanders.
We will begin our course by learning about the ecology and culture of food developed by Native
Americans: how did they hunt, gather and farm, and how did their methods of procuring food form
their relationship to nature and to each other? Then we will consider the diet of the first European set-
tlers and their interaction with Native Americans. Issues such as differing uses of the land, what was
considered by the term "property," and what was being sold by the Native Americans to the settlers
will be considered. Next we will examine how food was used to try to socialize the next wave of immi-
grants to New England and how women used food to gain entrance to higher education, which also
opened the door to science in food. Finally we will look at international issues such as genetically
modified foods, the economic and cultural impact of agribusiness, over-fishing the seas and pollution
as it relates to our food. We will enjoy a historically accurate demonstration of life in the 1700's at His-
toric Deerfield and a guest speaker.

evaluate whether Berkeley's philosophy flies in the face of the common sense it purports to articulate.
We will examine his response to skepticism through his accounts of perception, cognition, philosophy
of science and mathematics, and his conception of `common sense.' Finally, we will discuss the im-
materialist position he is famous for in light of the epistemic problems he was trying to solve.
Requirements: four short assignments and one longer (5-7 pages) paper.
Prerequisites: Philosophy 102, or consent of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 15.
Meeting time: afternoons.
Cost to student: approximately $80 for books.

PHIL 013 Legal Realism and the Search for the Law (Same as Political Science 023)
From the 1920s-1940s, a movement called Legal Realism assailed the notion of an objective and im-
partial legal system. According to the Realists, the outcomes of legal disputes depend on the values,
backgrounds, and idiosyncrasies of decision-makers (usually judges and juries). In the most extreme
formulation, what a judge eats for breakfast has a greater effect on the outcome of a case than the rules
or laws that ostensibly govern the case. Modern-day descendents of Legal Realism proclaim that "law
is politics." Is this radical skepticism on the mark? Insightful but exaggerated? Fundamentally
flawed? This course will probe the Realist perspective in the context of major legal controversies,
including Roe v. Wade, Bush v. Gore, the O.J. Simpson trial, the impeachment of Bill Clinton, and the
fight over the Supreme Court nominations of Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas.
Requirements: attendance, reading, participation, several 1- to 2-page papers and one 10-page paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20.
Meeting time: afternoons.

PHIL 014 Native American Philosophies
If we overcome the miserly view that philosophy is only done by "professional" philosophers as well
as the notion that philosophy can only be done argumentatively, we may be able to realize Native
Americans were philosophical especially in the stories they told and still tell. Using primary sources,
the course considers Native American views on a variety of philosophic topics. By examining the
presumptions, declarations and implications of such stories, we find Native Americans confronted
and speculated about the Big Questions of creation, human purpose, freedom, immortality, god(s),
morality, history, and so forth. We find we are even able to place stories in rough categories of epis-
temology, metaphysics, ethics, political philosophy, aesthetics, and so forth, though it is important to
avoid forced fitting just to advance the categories. Depending on student interest, we may also read
more sustained writings such as Neihardt's Black Elk Speaks, Linderman's Pretty-Shield, Zolbrod's

PHYSICS
PHYS 010 Light and Holography
This course will examine the art and science of holography. It will introduce modern optics at a level
appropriate for a non-science major, giving the necessary theoretical background in lectures and dis-
cussion. Demonstrations will be presented and students will make several kinds of holograms in the
lab. Thanks to a grant from the National Science Foundation, we have 7 well-equipped holography
darkrooms available for student use. At the beginning of WSP, the class will meet for lecture and dis-
cussion three mornings a week and for lab 2 afternoons a week. Later classes will be mainly laborato-
ry.
Students will be evaluated on the basis of regular attendance, completion of 4 laboratory exercises,
and a holography laboratory project or a 10-page paper. Attendance at all classes and labs is required
for a passing grade.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 30. Preference will be given to students with no previous college
course in physics more advanced than Physics 100.
Cost to student: approximately $50 for holographic film, chemicals, and photocopies.
JONES and FORKEY
PHYS 011 Introduction to Computer Aided Drafting and Design (CADD) (Same as ArtS 011)
Students will gain a fundamental knowledge of techniques used in two dimensional (2D) and three
dimensional (3D) computer aided drafting. The course begins with an emphasis on CADD nomencla-
ture as applied to drawing in 2D. We then become concerned with drawing in 3D and visualizing spa-
tial relationships by creating wireframe entities of shapes found in everyday life. This will lead to 3D
surface and solid modeling techniques including Boolean operations, mass recognition and shape
manipulation. Following this introduction, the students will be challenged to explore creating objects
of their choosing and develop photorealistic renderings with differing light sources and changing tex-
tures.
Art, science, mathematics, and other students who are interested in communicating their design ideas
in a 3D form will find this course interesting, as well as those students seeking exposure to an engi-
neering point of view. Students will create a computer solid model of a design idea and develop the
photorealistic rendering that optimizes their design's presentation. This rendering together with the
student's 2D and 3D drawings will form the basis for evaluating his/her success.
No prerequisites other than a familiarity with the Windows operating system. Enrollment limit: 14.
Meeting time: afternoons; 1p.m.-4 p.m. two times per week. This is a fast moving course. The creative
renderings will reward the student's commitment to attendance and lab time.
Cost to student: $200 for the CADKEY Windows software package.

Representational drawing is not merely a gift of birth or a magical ability granted by angels, but a
learnable skill. If you ever wanted to draw, but doubted you had the ability or believed you could not
learn, then this course is for you. This intensive course utilizes discoveries in brain research to teach
representational drawing. By using simple techniques and extensive exercises you will discover and
develop the perceptual shift from your symbol based left hemisphere to your visually based right
hemisphere. This cognitive shift enables you to accurately see and realistically represent the physical
world. You will learn to draw a convincing portrait, self-portrait, and still life. This course is designed
Winter Study Program
­ 372 ­
to develop your powers of observation and enhance your innate creative problem solving abilities,
which are applicable in any field. Students need no previous artistic experience, just the willingness
and desire to learn a new skill. Students will be expected to attend and participate in all sessions. They
will also be required to keep a sketchbook recording their progress and complete a final project.
Evaluations will be based on participation, effort, and development. The class will meet three times
per week (about 10 hours lecture and group exercises) with substantial additional independent student
work.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 30, with preference given to juniors and seniors.
Meeting time: afternoons. The course will meet in two sections of 15.
Cost to student: approximately $30 for text and drawing materials.

MCALLISTER
PSCI 013 Bové, `malbouffe,' McWorld (Same as Environmental Studies 023)
In August 1999 a small band of farmers led by José Bové dismantled a McDonald's restaurant in
southern France and coined a new French word at the same time: `malbouffe' (loosely translated as
`junk food'). While no one knew it at the time, this event has become a `shot heard round the world' in
the current political struggle over globalization. Since 1999 Bové has come to symbolize the anti-
globalization movement (for example, hundreds of attendees of the first World Social Forum meeting
sported badges stating "We are all José Bové"), just as McDonald's has become the dominant symbol
of globalization (its golden arches are among the most recognizable images in the world). One result:
when anti-globalization protestors take to the streets, the local McDonald's becomes--only after the
politicians themselves--the most protected site in the city.
More than globalization in a vague sense, this course explores the current struggle best symbolized by
José Bové and McDonald's: the global politics of industrial agriculture. We will learn about the evolu-
tion of agricultural production from family/peasant farming to concentrated animal feeding opera-
tions; the importance of immigrant labor in the production of cheap industrial food; the recent incor-
poration of agriculture into global free trade agreements; the debate over biotechnology; and the poli-
tics and political activism of Bové himself. Texts will include José Bové's The World is Not for Sale
and Eric Schlosser's Fast Food Nation as well as shorter pieces from E.F Schumacher, Wendell Berry
and others.
Format: seminar. Evaluation based on class participation and a 10-page paper.
No prerequisites, but a reading knowledge of French will be helpful. Enrollment limit: 15.
Meeting time: mornings, plus one field trip outside normal class hours.
Cost: $100 for books, reading packet and field trip to a Vermont factory farm.

PSCI 014 The Work of the Supreme Court: A Simulation
The aim of this course is to provide a sense of the personal, theoretical, and institutional characteristics
of judicial decision making at the highest level. At the beginning of the course, all students will be
furnished with a set of the briefs for an actual pending Supreme Court case. Four students (two per
side) will be assigned to make oral arguments to the "Court," which will be composed of eight stu-
dents, each playing the role of a sitting justice, and the instructor, who will act as chief justice for pur-
poses of coordination. After hearing arguments, the "Court" will confer and prepare majority and oth-
er opinions and announce them in "open court" at the conclusion of the term.
Evaluation will be based on the overall credibility in assigned role; effective argument, questions, per-
formance in conference, drafting, etc. and a 3- to 5-page "reflective" essay in which students will be
expected to identify and comment on some aspect of the work of the Court.
Prerequisites: permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 12. Preference to students who have com-

PSCI 015 Objective Journalism During Times of Conflict
Can a newspaper editor or reporter from a nation fighting terror separate their patriotism and be mem-
bers of a medium whose goal it is to reveal the truth, report objectively and let the reader judge for him
or herself? This class will follow personal experiences of two Israeli journalists, Aviva Lori and Shlo-
mo Papirblat, through major recent events in the Middle East such as the current Intifada, the war in
Lebanon, military reserve duty and many other current topics. Students will examine actual journalis-
tic dilemmas of the instructors and discuss their perspective vis-à-vis the reality of the situation. Top-
ics for discussion include whether a governing body can require journalists, during times of national
peril, to favor national interest and potentially compromise their journalistic integrity. Can a true de-
mocracy restrict and regulate press coverage during times of emergency? What is the influence of the
international media on the political developments in a contiguous region? And how much should
political leaders consider the influence of the media on the success or failure of their planned political
strategy? A central question will be whether journalism is just another profession or is a journalist an
intermediary between the public and the decision-makers and thus partake in the evolution of national
Winter Study Program

events? In addition, the course will address the foreign press coverage of events and will question
whether a foreign correspondent, who is not familiar with the local language and culture and the com-
plexities of the local realities, can report in a manner that conveys the whole picture.
Evaluation will be based on a final 10-page paper.

PSCI 016 Satire and Parody
Americans rarely use satire to comment on politics. MAD magazine now has The Onion as company,
and that's about it. The British are masters of it. (Americans have a hard time being not-nice in public,
whereas the British don't mind.) This class will look at political satire, see what works and what
doesn't, and decide which types should be encouraged. Students will produce works of satire, which
will be displayed publicly. Projects will have to meet the following criteria: they must be political, that
is, deal with power and its legitimate distribution; they have to work, to have bite--if they are stupid,
they will fail; they have to be original, more than simple variations of standard satires; and they have to
be based on social facts, on actuality rather than assertion, hence likely require a little research. Final-
ly, they cannot take the form of the 10-page paper, even if the ten pages are full of a supposedly funny
dialogue. Final projects will have to be in a traditional satirical/parodic form, e.g. cartoons, limericks,
diaramas, skits, that sort of thing.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15.
Meeting time: afternoons.
Cost to student: none, depending on materials you choose for your final product.

PSCI 017 Diplomacy and War in International Relations: What if?"
The phrase "What if?" has begun many a passionate discussion in faculty lounges, dorm rooms, bars
and, increasingly, in a scholarly literature examining historical events in international relations. This
course will examine two such what-ifs and associated questions, some of which are military but most
of which involve other aspects of politics:
(1) What if one or more nations --Great Britain? Czechoslovakia?--had stood up to Hitler and Ger-
many at Munich in 1938? Could such actions have averted World War II? How plausible would the
occurrence of such actions have been? (2) What if the People's Republic of China were to attack Tai-
wan? What might precipitate such a conflict? Would the PRC succeed? Would the U.S. intervene?
The course will involve not only readings and discussion but also a variety of policy-oriented simula-
tions of diplomacy and war in the form of board games, computer games, or role-playing. (Rules will
be taught.)
Requirements: a final 10-page paper.
Prerequisites: Intellectual engagement, imagination, and one course in either international relations or

Do you really know who is a Refugee or an Internally Displaced Person (IDP)? How many are there in
the world? Where are they located? How did they end up there? How are they dealing with daily life?
What is their future? What kind of support do governments, civil society, and the international com-
munity provide, in the short or the longer run? How relevant and efficient is this support? Discover the
ground issues of one of the most burning international and human problems that the planet is facing in
the beginning of the twenty-first century, and make your own assessment.
The first week will cover a presentation and discussion of the overall condition of refugees and IDPs
in the world, and the nature and degree of involvement of the international community in rehabilita-
tion programs. Each following week we will focus on a national case study, starting with the Gaza
Strip, continuing with Timor Island and ending with the conflict over Nagorno Karabach between
Armenia and Azerbaijan.
Evaluation will be based on attendance, classroom participation, and individual assignments, includ-

PSYCHOLOGY
PSYC 010 The Psychology of Superstition and Belief in the Paranormal
We live in a technologically advanced age, and yet superstition and belief in the paranormal abound.
The purpose of this course is to better understand why people believe in things most scientists do not,
from alien abductions and astrology to "past-life" regression, bogus medical claims, and phantom El-
vis sightings--as well as more mundane, "everyday" examples of superstition. Our chief resource in
understanding the origins of people's beliefs will be cognitive and social psychological research on
the errors, biases, and shortcomings of human inference and decision making.

PSYC 011 From Segregation to Accommodation: Changing Perspectives on Disabilities
A dramatic shift in the laws and values shaping the participation of persons with disabilities in Ameri-
can society has led to motorized carts in Professional Golf Association tournaments and modified
exam procedures for some students on our own campus. With the help of guest speakers who them-
selves have disabilities as well as through readings and films, we will explore past and present under-
standings of disabilities (physical, sensory, cognitive, mental health) and the changing responses to
those who have them. Each student will conduct an investigation, using interviews and site visits, of
changing laws and practices related to persons with disabilities within a specific local context; for
instance, athletics, architecture, education, medicine, recreation. Alternatively, a student may focus
an inquiry on understanding the meaning and impact of his or her own disability or that of a family
member. The underlying aim of this course is to help students become better equipped to participate in
our society's continuing dialogue about the nature of disabilities and what measures should be taken
to accommodate those who have them.
Among the readings will be the book, No Pity: People with Disabilities Forging a New Civil Rights
Movement (Shapiro, 1993) and personal narratives written by persons with disabilities or their fami-
lies.
Evaluation will be based on class participation and presentation (both oral and written) of your inves-

particular focus on the dimensions of beauty and intelligence. We also will examine methodological
issues involved in how to study these tendencies and trends systematically and objectively. This
course will emphasize social psychological theory and research concerning the potential role of such
portrayals in women's and men's personal, social, and academic identities and achievement. We will

PSYC 014 Sleep and Dreams
While metaphors of sleep and the meaning of dreams have permeated literature and folklore for cen-
turies, the advent of psychological sleep labs, the electroencephalograph (EEG), and advances in neu-
roscience have allowed a scientific perspective to emerge regarding the functions and mysteries of
behavior that occupies one-third of our lives. This course explores the psychology of sleep, beginning
with emphasis on a neuroscience understanding. Readings, discussion, and lab exercises in the first
half of the course include circadian/ultradian rhythms, dyssomnias, parasomnias, and sleep depriva-
tion. A field trip to a local hospital's Sleep Lab to observe firsthand a sleeping subject's EEG patterns
is planned next. We then go on to consider various perspectives on dreams, including Piagetian, psy-
choanalytic, evolutionary, cognitive problem-solving, Buddhist, Gestalt, interpersonal, activation-
synthesis, and dreams-as-garbage views. Students will anonymously submit and evaluate dreams, ap-
plying one or more of these theories.
Evaluation will be based on class participation and discussion of student's commentary on readings,
submission and evaluation of anonymous dream journals, and a 10-page research paper.
Prerequisite: A basic understanding of scientific method is necessary to critically read assigned re-

pretation. Of particular interest will be to describe how, during psychotherapy, persons change. By
using both imagined therapy dialogues and published student auto-biographies, efforts will be made
at each stage to illustrate ways in which the general principles work out in practice. For the course
paper, students will be asked to describe an issue of concern in the student's own experience and to
imagine how a therapist might collaborate in working on that issue. At the end of the course the
instructor will discuss each paper individually with each student.
Requirements: readings, class discussion, and a 10-page paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 10. Preferences given to juniors and seniors.
Meeting time: mornings.

PSYC 020 Eating Disorders
What are eating disorders? Why do individuals develop eating disorders? What psychological and
cultural theories explain the emergence of eating disorders? Are eating disorders culture-bound syn-
dromes affecting primarily women in the West? What is a culture-bound syndrome? What types of
treatment are available to help individuals suffering from eating disorders?
This course seeks to answer the above questions and many more as it investigates the manifestation of
eating disorders in both western and non-western cultures. Eating disorders involve a severe distur-
bance in eating behavior, maladaptive attempts to restrict body weight, and abnormal attitudes about
weight and shape (e.g., Anorexia Nervosa, Bulimia Nervosa, and Binge-Eating Disorder). It has been
hypothesized that eating disorders have sharply risen in the Unites States since the 1950's and taken
on the quality of a social epidemic, affecting primarily adolescent and young adult female popula-
tions.
In the course, we will seek to understand the nature of eating disorders and the psychological meaning
of the symptom complex for the individual sufferer. We will also look at the cultural factors theorized
to be implicated in the emergence of eating disorders in western culture: the value of beauty, weight
control, thinness, the emphasis on exercise and fitness, the glamorization of anorexia in the mass me-
dia, and the role conflict experienced by many women in contemporary society.
Additionally, we will seek to identify cultural factors that these theories might have missed (revolving
around issues of power and control) and look at the ways in which eating disorders affect women from
non-western backgrounds both in the United States and beyond. In doing so, we will critique the cul-
ture-bound theory of eating disorders and suggest other possible frameworks for understanding eating
disorders.
Finally, we will examine the treatment options available to individuals suffering from eating disor-
ders. Possible readings include: A Hunger So Wide and Deep by Becky Thompson, Eating Disorders:
Anatomy of a Social Epidemic by Richard A. Gordon, and Feminist Perspectives on Eating Disorders
edited by Patricia Fallon, Susan Wooley, and Melanie A. Katzman. Excerpts drawn from Adios Bar-
bie: Young Women Write about Body Image and Identity edited by Ophira Edut, Culture and Weight
Consciousness by Mervat Nassar, The Beauty Myth by Naomi Wolf, Food and Culture edited by Ca-
role Counihan and Penny Van Esterik, and The Handbook for the Treatment of Eating Disorders by
Garner and Garfinkel will also be used to complement assigned readings, lectures, and class discus-
sion.

REL 012 The Spirit and Practice of Yoga: Coming into Alignment
This class provides an orientation to yoga and builds a foundation for an effective and rewarding per-
sonal yoga practice. Each class will begin with a half-hour discussion of selected readings on yoga
philosophy and schools of yoga, including Patanjali's Yoga Sutras, The Bhagavad Gita, and Tantra:
The Yoga of Ecstasy, followed by a 90-minute yoga practicum where students will be introduced to the
principles of alignment and how they apply in the major types of yoga poses: posture flow, standing
poses, inversions, abdominals, hip-openers, backbends, twists, forward bends, and restoratives. In
this way the class builds strength, flexibility, and awareness. Sanskrit and English names of poses will
be taught. Students will receive individualized attention on how to work with the principles of align-
ment in their particular bodies. Yoga training is complementary to sports/athletics, aids classroom and
study, and cultivates a sense of well-being, balance and spiritual connection to oneself.
Evaluation: attendance at all classes including a mandatory field trip to Kripalu Center, class partici-
pation, informed discussion of short readings, three two-page journal entries, demonstration of prin-
ciples of alignment, and final exhibit (equivalent to a 10-page paper).

REL 014 Language of the Holocaust
How name what is unnameable, unthinkable, unimaginable? Is silence the only response to unspeak-
able acts? Or, if you can articulate a name, an authority, an identity, a reason for genocide, for the
annihilation of the Jewish people, how do you express or represent the experience without the luxury
of artifice? What are the terms of such expression? What claims does the experience make on those
who wish to define it? Is there an ultimate fiction greater than fact that such an event requires? This
course will concentrate on the relationships between historical/recorded (mimetic) interpretations
(i.e., first person accounts, religious and historical texts, documentary footage) and constructed (poe-
sis) interpretations of the Holocaust. The latter will include a sampling of films, novels, poems, art of
victims and survivors and all of which use the material of genocide as primary source for the creation
of a work of art. Within this framework questions regarding both the particular and universal nature of
the Holocaust will be addressed. Course readings and material will offer provocative pairings to
sharpen and question the necessary yet paradoxically unstable distinction between the mimetic and
poetic mode: Those might include Wiesel'sNight; Borowski'sThis Way To The Gas Chambers Ladies
and Gentlemen; Primo Levi's Survival in Auschwitz; Charlotte Delbo's None of Us Will Return; Ida
Fink's A Scrap of Time and Other Stories; Charles Reznicoff's Holocaust; Artie Spiegelman's Maus I
and Maus II; Expressionistic and concentration camp art; various historical accounts; and selections
from the work of Paul Celan, Nelly Sachs, A. Sutzkever, Edmond Jabes, Emanuel Levinas, Zvi Ko-
litz. Films might include, Nasty Girl, Shop On Main Street, Life is Beautiful, Shoah, Shindler's List.

REL 016 Buddhist Art of Asia (Same as ArtH 016 and Asian Studies 016)
In the sixth century BCE, Siddhartha Gautama, the historical Buddha, was born on the Indian subcon-
tinent. Over the next millennia, his teachings spread from the foothills of the Himalayas to locations as
far-flung as Tibet and Indonesia, Korea and Sri Lanka, China and Nepal. This seminar will explore the
world of Buddhist art from its rise and development in India to its transmission and transformation in
China and pre-modern and modern Tibet.
Our examination is grounded on the understanding that Buddhist images and architecture not only
communicated religious values and philosophical beliefs, but served pivotal ritual, social and institu-
tional aims. Only by discerning the inter-relationship between these varied dimensions in specific cul-
tural contexts can we begin to appreciate the spiritual efficacy and social power of Buddhist artistic
creations. Toward that end, we will draw on a range of resources, including key primary texts, secon-
dary works, audio-visual tools, a field trip, and a guest speaker.
Requirements: class participation, weekly discussion papers and a final 8- to 10-page paper.

The stage manager is a pivotal member of the collaborative process. He or she builds the creative en-

prime communicator and liaison who synthesizes the disparate elements of production into a cohesive
whole and is responsible for the implementation of diverse artistic choices throughout the production
process. This course will explore the role of the stage manager and will offer a comprehensive inves-
tigation of the work from pre-production to closing a show. Through a system of readings, exercises,
written assignments and `hands-on' activities, the student will learn the importance and process of
stage management.

THEA 014 From Avant Garde to Popular Culture: The Theatre Songs of Kurt Weill (Same as

Kurt Weill's works are proof that serious art and popular musical theater are not mutually exclusive.
From his early years as one of the most progressive European composers to his later years as a wildly
popular New York theater composer, there runs a consistent thread of economy and sharpness. One
can hear the theatrical potential in Weill's early instrumental music just as clearly as one can hear den-
sity and concentration in his songs for the New York stage. This Winter Study course will concentrate
on selected early works and songs from "the Three Penny Opera," probably Weill's finest theater
score. Class meetings will consist of both lectures and dramatic coaching. A cabaret of songs from
"Three Penny" will be performed during the last week of the class.
Method of evaluation: A student may fulfill the requirements of the course by performing, writing a
10-page discursive paper, or some combination of the two approved by the teacher.

SPEC 010 Quest for College: Early Awareness in Berkshire County Schools
Today's extremely competitive higher education market places significant pressure on students na-
tionwide to start planning for college at an increasingly early age while simultaneously demanding
ever-higher standards of excellence for admission to top schools. "Early Awareness" initiatives aim to
educate middle school students as to what lies ahead on the college horizon, empowering them to
make sound academic and extracurricular choices that will keep open a maximum of options. The first
week of this course will be spent in the classroom, exploring and discussing problems and issues ger-
mane to the national trends towards greater (and earlier) college-related pressures. Students will re-
spond to a series of readings dealing with such issues as tracking, paid test preparation and untimed
testing, early decision, parental and peer pressures, special interests, misrepresentation of informa-
tion, independent counseling, and others. Class time will also be devoted to familiarizing students
with both the nuances of the college admission process and the administration of the early awareness
game, Quest for College. Students will spend the next two weeks visiting 10-12 Berkshire County
Winter Study Program

middle schools, administering the game and inviting students to the culminating College Day. All 8
students will then work together to plan and run College Day activities for students and their parents.
This day will include a) campus tours, b) general higher education info sessions, and c) financial aid/
scholarship info for the parents. If student and community interest is sufficient, the course may culmi-
nate in a public presentation and open forum early second semester.
Evaluation will be based on completion of field work (school visits), organization and execution of
project to bring local middle school students to the Williams Campus for a day of early-awareness
related activities and a final paper (approximately 10 pages) reflecting on a course-related issue of the
student's choosing.

SPEC 012 What is Williams?
What is the essence of this complex and evolving entity Williams College and how can it be commu-
nicated? To advance its mission the College must understand the heart of its enterprise and effectively
articulate that understanding to a variety of audiences from prospective students and parents to alum-
ni, potential donors, government leaders, media, and even current students, faculty, and staff. We'll
refine our understanding of Williams by analyzing how the College represents itself, assessing how
effective those communications are, and comparing how other colleges and organizations represent
themselves. Along the way we'll discuss what makes communication effective. In addition to a num-
ber of short in-class presentations, students (individually or in pairs) will undertake, with the instruc-
tors consent, a communications project (using any of a variety of media) to advance some aspect of
Williams. This might be a script for admissions tour guides, a media campaign to promote need-blind
financial aid, a plan to enhance the recruitment of students of color, a publication to raise funds for
some curricular innovation or the new student center.

SPEC 013 Going to Extremes (Same as English 013)
This course will examine how and why works of both fiction and non-fiction travel to the ends of the
earth to investigate extremes of human behavior. Topics to be addressed include going native, the lure
of intemperate places, Romanticism the monster that will not die, and the attractions of disaster. We'll
assume a familiarity with Frankenstein, focusing instead on Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad,
Into the Wild by Jon Krakauer, An Imaginary Life by David Malouf, shorter narratives by Edward
Abbey, Bruce Chatwin, David Quammen, and Annie Proulx; and at least two films. Written work,
which will amount to ten pages in various forms, will invite students to draw on their own experi-
ences, as well as traverse the usual borders between genres.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20. Priority given to upper-level students.
Meeting time: mornings, three times a week for two hours.

poisoning, drug and alcohol emergencies, burns, frostbite and other exposures to cold, also bone,
joint, and back injuries, and sudden illnesses such as heart attacks, strokes, convulsions, etc. It will
also teach the use of all splints, backboards, bandages, and other rescue equipment. It will teach ex-
trication and unusual emergency situations and the use of oxygen. The outdoor course will include
rescue toboggan handling, organization of rescues, and outdoor practical first aid. Classroom work
will include lectures, seminars, and practical work.
Requirements : There will be a mid-term and a final exam which will be both written and practical.
Each week there will be 17 hours of classroom work plus 8 hours of practical outdoor work at Jiminy
Peak ski area. Attendance at all classes is mandatory.
Prerequisites: None.

SPEC 015 Uncle Eph in his Youth: Old Williams in Thought and Form (Same as American
Studies 015, ArtH 015 and English 024)
The Williams of the past is very much like the Williams of today: and also very different. In this course we
will explore our community's past by looking at its architectural history, its building (many of which are
still here), and at what was happening in those buildings (which we will have to dig out of the archives).
How have the buildings and the work that the students do--in and out of the classroom--changed as they
have grown up together? We will read about these areas; we will tour our own campus, and we will take
some field trips too; Amherst, and perhaps Union. We will try to re-create--literally--some of the experi-
ences of previous Williams students, and we will do this in the buildings where those experiences took
place. In doing so we will see how radically, even fundamentally, the learning experience of the past differs
from that of today. Students will do independent work in the archives--Williamsiana--and take an active
part in the staging of the re-animated classes. Work from the class will be used to create and exhibition in
Williamsiana, with students each working on some part of the display.
Requirements: perfect attendance and several short, sometimes collaborative, assignments, both written
and otherwise.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 18.
Meeting time: various; six hours a week, with additional field trips.

SPEC 022 Deaf and Proud: An Introduction to Deaf Language and Culture
The aim of this course is to introduce students to the world of deafness. Although it is not a sign lan-
guage course, we will learn about the differences between American Sign Language (A.S.L.) and in-
vented sign systems such as Signed English. Students should expect to develop a basic understanding
of the linguistic status of A.S.L., a language in which the grammar is expressed on the face and which
does not share the grammatical structures of English. We will give specific attention to the social and
economic status of the deaf community at large and to the social and political constraints imposed
upon them by a hearing community which denies them education in their own language. Three ap-
proaches to deaf education will be addressed: oral, signed English, and A.S.L. Several native signers
will be invited to lecture and engage in dialogue with students about deaf politics and culture. The
course will be taught by an instructor with extensive experience as an interpreter in the deaf communi-

ty. In addition in exploring deafness from the perspectives of deaf people, students will learn about the
role of the interpreter in both deaf and hearing communities. Major texts from the course may include
the following: In This Sign by Joanna Greenberg, a child of deaf adults; The Mask of Benevolence by
Harlan Lane; Voices from a Culture by Padden and Humprhies; and a collection of articles and videos.
Evaluation will be based on brief journal entries which record responses to videos, discussions and
readings following each class, a 5-page critical response essay to an assigned topic, class participa-
tion, and a final project (i.e. oral presentation, performance, essay, etc.)
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15.

SPEC 024 Eye Care and Culture in Caribbean Nicaragua
The Winter Study will take place in Bluefields, Nicaragua and surrounding villages on the Caribbean
Coast of Nicaragua. After background study of HealthCare Policy and "hands on" training in eye
care, the group will travel to Bluefields, Nicaragua and surrounding communities to assist in the con-
ducting of eye care clinics under the auspices of the international organization "Volunteer Optometric
Services to Humanity" (VOSH). "The Primary Mission of VOSH is to facilitate the provision of vi-
sion care worldwide to people who can neither afford nor obtain eye care."
Schedule : Jan. 6-18.--Study of Health Care Policy and Culture in a third world country.
Hands-on training in: 1. measuring visual acuity using eye charts; 2. learning to use an "auto refractor
to get readings for the doctors as a guide to prescriptions; 3. dispensing--fit glasses and understand
prescriptions. Jan. 19-26--1. assist in administering eye care evaluations; observation and assisting
eye care professionals in cataract operations and glaucoma evaluation.
During the Williamstown preparation (Jan. 6-18), the students will be led in a study of health care
policy by Dr. Melvin Krant, retired oncologist and former lecturer at Brandeis University on third
world health policy and history; culture and realities of the Caribbean Coast people will be led by Dr.
Robert Peck and Lynn Hood, former Director of the Council on Aging in Williamstown and co-leader
of the spring break 2001 trip to the Coast to build a library building for the new university in Blue-
fields.
Requirements: attend classes in Williamstown, Monday, Wednesday and Friday, 10 a.m.-noon.
Keep a journal on the daily experiences of living and working in a third world country. Research, in
some detail, the daily realities of an eye care recipient (education, vocation, family, economics, future
etc.). Write up this information in a biographical essay, reflecting on life in the third-world region.

(See under Russian for full description.)
SPEC 026 Introduction to Zen Training for Pre-Medical Students (Same as Asian Studies 026
and Religion 026)
An intensive exposure to the training methods of Chozen-ji line of Rinzai Zen, training that includes
zazen (seated mediation), budo (martial arts) and manual labor, all of them based on attention to
breath, posture and the most efficient use of the body. Three weeks is a trivial amount of time, but
experience shows it to be the minimum necessary to generate a fundamental shift in perspective. The
emphasis is on understanding Zen as mind-body training and training as a way of life. Come prepared
to work hard and sleep little for 21 days.
It can take a long time for physicians to recognize that who they are can be as therapeutic as what they
know. Zen is a means to accelerate that process by physically training that "who you are," asking you
to look at the nature of healing, the nature of compassion, the relations between giving life and taking
life. Unlike all other forms of training in the healing arts, Zen works directly through the body and not

the intellect. How do you stand when facing a grieving parent? How do you breath when rushed to a
scene of mass destruction? How do you live a life in which all relationships can be therapeutic?
The program will be based at the Greene's home in Nuuanu Valley, outside of Honolulu. Students will
live in rough outdoor accommodations there, will eat there and will do the majority of their Zen train-
ing there. Once students have become accustomed to the rigors of meditation, they will do portions of
their Zen training at Daihonzan Chozen-ji, a few miles away. Budo training (primarily with a sword)
will take place at the Daihonzan and other dojo nearby.
Final evaluation: Given the rigorous mind-body emphasis of the training, final evaluation will be
done in the form of an oral review of the strengths and weaknesses of each student's performance.
Areas to be discussed with each student include ability to focus, ability to attend to the needs of the
group, and ability to bring out kiai. This is the same format for evaluation used with medical students
during their most intense period of training, their 3rd year clerkships.
Contacts:--Gordon Greene--phone: 808-595-7024 (home).

Each class will begin with a lecture-demonstration, followed by practice on the potter's wheel. Each
student will have the use of a potter's wheel for each class. We will work on mugs, bowls, pitchers,
plates, jars, lids, vases, and bottles, and will finish these shapes as required by trimming and adding
handles, lugs, lids, spouts, and knobs. We will also work on several different handbuilding projects.
After the tenth class session, all class work will be biscuit-fired. The eleventh class will be devoted to
glazing the biscuited pieces. Glazing techniques will include pouring, dipping, layering, brushing,
and stamping, and using wax resist and other masking techniques to develop pattern and design. The
completed work will then be glaze-fired. The last meeting will be devoted to a "final exam" gallery
show of your best work. Woven into lecture-demonstrations will be presentations on various topics
relating to the science and history of pottery making.

SPEC 039 Composing A Life: Finding Success and Balance in Life After Williams
To be at Williams you have learned to be a successful student, but how do you learn to be successful in
life? How will you define success in both your career and in your personal life? How will you resolve
the inevitable tradeoffs and achieve balance between the two? In short, what will constitute the "good
life" for you? We borrow the concept of "composing a life," from a book by Mary Catherine Bateson,
as a very apt metaphor for the ongoing process of defining success and balance in life. This course is
designed: (1)To offer college students, on the threshold of entering adulthood, an opportunity to ex-
amine and define their beliefs, values, and assumptions about their future personal and professional
lives, and to consider how they might achieve a successful balance; (2) To encourage students to gain
a better understanding of how culture, ideology, and opportunity affect their life choices; 3) To pro-
vide an opportunity for students to consider different models of success and balance through an em-
phasis on case studies and "living cases" (in the form of guests from various professions who have
made different life choices); and 4) To aid students in contemplating their career options through indi-
vidual advising and introducing various career and life planning resources. Through the use of se-
lected readings, cases, guest speakers and field interviews, we will explore both the public context of
the workplace as well as the private context of individuals and their personal relationships in deter-
mining life choices.
Requirements: evaluation will be based on regular attendance, class participation, field interview, and
a 10-page final paper
