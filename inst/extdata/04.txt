HISTORY OF THE COLLEGE
The chartering of Williams College in 1793 was an act of faith and certainly an act surpassing the
modest intentions of Colonel Ephraim Williams, for whom the college is named.
Colonel Williams had not intended to found a college. Enroute with his regiment of Massachu-
setts militia to join the battle with the French and Indians at Lake George, the Colonel had tarried
long enough in Albany to write his last will and testament on July 22, 1755. In it he bequeathed his
residuary estate for the founding and support of a free school in West Township, where for some
years he had commanded a detachment of militia at Fort Massachusetts, farthest outpost of the
province. The will stipulated that West Township, then in dispute between Massachusetts and New
York, must fall within Massachusetts and that the name of the township must be changed to Wil-
liamstown, if the free school was to be established at all.
On September 8, 1755, Colonel Williams was killed at the Battle of Lake George. On October 26,
1791, after many delays, fifteen scholars were admitted to the free school in Williamstown. Within a
year the trustees, not content with the original modest design of the founder, were captivated by the
idea of creating a college where, as they put it, "young gentlemen from every part of the Union" might
resort for instruction " in all the branches of useful and polite literature." The proposal was extremely
ambitious, to be sure, but ambition was a common American ailment. England did not develop a third
university until the nineteenth century; Williams was the twenty-first institution of higher learning to
flower in onetime British colonies, the second in Massachusetts, the sixth in New England. On June
22, 1793, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts granted a charter to Williams College.
I
The bold decision to plant a college in the wilderness betrayed the intentions of Colonel Wil-
liams; yet the new vision had been fed by the same sort of dreams that had led Ephraim Williams to
see a school and a comfortable community where only a military outpost had stood. The early trust-
ees and the legislature of the Commonwealth were to be remembered for their foresight, but in the
decades after 1793 they had reason to acknowledge that the soil they had chosen was stubbornly
uncongenial--so uncongenial, in fact, that for many years the trustees of Williams spent more time
and energy in trying to close the College than in trying to keep it open.
In 1819 they petitioned to move the college to Northhampton, and in 1821, having been spurned by
the legislature, President Zephaniah Swift Moore took matters into his own hands. Convinced that
almost everything about Williams was impossible--its location, its funds, its enrollment--he led a
group of students over the mountains into the Connecticut Valley. There he became their president
once again, at the struggling new college known as Amherst. As for Williams, one member of the
senior class wrote home to his father: "It remains for us to say whether it shall die suddenly, or whether
it shall linger along for two or three years."
In the past the public had come to the support of the institution. A lottery furnished funds essen-
tial to the opening of the free school. A public subscription was the answer of Berkshire County to
the threat of removal in 1819. What saved the College in 1821 was the willingness of the Reverend
Edward Dorr Griffin to take the job of president and the determination with which he drew upon the
College's reputation for religious conservatism to collect much-needed funds. By 1828, the Rever-
end Griffin could be seen standing in the middle of Main Street, supervising the construction of a
handsome new building, housing a chapel, a library, and classrooms, a testament to his confidence
and his skill. The building is now known as Griffin Hall.
The College which had been taking shape under Griffin and his predecessors was not unlike
many other New England colleges where the classical curriculum and a moral atmosphere served as
the basis for training young men for professional life. The college turned out its share of clergymen,
doctors, lawyers, and teachers, serving the needs of Western Massachusetts and surrounding com-
munities in New York and Vermont. But Williams was not yet a place to which "young gentlemen
from every part of the Union" resorted. In fact, Nathaniel Hawthorne, attending the commencement
exercises in 1838, jotted in his notebook some observations on the Williams students he saw there:
"Country graduates--rough, brown-featured, schoolmaster-looking...A rough hewn, heavy set of
fellows from the hills and woods in this neighborhood; unpolished bumpkins, who had grown up as
farmer-boys."
History of the College
­ 4 ­
Williams seldom knew financial security until the end of the nineteenth century. But it did have
assets that enabled it to develop into a prototype of the small New England liberal arts college. Scen-
ery, a reputation for moral soundness, a loyal body of alumni, and a devoted faculty went a long way
toward compensating for inadequate funds.
Of the scenery, Thoreau remarked, after a visit in 1844, "It would be no small advantage if every
college were thus located at the base of a mountain." For Thoreau the location of Williams was "as
good at least as one well-endowed professorship."
In the early years the religious reputation of the College depended on the essential orthodoxy of
its presidents and faculty. It gathered strength from the famous episode of the "haystack meeting" in
the summer of 1806. Five Williams undergraduates, seeking to continue their prayers and conversa-
tions in spite of a sudden thunderstorm, retired from a grove of trees to the shelter of a nearby hay-
stack, where they were inspired to launch the great adventure of American foreign missions. The
extremely informal ties with the Congregationalists saved it from the sometimes stifling strangle-
hold of an organic denominational connection.
During a crisis in the affairs of the College in 1821, a group of alumni met in Williamstown and
organized the Society of Alumni, dedicated to the future welfare of the College. Their action gave
Williams the distinction of organizing the first college alumni society in history. Alumni loyalty was
rewarded when, in 1868, the College provided for official alumni representation on the board of trust-
ees, an act of recognition in which only Harvard, among American colleges, anticipated Williams.
II
But essentially the College has built its reputation around teachers and teaching. Mark Hopkins,
who was a Williams professor from 1830 to 1887 and president of the College from 1836 to 1872, has
become a symbol of this emphasis. In American education Hopkins pioneered in making the student
the center of the educational experience, and he did it so well that one of his former students, U.S.
President James A. Garfield, immortalized his achievement in an aphorism which has passed into the
lore of American education: "The ideal college is Mark Hopkins on one end of a log and a student on
the other." The Hopkins tradition has become one of the College's great assets. It has been perpetuated
in the lives of generations of teachers.
Scenery, a reputation for building sound character, loyal but not especially affluent alumni, and
devoted teachers could keep the College open, but like most other colleges Williams did not experi-
ence growth and prosperity until the closing decades of the nineteenth century. The scenery, of
course, remained constant, but it developed into an even greater asset as the United States became
more urbanized and industrialized. Williams was still a country college; a Massachusetts court de-
cision of 1888 declared that cows owned by the college were tax exempt. The discovery that busi-
nessmen could profit from liberal education sent college enrollments upward as the century drew to
a close; now more Williams alumni were men of affairs, fewer were clergymen. By 1906, of all the
colleges in New England, Williams drew the largest percentage of students from outside New Eng-
land.
From 1793 through 1870 the Commonwealth of Massachusetts appropriated for Williams College
over $150,000, a sum of such importance that Mark Hopkins himself observed that he did "not see
how the College could have got on" without state aid. A new and more dependable source of financial
support was developed as the century drew to a close. In the 1890's Frederick Ferris Thompson of the
Class of 1856 became the first of many individuals to supersede the Commonwealth as the largest
benefactor of the College. Ephraim Williams' original bequest of $9,297 has since grown by addition-
al gifts and bequests to an endowment valued at approximately $1.3 billion.
III
Williams moved into the twentieth century firm in its intentions to remain a college, at a time when
aspirations toward university status were unsettling many of the old colleges. It adhered to a curricu-
lum that was designed for undergraduates; it made room for the elective principle, but it subjected
course election to safeguards and controls. The idea of a liberally educated man was not jettisoned in
favor of the widely accepted idea of almost complete student freedom in course election. A survey of
the college curriculum in 1925 showed that Williams had combined the principles of prescription and
election, the goals of concentration and distribution, in such a way as to be the only major American
History of the College
­ 5 ­
college without any absolutely required courses and without any uncontrolled wide-option electives.
The Williams curriculum has continued to evolve, but it has not undergone such a series of major
overhauls as characterize curriculums inspired by the popular educational fancy of the moment. Not
having abandoned itself to the elective principle in the nineteenth century, Williams did not need to
rescue itself with the general education principle of the twentieth century.
During its long history much of the life and tone of the college was shaped by students. While the
same influence continues, the competitive pressure for admission since World War II has allowed
for a new and significant degree of selectivity on the part of the College. Among the consequences
of this change have been a quickening of the intellectual life of the College and a reconsideration of
traditions and emphases no longer considered appropriate for an institution of liberal learning.
Among the first traditions to go was compulsory religious exercises, abandoned in 1962 after a
hundred years of gradual but steady erosion. Voluntary worship in the form of ecumenical chapel
services and the activities of student religious organizations carry on another long tradition. In re-
sponse to the concern of undergraduate leaders and the faculty and in recognition of the failure of
Greek Letter Fraternities to fulfill adequately objectives consistent with college purpose, the Trust-
ees in 1962 took the first of a series of actions that replaced fraternities with a residential house sys-
tem. Williams became, as a result, a much more open community. The decision to become coeduca-
tional and the admission of women to Williams as degree candidates in 1970 have reinforced the
spirit of equality and freedom conducive to a climate of learning.
In this atmosphere of change and heightened purpose the curriculum underwent appropriate
transformations, as a careful comparative study of the yearly catalogues readily shows, leading to
the present 4-1-4 curriculum and a more flexible and wide-ranging schedule and program both on
and beyond the campus. Changes in the curriculum included the addition of majors and the
introduction of interdisciplinary programs, along with the expansion of language offerings to in-
clude full, four-year cycles in Chinese and Japanese. Continuing the tradition of putting the student
at the center of the educational experience, Williams in the Fall of 1988 introduced in each depart-
ment at least one course taught as a tutorial, in which, typically, pairs of students meet weekly with
the professor to discuss a paper, problem set, or work of art produced by one of the students. By
1992 some 40 percent of the graduating class had experienced at least one tutorial course either in
Williamstown or in the Williams-Oxford program, run in association with Exeter College, Oxford,
which provides each year for some 30 Williams juniors a year-long immersion in the life of Oxford
University.
This curricular expansion reflected, and in part resulted from, the fact that the makeup of the col-
lege community was changing to mirror more closely the growing racial, ethnic, and religious di-
versity of American society. The percentage of Williams students who identified themselves as
members of one or more American minority group rose to 25 percent; of faculty almost 13 percent.
At the beginning of this decade, President Morton Owen Schapiro inaugurated a strategic plan-
ning process, through which the College community identified priorities for change in the curricu-
lum and in residential life. The size of the faculty is being expanded to provide more curricular op-
portunities for students in tutorials and experiential learning. Requirements have been added in in-
tensive writing instruction and in quantitative and formal reasoning. New programming and struc-
tures are being added to student residential life and major projects are underway to greatly enhance
the College's student center, its facilities for theatre and dance, and its office and teaching spaces for
faculty.

MISSION AND OBJECTIVES
We are to regard the mind, not as a piece of iron to be laid upon the anvil and hammered into any
shape, nor as a block of marble in which we are to find the statue by removing the rubbish, or as a
receptacle into which knowledge may be poured; but as a flame that is to be fed, as an active being that
must be strengthened to think and to feel--and to dare, to do, and to suffer.
President Mark Hopkins '24
Induction Address (1836)
Our colleges will not be rich enough until they are able to bring the education they offer within the
reach of the poorest young man in the land.
President P.A. Chadbourne '48
Induction Address (1872)
Dedicated to the welfare of the great common life of the State, [the College] may not much longer
close its doors to one half of the community because of their sex, neither may it narrow its labors or its
sympathies to any class, to any favored few.
James D. Canfield '68
Centennial Oration (1893)
[Young people] now entering college, if given their biblical life span--and who knows what more or
less than three score and ten?--will be carrying responsibilities well into the 21st century...No one can
pretend to more than a guess at what they will then be called upon to comprehend. This much we do know:
that no training in fixed techniques, no finite knowledge now at hand, no rigid formula they might be given
can solve problems whose shape we cannot yet define. Nor have they time to waste in pursuit of transitory
expedients, the ephemeral, the shallow or the merely popular.
The most versatile, the most durable, in an ultimate sense the most practical knowledge and intel-
lectual resources which they can now be offered are those impractical arts and sciences around which
the liberal arts education has long centered: the capacity to see and feel, to grasp, respond and act over
a widening arc of experience; the disposition and ability to think, to question, to use knowledge to
order an ever-extending range of reality; the elasticity to grow, to perceive more widely and more
deeply, and perhaps to create; the understanding to decide where to stand and the will and tenacity to
do so; the wit and wisdom, the humanity and the humor to try to see oneself, one's society, and one's
world with open eyes, to live a life usefully, to help things in which one believes on their way. This is
not the whole of a liberal arts education, but as I understand it, this range of goals is close to its core.
President John E. Sawyer '39
Induction Address (1961)
The longer history of education in our own culture has been such as to suggest the openness, resil-
ience, flexibility and power of that age-old tradition of education in the liberal arts that at its best is
consciously geared to no less inclusive an activity than that of living itself...[And] no education which
truly aspires to be a preparation for living can afford to ignore the fundamental continuities that exist
between the cultivation of specific areas of specialized knowledge, expertise or skill (without which
we could scarcely endure) and that more fundamental and wide-ranging attempt to penetrate by our
reason the very structures of the natural world, to evoke the dimensions and significance of the beauti-
ful, to reach towards an understanding of what it is to be human, of one's position in the universe, and
of one's relations with one's fellows, moral no less than material. Towards that attempt we seem im-
pelled by the very fiber of our being. In its total absence, while doubtless we survive, we do so as
something surely less than human.
The history, moreover, of that most American of educational institutions, the independent, free-
standing liberal-arts college, witnesses forcefully to the power of that central educational institution
when wedded to the other long-standing conviction that education is not a process that can wholly be
confined to classroom, laboratory, studio or library, but one to which the diverse experience and richly
variegated moments of life in a residential community must all combine to make their particular con-
tribution. Extracurriculum as well as curriculum; play as well as work; fellowship as well as solitude;
the foreign as well as the familiar; discomfort as well as ease; protest as well as celebration; prescrip-
tion as well as choice; failure as well as success.
President Francis Oakley
Induction Address (1985)
At Williams, with a spectacularly talented and devoted faculty and staff, great physical and finan-
cial wealth, and the absolute finest students in all of American higher education, we are obligated to
Mission and Objectives
­ 7 ­
realize a vision of educational excellence worthy of our extraordinary resources. That vision undoubt-
edly involves the optimal use of new technologies to enhance the special relationship between a stu-
dent and a faculty member; the breaking down of departmental boundaries, fostering cutting edge
interdisciplinary teaching and research; a way to link more effectively the education that takes place
within the classroom with the education that takes place in the dorm rooms and dining halls and on the
playing fields; a program that allows our students to venture out into the world in ways that reinforce
their classroom experiences; and a commitment to redouble our efforts to educate our students in an
environment that reflects the great strength of our diverse society and to keep the precious prize of a
Williams education open to the most talented students in the nation regardless of family background.
We have never wavered in understanding that our mission is to provide the highest quality under-
graduate education possible, centered on an appreciation and indeed a love of the liberal arts. We can
build on that legacy. This is a time for Williams to set a new standard of excellence in undergraduate
education for an entire industry crying out for guidance. Let history one day note that our community
had the courage to seize the moment.

THE CURRICULUM
Williams College offers a course of study leading to the degree of Bachelor of Arts. The course
requirements prescribe both the number of courses to be completed and the minimum grade level to
be achieved; the curriculum also requires that each student explore several fields of knowledge and
concentrate in one. The full requirements for the degree include meeting the minimum academic stan-
dards stated below, residing at the College, fulfilling the distribution requirement, completing a major,
and completing the physical education requirement.
The academic year is divided into two regular semesters and a Winter Study Program. The student takes
four courses in each semester and during January pursues a single program of study on a pass-fail basis.
The Winter Study Program, which began in 1967, is intended to provide students and faculty with a
dramatically different educational experience in the January term. The differences are in the nature of
the courses, the nature of the learning experience, and the change of educational pace and format from
the fall and spring semesters. These differences apply to the faculty and students in several ways: fac-
ulty can try out courses with new subjects and techniques that might, if successful, be used later in the
regular terms; they can explore subjects not amenable to inclusion in regular courses; and they can
investigate fields outside their usual areas of expertise. In their academic work, which is graded Hon-
ors, Pass, Perfunctory Pass, or Fail, students can explore new fields at low risk, concentrate on one
subject that requires a great deal of time, develop individual research projects, or work in a different
milieu (as interns, for example, or on trips outside Williamstown). In addition, Winter Study offers
studentsanopportunityformoreindependenceandinitiativeinalessformalsetting, more opportunity
to participate in cultural events, and an occasion to get to know one another better.
REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR OF ARTS DEGREE
Academic Requirement
To be eligible for the Bachelor of Arts degree a student must pass 32 regularly graded semester
courses and receive grades of C minus or higher in at least 19 of those semester courses, pass four
Winter Study Projects, fulfill the distribution requirement, complete all requirements for the major
including an average of C minus or higher, and complete the physical education requirement. Begin-
ning with the Class of 2006, students must also fulfill the quantitative/formal reasoning and writing
requirements.
Distribution Requirement
The distribution requirement falls into four parts.(Parts 3 and 4 DO NOT apply to the Class of 2004
and 2005.)
1) DIVISIONAL REQUIREMENT--designed to ensure that in their course of study at Williams,
students take an appropriately diverse distribution of courses across the full range of the curricu-
lum.
For the purposes of the divisional requirement, courses are grouped into three divisions: Divi-
sion I, Languages and the Arts; Division II, Social Studies; and Division III, Science and Mathe-
matics. A full listing of the subjects in each division appears below.
Students must complete at least three graded semester courses in each division. Two such
courses in each division must be completed by the end of the sophomore year. No more than two
of the courses used to satisfy the requirement may have the same course prefix.
Courses which fulfill the distribution requirement in Division I are designed to help students be-
come better able to respond to the arts sensitively and intelligently by learning the language,
whether verbal, visual, or musical, of a significant field of artistic expression. Students learn
how to develop the capacity for critical discussion, to increase awareness of the esthetic and
moral issues raised by works of art, and to grow in self-awareness and creativity.
Courses which fulfill the Division II requirement consider the institutions and social structures
that human beings have created, whether knowingly or unknowingly, and which in turn marked-
ly affect their lives. These courses are intended to help the students recognize, analyze, and eval-
uate these human structures in order that they may better understand themselves and the social

quirements as indicated under individual course listings.
2) PEOPLES AND CULTURES REQUIREMENT--intended to help students to begin to under-
stand the cultural diversity of American society and the world at large, so that, as citizens of an
increasingly interconnected world, they may become better able to respond sensitively and
intelligently to peoples of varied social backgrounds and cultural frameworks. Courses which
The Curriculum
­ 10 ­
fulfill this requirement are thus designed to familiarize students with some dimension of
American cultural diversity or that of the non-Western world. Each student must complete one
graded semester course primarily concerned with : (a) the peoples and cultures of North Amer-
ica that trace their origins to Africa, Asia, Latin America, Oceania, or the Caribbean; Native
American peoples and cultures; or (b) the peoples and cultures of Africa, Asia, Latin America,
Oceania, or the Caribbean. Although this course, which may be counted toward the divisional
distribution requirement, may be completed any semester before graduation, students are
urged to complete the course by the end of the sophomore year.
An asterisk following a course title indicates that the course may be used to meet the Peoples
and Cultures Distribution Requirement. A list of courses offered in 2003-2004 which meet the
requirement is on page 314.
3) QUANTITATIVE/FORMAL REASONING REQUIREMENT--intended to help students
become adept at reasoning mathematically and abstractly. The ability to apply a formal meth-
od to reach conclusions, to use numbers comfortably, and to employ the research tools neces-
sary to analyze data lessen barriers to carrying out professional and economic roles. Begin-
ning with the Class of 2006, prior to their senior year, all students must satisfactorily complete
a Quantitative/Formal Reasoning (QFR) course--those marked with a "(Q)." Students requir-
ing extra assistance (as assessed during First Days) are normally placed into Mathematics
100/101, which is to be taken before fulfilling the QFR requirement.
The hallmarks of a QFR course are the representation of facts in a language of mathematical
symbols and the use of formal rules to obtain a determinate answer. Primary evaluation in
these courses is based on multistep mathematical, statistical, or logical inference (as opposed
to descriptive answers). A list of courses offered in 2003-2004 which meet the requirement is
on page 317.
4) WRITING REQUIREMENT--Beginning with the Class of 2006, all students are required to
take two writing-intensive courses: one by the end of the sophomore year and one by the end of
the junior year. Students will benefit most from writing-intensive courses by taking them early
in their college careers and are therefore strongly encouraged to complete the requirement by
the end of the sophomore year. Courses designated as "writing intensive"--those marked with
a "(W)"--stress the process of learning to write effectively. Such courses include a substantial
amount of writing (a minimum of 20 pages), usually divided into several discrete assignments.
Instructors pay close attention to matters of style and argumentation. Enrollments are limited
to 19. A list of courses offered in 2003-2004 which meet the requirement is on page 321.
Major Requirement
The Major Requirement is designed to assure that all Williams undergraduates will have the experi-
ence of disciplined and cumulative study, carried on over an extended period of time, in some impor-
tant field of intellectual inquiry. Juniors are required to declare a major and the selection is normally
made at the time of registration in the spring of the sophomore year.
MAJOR FIELDS
Majors are offered in the following fields:
American Studies History
Anthropology Japanese
Art Literary Studies
Asian Studies Mathematics
Astronomy Music
Astrophysics Philosophy
Biology Physics
Chemistry Political Economy
Chinese Political Science
Classics (Greek, Latin) Psychology
Comparative Literature Religion
Computer Science Russian
Economics Sociology

The Curriculum
­ 11 ­
GENERAL STRUCTURE OF MAJORS
1) A student ordinarily must elect at least nine semester courses in his or her major field. A particu-
lar major may also require an additional course and/or one Winter Study Project during the junior or
senior year.
A student may also fulfill the minimum requirements for a major by taking eight semester courses
in the major field and two semester courses, approved by a major advisor, in associated fields. In inter-
departmental majors, such as Political Economy, a larger number of courses may be required.
2) A prescribed sequence of courses, supplemented by parallel courses, and including a major
seminar, is required in some major fields. Other majors ask the student to plan a sequence of elective
courses, including advanced work building on elementary courses in the field, and ending in a one- or
two- semester faculty-organized course or project in the senior year. All majors provide a system of
counseling to help students plan programs reflecting individual interests as well as disciplined and
cumulative patterns of inquiry.
Courses in many major programs require prerequisite courses in related areas. A full description of
the detailed structure of each major is found under the heading of that major.
CONTRACT MAJOR
Students who wish to undertake the coherent study of an interdisciplinary subject not covered by a
regularly offered major may propose to be contract majors. Procedures for arranging a contract major
and for honors work in such a major are described in the section, "Courses of Instruction." Students
interested in this option should begin consulting with the Dean's Office and with potential faculty ad-
visors early in the sophomore year. A student completing a contract major may not do so in conjunc-
tion with a second major. For further details, see page 132.
TWO MAJORS
A student may complete two majors with the permission of both majors and the Committee on Aca-
demic Standing. Although a student may be granted permission to use a course from one major to fulfill a
particular requirement in the other, the student nevertheless must take the minimum number of courses in
each field without counting any course twice. A student may be a candidate for Honors in either or both of
the majors, but a course for Honors in one major may not be used for an Honors course in the other.
Physical Education Requirement
The Physical Education requirement provides students the opportunity of establishing and main-
taining a general level of fitness and well-being; of developing abilities in carry-over activities; of
discovering and extending their own physical capabilities; and of developing skills in activities with
survival implications, such as swimming, life saving, and water safety.
A swim test is required of all first-year students at the start of the academic year. Students who fail
to complete the test must pass a basic swim course given in the Physical Education program during the
first quarter of the year.
Students must complete four quarters of physical education by the end of the sophomore year un-
less excused by the Dean of the College and the Director of Health. Students must enroll in at least two
different activities in fulfilling the requirement.
Participation in a fall or spring intercollegiate sport is equivalent to two activity units and participa-
tion in a winter sport is equivalent to three units. A maximum of three credits may be attained while
participating in intercollegiate sports with the exception of a two sport athlete who can fulfill the
physical education requirement by totaling four units in two sports. Students may receive a maximum
of two activity units for participation in a club sport; the remaining two units must come from the
physical education activity program.
Residence Requirement
Students who begin college at Williams must spend a minimum of six semesters in residence at Wil-
liams. Students transferring to Williams from other institutions must spend a minimum of four semesters in
residence at Williams, and those entering as sophomores are expected to spend six semesters in residence.
Students are considered to be in residence if they are taking a program of study under the direction of the
Williams College Faculty. Students must be in residence for both semesters of the final year.
The degree requirements must be completed within eight semesters, including any semesters for
which a student receives credit while not in residence at Williams. Thus, semesters spent away on
exchange or other approved programs at other colleges are included in the eight semesters. Similarly,
if a student requests, and the Committee on Academic Standing grants, degree credit based on Ad-
vanced Placement scores, then these semesters are also included in the limit of eight.

ADDITIONAL CURRICULAR OPPORTUNITIES
Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate
At the discretion of the appropriate departments or programs, students presenting satisfactory
scores in Advanced Placement tests or International Baccalaureate higher level examinations may be
placed in advanced courses not regularly open to them and/or may receive course credit toward the
major or concentration. Therefore, if granted, this credit may be used as a prerequisite or in partial
fulfillment of the major or concentration requirements. AP and IB credit, however, may not be used to
reduce the normal course load of any semester, to make up a deficiency incurred at Williams, or to
satisfy the Distribution Requirement.
For members of the Class of 2007 or earlier, AP or IB credit (if in two or more subjects) may also be
used for acceleration, i.e. completion of the degree in fewer than four years. Starting with the Class of
2008, this option will not be available.
Certificate in European Languages
Students may pursue a Certificate in three European languages offered at Williams (German, Rus-
sian, and Spanish). The program certifies a particular degree of proficiency, cultural literacy, and ex-
perience with the language in the context of one's college education. In order to gain the proficiency
and experience certified by the program, students must have taken a) at least five semesters of college
language (or the equivalent) and b) a standardized proficiency test administered by the departments.
In addition, students are required to gain familiarity with the culture in question by taking at least one
course each in a) the literature, music, art, or philosophy, and b) the history, economics, or politics of
the cultural area. Students must take seven courses altogether, up to two of which may be taken
abroad. Please refer to the respective language programs for details on the specific certificates.
Combined Program in Liberal Arts and Engineering
The 3-2 program enables qualified students to combine a liberal arts education at Williams with
undergraduate professional training in engineering. In this program, a student studies at Williams for
3 years, completing 24 courses and 3 Winter Study Projects. He or she then transfers to a leading engi-
neering school and studies for a Bachelor of Science degree, usually for 2 more years. Upon success-
ful completion of this program, the student receives a Bachelor of Arts degree from Williams and a
Bachelor of Science degree from the engineering school. For students majoring in physics, chemistry,
computer science, or mathematics at Williams, the requirements for the senior year courses and major
exercise are waived for the Williams degree. Only students who have taken the prerequisite courses,
who have at least a B average in scientific subjects, and who have a good record in other subjects will
be recommended by their major department and approved by the Committee on Academic Standing
for this program.
Williams has a formal agreement that simplifies the application process to the 3-2 engineering pro-
gram at Columbia University. Other engineering schools offer 3-2 programs which might be ap-
proved on a case-by-case basis. All engineering schools expect that 3-2 students will have completed
several science and mathematics courses at Williams, so it is necessary to plan course selections care-
fully. The booklet "Choosing First Year Courses" includes a list of Williams courses recommended to
prospective engineers.
The 3-2 program offers an established route to entry-level employment as an engineer. In recent
years, however, most Williams students have chosen to complete the Williams B.A. in the usual 4
years and then go to graduate programs in engineering. Please see the section of this catalog titled
"Preparation for Graduate and Professional Study." Also, prospective engineers at Williams have the
opportunity to take undergraduate engineering courses at other institutions through various exchange
programs. For information about these opportunities, please see the section titled "Exchange Pro-
grams."
The pre-engineering advisor, Professor Jefferson Strait (fall semester) or Professor Sarah Bolton
(spring semester), will be happy to assist students interested in any of the options leading to engineer-
ing careers.
Co-ordinate Programs Offering Concentrations
In addition to majoring in a field, a student may choose to concentrate elective courses on a single
topic or area. Normally, a student declares a concentration at the time of registration in the spring of
the sophomore year. Concentrations are offered in the following programs:
The Curriculum
­ 13 ­
African and Middle-Eastern Studies
African-American Studies
Biochemistry and Molecular Biology
Cognitive Science
Environmental Studies
Leadership Studies
Legal Studies
Neuroscience
Science and Technology Studies
Descriptions of these programs appear under the appropriate heading in this publication. If the co-
ordinate program courses are directly related to the major, a student may be allowed to reduce the
number of courses required to complete the major.
Co-ordinate Programs
A number of programs do not formally offer concentrations, but do provide students with the op-
portunity to work in areas that cut across departmental and program lines. These are: Latin-American
Studies, Materials Science Studies, and Performance Studies. They are listed in this publication in
alphabetical order.
These programs provide educational guidance only, and will not appear on a student's transcript.
The Critical Reasoning and Analytical Skills (CRAAS) Initiative
To one degree or another, every class at Williams goes beyond its subject--be it mathematics, Ma-
chiavelli, or modernism--to teach intellectual skills that have wide application in other fields as well
as outside of the academy: scientific reckoning, expository writing, rhetorical analysis, oral presenta-
tion, and so on.
Courses offered under the CRAAS initiative foreground such analytical skills. While each CRAAS
class covers a different topic, all are aimed particularly at developing the processes necessary for ex-
cellence in a range of fields: techniques for analyzing ideas, data, texts or artworks; approaches to
interpreting, synthesizing, and developing arguments; strategies for presenting ideas and results.
CRAAS classes typically emphasize the practices of meta-analysis--self-criticism, editing, and re-
vision--with the goal of constant improvement. Many classes feature peer tutoring, small group
work, and intensive one-on-one engagement with the professor. Students should leave a CRAAS
course with a substantially heightened ability to approach problems, analyze texts, and craft argu-
ments in whatever discipline they may go on to explore.
A few CRAAS courses are restricted to advanced students, but the majority are open to all, and
some are specifically targeted for first -year students. Most have strictly limited enrollment. Because
these classes cultivate the general strategies of effective scholarship, students are encouraged to con-
sider taking a CRAAS course early in their academic careers.
A list of CRAAS courses offered in 2003-2004 is on page 313.
Cross-Enrollment Programs
A limited number of students may register at Bennington College or Massachusetts College of Lib-
eral Arts for courses not offered by Williams. Interested students should contact the Registrar's Office
about arrangements.
Exchange Programs
The Twelve College Exchange Program includes Amherst, Bowdoin, Connecticut College, Dart-
mouth, Mount Holyoke, Smith, Trinity, Vassar, Wellesley, Wesleyan, Wheaton, and, for a semester
program, the National Theatre Institute, in Waterford, Connecticut. In addition, the College maintains
an exchange with California Institute of Technology, Howard University, Fisk University, the Thayer
School of Engineering at Dartmouth, and with Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.
Information on the programs and copies of the participating schools' catalogs are available at the
Dean's Office. Application deadline is in February of the preceding academic year.
Experiential Education at Williams
Experiential education involving "learning by doing" outside the classroom has been a relatively
understated but successful part of the Williams curriculum for a number of years. In addition to the use
of traditional laboratory work in the natural sciences and studio work in art, more faculty have been
challenging students to become more personally engaged in the Williams curriculum through field
The Curriculum
­ 14 ­
work whether in the form of research, sustained work on special projects or through placement with
community organizations. Courses with an experiential learning component provide students with
opportunities to encounter firsthand the issues that they read and study about, requiring them to apply
academic learning to nonacademic settings and challenging them to use their experiences in those
settings to think more critically and deeply about what they are studying.
Courses involving experiential learning as defined above, range from fully integrated off-campus
programs such as the Williams-Mystic Maritime Studies Program (page 330) to courses involving
one small field research project. The amount and nature of the experiential component(s) will vary
according to the instructor's judgement. See page 313 for a list of 2003-2004 courses involving expe-
riential education.
A range of non-credit experiential education opportunities is also available to interested stu-
dents. Community service, internships, research, and the Museum Associates Program of the Wil-
liams College Museum of Art all provide students the chance to "learn by doing" outside the class-
room. Information on each of these non-credit forms of experiential learning is provided below.
Community Service:
Opportunities to put creative energy and initiative to use abound in community organizations in
the Williams College area. Service ranges from well-known work such as tutoring or building
homes with Habitat for Humanity, to working with newer, developing non-profit organizations
such as Chrysalis, an advanced stage AIDS residence. For more information, go to the Lehman
Community Service Council homepage on the College website at <http://wso.williams.edu:
8000/orgs/lehman/> or contact College Chaplain and Coordinator of Community Service, Rick
Spalding (Richard.E.Spalding@williams.edu).
Internships and Research Opportunities:
A wide variety of summer internship opportunities is available to interested students through the
Office of Career Counseling (OCC) and the Center for Environmental Studies (CES). Research work
opportunities are also available through individual departments.
Information regarding OCC's Williams College Alumni Sponsored Summer Internships can be
found at http://www.williams.edu/admin-depts/occ/ or by contacting Ron Gallagher, Program
Counselor at the Office of Career Counseling, Stetson Hall (Ronald.L.Gallagher@williams.edu).
Information regarding CES's summer internship and research opportunities can be found at
www.williams.edu/CES/resources/summeropps.htm or by contacting Sarah Gardner, Assistant
Director of the Center for Environmental Studies, Kellogg House (Sarah.S.Gardner@williams.e-
du). Information about research opportunities sponsored by individual departments is available
from Department Chairs.
Museum Associates:
The Museum Associates Program of the Williams College Museum of Art provides students an
opportunity to broaden their knowledge of art and art history, to learn about the field of museum
education, and to develop valuable communication and public speaking skills while working with
the public. The only academic requirement is the completion of ArtH 101-102. Applications are
accepted every spring. For more information, contact Barbara Robertson, Director of Education at
x2038 or by e-mail at broberts@williams.edu.
For more information about experiential education in general, contact Paula Consolini, Coordi-
nator of Experiential Education (pconsoli@williams.edu).
Honors Program
Williams awards the degree with Honors to those students who have demonstrated imagination,
initiative, and intellectual independence within the major. The Honors program requires two or three
courses constituting a clearly interrelated pattern of study, whether in the form of a thesis, specializa-
tion within the major, or interdisciplinary study with courses from other programs or departments. At
least one of the courses must be in addition to the minimum number required for the major; one may
be a Winter Study Project. A student who is a double major may be a candidate for Honors in either or
both of the majors, but a course for Honors in one major may not be used as an Honors course in the
other. Some programs also award honors for their concentrations.
Individual departments and programs describe special criteria, procedures, and patterns of study
for Honors in the "Courses of Instruction" section. Students should consult with their departments on
The Curriculum
­ 15 ­
their Honors options prior to the senior year. Before the student has begun the last of the required
course units, the department or program determines whether the student is admitted to Honors candi-
dacy. The degree is awarded with Honors or Highest Honors at the end of the senior year if, in the
judgment of the department, its criteria of excellence have been met.
Independent Study
When a particularly able student wishes to pursue the study of a subject not covered by the normal
course offerings of the College, arrangements may be made for him or her to undertake courses of
independent study under faculty supervision. Arrangements for independent study are made with the
appropriate department at the time of registration.
Study Away from Williams
Students may receive credit for work completed at other institutions or programs.Applicationsfor
study elsewhere require the approval of the chair of the student's major, the Dean's Office, and the
Committee on Academic Standing. Students studying away during the junior year should have al-
ready completed the physical education requirement, at least two courses in each division toward the
divisional distribution requirement, and the writing and quantitative/formal reasoning requirements if
applicable. Courses completed while away may be used toward the major with permission of the de-
partment or program and/or to fulfill the peoples and cultures requirement with permission of CAS.
All other degree requirements must be met with courses taken under the supervision of Williams fac-
ulty.
Williams participates in study abroad programs in Spain and France (in cooperation with Hamilton
College); in China (as part of the Associated Colleges in China); in Sweden (in cooperation with
twelve other colleges and the University of Stockholm); in Denmark (with the University of Copen-
hagen Danish International Studies); and in Kyoto (the Associated Kyoto Program,run byagroupof
elevencolleges). Williams students may also receive credit for approved programs at a wide variety of
other institutions, or for work done directly in a foreign university or accredited four-year American
university if acceptable evaluation is possible. Students interested in study away should consult the
Dean's Office. Students must submit a pink petition and essay to the Dean's Office by March of the
preceding academic year for which they wish to study off campus. Students must be in good academic
standing with no deficiencies and follow the procedures as set out in the Guide to Study Abroad.
The Williams Tutorial Program
The Tutorial Program offers Williams students a distinctive opportunity to take a heightened form
of responsibility for their own intellectual development. No student is required to take a tutorial
course, but any student with the appropriate qualifications and interests is invited to do so.
Tutorials at the 100/200 level are designed primarily for sophomores; sophomores are usually giv-
en enrollment preference for such courses, though interested juniors and seniors (and, in some cases,
first-year students) are often welcome. Tutorials at the 300/400 level are designed primarily for jun-
iors and seniors (and, often, for majors in the discipline); first-year students and sophomores are wel-
come to apply, but are urged to consult the instructor before registering.
Tutorials place much greater weight than do regular courses--or even small seminars--on student
participation. They aim to teach students how to develop and present arguments; listen carefully, and
then refine their positions in the context of a challenging discussion; and respond quickly and cogent-
ly to critiques of their work. Tutorials place particular emphasis on developing analytical skills, writ-
ing abilities, and the talents of engaging in rigorous conversation and oral debate.
The ways in which particular tutorials are conducted vary across the disciplines, but here is a de-
scription of how most tutorials at Williams are organized. Tutorials are usually limited to ten students.
At the start of term, the instructor divides the students into pairs. Each pair meets weekly with the
instructor for roughly one hour. Many tutorial courses begin and end the term with a group seminar,
and in a few departments, instructors hold weekly group meetings of all tutorial members to provide
background information designed to facilitate the students' independent work. But the heart of every
tutorial course is the weekly meeting of the two students with the instructor.
At these weekly meetings, one student delivers a prepared essay or presentation (e.g., an analysis of
a text or work of art, a discussion of a problem set, a report on laboratory exercises, etc.) pertaining to
the assignment for that week, while the other student--and then the instructor--offer a critique. In the
following week, students switch roles. Typically, students write five or six essays (usually in the range
of 4-7 pages) during the term, and offer five or six critiques of their partners' work.
Since the program's inception in 1988, students have ranked tutorials among the most demand-
ing--and rewarding--courses they have taken at Williams. While not designed to be more difficult
The Curriculum
­ 16 ­
than other courses, tutorials are nonetheless challenging, with frequent writing assignments and the
expectation that students will be well prepared to participate actively and effectively in weekly discus-
sions. At the same time, students have consistently placed tutorials among the most enriching and
consequential courses they have taken. They have appreciated the close attention to their writing and
argumentation skills; the opportunity to be held accountable, in a detailed way, for the extended im-
plications of their ideas; the chance to develop their oral abilities as they engage in debate; and the
close intellectual bonds tutorials build between teachers and students, and students with each other.
Many students have formed important advising and mentoring relationships with their tutorial teach-
ers.
Registration information: Students register for tutorials as they would for any other course (but
should first check the description for prerequisites and to see if permission of the instructor is re-
quired). (2) Because of limited enrollments and the special arrangements involved in organizing tuto-
rials, students are encouraged to determine, as early as possible, their interest in and commitment to
the course. Students may not drop or add a tutorial after the first week of class. (3) Tutorials may not be
taken on a pass/fail basis.
More information: Please see page 320 of this catalog for a list of tutorials offered in 2003-2004.
Students may obtain detailed information about particular tutorials from the course descriptions and
the instructors. (All tutorials have a "T" after the course number.) For general information, advice, or
suggestions about the program, please contact Professor Stephen Fix, Tutorial Program Director, in
Stetson.
Williams-Exeter Programme at Oxford University
Williams offers a year-long programme of studies at Oxford University in cooperation with Exeter Col-
lege, Oxford. Based at Ephraim Williams House, Williams' study center at Oxford, the Programme is de-
signed to offer the fullest possible integration of the students into the intellectual and social life of one of the
world's great universities. It makes full use of the Oxford tutorial system and the Oxford three-term calen-
dar is followed.
In addition to extensive opportunities to pursue British and Commonwealth studies, the Pro-
gramme also offers instruction in other fields for which Oxford is particularly noted or which are rep-
resented only marginally or infrequently in the Williams curriculum. Interested students should con-
sult the Dean's Office and the "Courses of Instruction" section of this catalog.
Williams-Mystic Maritime Studies Program
The William-Mystic Seaport Maritime Studies Program offers students a unique opportunity to
explore the ocean, to travel the Atlantic and Pacific Coasts, and to undertake original research of their
own design in the humanities and sciences. A term at Williams-Mystic satisfies both a semester's
credit and one winter study requirement, as well as intensive writing course credit. Four Williams
courses are offered as an integrated, multidisciplinary curriculum in the semester-long program at
Mystic Seaport, in Mystic, Connecticut: Maritime History, Literature of the Sea, Marine Policy, and
either Marine Ecology or Oceanography (see the American Maritime Studies section in this catalog).
Williams College faculty members serve as the Director and Marine Scientist. Travel includes an off-
shore voyage on the open ocean sailing aboard a tall ship, a seminar along the Pacific Coast, and a
seminar on Nantucket Island, all of which are cross-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary exercises. Stu-
dents live in historic, cooperative, coed houses at Mystic Seaport, the world's largest maritime mu-
seum, and have full access to world-class maritime collections, a maritime library, well-equipped lab-
oratory, and diverse coastal habitats (where field research can be undertaken in a wide variety of envi-
ronments, ranging from tidepools and salt marshes to sandy beaches and estuaries). Students also par-
ticipate in maritime skills under professional instruction, with choices such as celestial navigation,
maritime art, music of the sea, boat building, or small boat handling and sailing. Williams-Mystic
seeks candidates who are willing to try new things and work in a compelling academic environment.
No sailing experience necessary, and all majors welcome--a typical semester at Williams-Mystic is
represented by 12 to 14 different majors spanning the sciences and humanities. Sophomores, juniors,
and seniors can attend. Interested students should contact Williams-Mystic at admissions@williams-
mystic.org, call (860-572- 5359), visit the website (williamsmystic.org), or obtain a Williams-Mystic
catalog from the Dean's office. Applications are on the web and at the Dean's office. Financial aid and
scholarships are available.

ACADEMIC STANDARDS AND REGULATIONS
Attendance
In order to give students a larger share of responsibility for their own education, Williams College does
not administer a general system of required classroom attendance. The College expects students to make
full use of their educational opportunities by regular class attendance and to assume the academic risks
incurred by absences.
Although no formal system of class attendance is maintained by the College, instructors may set such
standards of attendance as they feel are necessary for the satisfactory conduct of their courses. Students
who fail to meet these standards may be warned by the instructor and notice sent to the Dean that continued
absence will result in their being dropped from the course. A failing grade will be assigned to any course
dropped after the regular course change period. Students who do not attend the first class meeting in a
semester course or Winter Study Project may be required to withdraw by the instructor. Attendance is re-
quired at announced tests and final examinations unless the student is specifically excused by the instructor
or the Dean's Office. Satisfactory attendance in four quarters of activities approved by the Department of
Physical Education is required except for students excused by the Dean and the Director of Health.
Registration
Registration for fall and spring semesters and for the Winter Study Program takes place at designated
periods during the academic year. There may be a $5 per day processing fee for any registration changes
accepted after the announced deadlines.
New students register by mail in early summer; soon after arrival at Williams, they meet with their as-
signed Academic Advisors to discuss the curriculum and their course selections. All course changes for
new students are made with the approval of the Faculty Advisors. During the first two years of study, stu-
dents are limited in the number of courses they may take in one department or subject each semester. For
full details, see pages 44-45.
Course Change Period
Course changes may be made during a designated period at the beginning of each semester. No course
changes may be made after that period except with the approval of the Committee on Academic Standing,
after consultation with the Dean's Office. During Winter Study, a second Winter Study Project may be
added if the instructor approves but the original Project may not be dropped. A processing fee of $5 per day
may be assessed for each course change accepted after the announced deadline.
First-year and first-semester transfer students may be permitted to withdraw from one course (incurring
a deficiency but no grade penalty) as late as the tenth week of the semester. Upperclass students also may
once in subsequent years withdraw from a course under the same conditions. A withdrawal, recorded on
the transcript as a "W," is granted only with the approval of the instructor and a dean and only if there is
complete agreement between the instructor and the dean that, despite conscientious effort to do the work,
continuation in the course would be detrimental to the overall educational interest or health of the student.
The deficiency thereby incurred must be removed in the normal manner. See references to making up defi-
ciencies on page 19.
Course Load
Students are required to take and complete four courses each semester. In exceptional cases, students
may, upon petition to the Committee on Academic Standing and with departmental approval at the time of
registration, elect a pattern of five semester courses in the fall semester and three in the spring or three in the
fall and five in the spring; a pass-fail course cannot be used as the fifth course in this pattern.
If a student with a disability believes that he/she is unable to pursue a full course of study, the student
may petition the Disabilities and Accommodations Advisory Group for permission to pursue a reduced
course load. Such a petition must be accompanied by a professional evaluation which addresses the stu-
dent's inability to maintain a full course of study and discusses the rationale for a reduced course load.
Upon consideration of a student's petition and supporting documentation, the Disabilities and Accom-
modations Advisory Group makes a recommendation to the Committee on Academic Standing which
renders decisions. Such cases are considered on an individual basis and may be initiated at any time during
the student's tenure at Williams.
Academic Standards and Regulations

Fifth Course Pass-Fail Option
Except in the case of the unbalanced course program described above, a student may, at the beginning of
any semester, enroll in a fifth course that must be specified as the pass-fail course. By the sixth week, a
student must decide whether to continue the course, and if so, whether on a pass-fail or regularly graded
basis. A form for designating the option chosen will be sent from the Registrar's Office. A processing fee
of $5 per day assessed for 5th course grading option designations accepted after the announced deadline. A
course graded "Pass" may not be used as one of the thirty-two semester courses required to complete the
degree, to fulfill distribution or major requirements, or to make up a deficiency. A pass-fail course con-
verted to a fifth regularly graded course may be used to fulfill distribution or major requirements or to make
up a deficiency incurred in a prior term. The grade received will be included in the calculation of the stu-
dent's cumulative grade-point average.
Winter Study Project
Students must take and pass a Winter Study Project in each of their four years. Winter Study Projects are
graded Honors, Pass, Perfunctory Pass, or Fail. All work for Winter Study Projects must be submitted by
the last day of the Winter Study Program; work may be accepted after this date only with the permission of
a dean. Students who fail their Winter Study Projects will be placed on Academic Probation by the Com-
mittee on Academic Standing and will be required to make up the deficiency (see page 19). Students who
fail through gross neglect of work will normally be required to resign. A student who receives a second
Perfunctory Pass grade in Winter Study will be required to pass a fifth course, which may be graded on the
regular A-E or pass/fail basis, in the following spring or fall semester.
Grading System and Records
Williams uses the following system of grades: A, excellent; B, good; C, fair; D, passing; E, failing.
These letters, with plus and minus value, have the following numerical equivalents in calculating grade
averages:
A+ = 4.33 B+ = 3.33 C+ = 2.33 D+ = 1.33
A = 4.00 B = 3.00 C = 2.00 D = 1.00 E = 0
A­ = 3.67 B­ = 2.67 C­ = 1.67 D­ = 0.67
A permanent record of each student's grades is kept and this official record forms the basis for any aca-
demic action by the College.
A transcript of a student's cumulative academic record is available from the Registrar's Office upon
written request. Transcripts will not be issued for students who are in financial arrears.
Provisions relating to student records, access to them, and safeguards on their use are in the Student
Handbook.
First-Year Student Warnings
In the middle of each semester, instructors report to the Registrar those first-year students whose grades
at that time are unsatisfactory. The students and their academic advisors receive notices of warnings as a
matter of routine. The Dean's Office will inform parents of students who receive two or more warnings
unless instructed not to do so by the student within three working days of the receipt of the warnings.
Extensions of Deadlines
Deadlines for course work are set by the instructor with the following limitations:
 for courses with final exams, the latest that written work may be due is 5:00 p.m. on the last
day of reading period.
 for courses without final exams, the latest that written work may be due is 5:00 pm. on the
third-to-last day of the exam period.
If work is due before these deadlines, the instructor may grant an extension up to these deadlines solely
at his or her discretion. Short extensions beyond these deadlines may be granted by a dean but only with the
concurrence of the instructor. No extensions will be granted beyond the examination period except in the
case of serious illness.
Instructors may require students who have missed announced quizzes or hour tests to present satis-
factory explanations to a dean before they are permitted to make up the exercises.
Academic Standards and Regulations
­ 19 ­
If a student is absent from a final examination, a make-up examination may be given only with the
permission of a dean and at a time determined by the dean.
Deficiencies
A student receives credit for a course by obtaining a grade of at least D minus. If the student fails a
course, he or she must make up the deficiency.
If a failure occurs in the first semester of a full-year course, the student may, with the consent of the
instructor, continue the course and receive credit for the second semester only. If a failure occurs in the
second semester of a full-year course, credit for passing the first semester may be retained only with the
approval of the Committee on Academic Standing.
A senior who incurs a failure in the first semester in a required major course may be dropped from the
College at midyear.
Normally deficiencies can be made up only by courses taken after the deficiencies have been incurred.
A student must make up a deficiency in one of these ways:
1) obtain a grade of at least C minus in a summer school course, approved in advance by the Registrar,
at a regionally accredited four-year college or university; (The grade will not, however, be included
in the calculation of the student's cumulative grade point average.)
2) pass an extra graded course at Williams in the semester following the failure;
3) in the case of afirst-semester failure ofayear-long language course, obtainagrade of at leastaCminus
in the work of the second semester of that course. The failure for the first semester will, however, re-
main on the student's record and will be included in the cumulative grade point average.
A deficiency must normally be made up before the start of the following academic year, or in the case of
a deficiency incurred in the spring semester, no later than the following fall semester. A student may, in
consultation with the Dean's Office, petition the Committee on Academic Standing with an alternate plan.
Separation for Low Scholarship
It is the policy of Williams College not to permit a student to remain in residence after it has become
evident that he or she is either unable or unwilling to maintain reasonable standards of academic achieve-
ment. At the end of each term, the Committee on Academic Standing reviews all academic records that fail
to meet the following minimum academic requirements:
For first-year students: Three grades of C minus or better and no failures each semester, and
at least Perfunctory Pass on the Winter Study Project
For upperclass students: Four grades of C minus or better each semester, and
at least Perfunctory Pass on the Winter Study Project
Students whose records fail to meet these minimum academic requirements or whose records otherwise
fail to show adequate progress may receive an academic warning, be placed on academic probation, or be
required to resign.
Students who are required to resign from the College for academic reasons are normally not permitted to
return for at least one year from the date of their resignation. A student who has been required to resign
from the College may petition the Committee on Academic Standing through the Dean for reinstatement
on two conditions only: all deficiencies must have been made up and a letter submitted to the Committee
that offers convincing evidence that the student is ready and able to complete work toward a degree at
Williams without further interruption.
When required to resign, students must vacate their rooms promptly. Financial aid students must also
see the Director of Financial Aid before leaving to discuss loan repayment and renewal of aid in the event
of readmission.
A student who fails to meet minimum academic standards in his or her final semester at Williams may
be required by the Committee on Academic Standing to meet them by earning grades of at least C minus
elsewhere before the B.A. will be awarded. If such work is required, it must be completed within three
years unless stipulated otherwise, and the courses must be approved in advance by the Registrar.
Academic Standards and Regulations
­ 20 ­
Withdrawal from the College in Good Standing
Students in good standing occasionally wish to take a personal leave of absence from the College. Stu-
dents wishing to leave the College should discuss their plans with the Associate Dean before departure;
they must submit a letter requesting permission to withdraw, pay all College bills, and vacate their rooms
promptly. Financial aid students must also meet with a representative in the Office of Financial Aid before
leaving to discuss loan repayment and renewal of aid upon return.
Normally, a student may not voluntarily withdraw from the College in good academic standing after the
eighth week of each semester. After that date, a student is expected to complete the work of the semester,
and grades will be recorded for each course in which he or she is enrolled.
A withdrawal is granted by the Associate Dean for a period of at least a full year and up to three years.
Students who leave in good standing may return with the approval of the Associate Dean. Upon return,
students are expected to complete degree requirements without further interruption.
Refunds
Payment refund or credit in the event of withdrawal is described on page 27.
Eligibility for and Completion of Majors
To be eligible for any major, students must have received grades of C minus or better in each course in
the major taken in the first two years of college and Honors or Pass on any Winter Study Project taken in
that department. A senior may enter a major only upon the approval of the department chair and the Com-
mittee on Academic Standing.
In addition to passing each major course and, where required, a major Winter Study Project, the student
must maintain an average in the major of 1.67 or higher. Seniors who have an average below 1.67 in the
major field will normally not be allowed to continue. A senior who receives a grade of E in the first semes-
ter of a required major course may be dropped from the College at mid-year. A student who falls below
these standards may continue in the major only with the approval of the Committee on Academic Stand-
ing.
A senior major exercise is not required by every department but is by some. All departments requiring
such an exercise specify it as such in the description of their major programs in the "Courses of Instruction"
section, and all students in those departments must complete the exercise satisfactorily.
Eligibility for Extracurricular Activities
A student is eligible to represent the College in any athletic, dramatic, literary, or musical event and be in
the student government, or other organization as a member, substitute, or officer, unless he or she is de-
clared ineligible:
1) by the Dean;
2) by vote of the Discipline Committee; or
3) by vote of the Committee on Academic Standing because of a dangerously low record.
The Student Honor Committee may recommend to the Dean loss of eligibility as a penalty for a viola-
tion of the Honor Code.
Dean's List
All students who attain a semester average of 3.50 or higher in a program of four or more courses are
placed on the Dean's List for that semester.
Phi Beta Kappa Society
Students of the highest academic standing are eligible for election to membership in the Phi Beta Kappa
Society in accordance with the following rules:
1) The requirements for election to membership shall be a grade point average of 3.3 and Honors or
Pass in all required Winter Study Projects. There shall be two elections of new members for each class, at
the end of the junior and senior years.
2) At the end of the junior year, all students in the highest five percent of the class, ranked by cumulative
grade point average, shall be eligible for election provided they have met the requirements and have com-
pleted enough courses to be considered candidates for the B.A. degree in the following year. A student who
leaves Williams at the end of the junior year to attend graduate school may be elected under the above
procedures.
Academic Standards and Regulations
­ 21 ­
At the end of the senior year, all students not yet elected and in the highest 12.5 per cent of the class,
ranked by cumulative grade point average, shall be eligible for election provided they have met the require-
ments.
3) Students shall be eligible for election only if they have been students at Williams College for at least
two years.
4) Honorary members may be elected from distinguished alumni of at least twenty years' standing. No
more than one such member shall be elected each year.
5) Any student who shall have gained his or her rank by unfair means or who in the judgment of the
Dean of the College is not of good moral character is ineligible to election.
6) The name of a member elect shall be entered on the roll only after he or she has accepted the election
and has paid to the Treasurer the regular entrance fee.
7) Any undergraduate member who withdraws from the College before graduation or who falls short of
the minimum Phi Beta Kappa scholastic standing may, upon a two-thirds vote of the members present at
the annual meeting, be deprived of membership in the society.
8) Any undergraduate member who is expelled from the College shall be deprived of membership in
the Society.
9) While connected with Williams College as an officer of instruction or administration, any graduate of
Williams College who is a member of another chapter of Phi Beta Kappa shall be considered a regular
member of the Williams chapter.
10) While connected with Williams College as professor, associate professor or assistant professor, or
an officer of administration, any member of another chapter of Phi Beta Kappa shall have all the privileges
of the Williams chapter, including holding office and voting. While connected with Williams College, any
other officer of instruction or administration who is a member of another chapter shall have all the privi-
leges of the Williams chapter, except holding office and voting.
Awarding of Degrees
By vote of the Trustees, the degree of Bachelor of Arts is conferred at Commencement upon students
who have completed the requirements as to courses and grades to the satisfaction of the Faculty. The right
to a degree may, however, be forfeited by misconduct at any time prior to the conferring of the degree. No
degree in absentia will be conferred except by special vote of the Trustees on petition presented to the
Dean. Diplomas will not be authorized for students who have not paid College charges or have not re-
turned all books belonging to the library.
Graduation with Distinction
The Faculty will recommend to the Trustees that the degree of Bachelor of Arts with distinction be con-
ferred upon those members of the graduating class who have passed all Winter Study Projects and obtained
a four year average in the top:
35% of the graduating class -- Bachelor of Arts cum laude or higher
15% of the graduating class -- Bachelor of Arts magna cum laude or higher
2% of the graduating class -- Bachelor of Arts summa cum laude
­ 22 ­
ACADEMIC ADVISING
A variety of academic advice and counsel is provided to students during the course of their undergradu-
ate education. Instructors, departmental and administrative officers, and some special programs are avail-
able to help students explore and develop their academic interests and talents and take advantage of aca-
demic opportunities available through the College.
In the first year each student is assigned an academic advisor from the faculty or staff. This advisor
discusses course choices and academic requirements with the student. The Dean's Office coordinates this
advising program, reviews the academic progress of individual students, and--when appropriate--calls
students in to discuss their situations.
In the sophomore year, students may seek advice from deans, former advisors, and instructors, along
with preprofessional and other special advisors (see page 411). Sophomores are also encouraged to discuss
major options and requirements with faculty members from departments and programs in which they have
an interest before declaring a major in the spring semester.
The student-run Senior Advisor program provides additional advice and information for sophomore
students in particular, as well as for first-year students and any others with questions about particular
courses, departments, majors, or areas of study. Senior Advisors are nominated by departments and pro-
grams from among the year's senior majors. During the course of the year the Senior Advisors hold several
Course and Majors Fairs, keep informed about any changes in faculty and curriculum in their departments,
and generally make themselves available for consultation by students.
In the junior and senior years students are advised by faculty from their major departments or programs.
Each department or program determines its own advising system for its majors, although chairs are regu-
larly available for consultation.
ACADEMIC ASSISTANCE
Additional programs of academic assistance are also available through the Dean's Office. After confer-
ring with the instructor, a student needing extra help in a particular course may request a tutor recom-
mended to the Dean's Office by the department; costs of this tutoring are covered by the Dean's Office.
Students seeking to improve their writing skills in any course may take advantage of the Writing Workshop.
Trained and supervised by a coordinator, student writing tutors provide help with problems on papers al-
ready corrected and with drafts of papers in progress. The Math and Science Resource Center, a drop-in
help center staffed by student tutors, is also available to students of Biology 101, 102 and 202, Chemistry
151, 153, 155, 251, and 255, Mathematics 100, 101, 103, 104 and 105, Physics 131, 132, 141 and 142, and
Statistics 101 and 201.
EXCHANGE AND STUDY ABROAD
Advising of exchange students and of Williams students wishing to study abroad in the junior year is
coordinated by the Dean's Office. Special orientation and information meetings are held during the fall
semester for new students and for students wishing to study abroad. Orientation and counseling of interna-
tional students is arranged by the International Student Advisor in the Dean's Office.
POSTGRADUATE AND PROFESSIONAL STUDY

­ 23 ­
ACADEMIC HONESTY
All students are expected to be familiar with the Williams College Honor Code and to reaffirm their
commitment to the Statement of Academic Honesty by signing an Honor Code Pledge at the beginning of
each academic year. The Honor Code covers all aspects of academic honesty, including the writing of pa-
pers and laboratory reports as well as all quizzes, homework assignments, hour tests, and examinations.
Statement of Academic Honesty
As an institution fundamentally concerned with the free exchange of ideas, Williams College has al-
ways depended on the academic integrity of each of its members. In the spirit of this free exchange, the
students and faculty of Williams recognize the necessity and accept the responsibility for academic hones-
ty.
A student who enrolls at the College thereby agrees to respect and acknowledge the research and ideas
of others in his or her work and to abide by those regulations governing work stipulated by the instructor.
Any student who breaks these regulations, misrepresents his or her own work, or collaborates in the mis-
representation of another's work has committed a serious violation of this agreement.
Students and faculty are to report violations and alleged violations of this agreement. Such reports are to
be submitted to the Student Honor Committee, consisting of eight student members of the joint Faculty-
Student Honor System-Discipline Committee. This committee is responsible for determining the guilt or
innocence of the accused person or persons, and for recommending appropriate punishments to the Dean.
A committee of faculty members to be designated by the Faculty will sit with the Student Honor Commit-
tee in an advisory capacity.
A quorum of three-quarters shall be required for the Committee to meet. A vote of guilty by at least
three-quarters of those present is necessary for conviction. A recommendation for dismissal must be made
by unanimous vote of those present, and shall be carried out only with the assent of the President of the
College.
The Committee is responsible for informing the student body of the meaning and implications of this
statement. The aforementioned faculty committee shall be responsible for informing faculty members of
the meaning and implications of this statement.
Any amendments to this statement must be made through a student referendum in which two-thirds of
the student body votes, and in which two-thirds of those voting vote for the amendment. These alterations
must be ratified by the Faculty.
Adopted 1971
Guidelines
Instructors are encouraged to submit to the Honor Committee a written statement defining how the
Statement of Academic Honesty applies to their courses or laboratories, and to explain such guidelines to
their students. Instructors may set any type of final examination or hour test, ranging from closed-book,
alternate-seating classroom exercises to open-book, "take-home" examinations or papers, and any require-
ments for laboratory exercises. Some instructors encourage cooperation among students but others do not.
If a student is unsure how the Honor Code applies in a particular situation, it is ultimately the student's
responsibility to find out from his or her professor, or from a member of the Honor Committee, how the
Honor Code applies in that situation. An open and highly individualized system can last only as long as
both the students and the faculty work together to create a true academic community.
In written material, students are expected to avoid the possibility of even unintentional plagiarism by
acknowledging the sources of their work. Careful observance of accepted standards of reference and
attribution is required. The basic rules are summarized below. Students are further advised to consult a
recognized style manual to learn how to acknowledge sources correctly. While academic honesty does not
demand a footnote on statements of common fact, it does require that a student provide clear footnotes or
other appropriate documentation and give credit in the bibliography to ideas, interpretations, and facts that
particular sources have contributed to the student's final work.
Academic Honesty
­ 24 ­
The basic rules of attribution require that:
1) A direct quotation (whether a single word or a phrase, sentence, paragraph, or series of paragraphs)
must always be identified by quotation marks, by indenting and single spacing, or by reduced type size of
the quoted material, and a note must be used to state the exact source.
2) A paraphrase of the work of another must be acknowledged as such by a note stating the source.
3) Indebtedness to the specific ideas of others, or the summarizing of several pages, even though ex-
pressed in different words, must be acknowledged by a note stating the source.
4) Every instance of the use of another student's laboratory reports, computer programs, or other mate-
rial must be acknowledged by a note.
5) Even the use of a student's own previous work must be acknowledged; thus, a student must obtain
the prior permission of all instructors concerned before submitting substantially the same paper in more
than one course.
Procedures for Alleged Violations
Students or faculty members who have discovered a violation or a possible violation of the Honor Code
should report it promptly either to the faculty chair or to the student chair of the Honor Committee. As
soon as possible after receiving a report of an alleged Honor Code violation, the Student Honor Committee
will convene to hear the case. The person bringing the charge will present the evidence to the Committee in
the presence of the accused student, who may then speak in his or her own defense both with and without
the accuser present. After the accused student has left the proceedings, the Committee will determine inno-
cence or guilt and, if the latter, will recommend an appropriate penalty to the Dean. Depending on the
circumstances of the violation, penalties then imposed by the Dean may include such possibilities as a
directed grade of E in the course, disciplinary probation, or temporary or permanent separation from the
College.
­ 25 ­
EXPENSES
Within the limits of available funds, Williams endeavors to offer its educational opportunities to all who
qualify for admission. Income from its endowment and annual contributions from its alumni and friends
have enabled Williams to keep its tuition at about half the actual cost per student to the College.
Payment of Term Bills
College bills for one-half of all tuition and fees are mailed to parents twice a year (in mid-July and mid-
December) for payment on August 15 and January 15; a fee of $250 may be charged if payment is re-
ceived after these dates. Term bills must be paid before the semester's classes begin or the student will not
be permitted to enroll in classes or remain in residence at the College. Billing statements for accounts with
outstanding balances or current activity will be issued monthly and are due upon receipt.
All outstanding balances must be paid to the Bursar, and all books and materials must be returned to the
Library, before the student is entitled to a degree or a transcript.
College Bills
College charges for tuition, room, board, and fees for the academic year 2003-2004 are as follows:
Tuition $27,890
Room Fee (including telephone service) 3,820
Full Board 3,840
Student Activities Fee* 150
House Maintenance Fee (upperclass) or First-Year Dues 50
_______
$35,750
Other Expenses
Based on a study of expenses reported by financial aid students, a minimum normal budget for a college
year at Williams includes additional expenses estimated as follows:
Books 800
Clothing, Laundry, Recreation approximately 1200
_______
Estimated year's total, exclusive of travel expenses** $2,000
________________
*A student activities fee for support of non-athletic student organizations is charged to all un-
dergraduates as part of the College term bill. It includes, for example, subscriptions to the col-
lege newspaper, and admission to most drama productions and musical events on campus.
**Travel expenses are not included in figures listed above. The cost of two round-trip tickets is
added into each successful financial aid candidate's award.
Additional Items
A House Maintenance Fee of $50 per year is charged to upperclassmen as a part of the College term bill.
It is used to provide a base for the social and cultural programs of each residential House and to meet any
unusual maintenance expenses for the Houses. First-year class dues of $50 are charged at the rate of $25
each semester.
The Commonwealth of Massachusetts requires that, effective September 1, 1989, all full- and part-time
students enrolled in institutions of higher education located in Massachusetts must participate in a qualify-
ing student health insurance plan offered by the institution or in another health insurance program affording
comparable coverage.
Expenses
­ 26 ­
The College offers a qualifying student health insurance plan to all students. The College will allow
students to waive participation in this insurance plan if the student will certify in writing, before the begin-
ning of the academic year, that the coverage offered by an alternative program chosen by the student is
comparable to that of the qualifying program available at the College.
Information about the student health insurance program offered by the College, including current details
of its cost, is mailed to all students each year. Additional information about this program or about the Com-
monwealth's requirements is available through the Thompson Health Center at (413) 597-3166.
There may be a $5 per day processing fee for any registration changes accepted after the announced
deadlines. There is a charge of $25 for a lost key.
Payment of College Bills
A non-refundable deposit of $200 to reserve a place in the first-year class is required from all admitted
candidates (except certain financial aid recipients) by the Candidate's Reply Date of May 1. The deposit
appears as a credit on the term bill rendered in July.
College tuition statements for one half of all fees are mailed to the billing name(s) and addresses on
record twice a year--in July, payable by August 15, and in December, payable by January 15. Payment
may be made by check, money order, or wire transfer. Credit cards can not be used to pay tuition and fees.
A fee of $250 may be charged if payment is received after these dates.
Students who receive a scholarship(s) that was not awarded through the Williams Office of Financial
Aid must complete a Scholarship Information Sheet and mail it to the Bursar Office by early June. Provi-
sional credit will be posted to the semester bill for the following; anticipated disbursements of direct loans
for which a promissory note has been signed and returned to the Office of Financial Aid, anticipated dis-
bursements of outside loans approved by the lender, outside scholarships which have not yet been received
and applied against the student account and any remaining semester contract amount for the Ten Month
Payment Plan. If actual payment for the above provisional credits are not received by the date anticipated,
the provisional credit will expire and be removed from the student's account creating a balance due.
A check returned to the College for any reason such as "account closed" or "insufficient funds" will be
charged to the student's term bill and a "return check charge" of $20.00 will be assessed. The College
reserves the right to require that payment be made in the form of cash, cashier check or money order.
Students with bills still unpaid at the start of the semester who have not made satisfactory arrangements
with the Bursar will not be permitted to enroll in classes or remain in residence at the College. Furthermore,
if arrangements for payment after the start of the semester are approved by the Bursar and these expected
payments are not made on time, students may not be allowed to enroll for the next semester.
If efforts by the Bursar's Office to collect the monies owed are unsuccessful, the account could be
placed with a collection agency, and if the delinquency persists, the College's experience with the account
may be reported to a national credit bureau. It is the policy of the College to pass on to the debtor all reason-
able costs associated with collection of the debt through a collection agency. If at any time the student
believes information concerning payment delinquency is inaccurate, he/she should notify the College c/o
The Bursar's Office, P.O. Box 406, Williamstown, MA 01267.
There are several loan options available to parents through outside sources. These include the MassPlan
Loan through the Massachusetts Educational Financing Authority and the Federal Plus Loan Program.
Information on these loans can be found in the brochure A Guide to Borrowing for College.
Williams also offers an installment plan, administered by Key Education Resources, whereby the yearly
charges are paid in 10 equal installments starting in June, with no interest charges. There are no income
restrictions. Monthly payments will be the total cost (less any scholarships, Stafford or parent loans) di-
vided by 10. There is an administration fee for this program. Information on this program is sent each
spring to all parents or can be obtained by calling Key Education Resources at (800) 539-5363.

will be credited to the student's account.
For students receiving Title IV federal funds, repayment of federal funds on a pro-rata basis will be
determined up to the 60% point of the semester per federal regulation. Please note that withdrawal late in
the semester could result in a balance owed to the College for federal aid that must be returned to the pro-
gram.
Repayment is first made to federal programs in the following order: Unsubsidized Federal Direct Staf-
ford Loan, Subsidized Federal Direct Stafford Loan, Federal Perkins Loan, Federal Direct PLUS Loan,
Federal Pell Grant, Federal SEOG, Federal SSIG, Robert Byrd Scholarship. Any remaining credit balance
reimburses other sources in the following order: Williams scholarship, other scholarships, other parent loan
programs and family. Specific examples are available on request.

Financial Aid
Williams has a substantial financial aid program to promote the greatest possible diversity in the social
and economic background of the student population. Students interested in financial aid policies and pro-
cedures should consult Williams College Prospectus, the Student Handbook, or the Office of Financial Aid.
Distinctive Undergraduate Scholarships
Williams College, through the Office of Financial Aid, administers over three hundred endowed schol-
arships, all of which are based on demonstrated need. Students who apply for financial assistance are auto-
matically considered for all these and other endowed scholarships. No separate application is required.

PREPARATIONFORGRADUATEAND PROFESSIONALSTUDY
Although the principle function of Williams is to provide a broad and solid liberal education that will be
of lasting value no matter what the vocation a student may pursue, the College recognizes that no funda-
mental conflict exists between a liberal education and preparation for a professional career; on the contrary,
a foundation of liberal studies increases professional competence in any field. A student should plan his or
her program of study so as to provide as much educational breadth and enrichment as circumstances per-
mit. A student should also give serious consideration to post-college plans early in the college career.
Each departmental major provides the foundation for graduate study in the corresponding field. Stu-
dents should consult the departmental programs listed under "Courses of Instruction" for requirements,
and for special advice regarding preparation for graduate study. Students should also consult with the ap-
propriate departmental chairman or the special faculty advisors as early as possible in their college careers
to make certain they have taken all the necessary factors into consideration.
Particular attention is called to the foreign language requirements of graduate study. Candidates for the
degree of doctor of philosophy at almost all graduate schools are required to have a reading knowledge of
both French and German. Under certain circumstances another language may replace French. Many grad-
uate schools require also a knowledge of Latin for students of English and Romantic Languages. Candi-
dates for the master of arts degree are required to have a reading knowledge of either French or German.
Students should consult departmental chairmen or the faculty advisors for the requirements in specific
fields of study.
Visual Arts
Although requirements set by various art and architectural schools differ, the basic requirements for a
variety of visual arts fields are summarized in the pamphlet "Guide to the Studio Art Major," available
from the Department of Art office in the W.L.S. Spencer Studio Art Building or the Office of Admission. A
summary of the requirements of all art and architecture schools offering Master of Arts and/or Master of
Fine Arts is available in the bulletin of the College Art Association (CAA), "MFA Programs in the Visual
Arts: A Directory." According to the current edition:
Admission to MFA programs should be based on the nature, extent, and quality of undergraduate
preparation, including courses in studio, art history, and other academic subjects. Quality of studio
preparation can best be judged on the basis of careful evaluation of work done at the undergraduate
level; therefore, a portfolio review (usually represented by slides) is regarded as an absolute necessity
in the admission process.
While many institutions consider the BFA to be the standard qualifying degree, the fact that the
applicant has attended a BA- or BS-granting institution does not necessarily rule out acceptance in
most MFA programs. Whatever the undergraduate degree, most entering graduate students tend not
to be completely prepared in one or more of the areas cited above and will require remedial make-up
work...
Some institutions use the MA degree as a qualifying prerequisite for final acceptance into MFA
candidacy, allowing the student to apply the earned credits toward the higher degree. (pp. 139-40)
Students are advised to take into consideration not only current minimum requirements but also recom-
mended courses. A summary of the essential information required for curricular planning may be found in
the "Guide to the Studio Art Major" and in the pamphlet "Choosing First Year Courses."
Business Administration
Williams offers no special course in preparation for a business career for graduate study in business
administration. The qualities which are important to succeed in business, and which graduate business
schools are seeking, are an ability to reason and to express oneself logically and clearly in written and oral
exposition; a good understanding of the physical and social environment in which business operates; a
solid background in quantitative skills; and an appreciation of human motivations and goals. This means
that a broad liberal arts program is preferred over a highly specialized one.
Within this broad prescription it may be desirable to have at least one year of economics and one year of
mathematics (including statistics and calculus). For those interested in production management or opera-
Preparation for Graduate and Professional Study
­ 31 ­
tion research, additional work in any quantitative course and/or a course in computer science would be
helpful.
But there is no particular major at Williams that is designated as preparation for the business profession.
Students interested in futures in business are encouraged to undertake a broad educational program in the
arts, humanities, and sciences. It is important that one gets involved in extra-curricular activities and that
one holds a leadership position.
Students interested in graduate work in business administration should consult with Fatma Kassamali at
the Office of Career Counseling.
Engineering
Many Williams graduates enjoy productive careers in engineering, applied science, or technical man-
agement. Successful engineers need to be able to communicate effectively, reason logically, and under-
stand both the technical and the social dimensions of a problem. A prospective engineer should pursue a
broad liberal arts education at Williams, with a strong grounding in basic science and mathematics. Most
often he or she will complete a Williams B.A. majoring in one of the sciences (usually physics, chemistry,
mathematics, or computer science) and then go to an engineering school for professional training leading
to a master's degree or doctorate in engineering. While it may be necessary to make up a few undergradu-
ate engineering courses, the opportunities at Williams to participate in scientific research and the breadth of
a liberal arts education prepare Williams graduates to succeed in engineering graduate study and in their
careers.
The booklet "Choosing First Year Courses" contains a list of Williams courses recommended to pro-
spective engineers. Students interested in engineering also have the opportunity to take undergraduate en-
gineering courses at other institutions. Williams maintains formal exchange programs with California
Institute of Technology, Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth College, and Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute. Williams students can arrange to study at one of these leading engineering schools for one or two
semesters, typically during the junior year. Individual arrangements may be possible at other engineering
schools. The 3-2 program offers another opportunity to study engineering at the undergraduate level. For
information about these opportunities, please see the sections of this catalog titled "Exchange Programs"
and "Combined Program in Liberal Arts and Engineering."
The pre-engineering advisor, Professor Jefferson Strait (fall semester) or Professor Sarah Bolton
(spring semester), will be happy to help plan course selections and to discuss the possible paths to a career
in engineering.
Law
Williams graduates regularly proceed directly to law schools on the strength of their liberal education.
No special courses are presented for pre-law students.
Students intending to study law should consult with the Pre-Law Advisor, Mary M. Winston, at the
Office of Career Counseling.
The Health Professions
Many Williams graduates elect to pursue a career in medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine, public
health, or other health-related fields. All are welcome to seek guidance from the Health Profession Office.
Students interested in medicine and related fields should pursue a broad liberal arts education, letting
enthusiasm for subjects be a guide. In most cases, a student should consider volunteer service and field-
specific internship experience in an effort to confirm interest in the chosen field. With careful planning, any
major can be studied.
In order to pursue a career in a health-related field, a student must pay particular attention to the courses
required for graduate school admission. In certain fields, upwards of twelve courses are listed as prerequi-
sites. The general requirements for many programs are outlined in "Choosing First Year Courses," but each
student considering advanced study in the health fields should plan on meeting with the Health Professions
Advisor early in the college career to ensure that planned coursework will meet specific admissions re-
quirements.
Charley Stevenson, the Health Professions Advisor, will be happy to discuss goals and specific steps
which might help a student realize them.
Preparation for Graduate and Professional Study
­ 32 ­
Pre-College and College Teaching/Research
A central qualification for careers in teaching at any level is proficiency in a major. Students interested in
college teaching and research should prepare themselves at Williams for graduate work in the subject of
their choice. Those interested in teaching at the elementary or secondary level should plan to attain state
certification and/or earn an MAT or M.Ed at a good graduate school. There are many opportunities to do
teaching internships and study education as an undergraduate while at Williams.
Students interested in college teaching should consult with the chairs of the departments in which they
intend to major. Those interested in teaching at the elementary and secondary level should consult with the
Director of the Program in Teaching or the Office of Career Counseling.
Teaching After Williams
There are many options for teaching after Williams, including independent and public school teaching.
Many states now offer streamlined programs to certify public school teachers, and many states offer wide
range of options for acquiring certification while you teach. Students who are interested in teaching are
encouraged to contact Susan Engel, the Director of the Program in Teaching at Williams, to find out how
they might participate in the program.
The Office of Career Counseling has a very active on-campus educational recruiting program that in-
cludes many private schools as well as Teach for America and similar programs. The program begins in
the fall and continues through the spring. Students interested in teaching at private elementary- or secon-
dary-level schools or participating in the Teach for America or similar programs directly after graduation
from Williams (certification is not required) should consult with the Office of Career Counseling.
Religious Study
There is no particular path through the Williams curriculum designed or recommended for students in-
tending to go to theological seminary or to prepare for a career as a religious professional. Most undergrad-
uate liberal arts courses can be useful to the prospective minister, priest, rabbi, or teacher of religion. Or-
dination requirements vary widely depending on the particular religious community or tradition; in some
cases it may be possible to make progress on certain credentials in academic study or field experience
during the undergraduate years. A basic foundation in the study of religion is certainly helpful--and stu-
dents contemplating advanced academic work in religious studies in preparation for a career in teaching or
scholarship should give serious consideration to concentrated undergraduate study in the field.
Students with vocational interests that may include ordination or certification as a religious professional
are urged to make themselves known to one of the chaplains (or, where appropriate, one of the local clergy)
as soon as these interests begin to come into focus. Those interested in graduate academic programs in
religious studies should consult with the faculty advisor in that field.

GRADUATE PROGRAMS AT WILLIAMS
Master of Arts in Development Economics
The Center for Development Economics, which opened at Williams College in 1960 with the support of
a grant from the Ford Foundation, offers an intensive one-year program in economic analysis and quantita-
tive techniques leading to the degree of Master of Arts in Development Economics. The program is specif-
ically designed for economists from developing countries who are already embarked on professional ca-
reers in public agencies. It includes required courses in development economics, international trade and
finance, monetary and fiscal policy, econometrics, and public finance. Center Fellows choose among
seminars in such fields as open-economy macroeconomics, agricultural economics, and economic transi-
tion.
Fellows are normally nominated by the public agencies from which they will be on leave. A candidate
must have a B.A. or B. Sc. degree of honors quality in Economics, have two or more years of relevant
work experience, and have an effective command of spoken and written English. Juniors and seniors ma-
joring in economics or political economy who have special interest in economic development or in a par-
ticular area of the world may, with the consent of the Chair of the Center and of the individual instructor,
satisfy some of their degree requirements by taking courses at the Center.
All communications relating to the degree of Master of Arts in Development Economics should be ad-
dressed to the CDE, Assistant Director, 1065 Main Street, Williams College, Williamstown, Massachusetts
01267, or e-mail cde@williams.edu.
Master of Arts in the History of Art
In cooperation with the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute, Williams College offers a two-year
course of study leading to the degree of Master of Arts in the History of Art. The objective of the program
is to offer to a small number of students a thorough professional preparation for careers in teaching and
museums, and to enable them to pursue further research whether independently or at other institutions of-
fering higher degrees. The curriculum consists of seminars in art historical subjects and an intensive study
of foreign languages in the context of the general literature of art. Problems of criticism, connoisseurship,
and conservation arising from the study of original works of art are fundamental to the program, and op-
portunities are provided for practical experience in museum work at the Clark Art Institute, the Williams
College Museum of Art, and the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art. The study of primary ma-
terials is further extended by field trips to other collections. The degree is normally awarded after two years
of resident graduate study. To earn the degree, students must take ten courses, of which at least six must be
graduate seminars (including ARTH 504). In connection with the preparation of a paper for the Graduate
Symposium, students will register for an eleventh course (ARTH 509), to be graded pass/fail, in their
fourth semester. A demonstration of proficiency in reading two foreign languages is required. Of these two,
German is required, and French is recommended. In January of the first year, students participate in a Eu-
ropean study trip with selected faculty; in January of the second year, students must complete a Qualifying
Paper. In addition to all course work, students must, at the end of the second year, present a shortened
version of the Qualifying Paper in a graduate symposium to be held on Commencement weekend. To enter
the program a successful applicant must have been awarded the degree of Bachelor of Arts or its equivalent
from an accredited institution. An undergraduate major in art is not required for acceptance to the program.
For further information, write: The Director, Graduate Program in the History of Art, Box 8, Williams-
town, Massachusetts 01267, telephone (413)458-9545, or email gradart@williams.edu.

COURSES OF INSTRUCTION 2003-2004
COURSE NUMBERING SYSTEM
Courses designated by a single number are semester courses.
Year courses are designated by an odd number and an even number joined by a hyphen; the work of
the two semesters constitutes an integral, indivisible course. Therefore, if a student does not pass the
second half of a year-long course, he or she forfeits credit for the first half and incurs a deficiency as a
result of the forfeiture. Students who register for a year course are required to do both semesters of
that course within the same academic year.
In some departments, course numbers have special meanings that are explained in their listings.
The(F) or(S) following a course's number indicates the semester, fall or spring, in which the course
will be offered.
THESE SYMBOLS ARE USED IN DEPARTMENTAL MASTHEADS TO INDICATE

Southwest Asia, the swath of territory that extends west and south from the Chinese border to east Africa is
not usually treated as a single entity, though it is united together by two important features: culturally it was
the heart of Islamic civilization and Islam continues to provide a common identity to the area in the face of
remarkable ethnic and historical differences; geologically it is the site of the preponderance of the earth's
oil and natural gas reserves. This course will bring to bear some of the theories of comparative politics and
international relations to better understand the region. Naturally terrorism and the obsessions with the war
on terrorism will be important themes in the course, but we will attempt to both contextualize and judge the
significance of those phenomena with a deeper investigation of the relation between Islam and violence,
Islamic political theory and the tendency towards authoritarianism, the political economy of the region and
the character of the processes of modernization and globalization.
Format: discussion/lecture. Requirements: one midterm paper (4-6 pages) based on class materials and a
final research paper (12-15 pages).

HONORS PROGRAM IN AFRICAN-AMERICAN STUDIES
A candidate for honors in African-American Studies must maintain at least a B+ average in the
concentration and be admitted to candidacy by the program faculty. An honors candidate must com-
plete her/his project in a semester (and Winter Study). A candidate will enroll for either AAS 491 or
492 (and Winter Study) during her/his senior year to write a forty-page thesis or to do an equivalent
project in the performing and studio arts. A faculty advisor, in consultation with the chair, can change
the particulars of an honors project.
An honors project should demonstrate unusual creativity, depth, and intellectual rigor. A candidate for
honors is permitted and encouraged to pursue non-traditional projects, such as presentations in the per-
forming arts, visual arts, or creative writing, as well as more traditional interdisciplinary studies. The advi-
sor will evaluate an honors project, and the program faculty will decide whether to confer honors. A stu-
dent wishing to become a candidate for honors in African-American Studies should secure a faculty spon-
sor and inform the program chair in writing before spring registration of her/his junior year.
AAS 491(F), 492(S) Senior Project
Non-honors candidates do a regular winter study project offered by the program or a"99." Candidates
for honors in African-American Studies must do W030 for the winter study period following 491 or
prior to taking 492.

THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN STUDIES CONCENTRATION AND THE AMERICAN STUDIES
MAJOR
Several courses in African-American Studies count for credit in the American Studies major. There-
fore, students in American Studies can easily complete requirements for an African-American Studies
concentration by electing one course in an African subject and by taking African-American Studies 491.
Another three courses must be chosen which satisfy both American Studies and African-American
Studies requirements.
AMERICAN STUDIES (Div. II)
Chair, Associate Professor: SCOTT WONG
Faculty 2003-2004: Professors: KUNZEL, K. LEE, REINHARDT. Associate Professors: KENT**,
WHALEN, WONG. Assistant Professors: AUBERT, BEAN, L. JOHNSON*. Senior Lecturer:
CLEGHORN. Bolin Fellow: RÚA.
GENERAL PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The American Studies Program uses interdisciplinary approaches to develop students' understand-
ing of the complexity of the culture(s) usually labeled "American." Examining history, literature,
visual media, performance, and other forms of expression, we explore the processes of cultural defini-
tion as contested by diverse individuals and groups. We ask new questions about aspects of American
life long taken for granted; we also use American culture as a laboratory for testing classic and con-
temporary theories about how cultures work.
NON-MAJORS, FIRST-YEAR STUDENTS, AND SOPHOMORES
American Studies 201 is open to non-majors including first-year students with Advanced Place-
ment credit in American History. All elective courses are open to students who meet the requirements
of the departments that sponsor those courses. American Studies 302 and 403 are open to non-majors
with permission of the instructor.
RATIONALE FOR COURSE NUMBERING
The introductory course is offered at the 200 level to suggest the desirability of some preliminary
training in college-level history, literature, sociology, or political science. The intermediate course,
302, is offered primarily for juniors, although it is open to sophomores who have had 201 and will be
away from campus during the spring of their junior year. 403 is designed for senior majors.
THE MAJOR
Required major courses:
American Studies 201
American Studies 302
American Studies 403
Elective courses:
Eight courses: five should be chosen from one of the specialization fields listed below, the other three
chosen from among any of the electives listed. Students are expected to take courses from at least two
disciplines when choosing the courses that make up their specializations. Students are also required
to take at least one course from a list of pre-1900 courses. Advanced Placement credit in appropriate
areas, or departmental courses not listed here, may be substituted for electives in the major, with per-
mission of the program chair.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN AMERICAN STUDIES
Candidates for honors in American Studies will undertake a substantial, year-long independent
project during their Senior year. Applicants should have a consistent record of high achievement in
courses taken for the major, and normally will have done work in the field of study of their proposed
thesis. Students who wish to write or produce an honors project should consult with a prospective
faculty advisor in their junior year. Formal application to pursue honors should be made by the time of
spring registration in the junior year. Students must submit a 1- to 2-page preliminary proposal de-
scribing the proposed project to the Chair of the American Studies Program at this time. Final admis-
sion to the honors thesis program will depend on the AMST advisory committee's assessment of the
qualifications of the student and the merits and feasibility of the project. If the proposal is approved,
they will be permitted to register for AMST 491, W030, and AMST 492 the following year. The com-
pleted project is due in mid-April. Each student will present a short oral presentation of his or her the-
sis at the end of spring semester.
ADVISING
All majors will be assigned a faculty advisor. Majors must meet with their advisor during the first
week of classes during the fall semester and at the time of the spring semester registration period in
order to have their courses and plans for the American Studies major approved. Both majors and non-
American Studies
­ 49 ­
majors are encouraged to talk at any time with the program chair or other affiliated faculty about the
major.
AMERICAN STUDIES AND OTHER PROGRAMS
Students majoring in American Studies are encouraged to consider pursuing concentrations in
African-American, Environmental, and Women's and Gender Studies. Many of the courses counted
for those concentrations may also earn credit toward the American Studies major.
STUDY AWAY FROM WILLIAMS
We encourage students to pursue cross-cultural comparative studies. A major in American Studies
can be combined with study away from Williams for a semester or a year if plans are made carefully.
Many courses that will be approved for College credit may also count toward the American Studies
major if their subject matter is American culture.
Students planning to be away in the junior year should have taken American Studies 201 before
they leave; those away for junior-year spring term should take American Studies 302 in their sopho-
more year. Students should consult as early as possible with the chair or their advisor about their plans
for fulfilling the requirements of the major.

AMST 201(F,S) Introduction to American Studies (W)
To be an "American" means something more than U.S. citizenship. In this course, we focus on the
problems and possibilities of American identity. Access to Americanness is shaped by factors such as
class, race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, religion, and region--categories which themselves change in
meaning over time. Given the geographical, racial, and cultural diversity of the United States, the
ways in which Americans imagine nation inevitably vary over time, according to place, and among
different individuals and groups. Rather than a survey of any one aspect or period of American histo-
ry, literature, or popular culture, this course is an introduction to the interdisciplinary field of Ameri-
can Studies, a field defined both by the range of texts we read (essays, novels, autobiographies,
photographs, films, music, architecture, historical documents, legal texts), and by the questions we
ask of them: How have different Americans imagined what it means to be an American? What ideas
about national history, patriotism, and moral character shape their visions of Americanness? How do
the educational system, mass media, government policies regarding citizenship and immigration
shape American identities? How are boundaries of inclusion and exclusion in the nation drawn? What
uses have been made of the claim to an American identity, and what is at stake in that claim? How have
Americans imagined a national landscape, a national culture, and to what ends?
Format: discussion. Evaluation will be based on a series of short critical essays and a group project.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 per section (expected: 19 per section). Preference given to
sophomores and first-year students with AP 5 in U.S. History. Two sections in the fall; one section in

AMST 310(S) Latino Cityscapes: Mapping Place, Community, and Latinidad in US Urban
Centers*
This interdisciplinary course examines the emergence of Latino cities in the U.S. We begin by explor-
ing urban centers that came to be identified with certain Latino groups--Puerto Ricans in New York,
Mexicans in Los Angeles, and Cubans in Miami. We then turn to other Latino cities that have been
historically overlooked given the popular and scholarly attention placed on New York, Los Angeles,
and Miami. We will analyze the diverse histories of migration and settlement, inter-ethnic and inter-
racial relations, community building and identity formation, and the racialization of urban spaces. Fi-
nally, we will consider the situatedness of latinidad in these urban environments, contemplating how
Latinos are shaped by and in turn shape the experience of the city in the US.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class participation, field research, two short essays, and
a final paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 12). Preference given to American Studies majors

History 469)*
While "race" and "ethnicity" have always played fundamental roles in shaping the course of Ameri-
can history and the image of American society, our understanding of the concepts of race and ethnicity
has often been less than clear. Our goal in this course is to determine and examine how Americans
have defined race and ethnicity at various points in our history and how these notions have been acted
out in policy, practice, and theory. Examples of the social and legal construction of race and ethnicity
will include white-Native American relations, slavery and its legacy, the "Yellow Peril," science and
race, and contemporary race relations.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class participation and three written assignments: an
annotated bibliography, an historiographical essay, and a final research paper.
Prerequisites: prior work in American Studies and/or History. Enrollment limit: 18 (expected: 18).
Preference given to senior American Studies majors, then to History majors.

SPECIALIZATION FIELDS
To provide focus for work in the major, each student will choose one of the Specialization Fields listed
below and record this choice when registering for the major. (This commitment can be revised, in consulta-
tion with the chair.) At least five electives will be taken from among those designated to support a special-
ization field. In extraordinary cases, students who wish to do so may be permitted to design their own spe-
cialization field. Fulfillment of concentrations in African-American Studies, Environmental Studies, and
Women's and Gender Studies may be used as the basis for individually designed specialization fields. All
such arrangements must be approved by the American Studies Committee.
CULTURAL PRACTICES

ANTHROPOLOGY AND SOCIOLOGY (Div. II)
Chair, Associate Professor JAMES L. NOLAN, Jr.
Professors: M. F. BROWN, D. EDWARDS, JACKALL, JUST. Associate Professors: FOIAS, NO-
LAN. Assistant Professor: SHEVCHENKO. Visiting Part-time Lecturer: HENKEL.
The Department of Anthropology and Sociology at Williams aims to help students achieve an inte-
grated understanding of biography, history, culture, and social structure in both traditional and mod-
ern societies.
Anthropology explores the full range of human experience by introducing students to the study of
tribal and peasant societies, especially those on the periphery of the West, as well as to the cultural
complexities of stratified, industrial societies such as our own. Integrated with the study of specific
peoples is an examination of the various analytical schemes anthropologists have developed to under-
stand them. Courses offered in the department represent two of Anthropology's major subfields: so-
ciocultural anthropology--that is, the comparative study of human social life, institutions, and be-
liefs--and archaeology, the study of the origins and lifeways of prehistoric peoples.
Anthropology and Sociology
­ 55 ­
Sociology studies the social and institutional intricacies of modern industrial societies and the so-
cial psychological dilemmas facing the individual in our epoch. Sociology courses introduce students
to classical and contemporary social thought about men and women and society, to the systematic
analysis of social institutions and social interaction, and to the social analysis of modern culture. The
Sociology major at Williams emphasizes the humanistic tradition of sociology, stressing qualitative
approaches to understanding how social reality is constructed.
MAJORS
The department offers separate majors in both Anthropology and Sociology, with a broad and di-
verse array of courses in both disciplines. The department is committed, however, to the unity of the
social sciences. To this end, Anthropology and Sociology offer joint core courses in methodology and
theory, as well as several elective courses in common. All joint courses are designated "ANSO."
Requirements
For the degree in Anthropology or Sociology, students must complete a minimum of nine courses
as outlined below:
(1) Core Courses. Majors in both disciplines must take a sequence of four core courses. Three of these
are joint (ANSO) courses. The sequences are:
Anthropology Joint (ANSO) Sociology
ANTH 101 The Scope SOC 101 Invitation to
of Anthropology Sociology
ANSO 205
Ways of Knowing
ANSO 305
Social Theory
ANSO 402
Senior Seminar
(2) Elective Courses. Majors in Anthropology or Sociology must take five elective courses from the
course listings of their respective disciplines or from the joint ANSO listings. Two of the courses
chosen are normally at the 300 level or above. In close consultation with their departmental advisors,
students may take some selected courses from other disciplines to fulfill major requirements in either
Anthropology or Sociology.
(3) Majors in each wing of the department are allowed to count up to two courses in the other wing to-
wards fulfillment of their major requirements.
STATISTICS AND DATA ANALYSIS
Majors in Anthropology and Sociology are required to take Statistics 101 (formerly Mathematics
143), a comparable course in statistics and data analysis, or prove competency in the area of statistical
analysis through examination. Courses taken to fulfill this requirement will not count towards the nine
course total that all majors are expected to complete.
AREA STUDIES CONCENTRATION
Students who wish to combine a major in Anthropology or Sociology with an Area Studies con-
centration are encouraged to do so. Courses taken to satisfy an Area Studies requirement may be
counted toward the major with prior approval of a student's departmental advisor. The only exception
to this rule is the Area Studies senior seminar, which cannot ordinarily be counted toward the An-
thropology or Sociology degree.
LANGUAGE STUDY, STUDY ABROAD, AND WINTER STUDY
Departmental advisors will help interested students integrate a major with study abroad, foreign
language study, or field research during the winter study period. The department encourages Williams
students to take advantage of established foreign study programs in Egypt, Japan, India, Hong Kong,
and other countries. Because some foreign study programs do not offer courses that can be counted
toward the Anthropology or Sociology degrees, however, sophomores planning to study abroad in
junior year must consult with the departmental advisor before declaring a major.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN ANTHROPOLOGY OR SOCIOLOGY
Honors and highest honors are normally awarded for the completion of a year-long research project
that has resulted in an original thesis of high quality. Students wishing to write an honors thesis should
engage a member of the department faculty as a Thesis Advisor as soon as possible and must submit a
proposal for the thesis for department approval no later than preregistration in the spring of the junior
year. If the proposal is approved, they will be permitted to register for Anthropology and Sociology
493-W031-494, during which they will write and defend a thesis. If their overall work in the major
continues to be of high quality and the thesis is deemed of a similar quality, they may be awarded
honors or highest honors in Anthropology or Sociology.

ANTHROPOLOGY / SOCIOLOGY COURSES
JOINT CORE COURSES
ANSO 205(S) Ways of Knowing
An exploration of how one makes sense of the social world. Some of the key questions of the course are:
What are the philosophical and epistemological underpinnings of social inquiry? How does one frame in-
tellectual problems and go about collecting, sifting, and assessing field materials? What are the uses and
limits of statistical data? What is the importance of history to sociological and anthropological research?
How can one use archival and other documentary materials to enrich ethnographic research? What are the
empirical limits to interpretation? What is the relationship between empirical data and the generation of
social theory? How does the social organization of social research affect one's inquiry? What are the typi-
cal ethical dilemmas of fieldwork and of other kinds of social research? How do researchers' personal
biographies and values shape their work? We will approach these problems concretely rather than abstract-
ly through a series of case studies of how men and women in the world of affairs, ranging from detectives,
epidemiologists, and corporate lawyers, make sense of their worlds in order to act responsibly. We will also
draw upon the field experiences of departmental faculty in settings as diverse as the jungles of Guatemala,
the mountains of Sumbawa, Afghan refugee camps, the criminal underworld of Russia, big city police
departments and district attorney offices, corporate offices on Wall Street, and criminal drug courts across
America and the United Kingdom. There will also be some practical training in basic field methods, census
and survey interpretation, and archival research.
Requirements: a series of short papers and a final exam.
Prerequisites: Anthropology 101 or Sociology 101 or permission of instructor. Expected enrollment: 20.
Hour: 1:10-3:50 W NOLAN
ANSO 305(F) Social Theory
An introduction to social theory in anthropology and sociology, with strong emphasis on enduring
works by major thinkers--Marx, Weber, Durkheim, and Freud, among others--who have shaped
views of society in the West and beyond. Several key questions inform exploration of these works:
What are the historical roots and principal attributes of modernity? From the perspective of moderni-
ty, how do social theorists understand "the primitive"? Do society and culture have organizing rules?
What role does human agency play in the unfolding of social life? What are the possibilities and limits
of scientific approaches to the study of human social experience? In considering such questions, we
will reconstruct the intellectual and social histories of both disciplines, examining in particular how
they abandoned common ground and language, with sociologists gravitating toward paradigms of
scientific predictability and anthropologists toward relativistic frameworks of interpretation. Finally,
we will examine the migration of ideas from anthropology and sociology to other disciplines and back
again. The course emphasizes major differences between interpretive frameworks as well as common
elements that contribute to a deeper understanding of the social world.
Format: seminar. Requirements: two short essays and one research paper based on local fieldwork.
Prerequisites: Anthropology 101 or Sociology 101 and ANSO 205 or permission of instructor.Enroll-
ment limit: 25 (expected: 22).

ANSO 402(S) Senior Seminar (Same as Anthropology 402 and Sociology 402)
This capstone seminar combines intensive discussion and individual research. The first half of the
semester will be dedicated to the discussion of a social issue central to the concerns of both anthropol-
ogy and sociology. The class will meet with the instructor in fall 2003 to decide on that topic. Then, in
the second half of the semester, students will pursue independent, original projects and produce a ma-
jor term paper. Toward the end of the semester, students will present their projects to the seminar. Stu-
dents who are not senior majors in anthropology or sociology are admitted to this course only on the
instructor's permission.
Format: seminar. Requirements: full participation, major research project and paper, class presenta-
tion.
Prerequisites: senior Anthropology and Sociology majors or permission of instructor. Enrollment lim-
it: 18 (expected: 18).

ANTHROPOLOGY COURSES
ANTH 101(F,S) The Scope of Anthropology*
Is there such a thing as "human nature"? Why have human societies developed such a bewildering
range of customs to deal with problems common to people everywhere? This course addresses these
questions by introducing students to the comparative study of human social life and culture. Topics
surveyed in the course include economics, language and thought, kinship and marriage, law and poli-
tics, and the wide variations in human belief systems, including religions. The course also considers
the ways that anthropology, a discipline that was until recently practiced almost exclusively by West-
erners, approaches other societies in search of insights on our own customs and values. Ethnographic

ANTH 102(S) Human Evolution: Down From the Trees, Out to the Stars (Same as
Environmental Studies 106)
One important way of understanding what it means to be a human being is to see humankind as an
evolving species. This course traces the story of our evolution, in terms of both the fossil evidence of
our anatomical evolution and the archaeological, primatological, and conjectural evidence for the
evolution of human behavior. We will trace five million years of human (and near-human) history as
our ancestors are transformed from creatures of the forest canopy to upright scavengers of the African
plains, to the fire-using species that burst out of Africa and spread across the globe, to the cold-adapted
Neanderthals, to the anatomically modern humans whose ability to manipulate symbolic communica-
tion has placed footprints on the moon while bringing us to the verge of self-destruction.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: research paper, two quizzes, and two exams.
Hour: 9:55-11:10 TR FOIAS
ANTH 103(F) Pyramids, Bones, and Sherds: What is Archaeology?*
Anthropology examines not only living societies, but also prehistoric cultures whose remains are found
worldwide. This course will present how archaeology examines the various aspects of human society from
the physical record of prehistory. How do we study the subsistence and settlement patterns, the political
and social organization, and the economy and ideology of prehistoric societies who have left behind mute
material records? The objective of anthropological archaeology is to bring to life these prehistoric cultures
through archaeological analysis. The different goals, approaches and methodologies of modern archaeolo-
gy will be discussed theoretically and then applied to case studies.
Format: lecture/discussion/class presentations of case studies. Requirements: class presentations, two pa-
pers, midterm and final exams.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 40 (expected: 25).

An introduction to the subsistence strategies, social life, and religious vision of native North Ameri-
cans. Particular attention will be paid to the sharp differences among Native-American world views
and to diverse strategies for cultural survival in contemporary America. Readings will include auto-
biographical, ethnographic, and historical works, as well as examples of contemporary Native-Amer-
ican literature.
Format: seminar. Requirements: one 5-page essay and one 15- to 20-page research paper.

ANTH 214(F) (formerly ANSO 214) The Rise and Fall of Civilizations (Same as Environmental
Studies 224)*
Over the centuries, philosophers and historians have asked how societies evolved from simple hunter-
gatherer bands to complex urban civilizations? Human prehistory and history have shown the re-
peated cycles of the rise, expansion and collapse of early civilizations in both the Old and New World.
What do the similarities and differences in the development of these first civilizations tell us about the
nature of societal change, civilization and the state, and human society itself? The course will examine
these issues through an introductory survey of the earliest civilizations in Mesopotamia, Egypt, India,
Mesoamerica and South America. Classical and modern theories on the nature, origin, and develop-
ment of the state will be reviewed in the light of the archaeological evidence.
Format: lecture/film/class discussion. Requirements: midterm, final exam, and short paper.

ANTH 220(S) Contemporary Islam*
Muslim as well as Western scholars sometimes refer to the relationship of Islam to the West as a "war
of cultures" or a "clash of civilizations." By focusing on the aims and motivations of current Islamic
movements, this course will examine these claims and offer an introduction to Islam as a moral tradi-
tion. The course will begin by surveying prominent interpretations of Islam by Western scholars and
juxtaposing them with Muslim accounts of Islam. We will then look more closely at ways in which
religious Muslims draw on the Islamic tradition in defining (and discussing) what a good life and a
moral society might be. We will explore the social conditions under which the authority of the Islamic
tradition remains strong and under which interpretations of the Islamic tradition change. Finally we
will explore the place of Islam in contemporary societies, including the Middle East, Europe and the
US, and seek to develop more nuanced answers to the question of the relationship between Islam and
the West.

ANTH 247T(S) Saints and Sainthood (Same as Religion 247T) (W)
"It's easy to be a saint," a friend of Thomas Merton once told him, "you only have to want to be one"; yet
saints are rare and, to believers, precious human beings. At the same time, saints and sainthood are remark-
ably widespread across time and space in human history: Christian saints, Muslim walis, Buddhist ara-
hants, Chinese sages, wonder-working Hasidic rebbes, and others are among those strange and wonderful
creatures who inhabit the borderlands between the sacred and profane, the divine and the human. Exem-
plars, intercessors, friends of God, miracle-workers--and sometimes charlatans and frauds--the varied
roles of saints are each unique to their own times, cultures, and traditions, yet we intuitively feel they have
something in common. In this tutorial we will explore the similarities and differences among these special
men and women and the place they occupy in the human imagination and experience.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: students are required to write five 6- to 8-page papers during the semester.

Bringing together insights from anthropology, art history, and religious studies, this course will ex-

humans have again and again made a division between sacred and profane. We will attend to this pro-
cess as expressed in the geography, social dynamics, and architecture of sacred space, noting patterns
of similarity and difference among and between the "little traditions" of folk and traditional societies
as well as the "great traditions" of universalist and modern societies. Having developed an analytical
vocabulary for understanding sacred space, we will put our model in motion by examining the dy-
namics of change, redefinition, and contestation that have so often surrounded the history of sacred
spaces.

ANTH 324(S) Empires of Antiquity
Cycles of rise and collapse of civilizations are common in our human past. Among the most fascinat-
ing cases are those of empires, conquest civilizations, or states that encompass a number of different
ethnicities, politics and peoples. However, their rise and often rapid collapse begs an important ques-
tion: how stable have empires been in human prehistory? Are they intrinsically unstable political
forms? The course will address these questions by examining the major empires of the Old and New
World in pre-modern history; Akkasian; Babylonian; Persian; Assyrian; Greek; Roman; Chinese; Ot-
toman; Aztec; and Inca empires. Using readings by political scientists, historians, epigraphers, ar-
chaeologists and political anthropologists, we will consider the cause of the expansion and collapse of
these empires, their sociopolitical and economic structures as mechanisms for their maintenance to
provide a cross-cultural comparison of the differential success and final decline of all these empires.

ANTH 328(F) Emotions and the Self (W)*
Everyone everywhere experiences emotions, and everyone everywhere is faced with the task of con-
ceptualizing a self-hood and its place in the social world. This course analyzes a variety of recent at-
tempts in the social sciences to come to grips with topics that have long been avoided: the nature of the
interior experience and an epistemological framework for its cross-cultural comparison. Exploring
the borderlands between anthropology, sociology, and psychology, we will bring the tools of ethno-
graphic analysis to bear on central pan-human concepts: emotions and the self. By examining these
phenomena as they occur in other cultures, we will be better placed to apprehend and challenge the
implicit (and often unconsciously held) assumptions about emotions and the self in our own culture,
both in daily life and in academic psychological theory. What are emotions? Are they things--neuro-
physiological states--or ideas--sociocultural constructions? How are they to be described;
compared? What is the self? How are selves constructed and constituted? How do various cultures
respond to categories of emotion and self, and how can we develop a sense of the relationship between
self and emotion?

An introduction to sociological analysis. The course focuses on the relationships of individual men
and women to the social world and introduces students to systematic institutional analysis. Students
will explore the intersection of biography, history, culture, and social structure as seen in the work of
classical and contemporary social thinkers, including Marx, Durkheim, Weber, Freud, Veblen, Sim-
mel, and Goffman. Special consideration will be given to the social and cultural problems of capital-
ism, rationality and irrationality in modern institutions and organizations, the psychological dilemmas
facing the individual in modern society, and the problem of social order and conflict.

This multidisciplinary course analyzes violence and aggression within broad historical and compara-
tive frameworks. The course begins with an examination of the universality of violence and human-
kind's ceaseless fascination with it. It then proceeds through an examination of types and meanings of
violence. Topics include: war and warriors; industrialized violence; ethnic and racial savagery; vio-
lence in the name of God; political violence; terror; honor and violence; sexual violence; criminal
violence; and self-destructiveness. The course concludes with a look at forces of order and peace in
several historical contexts. Special attention paid throughout to representations of violence in art, lit-
erature, and cinema. Readings include selections from Homer, Aeschylus, Tacitus, Suetonius, Dos-
toevsky, Sorel, Marx, Durkheim, Weber, Bloch, Tambiah, and Deutscher, along with many other clas-
sical and contemporary writers.

An analysis of modern terrorism and its threat to national security. First, the course begins with an historical
and comparative examination of organized terrorism in different countries, both state-initiated terrorism
and that directed against states. Second, it analyzes the roots, social organization, and goals of terrorism
directed against the United States at home and abroad, with a particular focus on terrorism emanating from
radical Islamists in the last quarter-century. Special attention to: the resurgence of militant Islam and the
reasons for Islamists' antagonism toward the West; the recruitment, training, and indoctrination of terror-
ists; the ideologies and self-images of terrorists; case studies of specific terrorist attacks and their social
psychological effects on American citizens. Third, the course examines military actions taken to extirpate
terrorism and the efficacy of such actions. Fourth, the course analyzes the exigencies and dilemmas of
ensuring public safety in a democratic society. Special attention to: the structure and ethos of intelligence
work; the investigation of terrorist networks and their financing; the technology and organization of ascer-
taining identities; and the control of illegal immigration. Fifth, the course examines the threat of terrorists'
use of biological, chemical, and nuclear weapons of mass destruction and the defenses against such threats.
Finally, it appraises the structure and content of mass media coverage of terrorism, as well as official and
nonofficial propaganda on all sides of these issues. Experts in different fields will give guest lectures

SOC 265(F) Drugs and Society
From nineteenth-century opium dens to early-twentieth-century speakeasies to late-twentieth-centu-
ry crack houses, this course investigates the important impact of drugs on American society. Focusing
on the social control of drug and alcohol use, particularly legal forms of social control, the course
analyzes such historical developments as the rise and fall of prohibition; the early-twentieth-century
illegalization of narcotics; the emergence of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), Narcotics Anonymous
(NA) and other self-help groups; and the recent advent of drug courts and juvenile boot camps. The
analysis will include evaluation not only of the social influence of drugs typically classified as "illic-
it," such as cocaine, opium, morphine, heroine, and marijuana, but also of alcohol, tobacco, and the
recent emergence and popularity of psycho-pharmaceutical drugs like prozac and ritalin. Rooted in a
sociological perspective, the course reviews different theoretical explanations of drug and alcohol
consumption and of the different strategies, legal and otherwise, that have been employed to define
and regulate drug use in American society.

able? Are there non-consumer societies in the modern world? How has globalization changed the ways
people consume in different parts of the globe? This course will explore the consumption and consumer
practices as products of modernity and will analyze the political, cultural and social agendas that have
transformed consumption over time. Politics of consumption (the way in which seemingly free and inde-
pendent consumption choices aggregate into the existing system of global capitalism) will be treated
alongside its symbolic element: the role of consumer practices in creating and articulating identities, build-
ing relationships and creating solidarities. It will look at money, fashion, advertising, arts, tourism, and
shopping in places as varied as nineteenth-century France, socialist Russia, postsocialist Hungary and in
contemporary United States, tracing both the mechanisms that structure patterns of consumption, and the
implications that these patterns have for the larger social order.

politics of the time, and evolves under an array of influences. This course analyzes discourses of collective
and individual identity and the mechanism involved in the formulation of the individual's sense of his or
her place in the world. Topics include: nations and nationalism, representations of individual and collective
pasts, collective memory and practices of remembrance, nostalgia and selective forgetting, narratives of
childhood and a "golden age," the invention of tradition, museums and memorials, biography and mem-
oirs, narratives of progression, and the making of national and family histories.

SOC 368(S) Technology and Modern Society
With expanding access to and use of the internet, controversial developments in such biotechnical
practices as the cloning of mammals, rapid advances in various forms of telecommunication, and the
increasing sophistication of technological weaponry in the military, the triumph of technology re-
mains a defining feature of modern life. For the most part, modern humans remain unflinchingly con-
fident in the possibilities technology holds for continuing to improve the human condition. Indisput-
ably, technology has benefited human life in innumerable ways. However, as with other features of
modernity, technology has also had significant, albeit largely unanticipated, social consequences.
Working within a sociological paradigm, this course will focus on the less often examined latent func-
tions of technology in modern society. It will consider, for example, the social effects of technology on
community life, on privacy, and on how people learn, think, understand the world, communicate, and
organize themselves. The course will also examine the effects of technology on medicine, business,
education, and the military and will consider such countercultural reactions to technology as the Lud-
dite movement in early-nineteenth-century England and the U.S. agrarian movements of the twen-
tieth century.

Parallel courses
Any four additional Art Studio or Art History courses. At least one elective must be taken in each
wing of the department. At least one of the electives must be an Art History course concerned
with a period of Western or non-Western art prior to 1800.
Art History Route: The history of art is different from other historical disciplines in that it is founded
on direct visual confrontation with objects that are both concretely present and yet documents of the
past. We emphasize analysis of images, objects, and built environments as the basis for critical
thought and visual literacy. In addition to formal and iconographic analysis, we use the work of
other disciplines to understand visual images, such as social history, perceptual psychology, engi-
neering, psychoanalysis, cultural studies, and archaeology. Because of its concentration on visual
experience, the Art History major increases ones ability to observe and to use those observations as
analytical tools for understanding history and culture.
ArtH 101-102 introduces students to a series of critical studies of important works selected from the
history of Western art from antiquity to the present. The critical approach of the introductory course is
maintained in all further courses, especially by assigned study of original works in the Williams Col-
lege Museum of Art, Chapin Library, the Clark Art Institute, and Mass MoCA.
An introductory studio course, ArtS 100, in which no artistic talent or prior experience are as-
sumed, provides vital training in what is a visual as well as a verbal discipline. The requirement of a
course in non-Western art expands majors' geographic as well as cultural horizons, and the require-
ment of two courses in art from periods prior to 1800 provides a necessary concentration on earlier
moments in culture. (As the contemporary architect, Philip Johnson, said, "You cannot not know his-
tory.") The junior course (ArtH 301) develops awareness of the theoretical implications, as well as the
possibilities and limitations of different art-historical methods. The requirement of a seminar or grad-
uate course in the senior year enables students to apply that knowledge of methodology to their most
specialized work in the Art History route.
Art Studio Route: The studio division of the Art major has been structured to foster the development of a
critical understanding of making art; to support creative interests and to develop students' perceptions and
imaginations as they investigate a variety of visual media. Drawing I, ArtS 100 serves as an introduc-
tion to the basic drawing and design principles which establish the foundation for the development of
visual expression. ArtH 101-102, an introduction to the history of Western art, provides part of the neces-
sary background in the critical analysis of art. The 200-level ArtS courses provide opportunities to learn the
elements of some of the principal visual arts media: architecture, painting, photography, printmaking,
sculpture, and video. These courses combine technical foundations in the medium with analysis of the
interrelation of visual form and content. The 300- and 400-level courses place a greater emphasis on the
application of appropriate visual skills and strategies to particular thematic concerns, and to the develop-
ment of the student's individual vision. All studio art seniors exhibit their work in the Williams College
Museum of Art as a part of the requirements for the major.
History and Practice Route: This route allows students to study in depth both the history of art and the
making of it. It offers considerable flexibility: students may propose courses of study that emphasize partic-
ular media, themes or methodological issues. To mention just three examples, students may design se-
quences of courses that focus on architecture, gender or narration in both the history of art and contempo-
rary practice. And students may take more courses in one wing of the department than the other, as long as
the minimum requirements in each wing are satisfied. The History and Practice route is especially well-
suited to students interested in arts-related careers outside of higher education, including work in art galler-
ies, art museums, and primary or secondary school education. Courses of study for History and Practice
majors must be approved by two members of the faculty, one from each wing of the department. Any
changes in a History and Practice course of study must also be approved by two advisors.
History and Practice Faculty Advisors: Michael Glier, Ann McCallum, and Ben Benedict in stu-
dio; E. J. Johnson and Michael Lewis in history.
COURSE NUMBERS
First Digit
The introductory courses in both Art History and Studio have 100-level numbers and are prerequisites
for most other courses in the department. The distinction between 200- and 300-level offerings is ei-
ther one of difficulty or of the sequence in which material is best taken. Also, lecture courses with no
prerequisite have a 100- or 200-level number. The 400-level seminars and tutorials are intended for
advanced students, usually senior majors.
Middle Digit
Art History (ArtH)
Middle digit distinguishes courses according to geographical area, or time span covered. 0 = general; 1 =
Ancient; 2 = Medieval; 3 = fifteenth, sixteenth century; 4 = seventeenth, eighteenth century; 5 = nineteenth
century; 6 = twentieth century; 7 = Asian; 8 = African; 9 = independents, honors.

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN ART
Students who wish to become candidates for the degree with honors must show prior evidence of
superior performance in the major as well as research capabilities to carry out the proposed project.
Art History:
In order for a project to be considered, the candidate (1) must have arranged for an advisor, and (in
consultation with the advisor) a second reader to supervise and evaluate the project (2) should normal-
ly have had one course with the advisor. In addition, the topic must be within the advisor's areas of
competence and should normally be related to course work which the student has done previously. In
the case of an interdisciplinary proposal, the second reader should normally come from the other dis-
cipline.
The student submits a 2-page proposal including a statement about the preparation for the project, a
description of the topic and a general bibliography. Following approval by the faculty advisor and
second reader, this proposal is reviewed by the entire Art faculty, who have the option to request revi-
sions and to refuse the proposal. Students should keep in mind that a thesis in Art History is not neces-
sary for admission to graduate study.
It is the responsibility of the candidate to select one of the following routes and to meet all dead-
lines. Students who are not making satisfactory progress on their research and writing will not be al-
lowed to continue with the thesis. The completion of the requirements, however, will not guarantee a
degree with honors. The degree with honors will be awarded for projects demonstrating a high degree
of scholarly achievement and self-motivation. All proposals must be submitted according to the
guidelines set out below. The timetable for submission of work, including specific dates, is available
in the Art Department office.
Students may select one of the following options:
1) Full-Year Thesis: Research and writing will be carried out during both semesters and WSP of the
senior year (students should register for ArtH 493-W031-494). The thesis topic, advisor and se-
cond reader must be determined by April 15 of junior year. Students who are on overseas pro-
grams junior year are advised to make arrangements prior to their departure, but they may submit
a final proposal two weeks before the fall semester of senior year if they have made the necessary
arrangements. After the thesis is submitted, the candidate for honors shall present an oral defense
before faculty and peers.
2) Half-Year Thesis: Research and writing will be carried out during fall term and winter study or dur-
ing winter study and spring term (Students should register for ArtH 493-W031 or W031-ArtH
494). For students who choose to complete the mini-thesis in the fall, proposals must be submitted
by April 15 of the junior year. For those planning to complete the mini-thesis in the spring, propos-
als must be submitted by November 1.
A student's project is judged by two members of the department, the advisor and second reader; in
the case of an interdisciplinary project, a member of the Art Department and a member of the other
relevant department or program function as advisor and second reader. In rare cases, a third reader
may be appointed by the department at the request of the advisor or second reader.
All routes require that one course and one WSP, in addition to the ten required courses for the major,
be dedicated to the honors project.
Art Studio: (for the Class of 2003)
The Art Studio division of the Art Department offers a specialization route toward departmental
honors. This route, which requires the completion of a substantial body of independently produced
visual work, consists of two courses constituting a clearly interrelated pattern of study. The first of
these must be a WSP 033 in the senior year, followed by ArtS 418T Senior Tutorial.
In the spring of the junior year, the student should consult with a prospective faculty adviser and
declare her/his intent to pursue the degree with honors to the department chair. Potential honors candi-
dates should submit a written proposal and visual documentation of prior work in the field, to the fac-
ulty adviser, on the first Monday in October, in the fall of the student's senior year. The proposal
should outline a concise and specific course of study in media with which the student can evidence
prior experience. The evidence is provided by the visual documentation, in the form of a slide portfo-
lio or video tape. Students should seek assistance from their advisers both on the written proposal and
the selection of visual documentation. The studio faculty, as a whole, will review the proposals and
support materials. The faculty adviser will inform the student of the faculty members' decision prior
to Winter Study registration. Students whose honors proposals are approved by the faculty must enroll
in WSP 033 and Arts 418T in the spring semester of the senior year. Members of the studio faculty will
review the work in progress, at the end of February. Only candidates who succeed to evidence a suffi-
Art
­ 65 ­
cient amount of work and substantial progress will be allowed to continue to pursue the degree with
honors.
To be considered for honors a student must successfully complete all requirements for the major.
Each honors candidate will be expected to have demonstrated the ability to work independently and
the understanding of what is required to develop a body of work that investigates a thesis. The project
will culminate in a presentation agreed upon by the student, the faculty advisor, and the faculty tutor
teaching ArtS 418T. All candidates will be required to present the department with a set of no fewer
than twenty slides that document the work completed during the project. This documentation will be
accompanied by a written description of the project.
The awarding of honors will be decided by the studio faculty of the department, on the recommen-
dation of the student's advisor and the faculty member teaching ArtS 418T, based on performance in
the two related courses. Highest honors are normally awarded only to students whose performance in
both the honors program and other courses in the major has been exceptional.
Art Studio: (starting with the Class of 2004)
Studio art concentrators who wish to be candidates for honors are required to add a 200-level
course, and to take the 400 level senior tutorial. An additional 300 level tutorial or 200 level course
must be added for a total of twelve courses.
Honors candidates enrolled in the senior tutorial must "evidence" prior experience in the media
chosen for the honors work. This "evidence" may consist of one or more 200-level courses in the me-
dium, course work at the 300 level and/or a slide portfolio demonstrating the student's proficiency in
the media chosen for the honors project. This work is presented to the senior tutorial instructor at the
start of the spring semester.
At the end of the spring semester, of the senior year, the honors candidate will orally defend his/her work
in the senior exhibition at WCMA. The entire studio faculty will attend the defense. Based on the work and
the oral defense, the studio faculty (as a whole) will designate honors, high honors or no honors.
History and Practice:
The route to honors is a combination of the Art Studio and Art History honors routes. At the begin-
ning of senior year, a candidate for honors in History and Practice makes a proposal to two faculty
members, one faculty advisor from each wing of the department. If both advisors agree to supervise
the project, the candidate enrolls in independent study and works through the fall semester and winter
study. The progress of the project is assessed by both advisors at the end of winter study; if the project
is not well enough developed, the advisors may end it at that time. If the project is allowed to move
forward, the student enrolls either in ArtS 418T Senior Tutorial, if the project is primarily a matter of
making art, or in an Honors Independent Study, if it is primarily a writing project. The final project is
submitted to the two advisors, who will determine whether or not it will receive honors.

ARTH 201(F) American Landscape History (Same as Environmental Studies 201)
This is a survey course stressing the description and historical geography of regional, vernacular American
settings, with the goal of discerning a national style of spatial or landscape organization. Among the hu-
man-altered environments to be studied are: forestlands, rangelands, croplands, outdoor recreational sites,
mines and quarries; small towns, milltowns, central business districts, and suburbs; power and utilities;
housing, industry, commerce, and institutional uses such as the American college campus; water, road, and
rail corridors as examples of circulation nets. Primary evidence will be visual.
One afternoon meeting each week provides discussion and field- or site-visit opportunities, and enables
classmembers to obtain a first-hand familiarity with a rural-urban gradient of representative land uses and
occupants of the Hoosic-Hudson watershed and Taconic upland region surrounding Williamstown, as well
as experience with interviewing and field study methodologies.
Requirements: several mini-tests, four term paper installments on the documentation of an evolving land-
scape site or behavior, short class presentation on research, as its "landscape" or type comes up for class or
lecture consideration, and an obligatory all-day field trip.

From the beginnings of Greek sculpture in the eighth century B.C.E. until the end of the Hellenistic period
in the first century B.C.E., the human figure remained the most prominent choice of subject for Greek
artists. This course is a survey of Greek sculpture in the first millennium B.C.E. with emphasis on ancient
Greek attitudes toward the body. We will consider the use of male and female figures, both human and
divine, from athletic, religious and funerary contexts, and from the dedications of individual figures to the
complex mythological narratives found on Greek temples. Reading material includes ancient literature in
translation as well as contemporary critical essays.

ARTH 223(F) Early Medieval Art and Architecture
A survey of the major works of architecture, sculpture, book illumination, monumental mural decora-
tion (mosaic and fresco) and the minor arts (ivory carving, metalwork, etc.) produced from Dura Eu-
ropos to Toledo and from the Fayum to the Isle of Iona between approximately 200 and 1050. Lec-
tures will focus on questions of style, content, function, patronage and audience in an attempt to con-
vey not only the remarkable diversity and inventiveness of early medieval artistic practice, but also
the central role that buildings, images and fashioned objects played in articulating and even shaping
early medieval life. Aiming to situate these works within their larger social, political, devotional, in-
tellectual as well as art-historical contexts, the course also hopes to demonstrate the unique power of
Art

the visual arts to provide access into an emerging European world whose values and concerns were
radically different from, and yet fundamental to, those of the modern West.

ARTH 224(S) Romanesque and Gothic Art and Architecture: The Medieval Church in
Context
The goal of this course is to survey the major works of ecclesiastical architecture, sculpture and
stained glass produced in France between approximately 1050 and 1400. These works were not
created in isolation from their surroundings, thus we will attempt to understand them not only stylisti-
cally, but also in their original functional, social, and sometimes even political settings. The course
will emphasize the abbey church and the cathedral, the two major ecclesiastical buildings of this peri-
od, as heterogeneous entities that used architecture, sculpture, stained glass and other media, in con-
junction with church ritual, to render their sacred spaces distinct from, and elevated above, the world
outside. We will furthermore try to appreciate the special centrality of the abbey church and the cathe-
dral in high medieval society. Sites for contact with God and for the development of advanced learn-
ing, they could also serve as critical determinants of local economic and political life, and as focuses
of pilgrimage, trade, and international cultural exchange.
Requirements: midterm, final, three to four short papers.
Hour: 2:35-3:50 MR LOW
ARTH 231(F) Italian Renaissance Art
An introduction to Italian painting, sculpture, and architecture from the fifteenth and sixteenth centu-
ries. Unlike other academic disciplines, art history continues to refer to this period as a renaissance or
"rebirth." Why is this the case? To what extent is this a useful definition? We will consider these ques-
tions by paying critical attention to the ideals that have come to define the Renaissance as a period of
astounding creativity and achievement in the visual arts: the rebirth of classical culture, renewed
attention to naturalism, and developing individuality and intellectual status of the artist. We will then
take up a series of thematic lenses (including religion, domestic life, gender identity, civic ritual, polit-
ical power, and artistic style) in order to pose questions about the character and purpose of art in differ-
ent social contexts. The goal of this course is not to present an exhaustive survey of the period, but
rather to provide a broad range of frames of reference for thinking about Renaissance art.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: a midterm, a final, and two papers.

Rembrandt van Rijn, Frans Hals, Jan Vermeer are only the best-known of the many artists who were
active in the northern Netherlands during the seventeenth century. The variety of their subjects was
unprecedented, but the degree of symbolic content in their work is disputed: to what extent was Dutch
painting an art of description or of hidden allegory? We will consider this problem and also give spe-
cial attention to the ongoing reinterpretations of Rembrandt's oeuvre and life.

An examination of the major movements and critical tendencies that defined American art of the
1960s and 1970s. Beginning with Pop and Minimalism's reconsideration of the relationship between
art and everyday life, the course will explore the wide range of post-Minimal work that has included
Conceptual art, Earthworks and Environmental art, Performance and Body art, and early Installation.
The impact of growing social and political unrest at the end of the 1960s, and the emergence of the
anti-war, feminist and black-power movements, will be considered in relation to a variety of artistic

found wanting. This course examines American architecture, painting, and sculpture on its own
terms, in the light of the social, ideological and economic forces that shaped it. Special attention will
be paid to such themes as the Puritan legacy and attitudes toward art; the making of art in a commercial
society; and the tension between the ideal and the real in American works of art.

ARTH 265(F) Pop Art (W)
The use of commercial and mass media imagery in art became recognized as an international phe-
nomenon in the early 1960s. Items such as comic strips, advertising, movie stills, television programs,
soup cans, "superstars" and a variety of other accessible and commonplace objects inspired the sub-
ject matter, form and technique. This course will critically examine the history and legacy of Pop Art
by focusing on its social and aesthetic contexts. An important component of the course involves de-
veloping skills in analyzing visual images, comparing them with other forms, and relating them to
their historical context.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: two short response papers, oral presentation, and one final

ARTH 278(F) The Golden Road to Samarqand*
The region comprising present day Iran, Afghanistan, Central Asia, Pakistan and India has a rich and
complex history. Home to Genghis Khan and Tamerlane, Akbar the Great and Shah Jahan, it has gen-
erated some of the most spectacular monuments (e.g. the Taj Mahal and the blue tiled mosques of
Isfahan) and refined manuscript painting ever known. We will look at these art forms from the tenth to
the seventeenth centuries, highlighting the patronage of key dynasties, including the Timurids of Sa-
marqand and the Mughals of India. An important issue throughout the course will be the impact that
Islam has had on the artistic traditions of this region.

ARTH 305(S) North American Suburbs (Same as Environmental Studies 305)
This course details the intentions, built forms, and historical unfolding of that environment which now
houses more Americans than either city or countryside. Among the topics to be discussed will be:
seminal suburban communities in various regions of Canada and the United States ; the quest for a
rural ideal and the celebration of a tamed outdoors; the extent to which suburbs are peculiarly environ-
ments for child-raising, with the attendant purport given in the modern age to youth; the successional
patterns as farmlands, or estates are subdivided and later even become part of a central business dis-
trict; the kaleidoscope of architectural styles and revivals; the manner in which these communities
may be products of their various linkage systems to a central place, or city; the degree to which they
are increasingly centers in their own right, with attendant automobile-induced horizontally; and the
unfolding historiography of the North-American suburb. For that historiography the seminar will s
scrutinize comparatively the work of such scholars or commentators as Binford, Gans, Kenneth Jack-
son, Mumford, Sies, Stilgoe, and Venturi.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: each classmember will conduct field studies on a suburb
or suburban element of his or her choosing; this research will be used in three papers. Upon them and

ARTH 308(S) (formerly 302) Three Cities (Same as Environmental Studies 308)
This field-oriented seminar attempts to understand comparatively the three-century evolution of the
built environment of the three cities comprising New York;s Capitol District: namely, Albany
(founded 1624), Schenectady (founded 1684), and Troy (founded 1798). To accomplish this goal,
some ten specific kinds of sites will be chosen for field visits, with class sessions devoted to the con-
textual history surrounding those locations. Among the sites illustrating successive design solutions
for specific kinds of urban activities will be: commercial core arrangements (First and River Streets in
Troy, State and North Pearl Streets and Central Avenue in Albany, the Colonie malls); residential dis-
tricts (including the Stockade neighborhood and G.E. plot in Schenectady, Washington Park in Troy,
State Street in Albany as well as subsequent suburbanization); industrial settings (such as Troy's rem-
nants, North Broadway in Albany, and the General Electric site in Schenectady); institutional sites
(such as Union College, R.P.I., the Emma Willard School, and SUNY Albany); the state government's
office and legislative arrangements in Albany (including the State House, State Office campus, and
Empire State Plaza); open space arrangements (such as the Albany and Oakwood rural cemeteries,
Washington and Prospect parks); circulatory arrangements, including Hudson river-front develop-
ments, the Erie canal, railroads, depots, and yards, streetcar impacts, and such vehicular-induced
spaces as carriage drives, garages and parking lots, strip developments, and limited access super high-
ways.
Format: seminar. Requirements: a final paper, to be written in two installments, will synthesize these
site-visits with course readings and general urban theory, in the context in the rise of the middle class,
the service sector, mobility, romanticism and other ideals resulting in urban alternatives; several in-
class presentations.

ARTH 310(S) Introduction to the History of Architectural Theory
This course will focus on the notion of mimesis as the backbone of Western architectural theory, and
will discuss the notion of imitation in architecture (in its double meaning, as imitation of nature and
imitation of archetypal buildings) in Vitruvius, Alberti and in modern Vitruvianism, as well as some
aspects of architectural imitation in the Middle Ages. The second section will highlight the develop-
ment of modern tectonic principles and the dialectics between rule and licence in some sixteenth-cen-
tury architectural treatises, particularly Serlio and Palladio. Finally, some later developments of the
mimetic principles will be briefly surveyed, particularly in the context of nineteenth-century histori-
cism (Ruskin), of early twentieth-century modernism (Le Corbusier), and of contemporary architec-
tural theory and criticism.

ARTH 330T(S) Michelangelo: Biography, Mythology, and the History of Art (W)
One could argue that Michelangelo's enduring fame, and his preeminence in the western art historical
canon, is as much a product of his artistic persona as his artistic achievement. Indeed, the modern
notion of the visual artist as a brooding, even tortured genius of unstoppable creative force finds its
roots in the Italian Renaissance. This is largely due to the singular figure of Michelangelo, whose life
and career are more fully documented than those of any western artist to precede him. And Michelan-
gelo's mythic individuality, alongside his artistic innovations and contributions, have made him a fun-
damental force in the shape of the history of art as we understand and study it today.
Students of this tutorial will become well-acquainted with the life and work of Michelangelo through
the examination of a wide variety of primary and secondary sources: contemporary Renaissance doc-
uments, letters, poetry, and biographies; art historical surveys, monographs, and studies; and docu-
mentary and popular film. They will give their critical attention, however, to the intersection between
this artist's biography and his artistic production. We will focus on a number of important questions
arising from this connection. What, for example, is the nature and reliability of the evidence used to
reconstruct Michelangelo's life and personality? What are the grounds for interpreting his work ac-
cording to his philosophical outlook, religious beliefs, and even sexuality? To what extent was Miche-
langelo responsible for shaping his own persona for posterity? Is the myth of this artist distinguishable
from his "reality?" And to what extent have all these issues shaped our own thinking about artists and
the history of art? Each student will write and present orally an essay of approximately seven double-
spaced pages every other week on the readings for that week. Students not presenting an essay will be
responsible for offering a critique of their colleague's work.

ARTH 360(S) Avant-Garde Film: Kenneth Anger, Jack Smith, and Andy Warhol
The history and legacy of three avant-garde filmmakers will be the focus of this course. In the 1960s,
such films were known as "underground" films because of their refusal of Hollywood conventions of
finish, clarity, and realism, but also because of their content, which often represented "unconvention-
al" sexualities and identities for the period. More recently, this work has been described as the emer-
gence of a queer cinema tradition. As we consider how these films vary in aesthetics and production
strategies from classical Hollywood cinema, we will address such issues as the politics of avant-gard-
ism and commercial culture, "high" vs. "low" art, as well as censorship and artistic freedom. One
important issue we will continually engage is the strategy of appropriating materials and techniques
from one domain (for instance, mass or popular culture) for use in "avant-garde" or experimental pro-
duction. Throughout the course, we will analyze the formal differences (i.e., use and manipulation of
space, time, style, structure, etc.) between each filmmaker and consider the relations, if any, between
formal experimentation and social transgression. Student presentations and research papers will pro-
vide the opportunity to analyze the influence of these filmmakers on other visual artists or areas of
visual and popular culture (i.e., art cinema, fashion, pornography, advertising, etc.). Film screenings
will be scheduled as a lab.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: two short papers, oral presentation, and one final research

ARTH 362(F) Art of California: "Sunshine or Noir" (Same as American Studies 362)
California has long been considered a land of "sunshine and noir," unique in the national and interna-
tional imagination as a land of physical recreation and destruction, a land of opportunity and social
unrest. In this course, we will study the visual arts and culture of California from the 1960s to the
present. Although we will focus on southern California, particularly Los Angeles, we will also con-
sider movements in San Diego and the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Area. The course will approach
California pop, conceptual, funk, performance, installation, public, and media arts to pursue questions
of influence and interpretation concerning the relations between space, place, identity, and style in the
visual arts and popular culture. Alongside analyzing California's visual culture, we will examine the
region's cultural geography through historical and theoretical readings. Particular attention will be
given to the region's special relations to Hollywood, the automobile, beach-surf culture, and the great
diversity that characterizes the state.
Evaluation will be based on two papers and a presentation.

ARTH 376(F) Images and Anti-Images: Zen Art in China and Japan*
This lecture-discussion course studies a variety of art forms (painting, ceramics, tea ceremony, and
garden) in the context of Zen in China and Japan. We will investigate the Zen aesthetic ideals and
religious meanings conveyed by these art forms. Special attention will be paid to the study of Zen
painting from the twelfth century to the fifteenth century, the golden age of Zen painting in both coun-
tries. Issues of interest include, for example, the meanings and functions of Zen painting, iconography
and its evolution, different patronage systems in China and Japan, and to what extent Japanese artists
tried to break away from their Chinese counterparts, while working with highly derivative material,
both iconographically and artistically.

ARTH 422(F) Making the Stones Speak: The Emergence and Development Of the
Romanesque Sculpted Portal
Beginning around the year 1000, European Christendom experienced a great ecclesiastical building boom.
According to a contemporary chronicler, "it was as if the whole earth, having cast off the old by shaking
itself, were clothing itself everywhere in the white robe of the church." During the course of the eleventh
century, the designers of these structures fashioned a new architectural language that we now label "Ro-
manesque." One of the most innovative and dramatic aspects of this new language was its assimilation of
monumental sculpture, absent in Europe since the fifth century. The focus of attention in this regard was
the portal, which marked the threshold between the profane realm of the outside world and the sacred
space of the church. This seminar will investigate the antecedents and origins of the Romanesque sculpted
portal and examine in detail its greatest manifestations. Emphasis will be placed on understanding these
often complex sculptural schemes within their original functional and physical contexts. What role did this
imagery play in structuring the medieval visitor's overall experience of the church? And what did it mean
to have this imagery carved into the very fabric of "God's temple"?
Requirements: class discussion, class presentation, 15- to 20-page research paper.

ARTH 432(F) Art and Private Life in Renaissance Italy
Today, Botticelli's Birth of Venus, Michelangelo s Doni Tondo, Leonardo's Mona Lisa, and Titian's
Venus of Urbino hang on museum walls, but each of these paintings was originally commissioned for
a specifically domestic setting. Paintings such as these helped to shape the very fabric of everyday life
for their original owners and viewers. This seminar focuses on the domestic setting as a physical, so-
cial, and historical context for the investigation of images once housed within the walls of the Renais-
sance palace (including devotional art, ritual objects, painted furniture, and portraiture). We will pose
questions regarding the relationship between these images and the families who lived with them, fo-
cusing especially on aspects of gender and identity.
Requirements: class discussion and presentations, a 15- to 20-page paper, and a possible field trip to
New York.
Prerequisites: ArtH 101-102. Enrollment limit: 12. Open to juniors and seniors as well as graduate

ARTH 448(S) Art about Art: 1400-2000 (W)
This thematic seminar will focus on depictions through which artists referred to their own profession
and its products. Images to be discussed include legends of the origin of art, self-portraits and other
portraits of artists, scenes of contemporary and historical artists in their studios, as well as finished art
on display. While tracking the major changes in imagery from the end of the Middle Ages through the
twentieth century (with some reference to earlier developments) we will analyze specific images,
comparing their implications with both the social conditions and the theoretical positions then current.
Requirements: a 2-page paper, two 12-page papers, and a class presentation.

ARTH 449(F) The Meanings of Poses in Baroque Art
Art of the 1600s (e.g., Rembrandt, Rubens, Caravaggio, Bernini, Poussin) represents a highpoint in
artists' ability and interest in conveying "the passions of the soul" through the actions of the body. The
range of feelings represented had never been broader than at this time. We will distinguish the individ-
ual from the conventional poses (e.g., for melancholy or admiration), track how long the conventional
poses had been in use, and consider which poses, if any, were favored by individual artists (e.g., Cara-
vaggio's repeated use of a pointing gesture).
Requirements: two oral reports and a 25-page paper (half due mid-way through the semester, the
whole paper at the end).

ART STUDIO COURSES
ARTS 100(F,S) Drawing I
The process of drawing develops a heightened awareness of the visual world. Your subjective experi-
ences and your objective experiences combine to form a larger perceptual understanding of the envi-
ronment in which you live. Drawing allows you an alternative use of these processes and provides a
format for stating what you know about the world. Drawing is an excellent means for improving your
skills in observing, seeing distinctions, and creating new meanings from your perceptions. This is an
introductory course which will investigate the properties of making an image on the two-dimensional
page. While drawing is an essential basis for much of the artmaking process, its use is not limited to
artists. Design, illustration, engineering, and science are among the many fields which incorporate
drawing.
There are three to five sections of ArtS 100 offered each semester. Although individual faculty mem-
bers teaching beginning drawing do not follow a common syllabus, they share common goals. Syllabi
for each section are available either from the secretary's office in the W. L. S. Spencer Art Building or
can be obtained on the Hector file server: Departments, Art, and then ArtS 100.
Evaluation will be based primarily on the quality and quantity of work produced as well as some atten-
tion to the student's progress. Lab fee.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20. Preference given to Art majors and first-year students. This
course cannot be taken on a pass/fail basis.

tions of markmaking. As with any discipline, familiarity with the rules allows the users to seek alter-
natives and develop definitions of how the drawing process can best be suited to their own visual vo-
cabulary. The range of exercises could include traditional materials on paper as well as combinations
of materials more commonly associated with non-art disciplines, i.e., computers, industrial materials,
literature, etc.
Evaluation will be based on evidence of each student's progress, as shown in a portfolio of drawings
made in class and as homework. Attendance and participation in class discussions are also considered

ARTS 255(F) Photographic Time and Space
An introduction to the practice of photography with an emphasis on the vision that is unique to the
camera: the particular manner in which three-dimensional reality is rendered on the two dimensional,
light-sensitive plane. The course will concentrate on the study and creation of imagery which is de-
pendent on the specificity of photographic vision. Students will receive instruction on the workings of
a 35mm camera (provided by the department), development of black and white film and basic print-
ing technique. Students will be asked to respond to a series of assignments. A substantial amount of
lab time, in addition to the class meetings, is necessary to complete these assignments. Students'
works are evaluated individually and in class critiques throughout the semester.
Evaluation will be based on the level of formal and technical competence of the portfolio as well as the
conceptual strength and sophistication of the work completed. Lab fee.

preconceived and accidents facilitated by the alchemy inherent in the basic properties of chemical
photography. Students will use a digital camera (provided by the department), learn to develop b/w
film and the basis of b/w printing technique. Students will be asked to respond to a series of both ana-
logue and digital assignments. A substantial amount of lab time, in addition to the class meetings, is

This is an inter-disciplinary video production workshop that explores visual strategies to produce and
re-produce performance practices. These performance practices include performance art, ritual,
dance, music, the spoken word, and media spectacles. At the theoretical level, we will study perfor-
mance as a practical, aesthetic and theoretical terrain, and as a historical site that produces knowledge
in its relationship to the politics and power of representation, culture and memory. We will engage
with various practices of documenting performance such as visual anthropology, docu-drama, ethno-
graphic surrealism, dance for the camera, and other experimental approaches.

[and] is based on engagement." So writes Suzanne Lacy, a long-time practitioner of such work. En-
gagement with members of the public is the premise on which this public art tutorial is founded. The
hands-on work of the class will consist in exploring issues directly relevant to our context and the lives
of those around us. Students do three projects--one on Place, one on Memory, and one on Communi-
ty Concerns; each student does individual projects discussed in the tutorial groups. Artwork of like
concerns, accompanied by readings, will preface the projects.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: readings plus directing one discussion on readings, exercises, three

ARTS 317T(F) The Miniature
This course will involve the critical analysis and production of works of art done on a small scale. If art
on the largest scale is inherently public in nature, what is the nature of the miniature? The miniature
has fulfilled many functions: images of remembrance, the portrait of a beloved, devotional objects, art
made as an object of contemplation and wonder. The language of the miniature is intimate, private,
and bears the authority of understatement. Our involvement with many works of art is likely to be
distanced, in time and in space. Our involvement with the miniature is close, highly personal, and
frequent. Course assignments will examine the inherent qualities of the work in miniature, and ask
students to create work to fulfill historically defined and innovative functions. The assigned work can
be executed in any medium in which the student has completed an introductory course. Students will
meet in pairs, together with the instructor, and the students will present critical responses to the works
in progress and upon completion. Readings will be assigned to focus this critical analysis. In addition
to the production of miniatures, each student will research and deliver critical presentations on related
contemporary or historical works.
Format: tutorial. Evaluation will be based on the quality of the assigned work, the engagement in the
critique process, and quality of presentations.

ARTS 319(F) Look/See: Strategies of Imaging
This Junior Seminar addresses the intersections of process and theory in order to strengthen analytical
skills of visual practitioners. The imagist of the twenty-first century will require knowledge that includes
but expands upon the perimeters of conventional imaging techniques. How imagists collect what they
require will necessitate correspondence with the processes of other visual practitioners. What do design-
ers, writers, scientists, philosophers, documentary film-makers, mathematicians see when they look at
their subject? What strategies are used to see and then re-present that view? Which are the best means of
studying surface, and how might we understand its difference [if any] from depth? Imagists from all
disciplines bring into view that which has been neglected, forgotten or never considered. What are their
means of accomplishing this and to whom might emerging practitioners receive guidance for critical
analysis? This course, through the presentations and readings of several guest speakers, will speak to the
issues of looking at the subject, seeing the significance of the subject and translating that view into strate-
gies for imaging.
Requirements: a substantial amount of critical reading and viewing and five studio production assign-
ments will be completed throughout the semester. In addition to critiques of individual projects, the final
grade will be based upon a portfolio that includes 20-30 slides of work produced during the term, an
artist statement, an art resume, and a 5-page essay.
The course is limited to Art majors and is required of junior Art majors.

The primary emphasis of the senior tutorial is on strengthening the student's skill and sensitivity in
using critical analysis for the creation of visual objects and/or events. At the beginning of the term,
studio art majors, in consultation with the tutor, will determine the individual projects that will serve
as the focus of their work for the semester. During the course, students are expected to refine their
creative directions in a coherent and structured body of work which will be exhibited at the Williams
College Museum of Art. Students are responsible for buying their own materials.
Prerequisites: completion of all other studio courses required for the art studio route. Enrollment limit:
18. Senior Art majors who wish to pursue a more structured course are encouraged to take a second
300-level tutorial instead of 418T. Independent study with a studio faculty member will also fulfill the

functional objects have been and are interpreted. Class discussion will include distinction between
"fine arts," "decorative arts," and "design"; role and limitation of connoisseurship; the current rela-
tionship of object study to aesthetics, social history, history of technology, anthropology, sociology,
gender and ethnic studies; the effect of the market on history and scholarship; and current theories on
the role of objects in human life.

ARTH 504(F) Methods of Art History and Criticism
This is a seminar in the intellectual history of the history of art, with some concentration on the ways in
which this disciplinary tradition has been challenged by recent critical theory. It will begin its study with the
"founders" of the field and end with issues and problems that generated the "new art history" twenty years
ago and "visual studies" in the last decade. Topics to be covered include: style, iconography/iconology,
semiotics, identity politics, formalism, deconstruction, phenomenology, psychoanalysis, feminism, Marx-
ism, and gender studies. Resident Clark Fellows will occasionally talk to us on perspectives of their choice.
Requirements: each student will write several very short papers and one concluding essay, as well as pres-
ent a couple of the readings to the class.
Enrollment limited to and required of first-year students in the Graduate Program in the History of Art.

ARTH 505(S) Compasses to Computers: Principles and Devices of Architectural Design in the
Classical Tradition
Precision in building was aimed at and achieved well before the rise of modern science and technolo-
gy. The classical system of the orders, both in its ancient format and in its early-modern renaissance, is
based on exactly repeatable, almost standardized parts and components, precisely measured and pro-
portioned with excruciating, almost unimaginable accuracy. This course will explain the basic prin-
ciples of the classical system of the architectural orders, how they were designed and built, emphasiz-
ing the complementary roles of geometry and arithmetic in renaissance architecture, as well as the
general rise of number-based tools of quantification in modern architectural theory and practice. Ad-
ditionally, a brief survey of the design processes in the works of architects such as Frank Gehry, Greg
Lynn, and Bernard Cache will introduce a discussion on the continuity between classical geometry
and numeracy, and contemporary computer-based design.
Format: seminar. Requirements/evaluation: active and informed participation in the seminar, an oral
research paper, to be presented in revised, written form at the end of the semester.
Hour: TBA CARPO
ARTH 506(F) The Print: History, Theory, and Practice
Centered around the Clark Art Institute's print collection, this seminar will introduce its participants to
the study of Western prints from the Renaissance to the nineteenth century (with an emphasis, this
semester, on Old Master materials). We will review the various methods of printmaking as well as the
primary elements of print connoisseurship. Through a series of close readings of historical texts, we
will explore aspects of artistic practice, theory, and collecting.
Requirements: each participant will lead discussions of several reading assignments and turn in short
written reports, in addition to a final term paper.
Enrollment limit: 11. Preference given to second-year students in the Graduate Program in the Histo-
ry of Art.

ARTH 508(S) Art and Conservation: An Inquiry into History, Methods, and Materials (Same
as ArtH 408)
This course is designed to acquaint students with observation and examination techniques for works
of art, artifacts, and decorative art objects; give them an understanding of the history of artist materials
and methods; and familiarize them with the ethics and procedures of conservation. This is not a con-
servation training course but is structured to provide a broader awareness for those who are planning
careers involving work with cultural objects.
Format: slide presentations, lectures, gallery talks, hands-on opportunities, technical examinations,
and group discussions. Sessions will be held at the Williamstown Art Conservation Center, Williams
College, Clark Art Institute, and the Governor A. Nelson Rockefeller Empire State Plaza Art Collec-
tion in New York. Examination questions may be formulated from exhibitions at these locations.
Evaluation will be based on six exams. Exam scores will be weighed in proportion to the number of
sessions covered by the exam (e.g., the paintings exam, derived from six sessions in the course, will
count as 25% of the final grade). There is no overall final exam. Some exams may be designated
"open book"; however, all work should be a student's individual effort.

ARTH 511(S) Dionysos in Greek Art, Poetry, and Ritual
In this interdisciplinary seminar, we will examine the representation of Dionysiac myth and ritual in
ancient Greek art and poetry. We will pay close attention to the nature of the relationship between
myth and ritual; to the complex connections between Dionysiac ritual and dramatic performance; and
to the contributions of the visual arts to the articulation of those relationships. Most of the works of art
to be considered in the course date from the Archaic and Classical periods, but important works of art
from the Roman period will be included. Reading assignments will include Euripides' Bakchai, Aris-
tophanes' Acharnians, Nietzsche's Birth of Tragedy, as well as contemporary scholarship on Greek
mythology and ritual, Greek conviviality, and visual narration in Greek art.
Requirements: short presentations, participation in discussions, and a final paper.

This seminar will investigate the development of the theater as an architectural form in Italy from the
fifteenth through the seventeenth centuries--from its beginnings in the residences of rulers and prel-
ates to the flowering of the Italian public opera house in the seventeenth century. The development of
scene design during the same period will also be considered. The material lends itself to interdisciplin-
ary work, combining, for instance, art history with music, theater, and/or social history.
Evaluation will be based on class participation, an oral presentation, and a final paper. Some reading

LANGUAGE COURSES
Reading proficiency in two European languages is required for the M.A. degree in Art History at Wil-
liams, and provision for attainment of this qualification is an integral part of the program of study. Of these
two, German is required, and French is recommended. Elementary and intermediate undergraduate
courses offered by the language departments are open to graduate students, and the graduate program of-
fers advanced, one-semester courses in French and German art-history readings. A student who begins
elementary language study after enrollment in the program should expect to take a sequence of courses.
Details may be obtained from the Graduate Program office. Entering students with some previous lan-
guage background will be asked to take a standard reading examination for purposes of placement. A score
of 500 is required for admission to the advanced course. Students with scores below 500 will be enrolled in
elementary language courses. Students should aim to complete all language work no later than the end of
the third semester.
To satisfy the requirement in each of the two required languages, a student must: (a) score 700 or better
on the SAT II reading examination upon enrollment in the program or, (b) complete punctually and satis-
factorily (B- or better) all assignments and tests in the advanced courses. The same standards and expecta-
tions apply to language courses as to other courses and seminars.

STUDY ABROAD
Students intending to major in Asian Studies are encouraged to study in Asia during one or both
semesters of their junior year. Williams sponsors study abroad programs in China and Japan. Oppor-
tunities to study in India, Indonesia, Korea, Thailand, and other Asian countries are also available.
Prospective Asian Studies majors who are planning to study abroad should discuss their plans with
their advisor as far in advance as possible. Up to eight courses taken overseas can count toward gradu-
ation, and up to four courses taken overseas may be counted toward the major.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS
Students interested in writing an honors thesis in Asian Studies, Chinese, or Japanese should sub-
mit a proposal to the department chair when they register for courses in the spring of their junior year.
The proposal should include a statement of the topic, a general description of the types of materials
available for study and how the study will be carried out, and the name of the faculty member who will
serve as advisor. Admission to the honors thesis program will normally be limited to students who
have maintained at least a B+ average in their courses for the major.
Students admitted to the program should register for ASST 493-W031-494, CHIN 493-W031-494,
or JAPN 493-W031-494. They will be expected to turn in the final draft of their thesis shortly after
spring break and to discuss their results formally with their faculty graders. Their final grades in the
three courses listed above and the award of Honors, Highest Honors, or no honors will be determined
by the quality of the thesis and the student's performance in the oral defense.
THE ASIAN STUDIES ENDOWMENT
The Linen summer grants for study abroad, the Linen visiting professorships, and several other
programmatic activities in the department are supported by an endowment for Asian Studies estab-
lished by family and friends in memory of James A. Linen III, Class of 1934, Trustee of the College
from 1948 to 1953 and from 1963 to 1982.

COURSES IN CHINESE (Div. I)
The department regularly offers four levels of instruction in Modern Standard Chinese (Mandarin), de-
signed to enable the student to become proficient in aural comprehension, speaking, reading, and writing,
as well as introductory courses in Cantonese, Taiwanese, Classical Chinese, and Chinese linguistics. The
course numbering system for Chinese is sequential. Students move from Chinese 101-102 to 201, 202,
301, 302, 401, and 402. Independent study (Chinese 497, 498) may be offered depending on student needs
and available resources; interested students must contact the coordinator of the Chinese Program well be-
fore the independent study is planned, and present a proposal to the program coordinator of the professor
with whom they are interested in working by the first day of pre-registration week. Those students entering
with proficiency in Chinese should see the program coordinator concerning placement.
The department also offers courses on Chinese literature in translation for those students who have no
knowledge of the language but who wish to become acquainted with the major achievements in Chinese
literary and intellectual history. For the purpose of the distribution requirement, all courses in Chinese are
considered Division I.
CHIN 101(F)-W088-102(S) Basic Chinese*
An introduction to Mandarin, the language with the largest number of native speakers in the world,
which is the official language of mainland China and Taiwan, and one of the official languages of
Singapore. Course objectives are for the student to develop simple, practical conversational skills and
acquire a basic proficiency in reading and writing in both the traditional and the simplified script at
about the 500-character level. This course, which assumes no prior background in Chinese, will con-
sist of approximately 60% training in speaking and listening with the other 40% spent on reading and
writing. Classes consist of a combination of "act" classes, conducted exclusively in Mandarin, where
students use the language in various types of drills and communicative activities; and "fact" classes,
conducted in Mandarin and English, where students learn about the language and culture. Both audio-
tapes and videotapes will be employed extensively.
Evaluation will be based on daily classroom performance, homework, quizzes, weekly tests, and a
final exam.
Credit granted only if both semesters and the winter study sustaining program are taken.

CHIN 152(S) Basic Taiwanese*
An introduction to Taiwanese, the majority language of Taiwan. Different varieties of this language,
which is also known as Amoy, Southern Min, Hokkien, and Fukienese, are spoken by over 40 million
people in Taiwan, southern Fujian, the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore. Suppressed
by the Japanese from 1895-1945 and by the KMT Chinese government from 1945 through the 1970s,
Taiwanese--in both its spoken and written forms--has been experiencing a fascinating revival in re-
cent years. This language, which is the most divergent of all the major Chinese "dialects," is of special
linguistic interest because it has preserved a number of features of Old Chinese. Our focus will be on
developing basic listening and speaking skills, though we will also study some of the special charac-
ters used to write Taiwanese. Since students in the course will ordinarily possess prior proficiency in
Mandarin, a related language, we should be able to cover in one semester about as much as is covered
in the first two semesters of Mandarin.

CHIN 222(F) Chinese Cinema (Same as Comparative Literature 272)*
The goal of this course is to provide students with basic knowledge about Chinese cinema and to help
students understand Chinese cinema against a cultural, historical, social, and political background.
Framed within the history of Chinese cinema in the twentieth century, this course emphasizes the ar-
tistic and political aspects of the movies made by the "Fifth generation" directors in the 1980s and
1990s. This course also introduces students to a critical scheme for cinema discussion: describing the
story of a movie, interpreting the movie, evaluating the movie, and theorizing personal opinions about
the movie.
Requirements: no exams, one short paper (5-7 pages), one longer paper (15 pages), and one presenta-
tion (with paper or notes). Participation of class discussions is taken into account.
Format: lecture/discussion. No enrollment limit (expected: 15). Preference given to Asian Studies,
Chinese and Japanese majors.
Hour: 2:35-3:50 MR DUAN
CHIN 223(S) Survey of Chinese Literature (Same as Comparative Literature 273)*
The goal of this course is to provide students with basic knowledge about Chinese literature and to
help students understand Chinese literature in its historical setting. Covering both classical and mod-
ern Chinese literature, this course emphasizes four major genres: poetry, prose, drama, and fiction.
Framed within a historical survey of the development of Chinese literature, this course focuses on an
analytical and interpretive reading of the major works in English translation, which represent the main
achievements of each genre. This course also introduces students to a critical scheme for literature
discussion, i.e., how to read literary works at formal, rhetorical, aesthetic, and conceptual levels.
Requirements: no exams, one short paper (5-7 pages), one longer paper (15 pages), and one presenta-
tion (with paper or notes). Participation of class discussions is taken into account.
Format: lecture/discussion. No enrollment limit (expected: 15). Preference given to Asian Studies,

Hour: 1:10-2:25 MR DUAN
CHIN 301(F), 302(S) Upper-Intermediate Chinese*
Although the oral skills will continue to receive attention, there is at this level increased emphasis on
reading and writing. A major goal of the course will be developing students' reading proficiency in
standard written Chinese, the grammar and vocabulary of which differ considerably from the collo-
quial written Chinese which was introduced during the first two years of instruction. About half of the
course will be devoted to newspaper reading, with the remainder consisting of several modules that
may include short selections from modern Chinese fiction, films, or other types of performance litera-
ture. Both simplified and traditional character texts will be used. Conducted in Mandarin.

CHIN 412(S) Introduction to Classical Chinese*
Also termed Literary Chinese in English and Wenyan or Gudai Hanyu in Chinese, Classical Chinese
was the standard written language of China from around the fifth century BC until the 1920s and
served for many centuries as the written lingua franca of China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam. More-
over, remnants of Classical Chinese are still used frequently in Modern Chinese, in both writing (e.g.,
newspaper and road signs) and speech (e.g., proverbs and aphorisms). After several weeks of study of
basic grammar and vocabulary, we will read short texts in literature, history, and philosophy from the
works of authors such as Confucius, Mencius, Laozi, Zhuangzi, Sima Qian, and the Tang poets Li Bai
and Du Fu. While the main objective is to develop reading proficiency in Classical Chinese, the
course also serves to enhance proficiency in Modern Chinese through classroom discussion in Man-
darin, translation of Classical Chinese into Modern Chinese, and comparison of Classical Chinese and
Modern Chinese vocabulary and grammar. Conducted in Mandarin.
Evaluation will be based on classroom performance, homework, tests, and a final exam.
Prerequisites: Chinese 202 or permission of instructor.
Hour: 2:35-3:50 TF DUAN
CHIN 431(F) Introduction to Chinese Linguistics (Same as Linguistics 431)*
Is Chinese--whose nouns "lack" number and whose verbs have no tense--a monosyllabic, "primi-
tive" language? Are the Chinese characters a system of logical symbols or "idiographs," which indi-
cate meaning directly without regard to sound? Should (and could) the characters be done away with
and alphabetized? Are Cantonese, Hakka, and Taiwanese dialects or languages? And what is the rela-
tionship between Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese? These are some of the questions we
will be taking up in this one-semester introduction to the scientific study of the Chinese language.
Topics to be covered include: the phonological, syntactical, and lexical structure of Modern Standard
Chinese; the Chinese writing system; the modern Chinese dialects; the history of the Chinese lan-
guage; sociolinguistic aspects of Chinese; language and politics in the Chinese-speaking countries;
and the teaching of Chinese as a foreign/second language. Readings in English and Chinese, with
class discussion conducted primarily in Mandarin.
Evaluation will be based on classroom performance, homework, two short papers, and one longer
paper.
Prerequisites: Chinese 301 or permission of instructor.

COURSES IN JAPANESE (Div. I)
The department regularly offers four levels of language instruction in Modern Japanese, designed to
enable the student to become proficient in aural comprehension, speaking, reading, and writing. Courses in
Japanese literature in translation are also offered. The course numbering system for Japanese is sequential.
Students move from Japanese 101-102 to 201, 202, 301, 302, 401, and 402. Independent Study (Japanese
497, 498) is offered for students who have completed 402 or the equivalent, depending on student needs
and available resources. Students interested in pursuing an independent study must contact the coordinator
of the Japanese Program well before the semester, and present a proposal to the professor with whom they
are interested in working by the first day of pre-registration week, Those students entering with previous
proficiency in Japanese should see Professor Yamada concerning placement. For the purpose of the dis-
tribution requirement, all courses in Japanese are considered Division I.
JAPN 101(F)-W088-102(S) First-Year Japanese*
An introduction to modern spoken and written Japanese, the course will emphasize oral skills in the fall
semester, with somewhat more reading and writing in the spring. The relationship between language
and culture and the sociolinguistically appropriate use of language will be stressed throughout. Both
videotapes and audiotapes will be used extensively. Classes consist of a combination of "act" classes,
conducted exclusively in Japanese, where students use the language in various types of drills and com-
municative activities, and "fact" classes, conducted in Japanese and English, where students learn
about thelanguageandculture.
Evaluation will be based on daily classroom performance, homework, quizzes, a midterm, and a final
exam.

JAPN 252(F) The Masks of Japanese Literature (Same as Comparative Literature 262)*
From the masks of the noh theater to science fiction fantasies of plastic surgery, this course examines
the device of the mask in modern Japanese fiction and films, as well as some of their premodern ante-
cedents. The fictional masks we will look at range from the traditional to the technological, from the
actual to the metaphorical, from the physical to the purely psychological. But all of them are used by
the authors to explore the nature of identity, and the significance of concealing or revealing the self,
either in fiction or face to face. All texts are translated or subtitled in English.

ASTRONOMY (Div. III)
Chair, Professor KAREN B. KWITTER
Professors: KWITTER, PASACHOFF. Observatory Supervisor/Instructor: SOUZA.
Why is the sky dark at night? What are those mysterious twinkling lights that dot the nighttime sky?
What is Earth's place in the Universe? Astronomy is the science that asks and tries to answer questions
like these. We have come a long way toward understanding what makes the sky appear as it does and
how the Universe is fashioned. The Astronomy Department offers courses for anyone who is inter-
ested in learning about the Universe, and who would like to be able to follow new astronomical dis-
coveries as they are made. All courses in Astronomy satisfy the Division III requirement. The Astro-
physics major, administered jointly with the Physics Department, and the Astronomy major, are de-
scribed below.
The beginning astronomy courses are offered on two levels. Astronomy 101, 102, 104, and
330-type courses are intended primarily for non-science majors, and have no prerequisite. Astrono-
my 111 is designed for students with some exposure to or interest in physics. It has a prerequisite of
one year of high school physics or permission of the instructor, and a corequisite of Mathematics
104 or equivalent background in calculus.
Most of the astronomy courses take advantage of our observational and computational facilities
including a 24" computer-controlled telescope with sensitive electronic detectors, and our own com-
puter network for image processing and data analysis. The Astronomy Department homepage can be
found at http://www.williams.edu/Astronomy.
ASTROPHYSICS MAJOR
The Astrophysics major is designed for students who want a rigorous introduction to the field,
and includes not only those who plan graduate study in astronomy, astrophysics, or a closely related
area, but also those interested in a wide variety of careers. Alumni are not only astronomers but also
computer scientists, geologists, teachers, doctors, lawyers, business school professors, and so on.
In recent years, many astrophysics majors have had a second major in fields as wide ranging as
mathematics, geosciences, economics, and art history. This major emphasizes the description of the
Universe and its constituents in terms of physical processes. Potential Astrophysics majors should
consult early with members of the Astronomy and Physics Departments to determine their most
appropriate route to and through the major. An essential ingredient in such students' undergraduate
training is experience in physics and mathematics. Therefore, the major normally will begin in the
first year a student is at Williams with Physics 131, 141, or 151 and Mathematics 104 or 105/106 in
the fall. Students with very good background placing them out of Physics 142 and out of Mathemat-
ics 104 may choose to take Physics 201 and Mathematics 105/106 instead. Astronomy 111 will
often be taken in the fall of the sophomore year; however, many students take it in the fall of their
first year at Williams, along with physics and math. Students who might place out of physics
courses should read the section on placement under Physics. Students who place out of Physics 131
or 141 into Physics 142 or 151 should particularly consider taking Astronomy 111 in the fall of their
first year.
In addition to the major courses described below, other courses in geosciences, mathematics, and
computer science may also be appropriate.

The total number of courses required for the Astrophysics major, an interdisciplinary major, is elev-
en. Students entering with Advanced Placement in physics and/or mathematics may obtain credit to-
ward the major for the equivalent of Physics 141 and/or Mathematics 104 and/or 105/106 taken else-
where, but at least 8 courses in astronomy, physics, and mathematics must be taken at Williams. There
are some aspects of astrophysics that are closely related to chemistry or geosciences. In recognition of
this relation, certain advanced courses in those departments can be accepted for credit toward the As-
trophysics major on a two-for-one basis. It is not possible to double major in Astrophysics and Phys-
ics.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN ASTROPHYSICS
The honors degree in Astrophysics will be awarded on the basis of a senior thesis presenting the
results of an original observational, experimental, or theoretical investigation carried out by the stu-
dent under the direction of a faculty member in Astronomy or Physics. There are no specific grade
requirements (other than College-wide requirements for remaining in good academic standing) for
entry into the thesis research program; however, a student wishing to do a thesis should have demon-
strated both ability and motivation for independent work in previous courses and in any earlier re-
search involvement. Students doing theses will normally choose a topic and an advisor early in the
second semester of their junior year. During the senior year, those students whose proposals have been
approved will elect two courses and a winter study project in addition to the minimum requirements
for the major. Preparation for the thesis will occupy at least one course (Astrophysics 493) and the
winter study project (Astrophysics 031). At the end of the winter study period, the departments will
decide, in consultation with each student, whether to admit that student to honors candidacy. Both a
written thesis and an oral presentation to faculty and fellow students are required. The degree with
honors will be awarded to those who meet these requirements with distinction. The degree with high-
est honors will be awarded to those who fulfill the requirements with unusually high distinction.
The departments will be flexible with regard to the number and timing of courses devoted to thesis
research within the general guidelines of two courses and a winter study project over and above the
minimum major requirements and the written and oral presentations, especially in cases of students
with advanced standing and/or summer research experience. Students considering unusual requests
are urged to consult with potential advisors or the department chairs as early as possible.
ASTRONOMY MAJOR
The Astronomy major is designed for students with an interest in learning about many aspects of
modern astronomy, but who do not choose to take the advanced physics courses of the astrophysics
major. It is also appropriate as a second major for students concentrating in another field. The Astron-
omy major emphasizes understanding the observed properties of the physical systems that comprise
the known Universe, from the Sun and solar system, to the evolution of stars and star clusters, to the
Milky Way Galaxy, to external galaxies and clusters of galaxies. Because some knowledge of physics
and calculus is necessary to understand many astronomical phenomena, the Astronomy major re-
quires the first two semesters each of the physics and calculus that are also required of Physics majors
and Astrophysics majors.
There are several possible routes through the Astronomy major, depending on preparation and in-
terest. Students considering a major in Astronomy should consult with members of the department
early and often. A first-year student, unsure about choosing between Astronomy and Astrophysics,
may wish to take not only Astronomy 111 but also Physics 131, 141, or 151 and Mathematics 104 (if
necessary) in the fall. Students who might place out of physics courses should read the section on
placement under Physics.

those departments can be accepted for credit toward the Astronomy major.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN ASTRONOMY
The honors degree in Astronomy will be awarded on the basis of a senior thesis presenting the re-
sults of an original observational, experimental, or theoretical investigation carried out by the student
under the direction of a faculty member in Astronomy. There are no specific grade requirements (oth-
er than College-wide requirements for remaining in good academic standing) for entry into the thesis

Biochemistry and molecular biology are dynamic fields which lie at the forefront of science.
Through elucidation of the structure and function of biologically important molecules (such as nucle-
ic acids, lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates) these disciplines have provided important insights and
advances in the fields of molecular engineering (recombinant DNA technology, "intelligent" drug
design, "in vitro evolution"), genomics and proteomics, signal transduction, immunology, develop-
mental biology, and evolution.
The Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Program is designed to provide students with an oppor-
tunity to explore living systems in molecular terms. Biochemistry and molecular biology are at the
Biochemistry and Molecular Biology
­ 92 ­
interface between the chemical and biological methods of looking at nature, therefore, the program
draws heavily from these disciplines. While chemistry is concerned with the relationship between
molecular structure and reactions, and biology focuses on cells and organisms, biochemistry and mo-
lecular biology probe the details of the structures and interactions of molecules in living systems in
order to provide the foundation for a better understanding of biological molecules both individually
and as members of more complex structures.
PROGRAM
While aspects of biochemistry and molecular biology can be very diverse, a common set of chemi-
cal and biological principles underlie the more advanced topics. With this in mind, the program has
been structured to provide the necessary background in chemistry and biology and the opportunity to
study the many facets of the modern areas of the biochemical sciences. Students interested in the Bio-
chemistry and Molecular Biology Program should plan their course selection carefully. Since it is ex-
pected that Biochemistry 321 would be taken in the junior year, students are advised to take the pre-
requisites for this course in both chemistry and biology during their first two years at Williams. While
the program is open to all students, it is expected that it will appeal primarily to majors in biology and
chemistry because of the number of courses required in those fields. In addition to taking the required
courses, students planning to complete the Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Program are strong-
ly encouraged to elect courses in mathematics and physics. In addition, students contemplating at-
tending graduate school in biochemistry or a related field are strongly encouraged to take BIOL/
CHEM 322.
THE FOLLOWING INTERDEPARTMENTAL COURSES SERVE AS THE CORE OF THE
BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY PROGRAM
BIMO 321 provides an introduction to biochemistry and molecular biology. BIMO 401, the cap-
stone course for the concentration, provides students the opportunity to examine the current scientific
literature in a wide variety of BIMO-related research areas.
BIMO 321(F) Biochemistry I--Structure and Function of Biological Molecules (Same as
Biology 321 and Chemistry 321)
This course introduces the basic concepts of biochemistry with an emphasis on the structure and func-
tion of biological macromolecules. Specifically, the structure of proteins and nucleic acids are ex-
amined in detail in order to determine how their chemical properties and their biological behavior
result from those structures. Other topics covered include enzyme kinetics, mechanism and cataly-
sis and regulation; the molecular organization of biomembranes and the flow of information from
nucleic acids to proteins. In addition, the principles and applications of the methods used to character-
ize macromolecules in solution and the interactions between macromolecules are discussed.
The laboratory provides an opportunity to study the structure of macromolecules and to learn the fun-
damental experimental techniques of biochemistry including electrophoresis, chromatography, and
principles of enzymatic assays.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, four hours per week. Evaluation will be based on a
final exam, problem sets and performance in the laboratories including lab reports.
Prerequisites: Chemistry 251 and Biology 101. No enrollment limit (expected: 25).
Hour: 10:00-10:50 MWF Lab: 1-5 W,R GEHRING
BIMO 401(S) (formerly 406) Topics in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology
This seminar course involves a critical reading, analysis, and discussion of papers from the current
biochemistry and molecular biology literature. Specific topics vary from year to year but are chosen
to illustrate the importance of a wide range of both biological and chemical approaches to address-
ing important questions in the biochemical and molecular biological fields.
Format: seminar, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on class discussions and presenta-
tions, several short papers, and a final paper.
Prerequisites: Biology 202 and BIMO 321. Enrollment limit: 12 (expected: 8). Preference given to
those completing the BIMO program; open to others with permission of instructors.
Hour: 1:10-3:50 W GEHRING and RAYMOND
To complete the concentration in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, a student must complete all of the
required courses listed below, take two electives from the list below (one must have a laboratory compo-
nent), and attend at least eight Biology and/or Chemistry Department colloquia. Since the Chemistry De-
partment counts two biology courses and the Biology Department counts two chemistry courses toward
the majors (each of which can be completed with only eight other courses), a student majoring in either
chemistry or biology would have to take only two or three additional courses to complete the program.

entists from other academic or research institutions are invited to present their research to students and
faculty. There are approximately a dozen colloquia offered each semester among which BIMO concentra-
tors may choose. Attendance at the honors student research presentations and the spring BIMO Alumni
Reunion poster session also count toward the colloquium requirement. Concentrators may receive credit
for colloquia attended during any of their semesters at Williams College.

The Biology curriculum has been designed to provide students a broad base for understanding prin-
ciples governing life processes at all levels, from biochemistry and cell biology to physiology to ecol-
ogy and behavior. Courses emphasize fundamentals common to all subdisciplines including the cou-
pling of structure to function, the transfer of energy in living systems, communication, and the mold-
ing of diversity by the evolutionary process. In upper-level courses and in independent and honors
research, students have the opportunity to investigate areas at the frontiers of modern biology.
Although the Biology major is specifically designed to provide a balanced curriculum in the broad-
er context of the liberal arts, it is also excellent preparation for graduate studies in the life sciences and
in the health professions.
MAJOR REQUIREMENTS
In order to make the major accessible to students with diverse interests, required courses are kept to
a minimum. The Biology major is satisfied by nine courses, as follows:
Biology 101 The Cell
Biology 102 The Organism
Biology 202 Genetics
Any two 300-level courses, one of which must have a laboratory associated with it.
Any one 400-level course other than 493-494.
Any other three courses or any other two courses and two semesters of Organic Chemistry.
Biology
­ 94 ­
NOTE: Independent study courses and AMS 311 (Same as Biology 231) do not fulfill the 300-level
or 400-level course requirements. Both WIOX 215, Biology: Ecology of Flowering Plants, and
WIOX 216, Biology: Evolution, in the Williams Oxford Program qualify for major credit.
Distribution Requirement
In order to ensure that majors broaden their knowledge of biology, one of the elective courses for
the major must include an upper-level course covering biological processes at levels of organization
above the cell. Courses that satisfy this distribution requirement are indicated in the individual course
description.
COURSE SELECTION AND PLACEMENT
It is preferable for students who plan to major in biology, or think they may be interested in doing
so, to take Biology 101, 102 during their first year at Williams. It is also possible to begin the Biology
major during the sophomore year, although students should understand that it may require taking two
or more biology courses during several semesters.
Students interested in biology, whether or not they intend to major in it, are encouraged to take Biol-
ogy 101, 102. It is also possible, with permission of the department, to take Biology 203 Ecology,
Biology 204 Animal Behavior, and Biology 220 Field Botany without prerequisite. Other biology
courses designed specifically for students who do not intend to take additional upper-level courses in
biology include Biology 132 Human Biology and Social Issues, Biology 134 The Tropics: Biology
and Social Issues, and Biology 133 Biology of Exercise and Nutrition. All of these courses satisfy the
Division III distribution requirement; in addition, Biology 134 satisfies the Peoples and Cultures dis-
tribution requirement.
Beginning students should normally enroll in Biology 101 and 102. Students with unusually strong
backgrounds in biology, such as those with outstanding performance on the College Board Biology
Advanced Placement Test, may be permitted to elect a sophomore-level course in lieu of Biology 101
and/or Biology 102 upon successful completion of a departmental qualifying exam, administered
during First Days.
COURSES RELATED TO THE BIOLOGY MAJOR
Students planning to pursue their interest in biology and related fields after completing their under-
graduate degrees are strongly encouraged to take one year of chemistry, at least one semester of math-
ematics (a course in statistics is recommended), and one semester of Physics. Students may wish to
check the requirements for graduate admission at relevant universities, and are also encouraged to
consult with the Biology Department's graduate school advisor, Professor Raymond, about prerequi-
sites for admission to graduate programs.
BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
Students interested in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (BIMO) should consult the general
statement under Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.
NEUROSCIENCE
Students interested in Neuroscience (NSCI) should consult the general statement under Neurosci-
ence.
ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
Students interested in Environmental Studies (ENVI) should consult the general statement under
Environmental Studies.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN BIOLOGY
In order to be recommended for the degree with honors, a Biology major is normally expected to
have completed the equivalent of two semesters and a winter study (031) of independent research
culminating in a thesis which demonstrates outstanding achievement of an original and innovative
nature. Although the presentation of a thesis and associated oral presentation in the fall and poster
defense in the spring are required for consideration for a degree with honors, their completion should
not be interpreted as a guarantee of a degree with honors. The principal considerations in admitting a
student to the program of independent honors research will be mastery of fundamental material and
skills, ability to pursue independent study successfully, and demonstrated interest and motivation.
Students interested in participating in the honors program should consult with the department early in
the spring semester of the junior year; approval must be received before spring registration in the ju-
nior year.
The minimum course requirements for a degree with honors in Biology are Biology 101, Biology
102, Biology 202, two 300-level biology courses (one of which must have a laboratory associated
with it), one 400-level biology course, Biology 493, Biology 494, WSP 031, and any other two
courses in biology (or any other one course and two semesters of Organic Chemistry).
In addition to the normal honors route, which includes two semesters (Biology 493-494) and a win-
ter study of research (WSP 031) during senior year, students have the option,subject to the approval of
their thesis advisor, to begin the honors research during winter study junior year or during the second
Biology
­ 95 ­
semester junior year. Students beginning honors in winter study of junior year would take Biology
494 in the spring of their junior year followed by Biology 493 in the fall of their senior year; students
beginning honors during the second semester of junior year would take Biology 494 that semester,
followed by Biology 493 in the fall of senior year and winter study research in the winter of the senior
year.
CREDIT FOR COURSES AT OTHER INSTITUTIONS
Students who enroll in study away programs may receive credit for up to two 200-level electives
towards the biology major upon approval of the course syllabi by the Biology Department's study
abroad coordinator, Professor Banta.
Students wishing to satisfy prerequisites for courses offered by the Biology Department with
courses taken at other institutions should consult, in person, with a member of the Biology Depart-
ment, prior to registering for the course that requires a prerequisite. Such consultations will include a
review of the course syllabi and the transcripts of the relevant previous college work, and students
should bring these materials with them.
BIOL 101(F) The Cell
This course provides an introduction to the cellular aspects of modern biology. It explains the devel-
opment of cell structure and function as a consequence of evolutionary processes, and it stresses the
dynamic properties of living systems. Topics considered include biological molecules and enzyme
action, membrane structure and function, energy exchange and design of metabolic systems, expres-
sion of genetic information, cell signalling, cell trafficking, the cell cycle, and cancer. In addition to

BIOL 133(F) Biology of Exercise and Nutrition
This class, intended for the non-scientist, focuses on the impact of exercise and nutrition on the human
body. We will discuss topics such as how different types of training influence exercise performance;
the changes that occur in the cardiovascular system during an exercise routine; the inherent limits of
the body to perform aerobic and anaerobic tasks; and long-term health consequences of a lifetime of
activity or inactivity. We will also examine how nutrition and metabolism affect body composition.
For example, we will rigorously and scientifically scrutinize the use of "fad" diets as a means to lose
weight.
Requirements: course work will consist of lectures and hands-on experiences with equipment used in
exercise physiology, all during regular lecture hours. Evaluation will be based on exams.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 120 (expected: 120). Preference given to seniors, juniors, sopho-
mores, and first-year students--in that order.

cal societies, and focuses specifically on the peoples and cultures of tropical regions in Africa, Asia,
Latin America, Oceanea, and the Caribbean. Tropical issues have become prominent on a global
scale, and many social issues in the tropics are inextricably bound to human ecology, evolution, and
physiology. The course begins with a survey of the tropical environment of humans, including major
climatic and habitat features. The next section focuses on human population biology, and emphasizes
demography and the role of disease particularly malaria and AIDS. The final part of the course covers
the place of human societies in local and global ecosystems including the challenges of tropical food
production, the importance of organic diversity, and the interaction of humans with their supporting

continually expanded by innovative molecular technologies. This course covers the experimental ba-
sis for our current understanding of the inheritance, structures, and functions of genes. It introduces
approaches used by contemporary geneticists and molecular biologists to explore questions about as-
pects of biology ranging from embryonic development to aging. The laboratory part of the course
provides an experimental introduction to modern genetic analysis. Laboratory experiments include
linkage analysis, bacterial transformation with plasmids, DNA restriction mapping, and computer-
based cloning.
Format: lecture/laboratory, six hours per week. Evaluation will be based on biweekly problem sets,
weekly laboratory exercises and laboratory reports, and three examinations; 90% of the final grade is
determined by performance on written exercises and exams.

BIOL 203(F) Ecology (Same as Environmental Studies 203) (Q)
This course combines lectures with field and indoor laboratory exercises to explore factors that deter-
mine the distribution and abundance of plants and animals in natural systems. The course begins with
an overall view of global patterns and then builds from the population to the ecosystem level. An em-
phasis is given to basic ecological principles and relates them to current environmental issues. Se-
lected topics include population dynamics (competition, predation, mutalism); community interac-
tions (succession, food chains and diversity) and ecosystem function (biogeochemical cycles, energy
flow).

BIOL 204(S) Animal Behavior
Making sense of what we see while watching animals closely is both an enthralling pastime and a
discipline that draws on many aspects of biology. Explanations can be found on many levels: evolu-
tionary theory tells us why certain patterns have come to exist, molecular biology can help us under-
stand how those patterns are implemented, neuroscience gives insights as to how the world appears to
the behaving animal, endocrinology provides information on how suites of behaviors are regulated.
The first part of the course focuses upon how descriptive studies provide the basis for formulating
questions about behavior as well as the statistical methods used to evaluate the answers to these ques-
tions. We then consider the behavior of individuals, both as it is mediated by biological mechanisms
and as it appears from an evolutionary perspective. The second half of the course is primarily con-
cerned with the behaviors of groups of animals from a wide variety of vertebrate and invertebrate
species, concentrating upon the stimuli, responses, and internal mechanisms that maintain social sys-
tems and on the selection pressures that drive animals toward a particular social system.
Format: lecture/laboratory, six hours per week. Evaluation will be based on examinations, lab reports,
and a research paper.
Prerequisites: Biology 102, or Psychology 101, or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 42 (ex-
pected: 28). Preference given to seniors, Biology majors, and Neuroscience concentrators.

the level of cells and tissues to the whole organism. The themes of the course include structure and
function, mechanisms of regulation, control and integration, and adaptation to the environment. Ex-
amples of these themes are taken from a wide variety of organisms with a focus on vertebrates. Labo-
ratories provide practical experience in measurement and experimental elucidation of physiological
phenomena and functional analysis of gross structure.
Evaluation will be based on hour exams, laboratory practicals, laboratory reports, and a final exam.

BIOL 206T(S) Genomics (W)
Genomics, the study of complete DNA sequences of organisms, has been touted as the new revolution
in biology. This tutorial course, aimed primarily at sophomores, explores the extent to which genom-
ics research has, and has not, expanded our understanding of biology. We begin by understanding the
experimental means of acquiring correct and complete DNA sequence(s) of a species. This back-
ground allows a critical analysis of the current data and databases used in genomic analysis. Reading
recent primary literature, we will then fully examine experimental approaches that assess interesting
biological phenomena on a genome-wide basis.
The class will meet as a whole once per week to discuss and refine questions on required readings of
primary literature. Each student will also be assigned to a weekly tutorial meeting with the instructor
and one other student. Every other week at this tutorial meeting, students will present a written and
oral critical analysis of the assigned reading. Students not making a presentation will question and
critique the work of their colleague.
Format: discussion, 75 minutes per week/tutorial, 1 hour per week. Evaluation will be based on tutori-
al participation and five tutorial papers of 5 pages each, with at least one substantive revision of a
tutorial paper.

beginning to have a molecular understanding of fascinating questions such as how cells decide their
fate, how patterns are created, how male and females are distinguished, and how organisms came to
be different. We have also discovered how the misregulation of important development regulatory
genes can lead to a variety of known cancers and degenerative diseases in humans. In this course we
will examine these and related topics combining a rich classical literature with modern genetic and
molecular analyses.

Plants are one of the most successful groups of organisms on Earth and have a profound impact on all
life. Successful use of plants in addressing global problems and understanding their role in natural
ecosystems depends on fundamental knowledge of the molecular mechanisms by which they grow,
develop, and respond to their environment. This course will examine the molecular physiology of
plants using an integrative approach that considers plants as dynamic, functional units in their envi-
ronment. Major emphasis will be on understanding fundamental plant processes, such as photosyn-
thesis, growth and development, water transport, hormone physiology, and flowering, from the mo-
lecular to the organismal level. Environmental effects on these processes will be addressed in topics
including photomorphogenesis, stress physiology, mineral nutrition, and plant-microbe interactions.
Frequent discussions of original research papers will examine the mechanisms plants use to perform
these processes and explore advances in the genetic engineering of plants for agricultural, environ-
mental, and medical purposes. Laboratory activities stress modern approaches and techniques used in
investigating plant physiological processes.
Format: lecture/discussion/laboratory, six hours per week. Evaluation will be based on problem sets,
lab reports, a term paper, and exams.
Prerequisites: Biology 202. Enrollment limit: 20 (expected: 12). Preference given to Biology majors.

BIOL 310(S) Mechanisms of Nervous System Development and Plasticity
Development can be seen as a tradeoff between genetically-determined processes and environmental
stimuli. The tension between these two inputs is particularly apparent in the developing nervous sys-
tem, where many events must be predetermined, and where plasticity, or altered outcomes in response
to environmental conditions, is also essential. Plasticity is reduced as development and differentiation
proceed, and the potential for regeneration after injury or disease in adults is limited; however, some
Biology
­ 99 ­
exceptions to this rule exist, and recent data suggest that the nervous system is not as hard-wired as
previously thought. In this course we will discuss the mechanisms governing nervous system devel-
opment, from relatively simple nervous systems such as that of the roundworm, to the more compli-
cated nervous systems of humans, examining the roles played by genetically specified programs and
non-genetic influences. We will also discuss the similarities and differences between development
and regeneration, the extent to which the nervous system is hard-wired, and the controversial idea that
degeneration represents "development in reverse."
Format: lecture/discussion/laboratory, six hours per week. Evaluation will be based on exams, short
papers and lab reports.
Prerequisites: Biology 202 and either Biology 205 or Biology 212. Enrollment limit: 20 (expected:

BIOL 315(F) Microbiology: Diversity, Cellular Physiology, and Interactions
Bioterrorism and the alarming spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria are but two of the reasons for the
renewed emphasis on the biology of microorganisms. This course will examine microbes from the
perspectives of cell structure and function, genetics, and evolution. A major theme will be the adapta-
tion of bacteria as they evolve to fill specific ecological niches, with an emphasis on microbe: host
interactions that lead to pathogenesis. We will consider communication among bacteria as well as be-
tween bacteria and their environment. Topics include: microbial development, stress response, biore-
mediation, bacteriophages, subversion of the immune defenses, and genomics. In the lab, students
will examine the regulation of bacterial gene expression, horizontal gene transfer, the isolation and
characterization of bacteria from natural environment, and carry out independent projects. Readings
will be supplemented by articles from the primary literature.
Evaluation will be based on three exams, a paper, lab reports, and a presentation.

BIOL 321(F) Biochemistry I--Structure and Function of Biological Molecules (Same as
Chemistry 321 and Biochemistry and Molecular Biology 321)
This course introduces the basic concepts of biochemistry with an emphasis on the structure and func-
tion of biological macromolecules. Specifically, the structure of proteins and nucleic acids are ex-
amined in detail in order to determine how their chemical properties and their biological behavior
result from those structures. Other topics covered include enzyme kinetics, mechanism and cataly-
sis and regulation; the molecular organization of biomembranes and membrane transport; and the
principles of recombinant DNA technologies. In addition, the principles and applications of the meth-
ods used to characterize macromolecules in solution and the interactions between macromolecules
are discussed.
The laboratory provides an opportunity to study the structure of macromolecules and to learn the fun-
damental experimental techniques of biochemistry including electrophoresis and chromatography.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, four hours per week. Evaluation will be based on
three hour exams, a final exam, problem sets and performance in the laboratories including lab re-

energy generation (aerobic, anaerobic, photosynthetic); the regulation and integration of the metabol-
ic pathways including compartmentalization and the transport of metabolites; and biochemical reac-
tion mechanisms including the structures and mechanisms of coenzymes. This comprehensive study
also includes the biosynthesis and catabolism of small molecules (carbohydrates, lipids, amino acids,
and nucleotides). Laboratory experiments introduce the principles and procedures used to study enzy-
matic reactions, bioenergetics, and metabolic pathways.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, four hours per week. Evaluation will be based on

(W)
A tutorial course investigating the patterns and processes in human-dominated ecosystems, especially
those that produce food and fiber, process wastes, or provide a context for human activities such as
recreation. The course will draw heavily upon the experiences that students have had in other biology
courses. Topics will include: the relationships among diversity, ecosystem function, sustainability, re-
silience, and stability of biological resource systems, nutrient pools and processing in human-domi-
nated ecosystems. Four field trips will be taken to biological resource sites in the region. These experi-
ences will serve as introductions to readings and the topics of papers to be written by student partici-
pants. Each student will write four papers that deal with questions requiring extensive reading of pri-
mary resources. Paper presentations will alternate with serving as a critic of other student papers. Stu-
dents will be given the opportunity to revise and rewrite two of the four papers in the week following
their tutorial presentation thereby being able to respond to the criticism and discussion of the tutorial
group.
Format: tutorial/field trip, one to three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on writing assign-
ments, tutorial presentation, performance in the role of paper critic, and course participation.
Prerequisites: Biology 203 or Biology 302 or Environmental Studies 203 or permission of instructor.

BIOL 410(F) Cell Dynamics in Living Systems
Far from being static entities, individual cells can exhibit dynamic behaviors, sometimes migrating
great distances or structurally reorganizing as in the formation--or reformation--of neuronal synap-
ses. The ability of cells to move and reshape underlies a vast array of normal biological processes,
including immune function, embryonic development, and memory formation, as well as abnormal
processes such as cancer growth and metastasis. It is through precise regulation of polymerization,
depolymerization, and contraction of the cellular cytoskeleton that motility is achieved, and we are
just beginning to understand the genetic and biophysical bases of how this regulation occurs. Not sur-
prisingly, imprecise regulation of the cytoskeleton can have serious consequences, and several disor-
ders arise from defects in this process. In this course we will review the primary literature covering
migration and motility.
Format: discussion, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on class participation and several
short papers.

BIOL 413(S) Molecular Basis of Biological Clocks
Circadian rhythms have been described in all organisms studied, including humans, a wide range of
other eukaryotes and several prokaryotes. With periods of about 24 hours, these rhythms regulate
biochemical, cellular, physiological and behavioral activities. Circadian rhythms are generated by
cellular clocks--genetically determined internal pacemakers that maintain their oscillations in the ab-
sence of environmental cues but may be reset by periodicities in the environment, especially the light-
dark cycle. Only recently have we begun to understand how circadian rhythms are generated and con-
trolled at the cellular level. This course will explore the basic biochemical features of biological
clocks with the aim of understanding their crucial role in regulating key biological parameters, such as
enzyme levels, levels of hormones and other regulatory molecules, and activity and sleep cycles.
Class discussions will focus on readings in the original literature.

BIOL 414(F) Life at Extremes: Molecular Mechanisms
All organisms face variability in their environments, and the molecular and cellular responses to
stresses induced by environmental change often illuminate otherwise hidden facets of normal physi-
ology. Moreover, many organisms have evolved unique molecular mechanisms, such as novel cellu-
lar compounds or macromolecular structural modifications, which contribute to their ability to sur-
vive continuous exposure to extreme conditions, such as high temperatures or low pH. This course
will examine how chaperonins, proteases, and heat- and cold-shock proteins are regulated in response
to changes in the external environment. We will then consider how these and other molecular mecha-
nisms function to stabilize DNA and proteins -and, ultimately, cells and organisms. Other extreme
environments, such as hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor, snow fields, hypersaline lakes, the in-
tertidal zone, and acid springs provide further examples of cellular and molecular responses to ex-
treme conditions. Biotechnological applications of these molecular mechanisms in areas such as pro-
tein engineering will also be considered. Class discussions will focus upon readings from the primary
literature.
Format: discussion, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on class participation and several

MAJOR
Through a variety of individual courses and sequential programs, the department provides an op-
portunity for students to explore the nature and significance of chemistry, an area of important
achievement in our quest for knowledge about ourselves and the world around us. The student of
chemistry is able to become aware of the special viewpoint of chemists, the general nature of chemical
investigation, some of its important results, how these results are expressed, and something of their
significance within the fields of science and in the area of human endeavor as a whole.
A major in chemistry can be achieved in several ways, preferably beginning in the student's first
year at Williams, but also beginning in the sophomore year. Building on a foundation in general chem-
istry, organic chemistry, and physical chemistry, a student elects additional advanced courses to com-
plete a major that is consistent with his or her background in other sciences, interests, and goals. A
student's program might emphasize biochemistry, organic chemistry, physical chemistry, or inorganic
chemistry, with additional courses available in analytical chemistry, environmental science, and ma-
terials science. Students considering a major in chemistry should consult with amember of the depart-
ment as early as possible in order to plan a program which best suits their interests and abilities and
which makes full use of their previous preparation.
Usually the requirements for the major are fulfilled by completing "Required Courses" and the ap-
propriate number of "Elective Courses." Starting at the 300 level, at least three of the courses taken
must have a laboratory component. In addition, the department has a number of "Independent Re-
Chemistry
­ 102 ­
search Courses" which, while they do not count toward completion of the major, provide a unique
opportunity to pursue an independent research project under the direction of a faculty member.
The Chemistry Department curriculum and major requirements began changing in the fall of the
2001-2002 academic year. As a result, first year students or sophomores who plan to begin a chemis-
try major, or who simply want to take introductory chemistry courses, should consult the section be-
low entitled "New Curriculum" to make course selections. However, seniors who have already begun
a chemistry major are subject to somewhat different requirements and should consult the table on
page 110 entitled "Former Curriculum" to make course selections. Questions about meeting major
requirements in either curriculum structure should be made directly to the Department Chair.

aStudents begin the major in the first year with either Chemistry 151 or 153 (based upon placement
test results and consultation with the chair). Students with outstanding performance on the College
Board Chemistry Advanced Placement Test or the International Baccalaureate Exam, and having
consulted with the chair, may begin the major with Chemistry 155 and will place out of Chemistry
256. The first year is completed with Chemistry 156. In the second year at the introductory level,
students take either Chemistry 251 or 255 and Chemistry 256.
bStudents wishing to pursue a research-based version of the laboratory program in Chemistry 251
may elect 255 after consultation with the chair.
cChemistry 256 is the fourth course in the Department's Introductory-level sequence. This course is
a prerequisite (or co-requisite) for all Quantitative and Advanced-level electives.
dTo complete the major in Chemistry, students must elect any one of Chemistry 361, 364, 366, or
367. The course elected, in consultation with the chair or major advisor, will depend on the stu-
dent's future plans.
eChemistry 361 and 366 are strongly recommended for anyone considering graduate school in
chemistry.
fChemistry 367 and 324 are strongly recommended for anyone considering graduate school in bio-
chemistry.
gThe Chemistry major requires either nine semester chemistry courses or eight semester chemistry
courses plus two approved courses from among the following: Biology 101, 102; Computer Sci-
ence 134; Mathematics 103, 104, 105; Physics 131, 132; or any courses in these departments for
which the approved courses are prerequisites. No more than two advanced-level organic courses
may be counted toward completion of the major.
Chemistry
­ 103 ­
Completion of any one of the advanced-level elective courses will satisfy the College requirement
that a student complete a major seminar.
For the purpose of assisting students in selecting a program consistent with their interests, the fol-
lowing groupings of electives and faculty advisors are suggested. However, a case can be made for
selecting courses from the different groups.
Biochemistry: Chemistry 321, Chemistry 322, Chemistry 324, Chemistry 341, Chemistry 342, Chemis-
try 344, Chemistry 367, Chemistry 436T, Chemistry 464T (Students interested in biochemistry should
consult with Ms. Gehring, Mr. Kaplan, or Mr. Lovett.)
Organic Chemistry: Chemistry 324, Chemistry 341, Chemistry 342, Chemistry 344, Chemistry 346
(Students interested in organic chemistry should consult with Mr. Markgraf, Mr. Richardson, or Mr.
Smith.)
Physical and Inorganic Chemistry: Chemistry 332, Chemistry 335, Chemistry 361, Chemistry 364,
Chemistry 366, Chemistry 368, Chemistry 436T, Chemistry 464T (Students interested in physical
chemistry should consult with Mr. Bingemann, Mr. Chang, Mr. Peacock-López, or Mr. Thoman. Stu-
dents interested in inorganic chemistry should consult with Ms. Park or Mr. Schofield. Students inter-
ested in materials science should consult with Ms. Park.)
The Chemistry major provides excellent preparation for graduate study in chemistry, biochemistry,
chemical engineering, environmental science, medicine, and the medical sciences. The major can
also be useful to those whose later professional or business careers may be related to chemical materi-
als or processes. While any accepted route through the major would permit a student to proceed to
graduate study in chemistry, three electives should be considered a minimum, and the particular im-
portance of Chemistry 321, 335, 361, 364, and 366 as preparation for advanced study should be noted.
In addition, at least a semester of research and courses in computer science are strongly recom-
mended.
Students with principal interests outside of the sciences may extend a secondary school foundation
in chemistry by electing a basic two-semester introductory course of a general nature or they may
elect semester courses designed for non-majors. All courses in chemistry satisfy the distribution re-
quirement.
The department is accredited by the American Chemical Society (A.C.S.), a professional body of
academic, industrial, and research chemists. The A.C.S. suggests the following courses for someone
considering graduate study or work in chemistry or a related area. Students completing these courses
are designated Certified A.C.S. Majors: 151 (153 or 155), 156, 251 (255), 256, 335, 361, 364, 366,
493-494; and at least two courses from 321, 322, 342, 344, 368, BIMO 401.
BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
Students interested in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology should consult the general statement
under Biochemistry and Molecular Biology in the Courses of Instruction.
MATERIALS SCIENCE
Students interested in Materials Science are encouraged to elect courses from the Materials Science
program offered jointly with the Physics Department, and should consult the information on page 218
describing this option.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN CHEMISTRY
The degree with honors in Chemistry provides students with an opportunity to undertake an inde-
pendent research project under the supervision of a faculty member, and to report on the nature of the
work in two short oral presentations and in a written thesis.
Chemistry majors who are candidates for the degree with honors take the following in addition to a
major listed above:
Chemistry 493-W31-494 Senior Research and Thesis
The principal considerations in admitting a student to a program of independent research are mas-
tery of fundamental materials and skills, ability to pursue independent study successfully, and demon-
strated student interest and motivation. In addition, to enroll in these courses leading to a degree with
honors, a student must have a B- average in all chemistry courses or the permission of the chair. At the
end of the first semester, the department reviews the student's progress and determines whether the
student is a candidate for a degree with honors. The designation of a degree with honors in Chemistry
or a degree with highest honors in Chemistry is based primarily on a departmental evaluation of the
accomplishments in these courses and on the quality of the thesis. Completion of the research project
in a satisfactory manner and preparation of a well-written thesis usually results in a degree with hon-
ors. In cases where a student has demonstrated unusual commitment and initiative resulting in an out-
standing thesis based on original experimental results, combined with a strong record in all of his or
her chemistry courses, the department may elect to award a degree with highest honors in Chemistry.
EXCHANGE AND TRANSFER STUDENTS
Students from other institutions wishing to register for courses in chemistry involving college-level
prerequisites should do so in person with a member of the Chemistry Department. Registration should
Chemistry
­ 104 ­
take place by appointment during the spring semester prior to the academic year in which courses are
to be taken. Students are requested to have with them transcripts of the relevant previous college
work.
COURSES FOR NON-MAJORS WITH NO PREREQUISITES
CHEM 111(F) Fighting Disease: The Evolution and Operation of Human Medicines
The past decade has seen an explosion in the number of pharmaceuticals available to doctors and their
patients. Pills are now available to treat conditions as varied as depression and baldness, and a cure for
the common cold is in development. A visit to the doctor now seems incomplete without a prescrip-
tion. Changes in Food and Drug Administration and health insurance policies combined with the tre-
mendous increase in advertisement of prescription drugs have also placed a larger burden on consum-
ers in deciding which drugs to take, as well as in paying for the medication.
This course focuses on understanding, at a biochemical level, how several drugs work their curative
magic as well as how they may lead to undesired side effects. We examine the processes through
which drugs are discovered or created and how they are then brought to consumers. Topics range from
the discovery of aspirin and the effect of World War II on the discovery of cheap treatments for malaria
to advances in protease inhibitors and combination therapies which have dramatically extended the
lives of AIDS patients. The main focus of the course is basic concepts in medicinal chemistry and
biology which underlie the action of any drug. We also explore the connections between basic re-
search, biotechnology companies, multinational pharmaceutical firms, patent attorneys, regulatory
agencies, doctors, and insurers which eventually lead to the availability of a given drug.
This course is designed for the non-science major who does not intend to pursue a career in the natural
sciences. Principles in organic chemistry and biochemistry will be developed as needed.
Format: lecture, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on quizzes, problem sets, class partici-
pation, a quiz, a midterm, a final project, and a final exam.
No prerequisites; students who have taken Chemistry 156 are not eligible. No enrollment limit (ex-
pected: 40).

CHEM 113(S) Chemistry and Crime: From Sherlock Holmes to Modern Forensic Science
In this course, designed for students who do not plan to major in the natural sciences, we use a case-
oriented approach to explore selected topics of forensic science. These include: (1) the scientific and
technological foundation for the examination of physical, chemical, and biological items of evidence,
and (2) the scope of expert qualifications and testimony, the legal status of scientific techniques, and
the admissibility of the results in evidence. The analysis of trace evidence, including glass, soil, gun-
powder residues and bullet fragments, and inorganic and heavy metal poisons are discussed through
an understanding of the basic concepts of chemistry and analytical chemistry. Forensic toxicology
and pharmacology are applied to the analysis of alcohol, poisons, and drugs based upon the principles
of organic chemistry and biochemistry. The characterization of blood and other body fluids necessi-
tate an understanding of serology and molecular genetics. The cases which stimulate the exploration
of these areas include: the John and Robert Kennedy assassinations, the Jeffrey MacDonald case (Fa-
tal Vision), the Wayne Williams case, the deaths of celebrities Marilyn Monroe, John Belushi, and
Janis Joplin, the authenticity of the Shroud of Turin, the Lindberg baby kidnapping, the Tylenol poi-
sonings, and the identity of Anastasia.
An interactive laboratory program provides an appreciation of scientific experimentation in general
and the work of a crime lab in particular. It includes an analysis of evidence collected at various crime
scenes and provides an opportunity to learn forensic techniques such as chromatography (for ink,
drug, and fire accelerant analysis), spectroscopy (for alcohol and drug analysis), and electrophoresis
(for DNA fingerprinting).
This course is designed for the non-science major who does not intend to pursue a career in the natural
sciences.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, four hours per week. Evaluation will be based on
problem sets, and/or quizzes, hour tests, a final exam, and laboratory performance.

CHEM 115(S) AIDS: The Disease and Search for a Cure
Since the discovery of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) in 1983, modern techniques of
molecular biology have revealed much about its structure and life cycle. The intensity of the scientific
investigation directed at HIV-1 is unprecedented in history. We now know more about this virus than
any other known pathogen. However, the early optimism concerning the prospects for an effective
AIDS vaccine has now waned and HIV strains that are resistant to drug therapies are common. We are
now nearly two decades into the AIDS pandemic and the World Health Organization estimates that
there are more than 50 million HIV-infected persons worldwide.
After an introduction to chemical structure, we examine the molecular biology of the HIV virus, the
molecular targets of anti-HIV drugs, and the prospects for a cure. We discuss the origin, epidemiology
and modes of transmission of HIV-1 and HIV-2, and look at how HIV-1 interacts with the human im-
Chemistry

mune system. We also discuss both old and new methods of vaccine development and the prospects
for making an effective AIDS vaccine.
This course is designed for the non-science major who does not intend to pursue a career in the natural
sciences.
Format: lecture, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on problem sets, two hour tests,

CHEM 262T(S) Applying the Scientific Method to Archaeology and Paleoanthropology (Same
as Anthropology 262T) (W)
How do we `know' early hominids migrated from Africa to Europe? What's the origin of Grecian
pottery glazes? Archaeological studies of human environmental impact include materials as recent as
nineteenth century glass, or as ancient as hundred-thousand year old stone tools. Paleoanthropology,
the study of early humans, covers materials that are millions of years old. Natural science can answer
many questions, not just how old an object is, but also where, how and sometimes why an object was
made. These answers in turn tell us about patterns of human development and settlement, and also
help us distinguish forgeries from genuine artifacts. Understanding when we do not know an answer
is also important. This tutorial will introduce science students to an interesting application, and
introduce students from anthropology, art history, or just possessing general curiosity to the methods
and limits of `scientific analysis'. Given the wide scope of this field, students will decide some of the
topics. Papers will be thoroughly edited for style, grammar and syntax, as well as the quality of argu-
ment. Students will improve their writing by integrating into successive papers the editorial com-
ments they receive and also by editing the writing of their tutorial partners.
Format: tutorial. Evaluation will be based on five 5- to 6-page papers.

Enzymes are complex biological molecules capable of catalyzing chemical reactions with very high
efficiency, stereo-selectivity and specificity. The study of enzymatically-catalyzed reactions gives in-
sight into the study of organic reaction mechanisms in general, and into the topic of catalysis especial-
ly. This course explores the methods and frameworks for determining mechanisms of enzymatic reac-
tions. These methods are based on a firm foundation of chemical kinetics and organic reaction mecha-
nisms. The first portion of the course is devoted to enzyme kinetics and catalysis including discus-
sions of transition state theory, structure-reactivity relationships, Michaelis-Menten parameters, pH-
Chemistry

dependence of catalysis, and methods for measuring rate constants. As the course progresses, the con-
cepts of mechanism and its elucidation is applied to specific enzymatic processes as we discuss reac-
tion intermediates and stereochemistry of enzymatic reactions. Our discussions of modern methods
include the use of altered reactants, including mechanism-based inactivators and genetically modified
enzymes as tools for probing enzymatic reactions.

Materials Science is a broad study of the physical properties of substances, such as hardness, elastic-
ity, electrical conductivity, and optical properties. This course investigates the relationship between
microscopic structure and macroscopic properties of polymers (plastics, elastomers, liquid crystals),
electronic materials (semiconductors, conducting polymers, and superconductors) and solids (metals,
magnets, ceramics, minerals, and glasses). We approach these topics from both physical and chemical
perspectives, reflecting the interdisciplinary nature of the field. For instance, we explore how the un-
derlying structure of materials arises from quantum mechanics and how temperature determines col-
lective response properties such as elasticity or conductivity. This course also studies the design of
new materials and their synthesis at the molecular level.
Format: lecture, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on weekly problem sets, reviews of
research articles, a midterm exam, a final exam, and a final paper, all of which have a significant quan-
titative component.

aBased on an outstanding performance on the College Board Chemistry Advanced Placement Test,
and having consulted with the chair, a first-year student may gain credit toward the major for 101,
102 and elect Chemistry 201-202 or 301, 302 directly.
bWhile the organic chemistry courses are normally elected before the physical chemistry courses,
the order may be reversed. The organic chemistry courses and the physical chemistry courses may
also be elected concurrently.
cChemistry 301 is a prerequisite for Chemistry 302. Chemistry 301, 302 are strongly recommended
for anyone considering graduate study in chemistry.
dChemistry 301, 310 are strongly recommended for anyone considering graduate study in biochem-
istry.
eThe Chemistry major requires either nine semester chemistry courses or eight semester chemistry
courses plus two approved courses from among the following: Biology 101, 102; Computer Sci-
ence 134; Mathematics 103, 104, 105; Physics 131, 132; or any courses in these departments for
which the approved courses are prerequisites. No more than two advanced-level organic courses
may be counted toward completion of the major.
Completion of any one of the advanced-level elective courses will satisfy the College requirement
that a student complete a major seminar.
For the purpose of assisting students in selecting a program consistent with their interests, the fol-
lowing groupings of electives and faculty advisors are suggested. However, a case can be made for
selecting courses from the different groups.
Biochemistry: Chemistry 303, Chemistry 308, Chemistry 310, Chemistry 311, Chemistry 314T,
Chemistry 321, Chemistry 322 (Students interested in biochemistry should consult with Ms. Geh-
ring, Mr. Kaplan, or Mr. Lovett.)
OrganicChemistry:Chemistry 303, Chemistry 310, Chemistry 311, Chemistry 312T (Students in-
terested in organic chemistry should consult with Mr. Markgraf, Mr. Richardson, or Mr. Smith.)
Physical and Inorganic Chemistry: Chemistry 304, Chemistry 305, Chemistry 314T, Chemistry
316T, Chemistry 318, Chemistry 401 (Students interested in physical chemistry should consult
with Mr. Bingemann, Mr. Chang, Mr. Peacock-López, or Mr. Thoman. Students interested in inor-
ganic chemistry should consult with Ms. Park or Mr. Schofield. Students interested in materials
science should consult with Ms. Park.)
The Chemistry major provides excellent preparation for graduate study in chemistry, biochemistry,
chemical engineering, environmental science, medicine, and the medical sciences. The major can
also be useful to those whose later professional or business careers may be related to chemical materi-
als or processes. While any accepted route through the major would permit a student to proceed to
graduate study in chemistry, three electives should be considered a minimum, and the particular im-
portance of Chemistry 301, 302, 304, 305, and 321 as preparation for advanced study should be noted.
In addition, at least a semester of research and courses in computer science are strongly recom-
mended.
Students with principal interests outside of the sciences may extend a secondary school foundation
in chemistry by electing a basic two-semester introductory course of a general nature or they may
elect semester courses designed for nonmajors. All courses in chemistry satisfy the distribution re-
quirement.
The department is accredited by the American Chemical Society (A.C.S.), a professional body of
academic, industrial, and research chemists. The A.C.S. suggests the following courses for someone
considering graduate study or work in chemistry or a related area. Students completing these courses
are designated Certified A.C.S. Majors: 101, 102 (103-104), 201-202, 301, 302, 304, 305, 493-494;
and at least two courses from 303, 311, 321, 322, 401, BIMO 401.
BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
Students interested in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology should consult the general statement
under Biochemistry and Molecular Biology in the Courses of Instruction.
MATERIALS SCIENCE
Students interested in Materials Science are encouraged to elect courses from the Materials Science
program offered jointly with the Physics Department, and should consult the information on page 218
describing this option.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN CHEMISTRY
The degree with honors in Chemistry provides students with an opportunity to undertake an inde-
pendent research project under the supervision of a faculty member, and to report on the nature of the
work in two short oral presentations and in a written thesis.
Chemistry majors who are candidates for the degree with honors take the following in addition to a
major listed above:
Chemistry
­ 112 ­
Chemistry 493-W31-494 Senior Research and Thesis.
The principal considerations in admitting a student to a program of independent research are mas-
tery of fundamental materials and skills, ability to pursue independent study successfully, and demon-
strated student interest and motivation. In addition, to enroll in these courses leading to a degree with
honors, a student must have a B- average in all chemistry courses or the permission of the chair. At the
end of the first semester, the department reviews the student's progress and determines whether the
student is a candidate for a degree with honors. The designation of a degree with honors in Chemistry
or a degree with highest honors in Chemistry is based primarily on a departmental evaluation of the
accomplishments in these courses and on the quality of the thesis. Completion of the research project
in a satisfactory manner and preparation of a well-written thesis usually results in a degree with hon-
ors. In cases where a student has demonstrated unusual commitment and initiative resulting in an out-
standing thesis based on original experimental results, combined with a strong record in all of his or
her chemistry courses, the department may elect to award a degree with highest honors in Chemistry.
EXCHANGE AND TRANSFER STUDENTS
Students from other institutions wishing to register for courses in chemistry involving college-level
prerequisites should do so in person with a member of the Chemistry Department staff. Registration
should take place by appointment during the spring semester prior to the academic year in which
courses are to be taken. Students are requested to have with them transcripts of the relevant previous
college work.

The course offerings in Classics enable students to explore the ancient Greek, Roman, and Greco-
Roman worlds from various perspectives: art, archaeology, philosophy, religion, and especially litera-
ture and history. Courses are of two types: language (Greek and Latin) and translation (Classical Civi-
lization). The 100-level language courses are intensive introductions to Greek and Latin grammar; the
200-level language courses combine comprehensive grammar review with readings from Greek or
Latin texts of pivotal historical periods; the 400-level language courses explore in depth selected au-
thors or topics and the methods of analysis appropriate to each of them. Courses in which texts are
read in translation provide both introductory surveys and opportunities for more specialized study of
the ancient Greco-Roman world from earliest historical times through late antiquity.
MAJOR
Majors and prospective majors are encouraged to consult with the department's faculty to ensure a
well-balanced and comprehensive selection of Classics courses appropriate to their individual inter-
ests. A course or courses in ancient history are strongly recommended. Majors may also benefit from
advice on courses offered in other departments which would complement their particular interests in
Classics. A reading knowledge of French, German, and Italian is useful for any study in Classics and
is required in at least two of these modern languages by graduate programs in classics, ancient history,
classical art and archaeology, and medieval studies.
The department offers two routes to the major: Classics and Classical Civilization.
Classics: (1) Six courses in Greek and/or Latin, with at least two 400-level courses in one language;
(2) Three additional courses, elected from the offerings in Greek, Latin, or Classical Civilization or
from approved courses in other departments.
Classical Civilization: (1) Either Classics 101 or 102, and either Classics 222 or 223; (2) Three
additional courses from the offerings in Classical Civilization or from approved courses in other de-
partments. (3) Three courses in Greek or Latin with at least one at the 400 level, or four courses in
Latin at any level. (4) A senior independent study is normally required to complete the Classical Civi-
lization major. Several of the courses elected, including the independent study, should relate to each
other in such a way as to reflect a concentration on a particular genre, period, or problem of Greek and
Roman civilization, including topics in ancient art and archaeology, religion in the Greco-Roman
world, and ancient philosophy.
In addition to the courses in Classical Civilization, appropriate courses from other departments or
from approved study abroad programs may be elected for the major. Examples of such courses, which
may vary from year to year, are ArtH 412 (Monsters and Narrative: Greek Architectural Sculpture),
Political Science/Philosophy 231 (Ancient Political Thought), and appropriate courses at the Intercol-
legiate Center for Classical Studies in Rome or at another approved overseas program.
Senior Colloquium: In lieu of a semester-long major seminar, majors will participate in the Senior
Colloquium, a student-faculty discussion group that meets twice each semester during the senior year.
The meetings focus on critical readings in Classics, often in conjunction with a guest lecturer's visit.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN CLASSICS
Students who wish to be considered for the degree with honors will normally present a thesis or
pursue appropriate independent study in the fall and winter study of their senior year. This thesis or
Classics
­ 114 ­
independent study offers students an opportunity to work in depth on a topic of their choosing and to
apply and develop the techniques and critical methods with which they have become acquainted dur-
ing their regular course work. It may also include relevant work with members of other departments.
In order to write a thesis, students normally must have a minimum GPA of 3.3 in their major courses
and must submit a thesis proposal before the end of the spring semester of their junior year that earns
departmental approval. To be awarded the degree with honors in Classics, the student is required to
have taken a minimum of ten semester courses in the department (not including the thesis or indepen-
dent study) and to have demonstrated original or superior ability in studies in the field both through
course work and through the thesis or equivalent independent study.
COURSE NUMBERING SYSTEM
Language Courses: The numbering of these courses through the 200 level reflects the prerequisites
involved; the only prerequisite for any 400-level course is Greek 201 or Latin 202, or equivalent lan-
guage preparation. The numbering of the 400-level courses partially reflects the order in which they
are offered over a two-year period for Greek and a three-year period for Latin. It also indicates a good
order in which to take the 400-level courses but not an essential order, and individual students may
enter the sequence at any point. While not every student will take every course, the rotation of
400-level courses is arranged to permit exposure, in a three- to four-year period, to most of the impor-
tant periods and genres of classical studies.
Classical Civilization Courses: The numbering of these courses often suggests a recommended but
rarely necessary sequence of study within a given area of classical studies. Most of the translation
courses do not assume prior experience in Classics or a cross-listed field.
CLASSICAL CIVILIZATION
CLAS 101(F) Greek Literature (Same as Comparative Literature 107)
From the Homeric epics of the eighth century to the tragedies of fifth century Athens, the literature of
the archaic and classical Greek world was produced by and for a "performance society" in which
genres like epic and lyric, iambics and elegy, victory odes for athletes and hymns for the gods, comedy
and tragedy, history and oratory and even philosophy,all developed out of the numerous and varied
occasions at which both poetry (usually accompanied by music and very often by dance) and prose
were performed. As we read in translation Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, Hesiod's Theogony and Works
and Days, several Homeric Hymns, selections from poets like Archilochus, Sappho, Solon and Pin-
dar, tragedies by Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides, comedies by Aristophanes, brief selections
from the histories of Herodotus and Thucydides, and perhaps a Platonic dialogue, we will attend to the
performance contexts in which these works were first produced, from the small drinking party to large
festivals, and to the different kinds of audience each "genre" presupposes and, indeed, implicitly
constructs. Our chief aim in doing so will be to enrich our readings of individual texts and to provide a
framework for exploring some of the issues that persist in a literature produced over four turbulent
centuries of social and political change, for example: the godlike in humans and yet our human limita-
tions, particularly our mortality; whether the family and community that survive us or the "fame" of
poetry can provide adequate compensation for individuals' mortality; gender constructions and their
relation to "genres"; changing conceptions of community and of the individual's and family's relation
to it as various types of polis ("city-state") develop.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on short response papers, two or three 5- to
7-page papers, and a final exam.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 40 (expected: 25-30). Preference given to first-year students and

CLAS 103(S) Greek and Roman Drama: Renewal and Transformation (Same as Comparative
Literature 109 and Theatre 311)
The reading list for this course includes many of the major tragedies of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and
Euripides, at least two comedies of Aristophanes, and probably an example or two of New Comedy
(Menander, Plautus, or Terence). But it includes also a number of contemporary plays based on an-
cient myth or ancient models (Anouilh's Eurydice and Antigone; Cocteau's Orphée, Sartre's The
Flies, Williams' Orpheus Descending, Eliot's Family Reunion, etc.) as well as Homer's Odyssey and
a few other readings, both ancient and modern, from outside drama. Though we shall read the ancient
plays closely, our specific focus will be less on drama per se than on themes of transformation and
renewal as they occur in myth, cult, drama, and other literature of all periods. In keeping with this
theme, students will be encouraged not only to develop critical and analytic sophistication in dealing
with these various materials but also to create their own transformations of ancient myth and ancient
models, in whatever medium they choose.

CLGR 101(F)-102(S) Introduction to Greek
This full-year, intensive course presents the fundamentals of Greek grammar, syntax, and vocabulary
and introduces students, in the second semester, to works of the classical period (usually by Xenophon
and Euripides).
This course is designed for students who are beginning Greek or have studied less than two years of
Greek in secondary school. Credit is granted for the first semester only if the second semester is taken
as well. Students with some previous experience in Greek may want to enroll in CLGR 102 only. (Con-

CLGR 201(F) Intermediate Greek
Reading of selections from Hesiod and from Plato, combined with grammar review. The primary goal
of this course is to develop fluency in reading Greek. We will also read the texts closely to explore
important continuities and changes in Greek culture between the archaic and classical periods. The
emphasis will vary from year to year, but possible subjects to be explored include: the education and
socialization of the community's children and young adults; religion and cult practices; the performa-
tive aspects of epic (and choral) poetry and of prose genres like oratory and the philosophical dia-
logue; traditional oral poetry and storytelling and the growth of literacy; the construction of woman,
of man; the development of the classical polis.
Format: recitation/discussion. Evaluation will be based on classroom participation, quizzes, tests, and
a final exam.

Hour: 8:30-9:45 TR HOPPIN
CLGR 402(S) Homer: The Odyssey
From the early archaic era through the classical and beyond, Homer's Iliad and Odyssey simulta-
neously influenced and reflected Greek conceptions of community, leadership, war, heroism, family,
loyalty, the gods, justice, and much more. And nearly all of subsequent Greek literature, both poetry
and prose, developed in varying degrees of dialogue with these early epic texts. In this course we will
explore Homeric values, narrative style, language, and effect by reading extensive selections from the
Odyssey in Greek, and the entire epic in translation.
Format: recitation/discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, oral reports, a paper or
papers, perhaps a midterm, and a final exam.
Prerequisites: Greek 201 or permission of instructor. Greek 402 is offered alternately as a course on
the Iliad and the Odyssey. Students who have taken Greek 402 on the Iliad may elect this course as
well. Enrollment limit: 12 (expected: 5-10).
Hour: 2:35-3:50 TR PORTER
CLGR 403(F) Poetry and Revolution in Archaic Greece
The age of experiment, of lyric, of tyranny, of migration and discovery, of the personal voice: it takes
many images to describe the profound changes in Greek society, thought, and self-expression during
the archaic era (roughly 800 to the Persian invasion of 479). We will first read selections from the lyric
poets (e.g. Archilochus and Sappho, Tyrtaeus and Solon), whose concise and expressive poems re-
flected contemporary culture in a way the archaic epics did not. Their poems create for modern read-
ers, as they did for the Greeks, a powerful sense of the poet's personal presence and engagement with
his (or her) audience. A similar intimacy characterizes the writings of many of the pre-Socratics, from
which we will next read some selections. Confident in the ability of the human mind to understand
both the human and the physical world, the pre-Socratics anticipated what came to be known as phi-
losophy and natural science. We will then turn to other writers who spoke directly about the political
upheavals of the archaic age, focussing on the "tyrant narratives" of Herodotus. Throughout the se-
mester we will also consider such significant material changes in the archaic era as the development of
monumental public sculpture, the evolution of the temple, and the undertaking of vast building pro-
grams, all of which transformed the visual scale of the Greek cities and their citizens' sense of self and
community.
Format: recitation/discussion. Evaluation will be based on daily translations and contributions to class
discussion, several translation quizzes, an oral presentation, a final paper, and a final exam.

LATIN
CLLA 101(F)-102(S) Introduction to Latin
This is a full-year course on the fundamentals of the Latin language. The first semester and part of the
second emphasize learning basic grammar; the rest of the second semester is devoted to reading selec-
tions from Latin poetry (including Vergil's Aeneid and some Medieval Latin poetry, e.g., the Carmina
Burana) and from Latin prose (e.g., Pliny's Letters and/or the Vulgate Bible). This course is designed
for the student with no previous preparation in Latin or who has had only a little Latin and wishes a
refresher. Credit is granted for the first semester only if the second semester is taken as well. Students
with some previous experience in Latin may want to enroll in CLLA 102 only: consult the department.
Format: recitation/discussion. Evaluation will be based on frequent quizzes, tests, classroom exer-

CLLA 201(F) Intermediate Latin I: The Late Republic
Reading of selections from Latin prose and poetry, normally from a speech or letters by Cicero and
from the poetry of Catullus. This course includes a comprehensive review of Latin grammar and aims
primarily at developing fluency in reading Latin. At the same time it acquaints students with one of the
most turbulent and important periods in Roman history and attends to the development of their inter-
pretative and analytic skills.
Format: recitation/discussion. Evaluation will be based on classroom performance, quizzes, a mid-
term, and a final exam. Occasional oral presentations or short essays may be required as well.
Prerequisites: Latin 101-102 or 3-4 years of Latin in secondary school: consult the department. En-
rollment limit: 12 (expected: 6-10).
Hour: 1:10-2:25 TF KRAUS
CLLA 202(S) Intermediate Latin II: The Early Empire
Like Latin 201, this course pairs poetry and prose and aims to develop students' fluency in reading
Latin while acquainting them with a vitally important period in Roman history. More than Latin 201,
however, this course attends to the development of students' analytic and interpretive skills. We will
read selections from Ovid's Metamorphoses and from such early imperial prose as Livy's account of
the early republic or Petronius' Satyricon.
Format: recitation/discussion. Evaluation will be based on preparation for each class, classroom per-
formance, quizzes, a midterm and a final exam. Several oral presentations and short essays may be
required as well.
Prerequisites: Latin 201 or permission of instructor; some first-year students may be advised to enroll
in Latin 202 rather than Latin 201: consult the department. Enrollment limit: 12 (expected: 6-10).
Hour: 9:55-11:10 TR MANOLARAKI
CLLA 402(F) History and Memory in Late Republican Rome
While we today consider Rome of the Late Republic "ancient," the Romans of this period conceived
of themselves as a "modern" society and engaged in complex negotiations with their own "ancient
history," struggling to refashion accounts of Rome's past in terms of contemporary conditions and
ambitions. In this course we will read selections from various genres--from theoretical texts like Ci-
cero's de oratore, histories like Sallust's de catilina, Cicero's forensic speeches and the letters he ex-
changed with men like Caesar and Pompey--in order to examine the dynamic tensions in the dis-
course of historical memory in the Late Republic. These writers, most of them also towering public
figures, sometimes manipulated their accounts of Rome's past merely to promote their immediate
agendas. But they also explored, in various ways and with visions for Rome which exceed those agen-
das, both the constraints and the liberating potential of the Roman past. While examining historical
memory as variously registered in these texts, students will be encouraged to ponder how, and to what
ends, we today engage in constructing our own collective past(s).
Format: recitation/discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, at least one presenta-
tion to the class, a mid-term, a ten-page paper and a final exam.
Prerequisites: Latin 202 or permission of instructor. Students who took the previous version of Latin
402 may enroll in this course. Enrollment limit: 12 (expected: 6-10).

CLLA 406(S) Horace Odes 1-3
Nietzsche claimed that he never had an artistic delight comparable to his experience of reading a Ho-
ratian ode. Through close readings of selected odes in Books 1-3 we will seek to experience such de-
light for ourselves and to learn why, as Nietzsche put it, "what is here achieved is in certain languages
not even to be hoped for." We will examine the relation between poetic landscapes, poetic programs
and the poetry's exploration of subjects like love, friendship, youth and old age, death, politics, private
morality; the poet's capacity to define himself by offering his own account of poetic traditions and his
place in them; the variety of voices and perspectives within individual poems and throughout the
collection; the demands thereby placed on the poet's audience and the power of the poetry to trans-
form an audience equal to those demands. It is in terms of this transformational power of poetry that
we will consider Horace's relationship to his contemporaries, particularly Vergil, his patron Maece-
nas, and Augustus.
Evaluation will be based on contributions in the classroom, two 2- to 3-page papers (translation with
comments), a short memorization assignment, a final paper, and a final exam.

COGNITIVE SCIENCE (Div. II)
Chair, Associate Professor KRIS N. KIRBY
Advisory Committee: Professors: GERRARD, H. WILLIAMS. Associate Professors: DANY-
LUK**, KIRBY. Assistant Professors: CRUZ*, ZAKI.
Cognitive science is concerned with how humans, non-human animals, and computers acquire,
represent, manipulate, and use information. As an interdisciplinary field it combines research and
theory from computer science (e.g., artificial intelligence), cognitive psychology, philosophy, linguis-
tics, and neuroscience, and to some extent evolutionary biology, math, and anthropology. Complex
issues of cognition are not easily addressed using traditional intra-disciplinary tools. Cognitive re-
searchers in any discipline typically employ a collection of analytic and modeling tools from across
traditional disciplinary boundaries. Thus, the methods and research agenda of cognitive science is
broader than those of any of the fields that have traditionally contributed to cognitive science. The
Cognitive Science Program is designed to provide students with the broad interdisciplinary founda-
tion needed to approach issues of cognition.
THE CONCENTRATION
The concentration in Cognitive Science consists of six courses, including an introductory course,
four electives, and a senior research project.
Minds, Brains, and Intelligent Behavior (COGS 222) is the entry-point into the concentration,
and provides an interdisciplinary perspective on issues of cognition. Ideally, it should be taken before
the end of the sophomore year. Emphasizing the highly interdisciplinary nature of the field, the four
electives must be distributed over at least three course prefixes. In the fall of the senior year, concen-
trators will conduct interdisciplinary Research in Cognitive Science (COGS 493), supervised by
members of the advisory committee from at least two departments.

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN COGNITIVE SCIENCE
Formal admission to candidacy for honors will occur at the end of the fall semester of the senior
year and will be based on promising performance in COGS 493. This program will consist of COGS
W031-494(S), and will be supervised by members of the advisory committee from at least two depart-
ments. Presentation of a thesis, however, should not be interpreted as a guarantee of a degree with
honors.
COGS 222(S) Minds, Brains, and Intelligent Behavior: An Introduction to Cognitive Science
(Same as INTR 222, Philosophy 222 and Psychology 222) (Q)
This course will emphasize interdisciplinary approaches to the study of intelligent systems, both natu-
ral and artificial. Cognitive science synthesizes research from cognitive psychology, computer sci-
ence, linguistics, neuroscience, and contemporary philosophy. Special attention will be given to the
philosophical foundations of cognitive science, information theory, symbolic and connectionist ar-
chitectures, the neural basis of cognition, perception, learning and memory, language, action, reason-
ing, expert systems, and artificial intelligence.
Requirements: several short papers and self-paced weekly lab exercises.
Prerequisites: Psychology 101 or Philosophy 102 or Computer Science 134 or permission of instruc-
tors. Background in more than one of these is recommended. Enrollment limit: 25 (expected: 25).
Satisfies one semester of the Division II requirement.
Hour: 9:55-11:10 TR KIRBY
COGS 493(F) Research in Cognitive Science
Independent empirical or theoretical research for one semester, under the guidance of two Cognitive
Science faculty from different departments. Research must be interdisciplinary, but may consist of a
scholarly paper, empirical research, computer or mathematical modeling, or any combination of the
above. Students will meet biweekly to discuss their projects, and give oral presentations of their pro-
jects at the end of the fall semester.
COGS W031-494(S) Senior Thesis
The senior concentrator, having completed the fall research project and with approval from the advi-
sory committee, may devote winter study and the spring semester to a senior thesis based on the fall
research project.

Literature. The Program in Comparative Literature gives students the opportunity to develop their critical
faculties through the analysis of literature in its international and multicultural context. By crossing nation-
al, linguistic, historical, and disciplinary boundaries, students of Comparative Literature learn to read texts
for the ways they make meaning, the assumptions that underlie that meaning, and the aesthetic elements
evinced in the making. Students of Comparative Literature are encouraged to examine the widest possible
range of literary communication, including the metamorphosis of genres, forms, and themes.
Whereas specific literature programs allow the student to trace the development of one literature in
a particular culture over a period of time, Comparative Literature juxtaposes the writings of different
cultures and epochs in a variety of ways. The rubrics of the Program's core courses--Literary Genres,
Literary Movements, Literature and Theory, and Cultural Studies--introduce the student to a variety
of critical methods. Because interpretive methods from other disciplines play a crucial role in investi-
gating literature's larger context, the Program offers courses intended for students in all divisions of
the college and of all interests. These include courses that introduce students to the comparative study
of world literature and courses designed to enhance any foreign language major in the Williams cur-
riculum. In addition, the English Department allows students to count one course with a COMP prefix
as an elective within the English major.
The Program supports two distinct majors in Comparative Literatureand Literary Studies. The ma-
jor in Comparative Literature requires advanced work in at least one language other than English and
is strongly recommended for students contemplating graduate study in the discipline. Both majors
provide a strong basis for any career demanding analytical, interpretive, and evaluative skills and al-
low the student, within a framework of general requirements, to create a program of study primarily
shaped by the student's own interests.
MAJORS
Comparative Literature
The Comparative Literature major combines the focused study of a single national-language litera-
ture with a wide-ranging exploration of literary forms across national, linguistic, and historical boun-
daries. Each student declaring the major must select a single foreign language as his or her specialty,
although the serious study of literature in foreign languages other than the student's specialty is
strongly encouraged. The languages currently available are French, German, Ancient Greek, Latin,
Russian, and Spanish. Each student will also be paired with a faculty advisor with whom the student
will meet each semester to discuss how best to fulfill the requirements for the major.
Eleven courses are required for the major:
Comparative Literature 111 The Nature of Narrative (Literary Genres)
Any three of the following core courses:
Comparative Literature 221 Twentieth-Century European Poetry (Literary Genres)
Comparative Literature 224/English 204 The Feature Film (Literary Genres)
Comparative Literature 232 European Modernism (Literary Movements)
Comparative Literature 240/English 230 Introduction to Literary Theory (Literature and Theory)

Comparative Literature 344/Religion 304 From Hermeneutics to Post Coloniality (Literature and
Theory)
Three literature courses in the student's specialty language, in which texts are read in the origi-
nal. At least one of the three must be above the 200-level.
Three courses in which most of the course work concerns literature other than that of the student's
specialty language or literary theory. These courses may be selected from Comparative Literature of-
ferings or from other departments and must be approved by the student's major advisor. Only one may
be in English or American literature. Among the offerings of other departments that are possible, the
following employ readings in English translation and are especially appropriate to the major:
English 126, 202, 216, 219, 220, 235, 341, 345, 361, 371, 372

Comparative Literature 401 Senior Seminar (variable topics)
Comparative Literature
­ 121 ­
Students who are considering a major in Comparative Literature should aim to acquire intermedi-
ate-level proficiency in their specialty language by the end of the sophomore year. They should also
complete core course requirements by the end of their junior year. Students pursuing the Comparative
Literature major are strongly encouraged to study abroad during their junior year and may receive
major credit for up to 4 courses taken during study abroad. At least three courses towards the major
must be at the 300 level or above. Students are expected to take the version of 401 offered in their
senior year, even if they have previously taken 401.
Literary Studies
The Literary Studies major allows for a wide-ranging exploration of literary forms across national,
linguistic, and historical boundaries. Unlike the major in Comparative Literature, the Literary Studies
major does not require the student to choose a specialty language, although the serious study of litera-
ture in one or more foreign languages is strongly encouraged. Each student will be paired with a facul-
ty advisor, with whom the student will meet each semester to discuss how best to fulfill the require-
ments for the major.
Eleven courses are required for the major:
Comparative Literature 111 The Nature of Narrative (Literary Genres)
Any four of the following core courses:
Comparative Literature 221 Twentieth-Century European Poetry (Literary Genres)
Comparative Literature 224/English 204 The Feature Film (Literary Genres)
Comparative Literature 232 European Modernism (Literary Movements)
Comparative Literature 240/English 230 Introduction to Literary Theory (Literature and Theory)
Comparative Literature 252 Modern Women Writers and the City (Cultural Studies)

Comparative Literature 344/Religion 304 From Hermeneutics to Post Coloniality (Literature and
Theory)
Five courses devoted to literature or literary theory that cover at least three different national/cultur-
al traditions. The courses may be selected from Comparative Literature offerings or from other de-
partments and must be approved by the student's major advisor. Of the courses taken outside of the
Program in Comparative Literature, no more than two may have the same course prefix. Students
are strongly encouraged to include courses in a foreign language among these five. Among the of-
ferings of other departments that are possible, the following employ readings in English translation
and are especially appropriate to the major:
English 126, 202, 216, 219, 220, 235, 341, 345, 361, 371, 372
Linguistics 101, 121
Religion 210, 211
Theatre 210, 211, 328, 330, 331
Comparative Literature 401 Senior Seminar (variable topics)
Students who are considering a major in Literary Studies should aim to complete core course re-
quirements by the end of their sophomore year. Students who choose to study abroad during their
junior year may receive major credit for up to 4 courses taken during study abroad. At least three
courses towards the major must be at the 300 level or above. Students are expected to take the version
of 401 offered in their senior year, even if they have previously taken 401.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN COMPARATIVE LITERATURE OR LITERARY STUDIES
To achieve honors in Comparative Literature or Literary Studies, a student must prepare a thesis,
usually 50-75 pages long, during the senior year (COMP 493-W031-494 or LIT 493-W031-494). The
topic of the thesis must be comparative and/or theoretical in approach. Those majoring in Compara-
tive Literature must include a significant amount of material in the literature of the student's specialty
language. Students must apply to the Program's advisory committee for permission to pursue an hon-
ors thesis during the spring semester of the junior year.

derstanding of a given text? In what ways, and for what purposes, do authors create different narrators
to present a story? Our texts may include writings from Antiquity, and by Cervantes, Goethe, Austen,
Gogol, Balzac, Flaubert, Dostoevsky, and Kafka. We will accompany these texts with pertinent
theoretical pieces by--among others--Aristotle, Plato, Culler, Benjamin, and Foucault. All readings

COMP 215(F) The Fashioning of Fashion: Theory and Practice (Same as French 215)
"Fashion," Roland Barthes wrote, "is too serious and too frivolous at the same time." As a product of
culture, at once trivial and essential, fashion exhibits a compulsion to create signs, to reproduce
changing meanings, and to agitate, as well as normalize, the perpetual play of difference and novelty.
The course will examine fashion as a system of communication; a network of variable signs; a writing
(on and of the body); an ideology of socially-constructed images of femininity and masculinity; a
Comparative Literature
­ 123 ­
meeting point for gender, class, and political relations of power; a system for controlling the eroticized
body; a temporal whirlwind of impermanence and change ("the ecstasy of the new"); a playing-out of
the forces of desire and consumption; an instrument for plundering and recycling the styles of the past;
and, finally, a reality of everyday life constitutive of social order, collective fantasy, and personal self-
definition. We will explore the ways that fashion--in particular clothing, perfume, and cosmetics, as
mediated by strategies of representation (i.e., advertising, publicity, photography, media, literature,
art, cinema, consumer culture)--create, reproduce, and disseminate a certain kind of "imaginary,"
where fictions of desire, eroticism, aesthetics, myth, and national identity circulate. Three general
goals will orient our study: first, to understand how the sign systems of fashion, fashion history, and
fashion advertising produce meaning and value within culture; second, to examine the "imaginary" of
desire, fantasy, and identity produced by the creation and marketing of clothes, perfume, and cosmet-
ics; and third, to analyze the "rewriting" of face and body (the phenomenon of the "makeover") which
fashion seeks to inspire. Attention will be given: (1) to the history of fashion, perfume and cosmetics,
primarily, but not exclusively, in nineteenth- and twentieth-century France; (2) to the representation of
fashion in works of literature (Baudelaire, Huysmans, Zola, Proust, Calvino, Suskind, Robbins), cine-
ma (Funny Face, Unzipped, Pret-à-Porter, Tales of Cities and Clothes), and cultural and feminist
theory (Barthes, Baudrillard, Lipovetsky, Bordo, Bartky, Simmel, Corbin); (3) to the collaboration of
designer, fashion house, model, wearer, and spectator in the creation and dissemination of fashion; (4)
to the links between fashion and "spectacle," fashion and postmodernism, fashion and fetishism, fash-
ion and domination; and (5) to fashion as both the endless play of difference ("a signification without a
message," Baudrillard) and the interlacing of desire and death (Benjamin). All readings in English.

COMP 219(F) Venice: City of Stone, Water, and Dreams (Same as Italian 219)
The course will examine the "imaginary" that Venice has generated in art, architecture, literature, and
film from the early Renaissance to the end of the millennium. This "imaginary"--a combination of
image, myth, symbol, ideology, history, culture, aesthetics, reality, fantasy, and fascination--has en-
veloped Venice in an aura of paradoxes. The city is touched by mystery and melancholy, mist and
clarity, water and sky, light and gloom, transparence and opacity, wonder and fear, decadence and
spirituality, mirror and mask, carnival and sobriety, labyrinth and horizon, sensuality and artifice,
wave and stone, movement and immobility, and commerce and art. Why has this watery city--this
"ship of stone," this "serenissima," this "most stupendous . . . most far-reaching of humanist cre-
ations" (Adrian Stokes) at the intersection of East and West, this "unquenchable flame burning
through a veil of water" (D'Annunzio)--so fascinated writers, artists, travelers, and traders for so
many centuries? In what different ways and through what different images has it been represented (in
painting, photography, novel, mystery, poem, travel narrative, film, etc.) over time and how have
these aesthetic and cultural representations differed and yet remained the same? All readings in En-
glish.

COMP 232(S) European Modernism (W)
This seminar will explore literary and cultural modernism as an international phenomenon from 1860
to the 1970s. In the context of the profound social and historical transformations of Western culture in
this period, we will examine the works of literary, cinematic, and theoretical creators who have shaped
our "modernity": namely, the consciousness we have of ourselves, of the worlds we live in, and of the
temporal rhythms that determined the cadence of late nineteenth and twentieth-century life. Readings
will include: Baudelaire, Rimbaud, Dostoevsky, Ibsen, Freud, Proust, Kafka, Apollinaire, Marinetti,
Rilke, Pirandello, Breton, Mann, Woolf, Joyce, Beckett, Celan, Calvino, and Duchamp among others.
Theoretical essays by Benjamin, Bataille, and Barthes will be considered as well. We will investigate
the imaginative and aesthetic response of modernism (in its cubist, futurist, surrealist, existentialist,
and feminist forms) to urban alienation and the rise of the machine. Attention will be given as well to
modernism's attack against religion and other forms of traditional spirituality, its revolt against ratio-
nality and social convention, its reaction to the horror and despair of world war, its attempt to empow-

COMP 253(F) Literature and the Body
Some writers maintain that the creative experience is rooted entirely in the mind or spirit. However,
there are those for whom the human body, sometimes their own, plays a central role, both in the pro-
cess of creation and as a subject of artistic inquiry. Whether through poetry, novels, sketches, or short
stories, these authors tell a very different tale of literary process, and it is focused on the primacy of
personal, physical experience. By way of Rabelais, Sorel, Gogol, Maupassant, Kafka, Tanizaki, Dine-
sen, Babel, Mandelstam, and Borges, this course will examine how different writers present and use
the body as the consummate vehicle of expression. We will also consider other areas of study that are
intimately related to the physical experience, such as asceticism, illness, prostitution, and disability.
All readings in English.

COMP 256(S) Literature of the Americas: Dialogues in Historical Perspective (Same as

Most of us in the US understand "American" literature as the work of writers born and raised in the
United States, overlooking both the rich literary traditions of Canada, the Caribbean and Latin Ameri-
ca and the centuries of political and cultural history we share with those peoples. This course will pres-
ent the methods and issues involved in studying the literature of the American hemisphere, from the
fundamental (what is meant by "America"?) to more nuanced issues of identity and cultural agency,
while examining key texts written from 1492 to the present. Our work will be comparative, drawing
texts from different linguistic traditions--English, French and Spanish--into dialogue with one ano-
ther. We will consider both the interrelations of American peoples and the many cultural forms that
have developed in response to our common colonial heritage. Topics to be considered include: Colo-
nial Beginnings, Slavery and Its Aftermath, Nation Building, the Frontier, the War of 1898, Afro-
American Modernisms, Ghosts in Twentieth-Century Fiction, Latino Writers in the US. Readings
may include: Cabeza de Vaca, Mary Rowlandson, Juan Francisco Manzano, Wheatley, Sarmiento,
Twain, Palma, Whitman, Cather, Martí, Guillén, Césaire, Hughes, Faulkner, Rulfo, Morrison, Maryse
Condé, Junot Díaz. All readings in English.

This course will explore the literary roots and effects of the explosion of the unconscious into con-
sciousness at the turn of the twentieth century. Freud's psychoanalytic revolution will reveal itself to
be actually a significant event in an evolutionary process that took place to a large extent in the arena
of literature, to which Freud himself repeatedly acknowledged his debt. We will examine psychologi-
cally-minded literary texts that precede and, in some cases, preview Freud's theories, those theories
themselves, and texts (theoretical and literary) that reflect the immense influence of psychoanalysis in
the twentieth century. Authors might include Sophocles, Shakespeare, Goethe, Hoffmann, Flaubert,
Carroll, Kafka, Duras, Garcia Marquez, and Morrison. All readings in English.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: active class participation, reading journals, two short and

COMP 341(S) Writing Against Writing: Modern Theories of Jewish Textuality
The course will study those twentieth-century Jewish writers, thinkers, and theoreticians who write
allegories concerning the impossibility of writing, or who explore theoretically the inadequacy of lan-
guage, or who associate words with indeterminacy, inexpressibility, invisibility, silence, and the exile
of meaning. The most powerful expression for these writers comes not so much from writing (black
words on white paper) as from the blank space between lines and around letters. Writing and erasing
become synonymous. For a poet like the German Paul Celan words are like sand dunes, forever undo-
ing the patterns of their meaning. For the French writer Edmond Jabès, writing covers the blank page
the way wandering footprints trace themselves ephemerally onto the whiteness of the desert (that of
Galut, exile). For Freud, language is the very medium of the "talking cure," but its connection to the
unconscious remains oblique, imprecise, and deceptive. Discussion will be given to literary works by
Kafka, Celan, Jabès, Aaron Appelfeld, Georges Perec, Natalia Ginzburg, Cynthia Ozick, W. G. Se-
bald, and to writings on the Holocaust by Primo Levi, Nelly Sachs, Bruno Schultz, and the Yiddish
poet Avram Sutzkever. Theoretical texts by Freud, Walter Benjamin, Jacques Derrida, Sarah Kofman,

COMP 401(F) Senior Seminar: Literature and the Law
In this seminar, we will examine the complex relationship between literature and the law from three
different perspectives. First, we will examine the law as a genre of literature by reading several works
of legal writing, such as the Code of Hammurabi, sections of the Old Testament, and the Constitutions
of the United States, the Soviet Union, and Iraq. Second, we will read important works of literature
that rely on legal practice, forensic analysis, or trial procedure to communicate their message, includ-
ing Aeschylus' Oresteia, Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice, and Kafka's The Trial. Third, we will
integrate our study of these two bodies of writing by delving into theory by Freud, Foucault, and oth-
ers, about the cultural significance of the law, as well as the co-evolution of legal consciousness and
literary craft. In addition, our work in this seminar will include several films that dramatize legal pro-
cedure, as well as a trip to an actual courtroom, where we will watch the real-life drama of a trial in
progress. All readings in English.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on thoughtful and timely preparation for class, several
shorter writing assignments, and a final research project.
Prerequisites: a 300-level literature course or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 15 (expected:
10).

Computers play an enormously important role in our society. General-purpose computers are used
widely in business and industry and are found in an increasing number of homes. Special-purpose
computers are found in everything from automobile engines to microwave ovens. Understanding and
exploiting the great potential of computers is the goal of research in computer science. Among the
many fascinating research projects in progress in computer science today are investigations of: ways
to focus more computational power on a problem through the simultaneous use of many processors in
parallel; revolutionary computer languages designed to simplify the process of constructing complex
programs for computers; the use of computer-generated graphic images in the arts and as a tool for
visualization in the natural sciences; and the use of digital methods in global communications. The
Computer Science Department at Williams seeks to provide students with an understanding of the
principles underlying computer science that will enable them to understand and participate in these
exciting developments.
The department recognizes that students' interests in computer science will vary widely. The de-
partment attempts to meet these varying interests through: (1) its major; (2) a selection of courses in-
tended primarily for those who are interested in a brief introduction to computer science or who seek
Computer Science
­ 127 ­
to develop some specific expertise in computing for application in some other discipline; and (3) rec-
ommendations for possible sequences of courses for the non-major who wants a more extensive
introduction to computer science. These offerings are discussed in detail below.
MAJOR
The goal of the major is to provide an understanding of algorithmic problem-solving as well as the
conceptual organization of computers and complex programs running on them. Emphasis is placed on
the fundamental principles of computer science, building upon the mathematical and theoretical ideas
underlying these principles. The introductory and core courses build a broad and solid base for under-
standing computer science. The more advanced courses allow students to sample a variety of special-
ized areas of computer science including graphics, artificial intelligence, computer networks, soft-
ware engineering, compiler design, and operating systems. Independent study and honors work pro-
vide opportunities for students to study and conduct research on topics of special interest.
The major in Computer Science equips students to take advantage of awide variety of career oppor-
tunities. Thus the major can be used as a preparation for a career in computing, for graduate school, or
simply to provide an in-depth study of computer science for the student whosefuturecareerwillonly
tangentially be related to computer science.
MAJOR REQUIREMENTS
Required Courses in Computer Science
A minimum of 8 courses is required in Computer Science, including the following:
Introductory Courses
Computer Science 134 Introduction to Computer Science
Computer Science 136 Data Structures and Advanced Programming
Core Courses
Computer Science 237 Computer Organization
Computer Science 256 Algorithm Design and Analysis
Computer Science 334 Principles of Programming Languages
Computer Science 361 Theory of Computation
Electives
Two or more electives (bringing the total number of Computer Science courses to at least 8) chosen
from 300- or 400-level courses in Computer Science. At least one of these must be a course designated
as a PROJECT COURSE. Computer Science courses with 9 as the middle digit (reading, research, and
thesis courses) will normally not be used to satisfy the elective requirements. Students may petition the
department to waive this restriction with good reasons.
Required Courses in Mathematics
Mathematics 211 Linear Algebra
Mathematics 251 Discrete Mathematics
Students considering pursuing a major in Computer Science are urged to take Computer Science
134 and to begin satisfying their mathematics requirements early. Note in particular that Mathematic
251 covers material complementing that in the introductory courses (Computer Science 134 and 136)
and is a prerequisite for many advanced courses.
Students who take Computer Science 105, 108 or 109 may use that course as one of the two elec-
tives required for the major in Computer Science. Those who count Computer Science 109 toward the
major must select an elective different from Computer Science 371 (Computer Graphics) for their
project course. Similarly, students who count Computer Science 108 as an elective cannot select
Computer Science 373 as their second elective. Computer Science 105, 108, 109, and 134 are not
open to students who have taken a Computer Science course numbered 136 or higher.
To be eligible for admission to the major, a student must normally have completed Computer Sci-
ence 136 as well as Mathematics 251 by the end of the sophomore year. Mathematics 211 must be
completed by the end of the junior year. Students are urged to have completed two of the four core
courses (Computer Science 237, 256, 334, and 361) by the end of the sophomore year and must nor-
mally have completed at least three out of the four core courses by the end of the junior year.
Satisfactory participation is required in the Computer Science Colloquium by all senior majors.
With the advance permission of the department, two appropriate mathematics courses numbered 240
or above may be substituted for one Computer Science elective. Other variations in the required
courses, adapting the requirements to the special needs and interests of the individual student, may be
arranged in consultation with the department.
Potential majors are strongly encouraged to pick up the latest copy of the Informal Guide to
Courses in Computer Science, which can be obtained from the departmental office or on the World
Wide Web at http://www.cs.williams.edu. This document contains much more information on the ma-
jor, including suggested patterns of course selection and advice on courses relevant to different stu-
dent goals.

LABORATORY FACILITIES
The Computer Science Department maintains two departmental computer laboratories for students
taking Computer Science courses. The Macintosh laboratory (used in Computer Science 105, 108,
109, 134, 136, and 237) consists of an electronic classroom containing Macintosh G4 computers. This
laboratory also contains projection facilities enabling the instructor to display the computer screen
during lectures and demonstrations.
The Unix laboratory (used in courses numbered 136 and above) consists of a network of worksta-
tions that are available exclusively to students taking advanced Computer Science courses. These
workstations also support student and faculty research in computer science.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE
The degree with honors in Computer Science is awarded to a student who has demonstrated out-
standing intellectual achievement in a program of study which extends beyond the requirements of
the regular major. The principal considerations in recommending a student for the degree with honors
will be: mastery of core material, ability to pursue independent study of computer science, originality
in methods of investigation, and creativity in research. Honors study is highly recommended for those
students with strong academic records in computer science who wish to attend graduate school, pur-
sue high-level industrial positions in computing, or who would simply like to experience research in
computer science.
Prospective honors students are urged to consult with their departmental advisor at the time of reg-
istration in the spring of the sophomore or at the beginning of the junior year to arrange a program of
study that could lead to the degree with honors. Such a program normally consists of Computer Sci-
ence 493 and 494 and a WSP of independent research under the guidance of a Computer Science fac-
ulty member, culminating in a thesis which is judged acceptable by the department. The program pro-
duces a significant piece of written work. The written work often includes a major computer program,
depending on the nature of the honors work. All honors candidates are required to give an oral presen-
tation of their work in the Computer Science Colloquium in early spring semester.
Students considering honors work should obtain permission from the department before register-
ing in the fall of the senior year. Formal admission to candidacy occurs at the beginning of the spring
semester of the senior year and is based on promising performance in the fall semester and winter
study units of honors work. Recommendations for the degree with honors will be made for outstand-
ing performance in the three honors courses. Highest honors will be recommended for students who
have displayed exceptional ability, achievement, or originality.
INTRODUCTORY COURSES
The department offers four introductory courses--Computer Science 105: Understanding the
Web: Technologies and Techniques, Computer Science 108: Artificial Intelligence: Image and Real-
ity, Computer Science 109: The Art and Science of Computer Graphics, and Computer Science 134:
Introduction to Computer Science.
Computer Science 134 provides an introduction to computer science with a focus on developing
computer programming skills. These skills are essential to most upper-level courses in the depart-
ment. As a result, Computer Science 134 together with Computer Science 136 are required as a pre-
requisite to most advanced courses in the department. Those students intending to take several Com-
puter Science courses are urged to take Computer Science 134 early.
Those students interested in learning more about important new ideas and developments in Com-
puter Science, but not necessarily interested in developing extensive programming skills, should con-
sider Computer Science 105: Understanding the Web: Technologies and Techniques, Computer Sci-
ence 108: Artificial Intelligence: Image and Reality, or Computer Science 109: The Art and Science of
Computer Graphics. Computer Science 105 explores the computing technology that underlies the in-
ternet. Computer Science 108 discusses the techniques used to construct computer systems that ex-
hibit intelligent behavior from learning to planning and problem-solving. Computer Science 109 in-
troduces students to the techniques of computer graphics used for the creation of artistic images. In
addition, all three of these courses provide an introduction to the techniques of computer program-
ming.
Although none of our introductory courses assume prior programming skills, some students plan-
ning to take Computer Science 134 who have no prior programming experience may find it useful to
gain some programming experience together with a broader understanding of our field by taking one
of the department's other introductory courses before enrolling in Computer Science 134. On the oth-
er hand, students with significant programming experience should consider electing Computer Sci-
ence 136 (see "Advanced Placement" below). Students in either of these categories are encouraged to
contact a member of the department for guidance is selecting a first course.
ADVANCED PLACEMENT
Students with an extensive background in computer science are urged to take the Advanced Place-
ment AB Examination in Computer Science. A score of 4 or better on the AB exam is normally re-
quired for advanced placement in Computer Science 136. Students scoring 3 or lower on that exam or
Computer Science
­ 129 ­
who have taken the Advanced Placement A Examination in Computer Science should consider enrol-
ling in Computer Science 134.
Students who wish to be placed in Computer Science 136 but who have not taken the Advanced
Placement Examination should consult with the department. Such students should have had a good
course in computer science using a structured language such as C++ or Java, and should have covered
such topics as recursion, arrays, files, and have some exposure to object-orientation.
PLANS OF STUDY FOR NON-MAJORS
The faculty in Computer Science believes that students can substantially enrich their academic ex-
perience by completing a coherent plan of study in one or more disciplines outside of their majors.
With this in mind, we have attempted to provide students majoring in other departments with options
in our department's curriculum ranging fromtwo-coursesequences to collections of courses equiva-
lent to what would constitute a minor at institutions that recognize such a concentration. Students in-
terested in designing such a plan of study in any department should discuss their plans in detail with a
member of thefaculty.Wewelcomesuchinquiriesfromstudents.Toassiststudents making such plans,
however, we include some suggestions below.
Students seeking to develop an extensive knowledge of computer science without majoring in the
department are encouraged to use the major requirements as a guide. In particular, the four core
courses required of majors are intended to provide a broad knowledge of topics underlying all of com-
puter science. Students seeking a concentration in Computer Science are urged to complete at least
two of these courses followed by one of our upper-level electives. Such a program would typically
require the completion of a total of five computer science courses and one course in mathematics
(MATH 251).
There are several sequences of courses appropriate for those primarily interested in developing
skills in programming for use in other areas. For general programming, Computer Science 134 fol-
lowed by Computer Science 136 and 237 will provide students with a strong background in algorithm
and data structure design together with an understanding of issues of correctness and efficiency. Com-
puter Science 323 provides valuable exposure to the techniques and tools needed for the development
and maintenance of large software systems. The sequence of courses Computer Science 109 and 134
would provide sufficient competence in computer graphics for many students interested in applying
such knowledge either in the arts or sciences. For students requiring more expertise in the techniques
of computer graphics, Computer Science 136 and 371 could be added to form a four-course sequence.
There are, of course, many other alternatives. We encourage interested students to consult with the
department chair or other members of the department's faculty.
GENERAL REMARKS
Divisional Requirements
All Computer Science courses listed may be used to satisfy the Division III distribution require-
ment.
Alternate Year Courses
Computer Science 108, 109, 323, 336, 337T, 338T, 371, 373, 432, and 434 are each normally of-
fered every other year. All other Computer Science courses are normally offered every year.
Course Numbering
The increase from 100, through 200 and 300, to 400 indicates in most instances an increasing level
of maturity in the subject that is expected of students. Within a series, numeric order does not indicate
the relative level of difficulty of courses. Rather, the middle digit of the course number (particularly in
upper-level courses) generally indicates the area of computer science covered by the course.
Course Descriptions
Brief descriptions of the courses in Computer Science can be found below. More detailed informa-
tion on the offerings in the department is available in the Informal Guide to Courses in Computer Sci-
ence.
Courses Open on a Pass-Fail Basis
Students taking a computer science course on a pass-fail basis must meet all the requirements set
for students taking the course on a graded basis.
With the permission of the department, any course offered by the department may be taken on a
pass-fail basis. Courses graded with the pass-fail option may not be used to satisfy any of the major or
honors requirements. However, with the permission of the department, courses taken in the depart-
ment beyond those requirements may be taken on a pass-fail basis.
COURSES INTENDED PRIMARILY FOR NON-MAJORS
CSCI 105(S) Understanding the Web: Technologies and Techniques (Q)
This course will enable students to understand the technology that underlies the World Wide Web and
provide them with the skills needed to effectively use this new medium. The course introduces tech-
niques for creating hypermedia documents on the web. Students will learn the basics of HTML, the
Computer Science
­ 130 ­
formatting language used to author World Wide Web documents, and a subset of Java, a language that
can be used to add interactive elements to web pages. The technology that makes the Web possible is
developing as rapidly as its use is growing. New facilities are introduced frequently. Web "standards"
are evolving in several directions simultaneously as vendors introduce competing proposals. Accord-
ingly, rather than simply learning how to use the Web as it is today, we will also examine the funda-
mental technologies that make the Web possible. These include digital encoding techniques, comput-
er network organization, communication protocols and encryption systems. This material will leave
students prepared to understand future possibilities for, and obstacles to, the development of the Inter-
net.
Format: lecture/laboratory. Evaluation will be based on homework, laboratory work and examina-
tions. 55% of a student's final grade will be determined by performance on examinations.
Prerequisites: Mathematics 100 or 101 (or demonstrating proficiency in the Quantitative Studies
diagnostic test--see catalog under Mathematics). This course is not open to students who have suc-
cessfully completed a Computer Science course numbered 136 or above. Enrollment limit: 60 (ex-
pected: 40).

can also verify that an algorithm will perform correctly, as well as accurately estimate its running time
and space requirements. We will present several algorithm design strategies that build on data struc-
tures and programming techniques introduced in Computer Science 136, including induction, divide-
and-conquer, dynamic programming, and greedy algorithms. Particular topics to be considered will
include algorithms in graph theory, computational geometry, string processing, and advanced data
structures. In addition, an introduction to complexity theory and the complexity classes P and NP will
be provided.

CONTRACT MAJOR
Contract Major Advisor: PETER D. GRUDIN
Students with the talent and energy for working independently and with the strong support of two
faculty advisors may undertake a Contract Major: a coherent study of an interdisciplinary subject not
covered by a regularly offered major. Such a major must be in an area suitable to the talents of the
faculty in residence and cannot consist of minor modifications to an existing major. A Contract Major
also must conform to the structure and have the coherence of a departmental or program major--i.e.,
it must embody a disciplined cumulative study that moves from an elementary to an advanced level
Contract Major
­ 133 ­
and culminates in a synthesis similar to a senior major course. Hence a Contract Major usually con-
sists of a program of existing courses, sometimes supplemented by courses of independent study and
the senior course.
The process of constructing a proposal for a Contract Major is both interesting and demanding. As
part of that process, students should consider carefully the advantage of working within existing ma-
jors or programs, taking note of the considerable intellectual pleasures involved in sharing similar
educational experiences with other students working within the same field. Students might also con-
sider whether their interests could be met by completing a regular major and coordinate program, or a
double major, or simply by working outside a major field in courses of special interest. Because the
Contract Major represents an exceptional opportunity provided for students whose interests cannot be
met through existing departmental and interdepartmental majors and programs, it cannot be pursued
in conjunction with another major.
Students who wish to explore or propose a Contract Major should consult with the Contract Major
advisor and with potential faculty sponsors as early as possible in the fall semester of the sophomore
year, and then--during the sophomore year--follow these procedures:
1) The student must initiate discussion with at least two members of the faculty from differing de-
partments who expect to be in residence during the student's senior year and who are willing to en-
dorse the Contract Major and undertake a central role in supervising its implementation, criticism,
evaluation, and ultimate validation. Since in essence faculty sponsors substitute for the student's ma-
jor department, they are expected to play an important role in the Contract Major.
The student must develop, in conjunction with the faculty sponsors, a written proposal (forms and
guidelines are available in the Dean's Office) which should contain:
a) a description of the proposed major area of study and an explanation of the reasons for proposing
the Contract Major. A sound and persuasive rationale for the major is crucial for obtaining ap-
proval from the Committee on Educational Policy (C.E.P.).
b) a list of all courses in the proposed major and an explanation for each course choice. A minimum
of nine semester courses, one of which must be designated the senior major course (and taken
during the senior year), must be completed for a Contract Major. Normal rules governing course
grades and grade point average apply for entry into and continuation in a Contract Major.
c) a list of other courses taken or anticipated to meet College distribution requirements, including
grades received in courses already completed.
2) By mid-January, the student must meet with the Contract Major Advisor to discuss and further
develop the proposal.
3) By the first day of spring semester classes, the student must submit a complete draft of the pro-
posal to the Contract Major Advisor for feedback.
4) By the end of the fourth week of the spring semester, the student must submit the final proposal to
the Contract Major Advisor. By this date also, the faculty sponsors must submit their endorsement
forms to the Contract Major Advisor. If the student is essentially proposing to transform an existing
coordinate program (e.g., African-American Studies, area studies programs, Environmental Studies,
Women's and Gender Studies, etc.), into a Contract Major, the chair of that program should also sub-
mit to the Contract Major Advisor a statement attesting to the validity of the proposal by the end of the
fourth week of the spring semester.
5) The Contract Major Advisor then conveys the proposal, a copy of the student's most recent aca-
demic progress report, the faculty sponsors' endorsement forms, and recommendations regarding the
feasibility and substance of the proposal, for approval by the Committee on Educational Policy. The
C.E.P., after consultation with departments and programs substantially affected by a proposal, will
vote on each proposal individually and will report the decision to the Contract Major Advisor, who
will notify students and sponsors before the spring registration deadline. If the time needed for C.E.P.
review demands it, the Contract Major Advisor may postpone notification to students and permit
them to register late without penalty. In making its decisions, the C.E.P. considers the student's aca-
demic record, the coherence and feasibility of the plan of study, and the degree of support expressed
by the faculty sponsors and, if appropriate, program chairs.
Subsequent changes in a Contract Major must be requested in writing by the student and approved
by the faculty sponsors as well as by the Contract Major Advisor. Where there has been substantial
alteration of the original program, the Contract Major Advisor will forward the student's written re-
quest to the C.E.P. for reconsideration.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN THE CONTRACT MAJOR
The route to the degree with honors in the Contract Major will normally be a senior thesis requiring
two semesters and a winter study of work. In special circumstances a student may propose to substi-
tute a one-semester course or a winter study course for one of his or her thesis courses and write a
mini-thesis. The Contract Major with honors shall comprise a minimum of eleven semester courses or
ten semester courses plus one winter study. One semester of independent study undertaken for the
thesis may be allowed to fulfill the requirement for a senior major course.
Contract Major, Critical Languages, Economics
­ 134 ­
The faculty sponsors shall determine by the end of winter study whether the student is to be ad-
mitted to honors candidacy. If not admitted to honors candidacy, the student may elect not to continue-
further independent study. If admitted to honors candidacy, the student shall submit a written thesis or
minithesis to three faculty readers, at least one of whom shall be a faculty sponsor and at least one of
whom shall not be a faculty sponsor. The outside reader or readers shall be selected by the Contract
Major Advisor in consultation with the faculty sponsors. There will be a one-hour oral exam by the
readers, and they shall make a final decision regarding honors.

CRITICAL LANGUAGES (Div. I)
Coordinator, JANE CANOVA
The Critical Languages Program enables students to study important foreign languages not taught
in regular courses at Williams. The languages offered are Arabic, Hebrew, Hindi, Korean, and Swahi-
li. Each may be studied for one year at the elementary level.
All courses adhere to the guidelines of the National Association of Self-Instructional Language
Programs (NASILP). Students work independently with standard language textbooks and individual
cassette tapes for roughly ten hours per week and attend two one-hour group review sessions per week
with native-speaking tutors. Language faculty from other institutions conduct the midterm and final
exams and determine the final grades.
To be eligible for a Critical Languages course, the student must:
z demonstrate proven capability for independent work and previous success in foreign language
study;
z explain how study of the language will integrate with his or her major or other academic inter-
ests;
z present a letter of recommendation from a Williams faculty member;
z in some cases take a pretest for placement;
z have attained sophomore standing or higher;
z have at least a 3.00 Grade Point Average.
Interested students should obtain an application form for the desired course in early April. Forms
are available at the Center for Foreign Languages, Literatures, and Cultures in Weston Hall. Students
must meet with the program coordinator and hand in the completed application forms no later than
one week before preregistration. The application must be approved before registering for the course.
Students should note that Critical Languages courses are hyphenated, meaning no credit is given
for the first semester until the second semester is successfully completed. Students must normally be-
gin a course in the fall semester. It cannot be taken Pass/Fail.
A Critical Languages course will be scheduled only if and when at least two students are accepted
into the course. Students planning to register for the course must attend an organizational meeting the
first week of each semester.

MAJOR
For students who have already taken Economics 101, your course sequence should be Econom-
ics 101, any Economics course numbered 201 to 240 prior to taking Economics 251 or 251M,
252, and a statistical methods course (either 253 or 255, or Statistics 201 and 346) which should
be taken before 401, plus any three economics electives of which at least two must be selected
from advanced electives numbered 350 to 394, and Economics 401.
(Please note that students who have taken Economics 101 cannot take Economics 110 or 120.
Note that students cannot take Economics 110 or 120 without having passed the quantitative
studies exam or the equivalent.)
Students who are beginning their sequence with Economics 110 or Economics 120 should fol-
low the following sequence:
Economics 110 Principles of Microeconomics
Economics 120 Principles of Macroeconomics
(Economics 110 and 120 may be taken separately and in any order)
Economics 251 Price and Allocation Theory
or Economics 251M Price and Allocation Theory (This section of the Price and Allocation
Theory course will employ a somewhat more mathematical exposition of microtheory.)
Economics 252 Macroeconomics
One statistical methods course, Economics 253 or 255, or Mathematics 201 and 346. (The sta-
tistical methods course should be taken before 401.)
Three Economics electives, of which at least two must be selected from advanced electives
numbered 350 to 394
Economics 401 Senior Seminar
To complete the major, economics students must receive a passing grade on the oral examination
given in the course of Economics 401. A student who fails the oral examination must re-take the exam
and receive a passing grade.
The primary objectives of the major are to develop an understanding of economic aspects of con-
temporary life and to equip the student to analyze economic issues of social policy. The introductory
courses stress use of the basic elements of economic analysis for understanding and resolving such
issues. The two required intermediate theory courses then provide a more thorough grounding in eco-
nomics as a discipline by examining the strengths and weaknesses of the price system in allocating
economics resources and by examining the aggregate processes which determine employment, infla-
tion, and growth. A course in statistical methods (253 or 255, or alternatively, Statistics 201 plus Sta-
tistics 346) equips the major to understand and apply the basic tools of quantitative empirical analysis.
Majors must take three electives, in at least two of which they apply parts of the theory learned in the
required intermediate theory courses. In the senior seminar, the student studies a series of current
theoretical or policy problems, applying analysis and research methods.
The normal requirement that nine economics courses be taken at Williams will usually be waived
only on the basis of transferred credit deemed acceptable by the department. Credit is granted based
on grades consistent with college policy on various examinations:
z Students who receive a 5 on the Microeconomics AP or Macroeconomics AP exam, or a 5 on each,
may place out of Economics 110 or 120, or both, respectively, but major credit will be given for only
one course.
z The Department will grant major credit for both Economics 110 and 120 to a student who receives a
6 or 7 on the higher-level Economics IB examination, and that student can place into any 200-level
course or intermediate-level micro or macro course.
z For A levels credit, the Department will grant major credit for both Economics 110 and 120 to a
student who receives a grade of A or B.
Prospective majors please note that instructors in all sections of Economics 251, 252, 253, and 255
feel free to use elementary calculus in assigned readings, lectures, problem sets, and examinations;
therefore, Economics 110 and 120 and Mathematics 103 or its equivalent are required as prerequisites
for these courses except for 251 which only requires Economics 110 and Mathematics 103 as a pre-
requisite. By elementary calculus is meant differentiation of single variable polynomial functions and
conditions for a maximum or minimum; it does not include integration or multivariable calculus.
Instructors in advanced electives (courses numbered 350-394) may also use elementary calculus in
assigned readings, lectures, problem sets, and examinations. Students interested in graduate study in
economics should consider studying more advanced mathematics; see your advisor for specific
suggestions. Students are also reminded that some courses now have specific mathematics require-
ments; see course descriptions.

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN ECONOMICS
We encourage all majors who have at least a 3.5 GPA in economics courses to consider honors. To
be admitted to candidacy for honors in economics a student must complete a substantial piece of inde-
pendent research. Two routes to honors are open: the Specialization Route and the Thesis Route.
1) Specialization Route, consisting of these three units:
a. Development of a thesis proposal in the second module of Economics 401;
b. An honors winter study project (W030) in January of the senior year;
c. Economics 404 Honors Seminar.
Students who have notified the department of their interest in writing an honors thesis will use the
second module of Economics 401 to develop a thesis proposal. Such proposals frequently build on
research papers completed for advanced electives, but this is not a requirement. If the proposal is ac-
cepted, the student will be admitted to W030. The department provides a memorandum to majors with
more details every spring and fall.
2) Thesis Route (Economics 493-W031-494):
A few students each year will be accepted for year-long thesis research on a subject closely related
to the scholarly interests of a faculty member. A student who hopes to do such independent and ad-
vanced research in close association with a faculty member should begin to work out a mutually satis-
factory topic early in the second semester of his or her junior year. Application to the department must
be made before the end of the junior year by submitting a detailed proposal for work under the super-
vision of the faculty member. The WSP of the senior year is also spent on the thesis.
TheCollege Bulletin states that students who wish to receive honors must take at least one course in
addition to the minimum number required for the major. Students who pursue a year-long thesis and
therefore take both Economics 493 and 494 may substitute Economics 493foranupper-levelelective
iftheywishto.StudentswhopursuetheSpecializationRouteto Honors may not substitute Economics
404 for an upper- (or lower-) level elective requirement.
AFRICAN-AMERICAN STUDIES AND AREA STUDIES
A major in economics who concentrates in African-American or Area Studies may substitute the
non-economics courses in the concentration for one lower-level elective in the Economics major, but
not for an advanced elective (350-394).
Note on Course Numbers: Courses between 201 and 240 are lower-level electives and are open to
first-year students who have taken 110 or 120 (or 101). Courses between 260 and 349 are intermedi-
ate electives which do not build on specific prior experience, but do require some maturity, so they
have any two economics courses or permission of instructor as prerequisites. Courses 350 and
above are advanced electives primarily designed for Economics and Political Economy majors and
have intermediate theory prerequisites.
ECON 110(F,S) Principles of Microeconomics (Q)
This course is an introduction to the study of the forces of supply and demand that determine prices
and the allocation of resources in markets for goods and services, markets for labor, and markets for
natural resources. The focus is on how and why markets work, why they may fail to work, and the
policy implications of both their successes and failures. The course focuses on developing the basic
tools of microeconomic analysis and then applying those tools to topics of popular or policy interest
such as minimum wage legislation, pollution control, competition policy, international trade policy,
discrimination, tax policy, and the role of government in a market economy. This course is required of
Economics majors and highly recommended for those non-majors interested in Environmental Stud-
ies, Women's and Gender Studies and Political Economy. The department recommends that students
follow this course with Principles of Macroeconomics or with a lower-level elective that has Econom-
ics 110 as its prerequisite. Students may alternatively proceed directly to Intermediate Microecono-
mics after taking this introductory course.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: problem sets, quizzes, short essays, midterm, final exam.

An introduction to the study of the aggregate national economy. Develops the basic theories of ma-
croeconomics and applies them to topics of current interest. Explores issues such as: the causes of
inflation, unemployment, recessions, and depressions; the role of government fiscal and monetary
policy in stabilizing the economy; the determinants of long-run economic growth; the long- and short-
run effects of taxes, budget deficits, and other government policies on the national economy; and the
workings of exchange rates and international trade. Economics 110 and 120 may be taken in either
order.

ECON 203(S) Gender and Economics (Same as Women's and Gender Studies 203)
This course uses economic analysis to explore how gender differences can lead to differences in eco-
nomic outcomes, in both households and the labor market. Questions to be covered include: How
does the family function as an economic unit? How do individuals allocate time between the labor
market and the household? How have changes in family structure affected women's employment, and
vice-versa? What are possible explanations for gender differences in labor force participation, occu-
pational choice, and earnings? What is the role of government in addressing gender issues in the home
and the workplace? How successful are government policies that primarily affect women (e.g., com-
parable worth policies, AFDC/TANF, subsidization of child care)? The course will focus on the cur-
rent experience of women in the United States, but will place these gender differences in a historical
and cross-cultural context.

ered: when is government intervention in the economy appropriate? What is the most effective form
of intervention? What effects do government policies have on individual incentives? The course will
cover issues in both taxation and spending. Specific programs will be considered such as Social Secu-
rity, Medicare, education, and public assistance for the poor. We will also discuss rationales and strate-
gies for reforming the U.S. tax system.

ECON 207(F) China's Economic Transformation Since 1980*
Over the past twenty years, China has undergone an unprecedented economic turnaround. Since
opening the economy, average incomes in China have quadrupled and over 250 million people have
been lifted out of poverty. In this course, we will study the transformation of China's economy from
several perspectives. First, we will study the wildly successful transition of China from a commune-
based economy to ``market socialism.'' Within this study, we will discuss the ways that institutions
and organizational structures in China have led to and have been changed by the economy in transi-
tion. We will then discuss the effects of trade on China's economy, and conclude by exploring the
effect of China's rapid economic expansion on the environment. Throughout the course, we will con-
sider ways China's economy will continue to change over the next ten to twenty years.

What do we lose when monopoly exists? How does market structure affect advertising and technolog-
ical progress? Why regulate corporate behavior in the areas of advertising, product safety, pollution,
and occupational safety? Do we regulate effectively? What is the appropriate role of business in pub-
lic policymaking?

ECON 351(S) Tax Policy (Q)
The tax system is a major element of public policy. In addition to raising revenue for government ex-
penditure programs, policymakers use the tax system to redistribute resources and to promote a vari-
ety of economic policies. For example, the United States tax system has specific rules to encourage
savings, education, and investment. Inherently, many tax policy choices involve trade-offs between
equity and efficiency. The purpose of this course is to clarify the goals and possibilities of tax policy,
Economics
­ 140 ­
mainly through an examination of U.S. federal tax policy (though the search for possible reforms may
lead us to examine policies from other countries). The course will examine the choice of the tax base
(income or consumption), notations of fairness in taxation (e.g., the rate structure), the choice to tax
corporate income separately from personal income, and a variety of specific tax policy issues (e.g.,
retirement saving, child care, the "marriage" tax, capital gains taxation, and the taxation of housing).
Format: seminar/discussion. Requirements: short policy memos, paper, and final exam.

ECON 357T(S) The Strange Economics of College (W)
The course is going to focus on current economic problems in U.S. higher education with the ambi-
tious intention of resolving--or at least illuminating--some of them in creative ways, using economic
theory and careful analysis to do it. An understanding of the economics of colleges and universities
and higher education that's emerged only recently makes that a non-unreasonable aim. Topics include
questions of access, choice and diversity of American higher education; economic and non-economic
returns to higher education investments; and differences between private institutional goals and that
of society.
Format: tutorial; will meet in groups of 3. Evaluation will be based on papers and discussions.

ECON 358(F) International Economics
Over the past decade and since World War II, the growth of world trade has significantly outpaced
growth of real GDP to create an increasingly global marketplace. For a group of rapidly growing East
Asian economies, the expansion of trade and the rise in the share of manufactured products in exports
has been even more spectacular. This course will cover the theory and empirical analyses of the causes
and consequences of international trade. Special attention will be focused on the relations between
technology, trade, and economic growth. Topics covered will include trade and welfare, comparative
advantage and its sources, the role of increasing returns and product differentiation, trade and eco-
nomic growth, trade policy with and without market power, and foreign direct investment.

ECON 360(F,S) International Monetary Economics
This course studies the macroeconomic behavior of economies that trade both goods and assets with
other economies: international financial transactions, especially the buying and selling of foreign
money, the role of central banks and private speculators in determining exchange rates and interest
rates, and the effects of international transactions on the overall performance of an open economy.
Additional topics may include the "asset market approach" to exchange rate determination, the nature
and purpose of certain international institutions, and important current events.

ECON 362(S) Global Competitive Strategies
This course examines the ways in which a country's factor endowments, domestic market characteris-
tics, and government policies promote or impede the global expansion of its industries and corpora-
tions. First, actual trade and investment decisions of multinational corporations are analyzed and
compared to the predictions of international trade theory. Second, competitive strategies of indige-
nous and foreign rivals in U.S., Pacific rim, and European markets are explored. Third, the efficacy of
government policies in promoting the competitiveness of industries in global markets is discussed.
Case studies of firms, industries, and countries will be utilized.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: a research paper and exam(s).

ECON 363(F) Money and Banking
This course consists of three broad areas of study. First, we will explore the role of money and its
interaction with other economic variables. Second, we will study the role of the central bank and the
conduct of monetary policy. Although special attention will be given to the organization and the op-
eration of the Federal Reserve System, other monetary policy regimes will also be considered. Finally,
we will look at the role of financial intermediaries (especially banks) in the flow of funds between
savers and investors.

ECON 364(F) Incentives and Information (Q)
Asymmetries of information are pervasive in economic relationships. For instance, buyers know their
own willingness to pay but sellers do not, and citizens know their earning ability but the government
does not. Informed agents have an incentive to manipulate their private information for their own
gain. Uninformed agents must design schemes to provide the right incentives. This course analyzes
moral hazard, mechanism design and signaling models. It uses techniques from game theory and con-
tract theory. Applications include auctions, insurance, health care, corruption and poverty reduction.
Format: seminar. Requirements: problem sets, midterm and final exam.

ECON 367(S) Empirical Methods in Macroeconomics (Same as Economics 514) (Q)
Macroeconomics and related fields in international finance and development have evolved special-
ized empirical techniques, known generally as macroeconometrics, which are designed to meet the
practical challenges that the data and the empirical questions pose in these fields. The course will
introduce the theory and application of these techniques, and students will learn how to implement
these techniques using real world data to address practical questions drawn from the fields of macro,
international finance and development. Topics to which these techniques will be applied include busi-
ness cycle analysis and forecasting, sources of exchange rate volatility and determinants of long run
economic growth. Computer work and programming will be an integral part of the course, but no
previous training is expected.
Format: seminar. Requirements: short empirical projects, midterm, term paper.

ECON 384(S) Corporate Finance (Q)
This course is similar to Economics 317, but it is at a more advanced level and is especially designed
for economics and political economy majors. While 317 focuses on financial markets, 384 is a mana-
gerial perspective of how managers operate in these markets. This course analyzes the major financial
decisions facing firms. Topics include capital budgeting, links between real and financial invest-
ments, capital structure choice, dividend policy, and firm valuation. Additional topics may include
issues in corporate governance, managerial incentives and compensation, and corporate restructur-
ing, such as mergers and acquisitions. A student may not receive credit for both 317 and 384.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: problem sets, short projects such as case write ups, mid-
term, and a final exam.
Prerequisites: Economics 251, 252, and some familiarity with statistics (e.g., Economics 253 or 255).

ECON 385(F) Games and Information (Q)
Be it a trade treaty or a marketing war or an election or even a courtship; people think strategically, i.e.,
they formulate their own actions while anticipating others'. Game theory provides a unifying frame-
work to study such strategic interactions. A special case of interest is games in which some players
know more than others. For instance, a CEO (who happens to hold stock options) may know more
about his/her company's future than others investors who hold stocks in that company. We study how
such informational asymmetries influence people's strategies.
Many new insights emerge from the study of Games and Information: First, individually rational be-
havior need not maximize a society's welfare in any conceivable sense. Second, asymmetric informa-
tion may lead to perverse incentives among individuals, causing certain types of markets to either
function very inefficiently or to collapse altogether. And third, in light of the above points, we should
pay close attention to designing the correct `rules of the game'--rules of corporate governance, the
regulatory framework, the law and the Constitution!
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: problem sets, a mid-term and a final.

ECON 401T(F) Senior Seminar--Economics of Community Development
This course focuses attention on the economic issues that arise in understanding community develop-
ment. Students will address such questions as: why do some cities grow, while others lose population?
Why are some communities successful in attracting new firms and getting existing ones to expand?
Why are some communities regarded as offering better 'quality of life' than others? Why do em-
ployees of local governments join unions in higher proportions than any other sector of the economy?
How do decisions made in local governments affect the overall economy, and how does the economy
and competition between communities affect local decisions? Thinking about such questions helps to
develop skills in economic analysis and understanding of communities, the challenges they confront,
and how to improve them. Students will be expected to read, discuss, and synthesize a variety of ana-
lytic approaches into their own analysis of particular community development questions. Students
will be expected to work with and analyze data and to present the results of their analysis.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: students will meet with the instructor in pairs for an hour each week;
they will write a paper every other week, and comment on their partner's papers every other week.
Students enrolled in this tutorial are required to participate for the full semester, even if pursuing a
thesis by the specialized route.

ECON 503(S) Public Finance (Same as Economics 378)
Public finance is the branch of economics concerned with government expenditure and taxation, fo-
cusing primarily on microeconomic aspects of these activities. It provides tools for understanding the
effects of government policies, as well as a useful conceptual framework for analyzing normative
questions such as "what is a good policy?" This seminar will present the basic principles for public
finance, and apply them to topics of particular importance in developing countries. The course will
begin by considering the efficiency of market economics, and rationales for government intervention
in the market, such as public goods, externalities, information-based market failures, and equity. Ap-
plications include environmental policy, education, health care, aid to the poor, and social security.
We then move on to the economics of taxation, considering what kinds of taxes are used in developing
countries, the economic and distributional effects of taxation, questions of administration and eva-
sion, and options for reform such as the value added tax. Time permitting, we may also address topics
such as pubic enterprises, political economy, and decentralization.

In this course, each Fellow carries out an individual research study on a topic in which he or she has
particular interest, usually related to one of the three seminars. The approach and results of the study
are reported in a major paper. Research studies are analytical rather than descriptive and in nearly all
cases include quantitative analyses. Often the topic is a specific policy problem in a Fellow's own
country.

COURSES AND COURSE-NUMBERING
The course offerings in English enable students, whether majors or non-majors, to explore litera-
ture in a variety of ways, and to satisfy their interests in particular authors, literary periods, and genres.
They emphasize interpretive skills, systematic and critical thinking, and careful attention to the gener-
ic, cultural, and historical contexts of literature written in English.
100-LEVEL COURSES
At the introductory level, the department offers a range of writing-intensive 100-level courses
which focus on interpretive skills--techniques of reading--as well as skills in writing and argumenta-
tion. The department also offers English 150, Expository Writing, a course focusing on rudimentary
writing skills. All 100-level courses are designed primarily for first-year students, although they are
open to interested sophomores, juniors, and seniors. A 100-level course other than 150 is required for
admission to most upper-level English courses, except in the case of students who have placed out of
the introductory courses by receiving a score of 5 on the Advanced Placement examination in English
Literature.
200-LEVEL COURSES
Most 200-level courses are designed primarily for qualified first-year students, sophomores, and
junior and senior non-majors, but they are open to junior and senior majors and count as major
courses. Several 200-level courses have no prerequisites; see individual descriptions for details.
200-level Gateway courses are designed for first- and second-year students who are considering be-
coming English Majors, or who are interested in pursuing upper-level course work in the department.
All Gateway courses are writing-intensive. Completion of a Gateway course is a requirement for the
major.
300-LEVEL COURSES
The majority of English Department courses are at the 300 level. 300-level courses are open to
sophomores, juniors, and seniors. They are normally not open to first-year students, although in ex-
ceptional cases first-year students may enroll in a 300-level course with consent of the instructor.
400-LEVEL COURSES
400-level courses are intensive, discussion-oriented classes that place a premium on independent,
student-initiated work. Such classes can be structured in a variety of ways. A course might alternate
tutorial sessions with seminar meetings, or it might take the form of a colloquium, with discussions
organized around individual or group presentations on different aspects of a topic. Or a class might be
oriented around a long final paper on a topic of the student's devising and involve conferences focused
on the progress of that project. Limited to 15 students, 400-level courses are open to students who
have completed at least one 300-level English course; they should be attractive to any student inter-
ested in a course that emphasizes intensive discussion and independent work.
ADVISING
All junior and senior English majors are assigned a departmental faculty member as an advisor.
Students' preferences for advisors are solicited during the preregistration period in April, and assign-
ments are announced at the start of the school year.
Non-majors who wish to discuss English Department offerings are invited to see any faculty mem-
ber or the department chair.
MAJOR
Majors are urged to select a balance of intermediate and advanced courses, and to choose classes
from both the American and British traditions. Each student can fashion his or her own sequence of
English
­ 147 ­
study within a basic pattern that insures coherence and variety. This pattern comprises at least nine
courses.
They are also urged to elect collateral courses in subjects such as art, music, history, comparative
literature, philosophy, religion, theatre, and foreign languages with a view to supporting and broaden-
ing their studies in literature. In particular, the study of classical and modern languages, as well as of
foreign literatures, is strongly recommended.
Requirements
The nine courses required for the major must include the following:
1) Any 100-level English class except English 150. Students exempted by the department from
100-level courses will substitute an elective course.
2) At least two courses dealing primarily with literature written before 1700 (identified in paren-
theses at the end of the course description).
3) At least two courses dealing primarily with literature written between 1700 and 1900 (identified
in parentheses at the end of the course description).
4) At least one course dealing primarily with literature written after 1900 (identified in parentheses
at the end of the course description).
5) At least one "criticism" course (identified in parentheses at the end of course description). A
course fulfilling the criticism requirement entails a sustained and explicit reflection on problems of
critical method, whether by engaging a range of critical approaches and their implications or by ex-
ploring a particular method, theorist, or critic in depth. Please note that when a criticism course also
deals with literature satisfying a historical distribution requirement (pre-1700, 1700-1900, etc.), the
course may be used to satisfy either the criticism or the chronological requirement, but not both.
6) At least one 200-level Gateway course (listed at the end of the 200-level course descriptions).
Gateway courses are designed for first- and second-year students contemplating the major or intend-
ing to pursue more advanced work in the department; these courses focus on analytical writing skills
while introducing students to critical methods and historical approaches that will prove fruitful as they
pursue the major. (Note: a Gateway course can fulfill a Period or Criticism requirement as well as a
Gateway requirement.)
The English Department encourages majors to consider courses offered in the Comparative Litera-
ture Program. The English Department will allow students to countone course with a COMP prefix as
an elective in the English major. This course must be an elective; it may not be used to satisfy the de-
partment's historical distribution, criticism, or gateway requirements.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN ENGLISH
The English Department offers three different routes toward honors: a creative writing thesis, a crit-
ical thesis, and a critical specialization. The requirements of each are described below. Candidates for
the program should normally have at least a 3.5 average in courses taken in English, but admission
will not depend solely on course grades. Formal application to pursue honors must be made to the
director of honors by April of the junior year. For the Class of 2003, the Director of Honors is Profes-
sor Kathryn Kent.
All routes require honors students to take a minimum of TEN regular-semester courses (rather than
the nine otherwise required for the major), and to devote their senior year winter study course to their
honors projects. More specifically:
Students doing a creative writing thesis must, by graduation, take at least nine regular-semester
courses, and, in addition, take English 497 (Honors Independent Study, fall) and English 031 (Honors
Thesis, winter study) during senior year.
Students writing a critical thesis must, by graduation, take at least eight regular-semester courses,
and, in addition, take English 497 and English 498 (Honors Independent Study, fall and spring) and
English 031 (Senior Thesis, winter study) during senior year.
Students pursuing a critical specialization must, by graduation, take at least eight regular-semester
courses, and in addition, take English 497 and English 498 (Honors Independent Study, fall and
spring) and English 030 (Honors Colloquium: Specialization Route, winter study) during senior year.
A student who is highly-qualified to pursue honors, but who, for compelling reasons, is unable to
pursue a year-long project, may petition the department for permission to pursue a critical thesis or
critical specialization over one semester and the winter study term. Since the norm for these projects is
a full year, such permission will be granted only in exceptional circumstances. If granted, the stan-
dards for admission and for evaluating the final project would be identical to those that apply to year-
long honors projects.
All students who wish to apply to the honors program are required to consult with a prospective
faculty advisor, as well as with the director of honors, before April of the junior year. In early-April,
candidates submit a 1-page preliminary proposal that provides as specific a description as possible of
the proposed project. The director of honors reviews proposals with the faculty advisor, and then
makes a recommendation to the whole department. Students whose proposals are accepted receive
provisional admission to the program at this time. Students not admitted to the honors program are
English
­ 148 ­
advised, when appropriate, about other possible ways of pursuing their interests (e.g., independent
studies, regular departmental courses).
Admitted students must consult with their advisors before the end of the spring semester of junior
year to discuss reading or work pertinent to writing the formal honors prospectus. This prospectus,
due in early August before the fall semester of senior year, is a decisive factor in final admission to the
program. Two copies of the formal prospectus must be submitted--one to the director of honors, and
the other to the student's advisor. After reviewing the prospectuses and consulting with advisors, the
department's honors committee determines final admission to the program. Applicants are notified
during the first week of the fall term.
While grades for the fall and winter study terms are deferred until both the honors project and re-
view process are completed, students must do the equivalent of at least B+ work to continue in the
program. Should the student's work in the fall semester not meet this minimal standard, the course
will convert to a standard independent study (English 397), and the student will register for a regular
winter study project. A student engaged in a year-long project must likewise perform satisfactorily in
winter study (English 030 or 031) to enroll in English 498 in the spring semester. When such is not the
case, the winter study course will be converted to an independent study "99."
Students are required to submit to their advisor, on the due dates specified below, three final copies
of their written work. While letter grades for honors courses are assigned by the faculty advisor, the
recommendation about honors is made by two other faculty members, who serve as readers of the
student's work. These readers, after consulting with the faculty advisor, report their recommendation
to the whole department, which awards either Highest Honors, Honors, or no honors. Honors of any
kind are contingent upon satisfactory completion of courses in the major during the spring semester of
the senior year. Highest honors are normally awarded only to students whose performance in both the
honors program and regular courses in the major has been exceptional. All students who are awarded
honors participate in a series of informal presentations at the end of the spring term in senior year.
Creative Writing Thesis
The creative writing thesis involves the completion of a significant body of fiction or poetry during
the fall semester and winter study of the senior year. (With permission of the honors committee, the
thesis may be undertaken during the winter study period and the spring semester of the senior year.)
Since a student will most likely include in the thesis writing done in earlier semesters, a creative writ-
ing thesis usually involves only the fall semester and the winter study period, rather than the full year
allotted to complete the critical essay.
Requirements for admission include outstanding work in an introductory and an advanced work-
shop, a recommendation from one of the creative writing teachers (who will then act as thesis advi-
sor), a brief preliminary proposal, and the approval of the departmental honors committee. The formal
prospectus consists of a 1-page description of the project, including its relation to work completed and
in-progress. Students must also submit a writing sample. A creative writing thesis begun in the fall is
due on the last day of winter study. The methods of evaluation are identical to those for critical projects
(but their page limits do not apply).
Critical Thesis
The critical thesis involves writing a substantial scholarly and/or critical essay during both semes-
ters as well as the winter study period of the senior year. The formal prospectus, a 2- to 3-page descrip-
tion of the thesis project, should present a coherent proposal indicating the range of the thesis, the
questions to be investigated, the methods to be used, and the arguments likely to be considered, along
with a brief bibliography.
Significant progress on the thesis, including a substantial amount of writing (to be determined by
student and advisor), is required by the end of the fall semester. A first draft of the thesis must be com-
pleted by the end of the winter study period. The spring semester is to be devoted to revising and refin-
ing the work and to shaping its several chapters into a unified argument. Ideally, the length of the hon-
ors essay will be about 15,000 words (roughly 45 pages). In no case should the thesis be longer than
25,000 words, including notes. The finished thesis is due on the second Friday following spring break.
Critical Specialization
The critical specialization route is intended to provide students with an opportunity for making a
series of forays into an area of interest that is both broad in scope and related to work undertaken in at
least two courses. At least one of these courses must be in the English Department, and both need to
have been taken by the end of fall term in senior year. The critical specialization must be united by a
common area of interest, such as a given literary form or historical period, a topic that cuts across
several periods, an issue in literary theory, a topic that connects literary and cultural issues, a compara-
tive literature or interdisciplinary topic. Students are encouraged to propose specialization topics of
their own devising. The following examples are meant only to suggest the kinds of topics appropriate
to a critical specialization: lyric traditions, postmodern narrative, magic realism, Dante and modern
literature, Freud and literature, the poet as citizen, new historicist approaches to literature, feminist
film criticism.
English
­ 149 ­
In addition to reading primary works, the student is expected to read secondary sources, which de-
scribe or define issues critical to the area of specialization. The formal prospectus, a 2- to 3-page de-
scription of the project, should specify the area and range of the study, the issues likely to be explored,
and the methods to be used for their investigation. This prospectus should also describe the relation
between previous course work and the proposed specialization, and include a brief bibliography of
secondary works. The pursuit of the specialization route requires the following: (1) writing a set of
three essays, each about 10 pages long (a page being approximately 250 words), which together ad-
vance a flexibly-related set of arguments. The first two essays are due by the end of the fall semester,
and the third by the end of winter study; (2) developing an extended annotated bibliography (about
4-5 pages long) of selected secondary sources, explaining their importance to the area of specializa-
tion (due mid-February); (3) meeting with the three faculty evaluators (one of whom is the advisor)
during the last two weeks in February to discuss the trio of essays and the annotated bibliography; (4)
writing a fourth essay of 10-12 pages, the purpose of which is to consider matters that arose during the
faculty-student discussion and to reflect on the evolution and outcome of the intellectual journey un-
dertaken by the student. This final essay is due on the second Friday after spring break.
The same three faculty members are involved throughout the assessment process, and the standards
and methods of evaluation are the same as for other kinds of honors projects, with the following ex-
ception: For the specialization route, the evaluation will also include the student's performance in the
discussion with the three faculty readers, and that discussion will include not only the student's writ-
ing but also secondary sources.
COURSES
100-LEVEL COURSES (except English 150)
Through small class discussions (limited in size to 19 students per section) and frequent writing
assignments, 100-level English courses ask students to develop their skills as readers and as analyti-
cal writers. Each course assigns 20 pages of writing in various forms. These courses are prerequi-
sites for taking most other English courses. Students who receive a 5 on the AP English Literature
exam may take upper-level courses without first taking a 100-level. All 100-level English courses
are writing intensive.
ENGL 107(F) Green World (Same as Environmental Studies 107) (W)
This course will explore the rich and various ways in which literature has constructed and interpreted
the green-written world: as the symbol of youth, love, beauty, and passing time; as a pastoral paradise
where man's fall from grace brings death into the world; as a scene of cyclical renewal and spiritual
rebirth; as the archetypal symbol of man's desire to transform chaos into civilization and art--to tame,
order, idealize, and copy nature's bounty while humanizing, plundering, and destroying the environ-
ment. We will a engage a wide range of genres from the Renaissance to the present: Burnett's classic
children's book, The Secret Garden, Shakespeare's comedy, As You Like It, selected nature lyrics from
the Renaissance to the present; Glück's The Wild Iris, Woolf's To the Lighthouse, contemporary prose
meditations on building gardens and protecting the earth by Jamaica Kincaid and Michael Pollan. We
will conclude with the hilarious Peter Sellers film, Being There, where Chance's proverbial gardening
lore is taken for political wisdom.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: active participation in class discussion, and 20 pages of
writing in the form of short essays.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference given to first-year students.
Hour: 1:10-2:25 MR I. BELL
ENGL 108(F) Forms of Revenge (W)
Even in its most brutal expression, revenge lies close to art. Writers in almost every period have ex-
ploited this affinity and vengeance is as basic to the detective novel and the suburban sitcom as it is to
ancient epic and the medieval fabliau. In this course, we will consider the representation of revenge in
a range of genres. Works by Homer, Shakespeare, Poe, Nabokov, Neil Jordan and Lucille Ball.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: 20 pages of writing in the form of short papers.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference given to first-year students.
Hour: 9:55-11:10 TR KLEINER
ENGL 109(F) Now and Then: Classic African American Literature (Same as American

This course explores the changing audiences for African American Literature through an examination
of three genres of African American Literature: The Slave Narrative, The Urban Novel, and The Folk
Tradition. We will read a range of text to understand each genre's early beginnings as well as the pres-
sures varying times and different audiences exert on the form. Slave Narratives by Harriot Jacobs and
Frederick Douglass will be juxtaposed to fictional Neo Slave Narratives by Octavia Butler and Toni
Morrison. The Urban Novel will be explored in its Naturalist form (Richard Wright and Ann Petry)
and its modernist form, Ellison's Invisible Man. We will consider the richness of the Folk Tradition in
Charles Chesnutt and Gloria Naylor. Throughout the course we will consider issues of gender and

ENGL 110(S) The Nineteenth-Century American Short Story (W)
This class will emphasize the development of critical reading skills through its focus on the short
story, a particularly crucial genre in the nineteenth century. We will examine the humorous, grotesque,
political, and realistic strains of short fiction in America across the century, and consider the function
of the story as both an artistic practice of economy and as a presence in periodical publishing--where
it functions both to entertain and to editorialize. Readings include a range of authors, such as Haw-
thorne, Poe, Edward Everett Hale, Rebecca Harding Davis, Bret Harte, Sarah Orne Jewett, Charles
Chestnutt, and Henry James.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: class participation and 20 pages of writing in the form of
frequent short papers.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference given to first-year students.
Hour: 11:20-12:35 TR T. DAVIS
ENGL 113(F) Critical Reading (W)
What determines a text's "meaning"? What makes a text "literary"? Is it something fundamental to the
text itself? Is it the circumstances in which we encounter it? Or is it the preoccupations and interests
we ourselves bring to it--in other words, the way we read it? This course will focus on key skills and
issues involved in critical reading of literary texts. It will be organized around a series of such funda-
mental questions as: What characterizes "interpretation"? What do literary texts expect of us? What
pleasures and parameters are established by the way(s) we read? Where does meaning come from:
author, reader, text? How does the form or genre of a work influence our interpretation of it? How is
our understanding of a text shaped by the contexts in which we encounter it, or by the literary tradi-
tions in which it was written? We will address these questions by reading and interpreting literary texts
(mainly short fiction and poetry) and pertinent critical and theoretical essays. Our readings, and our
written work, will invite increased self-consciousness about literary form, the functions of criticism,
and the process of reading and interpreting. The course is intended both to develop students' skills in
reading, writing about, and discussing literary texts, and to complicate their understanding of poten-
tial pleasures and profits of critical interpretation.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: four formal papers ranging from 3-7 pages, several short
informal writing assignments, participation in two tutorial meetings and active contribution to discus-
sion.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 per section (expected: 19 per section). Preference given to first-
year students. Four sections.
This course is part of the Critical Reasoning and Analytical Skills initiative.

ENGL 115(S) Narrative and Narrative Experience (W)
Forming and sharing and thinking about stories is our primary way of organizing experience: through
them we make life and the world understandable and open to mastery. In this course we will read nar-
ratives across time, from antiquity to the present day, and across their wide diversity of forms, from
poetry to novels to comic books, from plays to film and television. We will investigate the ways in
which narrative has been put to use as an organizer of experience, and the ways in which it has been
put to use in specific historical and political situations. Possible authors and works include Homer, Sir
Gawain and the Green Knight, Conan Doyle, Joyce, Nabokov, and Shakespeare, among others.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: 20 pages of writing in the form of short papers.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected:19). Preference given to first-year students.
Hour: 11:00-12:15 MWF P. MURPHY
ENGL 119(F) Literature and Social Change (W)
Underlying the title of this course is a question about how, and if, fiction can change society. How does
literature exercise criticism of the society which gives rise to its being written in the first place? This
debate has influenced theories of art throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. For writers,
particularly those influenced by Marx's account of society, it is often difficult to imagine that some-
thing cultural can affect the way that society and its economy are reproduced. On the other hand, it can
be equally difficult for those who defend the ideal of "art for art's sake" to imagine literature which has
political aims being good literature. In this course we will read novels by authors who have tackled the
theory and the practice of what it means to see, and to write, literature that explicitly calls for social
change. We will read Mary Wollstonecraft's Maria, or The Wrongs of Woman, George Gissing's New
Grub Street, Charles Dickens's Hard Times, and Jack London's Martin Eden as well as a range of
theorists, philosophers, and sociologists who have approached the question of how literature is-or
isn't- linked to explicitly political or revolutionary movements.

(See under Comparative Literature for full description.)
Note: English 120 may be used as the prerequisite for other English courses.
ENGL 121(S) Precocity (W)
Precocity--knowing too much too early and without understanding the implications of what you
know--is often the subject of literary texts, perhaps because it dramatizes the stakes of interpreting.
Precocity can emerge in a character, as a narrative posture, or in the very texture of the writing. It can
produce highly charged dramatic situations, comic or ruinous; it can precipitate crisis of character and
of narrative. We will read Nabokov's Lolita, James' The Turn of the Screw, Stoppard's play Arcadia,
and a range of poems and stories.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: students will write four short papers totaling 15-20 pages.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference given to first-year students.

ENGL 126(F) Stupidity and Intelligence (W)
Stupidity fascinates authors, and they do not merely despise it--they feel it and make us feel it. Why?
Around the same time that psychologists began measuring and ranking intelligence--and stupidity,
under various names, of course occupied the space below (average) intelligence--literary authors
were finding types of stupidity within intelligence. What is stupidity? Why can't it stay sequestered
from intelligence? Is there such a thing as literary stupidity? (Can one be specifically a bad reader not
only of books but of life?) What are the problems of intelligence? We shall be reading stories, novel-
las, novels, and plays by Melville, Poe, Henry James, Kafka, Borges, Stoppard and others, and we
shall be viewing several films.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: active class participation, and five papers totaling 20

ENGL 137(F) Shakespeare's Warriors and Politicians (W)
From history, legend, and his own imaginative powers, Shakespeare has fashioned superlative war-
riors: Hotspur, Othello, Macbeth, Antony, and Coriolanus are larger-than-life soldiers on the battle-
field. They are, however, frequently undone by love and politics. Hotspur is no match for the shrewd
political maneuvering of Prince Hal; Othello's love for Desdemona turns to hate through the machina-
tions of the Machiavellian Iago; Macbeth is pushed to regicide by his wife; and Antony is twice un-
done--made "a strumpet's fool" by Cleopatra and defeated by a mere "boy" in the supreme politician
Octavius Caesar. This course will examine seven plays by Shakespeare, where the virtues and weak-
nesses of the warrior and the politician are seen to be in tension: Richard III, Henry IV, Part I, Othello,
Macbeth, Antony and Cleopatra, Coriolanus, and Troilus and Cressida. In the last two plays, Shake-
speare portrays the convergence of sex, war, and politics with a new cynicism that leaves no character
unscathed.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: 20 pages of writing in the form of four essays, ranging in
length from 3-7 pages, and several short journal-style writing assignments, as well as active participa-
tion in class.

ENGL 142(S) Radio, Radio (W)
Radio, Radio is a seminar devoted to making and interpreting non-fiction audio. Using unobtrusive
recording technology we will learn to do field recording, interviews, and post-production editing. We
English
­ 152 ­
will use this process to ask fundamental questions about the media, the functions of stories, and our
relation to the world. How do we identify worthwhile stories? How do we understand their representa-
tiveness? When does an editor's manipulation become unethical or untrue? We will aim to vest our
answers to these questions in the form and content of our audio work. We will also spend considerable
time critiquing student work. Critical readings in media theory, radio history, and cultural history will
be assigned.
Format: seminar. Requirements: students must attend three specially arranged evening labs in audio
acquisition and editing. Assignments will include several short written exercises analyzing particular
readings and audio assignments; an editing assignment using found footage; and the production of
two short (4-6 minute) audio essays. Students will occasionally be required to work in teams.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 12 (expected: 12). Preference given to first-year students, and
then to sophomores, English majors, and junior/senior non-majors.

This survey of American writing before 1865 will trace literary forms including the sermon, the essay,
the romance, and the slave narrative, and inquire into the value and authority associated with these
different modes of writing. In addition, we will reflect upon the difficulties in constructing an Ameri-
can literature and the way authors have understood their work as a way of teaching, entertaining, ex-
pressing, or even escaping America. Readings will include John Smith, Anne Bradstreet, Mary Row-
landson, Jonathan Edwards, Benjamin Franklin, James Fennimore Cooper, Ralph Waldo Emerson,
Edgar Allan Poe, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Frederick Douglass.

ENGL 210(S) American Literature: 1865-Present (Same as American Studies 210)
This course is designed to provide an introduction to American literature from the post-Civil War peri-
od to the present. Beginning with Walt Whitman, we will read a series of influential American texts--
both fiction and poetry. We will situate these works not only within the literary movements of the time
(e.g., realism, modernism, and postmodernism), but also within other important historical and cultural
occurrences (e.g., immigration and migration, civil rights, commodity culture). Throughout, the em-
phasis will be on the diverse, sometimes conflicting traditions that make up the American literary can-
on. Readings may include works by such authors as Twain, Chopin, Chesnutt, Hemingway, Hughes,

ENGL 217T(F) Shakespearean Comedy (W)
This tutorial will explore the comic elements of five Shakespeare plays: A Midsummer Night's Dream,
Twelfth Night, Much Ado About Nothing, Henry the Fourth, part one, and Anthony and Cleopatra.
Though we will consider numerous theories of comedy, our emphasis will be mainly practical criti-
cism, focused on the texts: why and how is this comical? What does this humorous character or that
comic scene contribute to the play? What are some larger patterns of comedy? How does this play
apply, revise, or complicate the traditional patterns? How central is comedy to the play's vision? We
will explore the nature of comedy generally with some reading in comic theory (Hobbes, Bergson,
Meredith, Freud, Bakhtin, Frye) and Shakespearean criticism (C. L. Barber, Helen Gardner, Alvin
Kernan, Susanne K. Langer, Anne Barton, etc). We will also view and discuss several films, including
Orson Welles's "Chimes at Midnight" and Kenneth Branagh's "Much Ado." The emphasis of the
course is upon Shakespeare's language and dramatic art.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: students meet weekly with a tutorial partner and the instructor to dis-
cuss one student's paper and the other student's response. Each student writes five 5-page arguments
and five 2-page critiques.

ENGL 219(F) Literature by Women (Same as Women's and Gender Studies 219)
This course will consider literary works by women in English as occasions where women acknowl-
edge and confront both each other and a literary culture which has traditionally defined feminine iden-
tity and excluded female voices. Among the issues we will explore are: Are there significant inter-
textualities amongst women writers, enough that we might argue for women's literary "traditions,"
either in terms of form or content? What are the unique difficulties women face as creators, as opposed
to just subjects, of literature? Can writing serve as a form of resistance, and if so, how? How is femi-
ninity articulated alongside and/or intertwined with other identities and identifications, such as race,
ethnicity, class, and sexuality? While including a wide range of women, the course may study in great-
er depth such writers as Kate Chopin, Virginia Woolf, Adrienne Rich, Sylvia Plath, Toni Morrison,
Audre Lorde, Maxine Hong Kingston, and Margaret Atwood.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: one 4- to 5-page essay, one 6- to 8-page essay, midterm

GATEWAY COURSES
200-level "Gateway" courses are designed for first- and second-year students contemplating the
major or intending to pursue more advanced work in the department; these courses focus on analyti-
cal writing skills while introducing students to critical and historical approaches that will prove
fruitful in later courses. (Note: a Gateway course can fulfill a Period or Criticism requirement as
well as a Gateway requirement.)
ENGL 215T(F) Poetry and the City (Gateway) (W)
In this tutorial, intended primarily for sophomores, we will consider poems generated out of the expe-
riences of urban life. The city provides for poets a vivid mental and imaginative landscape in which to
consider the relation of vice and squalor to glamor; the nature of anonymity and distinction; and the
pressure of myriad bodies on individual consciousness. We will explore ways in which the poet's role
in the body politic emerges in representations of the city as a site both of civilized values and of
English

struggles for power marked by guile and betrayal. Poets will include Dante, Pope, Swift, Blake, Word-
sworth, Emerson, Baudelaire, Yeats, Crane, Moore, Auden, Hughes, Ginsberg, Baraka, O'Hara and
Ashbery. We will also draw on essays by Weber, Williams, Benjamin and Canetti; photographs by
Hines, Weegee, and Abbott; the blues, as sung by Holliday and Vaughan; and films such as Berlin:
Symphony of a City and Man with a Movie Camera.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: students will meet with the instructor in pairs for an hour each week,
will write a 5-page paper every other week and comment on their partners' papers in alternate weeks.
Emphasis will be placed on developing skills not only in reading and interpretation, but also in
constructing critical arguments and responding to them in written and oral critiques.
Prerequisites: a 100-level English course, except 150. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Preference

ENGL 222(S) Studies in the Lyric (Gateway) (W)
This discussion course is designed to introduce students considering the major to the study of lyric
poetry by raising three fundamental questions: How does one read a lyric? How does one talk about a
lyric? How does one write about a lyric? In the first half of the course we will read groups of poems
from a range of historical periods in order to examine the various elements that make up a poem (line
breaks, tone, image, versification, form, lyric audience). In the second half of the course we will focus
on two writers, John Donne and Robert Frost, to see how an individual poet uses and adapts lyric con-
ventions to develop a distinctive style and vision.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: active class participation and frequent short writing as-
signments.
Prerequisites: a 100-level English course, except 150. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference

ENGL 225(F) Romanticism and Modernism (Gateway) (W)
The literature of Europe in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries was dominated by two aesthetic
movements, Romanticism and Modernism, respectively. While Modernism is often thought to mark a
decisive break with Romanticism-in part because both movements presented themselves as "new," a
radical departure from what had gone before-there are important continuities and affinities as well as
breaches between the two movements. This course will investigate the nature of Romanticism and
Modernism, and the relation between them. We will study major works from each period, including
polemics, poetry, novels, and short stories by Wordsworth, Coleridge, Percy and Mary Shelley, Yeats,
Eliot, the French Symbolist poets, Wilde, and modern novelists such as Joyce and Woolf. We will
explore each movement's engagement with a range of topics and issues: for example, the subjective
experience of time and memory; the nature of symbolization, and the role of "feeling" in art; the rela-
tion of the individual mind to social life; the conflicted appeal for the artist of "common" language and
experience, on the one hand, and avant-garde forms of expression, on the other. Our broader aim will
be to invite potential English majors to think critically about the principles that underlie the ordering
of literary history into aesthetic movements and "periods."
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: four or five short essays, including at least one revision.
Prerequisites: a 100-level English course, except 150. Enrollment limit: 19 per section (expected: 19

ENGL 230(S) Introduction to Literary Theory (Gateway) (Same as Comparative Literature
240) (W)
In this course we will engage with the major arguments in the field of literary theory. Yet it is important
that this is not a catch-all survey class; rather, we will be conducting a continuing debate about the
nature of literary meaning and the relationship of such meaning to political and moral problems. Thus
we will ask, What determines the meaning of a text? How can an interpretation of a literary work be
deemed true or false? Is the relationship of literature to politics foundational or peripheral? Is criticism
a moral practice? Readings include W. K. Wimsatt and Monroe Beardsley, Paul De Man, Stanley
Fish, Judith Butler, Anthony Appiah, Richard Rorty, and Martha Nussbaum.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: several short papers amounting to 20 pages of writing and
an in-class presentation.

ENGL 232(S) The Epistolary Novel (Gateway) (W)
The epistolary novel uses the form of letters to tell its story. Starting with Aphra Behn's remarkable,
Love-letters Between a Noble-man and his Sister, this course will follow the development of this liter-
ary form through three centuries by exploring texts in which it reaches both its heights and its limits.
The course will include novels which have been popular in their time and which remain highly plea-
surable to read: Richardson's Pamela, Goethe's The Sorrows of Young Werther, Stoker's Dracula, and
Byatt's Possession. But we will also attend closely to the problems of representation these authors
face, and to the way that literary form relates to and shapes the novel's content. The epistolary form,
which pre-dates the fully-fledged novel, quickly runs into limits that make other forms of fiction writ-
ing appear much more sophisticated by the end of the eighteenth century. We will want to look at what
these limits are, and at why the form nevertheless prevails. In writing papers, students will be encour-
aged to engage critically with a wide range of secondary criticism and literary history, including writ-
ing on the rise of the novel.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: active participation in class discussion, and 20 pages of
writing in the form of short essays.
Prerequisites: a 100-level English course, except 150. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference

ENGL 235(S) Comedy/Tragedy (Gateway) (W)
"Tragedy is when I cut my finger. Comedy is when you fall down an open manhole cover and die."
Critics have long sought to define comedy and tragedy against each other, yet, as Mel Brooks' joke
suggests, the relationship between the two is complicated, even disturbing. In this course we will read
tragedies by Sophocles, Marlowe and Racine, comedies by Aristophanes, Shakespeare and Molière,
and works that do not easily fit either classification by Chekhov, Beckett and Stoppard. We will con-
sider how in different periods the distinction between the two forms has been understood and their
antithetical effects accounted for. We will discuss the essential if also problematic link between suffer-
ing and pleasure, and ask why it is that comedy persists while tragedy, at least in its classical expres-
sion, no longer seems possible. Critical readings will include Aristotle's Poetics, Nietzsche's The
Birth of Tragedy, and Bergson's Laughter.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: four or five short essays, including at least one revision.
There will also be periodic film screenings.

ENGL 238(S) American Women Writers (Gateway) (W)*
This course studies a range of American women writing about lives real and imagined from the mid-
nineteenth century through the second half of the twentieth century, a period of significant literary
transformation. We will read texts by Harriet Jacobs, Caroline Kirkland, Anzia Yerzierska, Sarah
Orne Jewett, Willa Cather, Zora Neale Hurston, Nella Larsen, Sandra Cisneros, Hisaye Yamamoto,
Marilynne Robinson, and Toni Morrison as well as selected critical readings. We will examine how
women represented their lives and negotiated challenges not only of gender, but of class, ethnicity,
and race. Critical readings will call our attention to problems of narrative structure and voice, of plot in
fiction, and to the intricate identities constructed by gender expectations.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: active class participation and weekly brief written re-

ENGL 316(S) The Art of Courtship (Same as Women's and Gender Studies 316)
During Elizabeth I's reign, love poetry and dramatic comedy acquired a remarkable popularity and
brilliance, unparalleled in English literary history. What is the "art"--the language, form, and rheto-
ric--of Elizabethan courtship? What kind of society generated this literary obsession, and conversely,
what kind of culture and sexual relationships did the literature of courtship and seduction produce?
This course explores the links between literary conventions and social conventions, sexual politics
and court politics. It studies gems of English Renaissance literature (Shakespeare's Twelfth Night and
Much Ado About Nothing, love poetry by Shakespeare, Spenser, Sidney, and Donne, Castiglione's
The Courtier) along with court rhetoric, political negotiations, the first poem written and published by
an Englishwoman, the first autobiography written by an Englishman, social debates over poetry, the
theater, sexuality, clandestine marriage, women's lawful liberty. There will be short lectures and lots
of discussion.

ENGL 325(F) Sentiment and Sensibility in the Eighteenth Century
Although the eighteenth century is often described as the age of reason, authors and readers of the
period were heavily occupied with feeling as the guide to truth. Long before the Romantic period,
authors drew on images of tearstained pages and created over-sensitive heroes. The terms sentiment
and sensibility are part of an eighteenth-century family of concepts, which includes taste, sympathy,
virtue, benevolence, and sense, that suggests the emphasis placed in the second half of the century on
physical and emotional response. Although sentimentality has come to seem to us a term of critique, it
was at the heart of the public celebration of novels such as Laurence Sterne's, A Sentimental Journey,
and Henry Mackenzie's Man of Feeling. Exploring what the terms sentiment and sensibility stand for
in eighteenth-century literature will allow us to approach a range of texts from the perspective of their
original male and female readers, and to think about this period of rapidly expanding literacy in terms
of classics that are often left out of the eighteenth-century canon. These will include Susanna Row-
son's Charlotte Temple, Elizabeth Inchbald's A Simple Story, poetry by Robert Burns, Thomas Gray,
and William Collins, and Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility. One of the aims of this seminar will be
to discuss the connection between eighteenth-century philosophy and the category of literature. In
addition to fiction and poetry, we will read key eighteenth-century texts dealing with sentiment and
emotional response and will explore how these texts inform and draw on sentiment and sensibility in
literature.

ENGL 326(S) Theorizing Enlightenment (Same as Comparative Literature 346)
The idea of 'Enlightenment' has been used to suggest a historical period (1650-1800), and to describe
modern society as critical, self-reflected, and secular. Yet, whether we use the term as a way to praise
the values of modernity, or as a way to describe a period in history where these critical values become
dangerously dominant, Enlightenment remains a slippery and preoccupying concept for social theo-
rists. This course will focus on three texts from the middle of the twentieth century that have taken up
the challenge of trying to work with this concept. The seminar will be organized as three cycles, with
the core of each cycle being one of the following texts: Foucault's, Order of Things, Habermas's,
Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere, and Horkheimer and Adorno's Dialectic of Enligh-
tenment. Our approach will be to treat each of these rhetorically rich texts as "primary" material rather
than to assume its theoretical coherence. Working closely with these twentieth-century authors, we
will allow time to read the eighteenth-century texts that the authors draw on in their characterizations
and descriptions of Enlightenment. We will, for instance, read The Order of Things together with
Locke's Essay Concerning Human Understanding, and Habermas together with Spectator essays and
essays from the Female Spectator. We will also read Kant's famous essay "What is Enlightenment"
together with Foucault and Habermas's writings on Kant.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: journal entries totaling 8-10 pages, and one final 10- to

ENGL 328(S) Jane Austen
Austen's wit and psychological acuity are part of an innovative aesthetic strategy: by making internal
consciousness crucial to narrative form, her work changed the course of the novel. Placing her writ-
ings in the political and philosophical context of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, we
will consider what constitutes virtue and virtuosity in Austen's notions of behavior and of literary
style, and will explore how issues of shame, audacity, and obligation affect her portrayal of genteel
English society in the decades following the French Revolution. Texts will include Northanger
Abbey, Sense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice, Emma, Mansfield Park, and Persuasion, as well as
some of Austen's early and unfinished writing, letters, and critical studies of her work.

ENGL 329(F) Puritanism and its Aftereffects
This course begins with an in-depth examination of Puritan writers, including William Bradford, John
Winthrop, Anne Bradstreet, Cotton Mather. Here our concerns will be with the political and theologi-
cal problems central to these authors, and with their approach to the aesthetic (with particular empha-
sis on their negotiation of typology with attention to the details of life in the colonies). We then will
shift to examine the representation of the Puritan era in a series of historical novels from the nineteenth
century by Nathaniel Hawthorne, Harriet Beecher Stowe, and Lydia Maria Child, among others. In
these novels, the Puritans are reconfigured sometimes as honorable founders of America, and some-
times as disturbing caricatures who must be repudiated by the modern nation. We will also consider
how the way in which Puritans perceived their world continues to structure the later era's understand-
ing and representation of contemporary events.

Gothic and "sensation" novels. Probable texts will include Austen's Persuasion, Brontë's Wuthering

In this course we will study the distinctive writing produced in the last two decades before the Civil
War, a concentrated moment of expression that has often been taken as the "birth" of an American
literature. But while some of the authors we will be reading have been valued by critics since the mid-
nineteenth century (Emerson, Poe, Hawthorne, Whitman), some were only rediscovered in the early
twentieth century (Melville, Dickinson), and some only entered the classroom in the last twenty-five
years (Stowe, Douglass). We will attend closely to the period's pervasive self-consciousness about
language; the contested influence of transcendentalism on literature; debates over citizenship and
American identity; and the challenge of slavery to American values.

ENGL 340T(S) Fiction of Virginia Woolf (Same as Women's and Gender Studies 335T) (W)
"Let us record the atoms as they fall upon the mind in the order in which they fall, let us trace the
pattern, however disconnected and incoherent in appearance, which each sight or incident scores
upon the consciousness. Let us not take it for granted that life exists more fully in what is commonly
thought big than in what is commonly thought small" ("Modern Fiction"). Virginia Woolf's fiction
represents a self-conscious and highly experimental challenge to the conventions of Victorian and
Edwardian fiction. This course will explore her efforts to bridge the gap between experience and its
representation in language by following the evolution of her innovative narrative techniques for por-
traying consciousness, memory, selfhood, relationships, and community. Along the way, we will con-
sider Woolf's challenges to stable gender roles and her reconception of women's positions as creators.
We will read most of the major novels, including The Voyage Out, Jacob's Room, Mrs. Dalloway, To
the Lighthouse, The Waves, and Between the Acts, together with selected short fiction and critical es-
says by Woolf and her contemporaries, and more recent critical work on Woolf.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: students will meet with the instructor in pairs for an hour each week.
They will alternate between writing 5- to 7-page papers and commentaries on their partner's papers,
and will also be required to do a substantial revision of one essay as a final project. Students will be
evaluated on their written work, their oral presentations of that work and their analyses of their col-
league's work.

In this course we will explore the way literary texts represent and construct gay, lesbian, bisexual,
transgendered and queer identities and experiences. We will start with works considered to be the
English
­ 160 ­
"first" definitively or openly queer writings in English, and move through the twentieth century. Some
of the main questions we will consider are: What historical shifts and social conditions enable the
formation of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered identities? What are the rewards and limits of
established literary genres (such as the novel) when called upon to represent queer lives? When do
such lives need new literary forms? What role does the literary and/or reading play in the constitution
of identity and community? How are sexual subjectivities intertwined with race, ethnicity, class and
other identities and identifications? Readings may include works by such authors as Walt Whitman,
Emily Dickinson, Oscar Wilde, Henry James, Radclyffe Hall, Gertrude Stein, E. M. Forster, Bruce
Nugent, Nella Larsen, Carson McCullers, James Baldwin, Allen Ginsburg, John Rechy, Adrienne
Rich, Audre Lorde, Monique Wittig, Neil Bartlett, Jeannette Winterson, Shyam Selvadurai, Achy
Obejas, David Wojnarowicz and R. Linmark Zamorra. In addition, we will read some of the most
significant writings in history and literary criticism that analyze these works and the contexts from
which they emerge.

During the period from 1965-1976, many writers attempted to develop a literary art based on new
emerging conceptions of "blackness." This course will examine what they understood a "black aes-
thetic" to be, and how this understanding affected their writing. With a careful eye to their political and
cultural contexts, this course will consider poetry, drama, essays, and fiction by such writers as Amiri
Baraka, Sonia Sanchez, Nikki Giovanni, Ishmael Reed, and Toni Cade Bambara.

ENGL 348(S) Faulkner and His Influence
William Faulkner was a great writer in two ways. First, he was the most interesting formal innovator
of all the novelists of American modernism (as in The Sound and the Fury and As I Lay Dying). Sec-
ond, he was a strange and provocative theorist of race (as in Go Down, Moses and Absalom, Absa-
lom!). We shall consider both of these dimensions of Faulkner, and what they have to do with each
other. Then we shall take up one or more novelists in the Faulkner tradition.

This tutorial investigates the role of editing in narrative. It does so both through the analysis of novels,
essays and films, and through exercises in creating and manipulating short digital narratives. One
might think of it as a lab course in which students will test the effects of different arrangements of
words, sounds, and moving images. While "Cut" will not emphasize technical mastery, basic audio
and video editing techniques will be taught in required labs. After that, the course will be conducted
through hour-long tutorials between the professor and pairs of students, concentrating on consider-
ation of student work. Assigned materials will include pieces by Dziga Vertov, Leni Riefenstahl, Or-

An exploration of the major trends in British and American poetry between 1900 and 1945, centering
on the radical aesthetic and formal shifts which took place during the Modernist movement, the
changing authorial and public perceptions of the place and function of poetry in the period, the cross-
pollinations and strains between the British and American literary traditions, and the writers' individ-
ual negotiations with the culture of their time. Readings will focus primarily on the poetry of W.B.
Yeats, Robert Frost, T.S. Eliot, Wallace Stevens, William Carlos Williams, Ezra Pound, Marianne
Moore and W.H. Auden.

ENGL 355(F) Fictions of Race*
"Race" is a fiction, with no basis in biological fact. This course examines how "fictions" in the artistic
sense (novels, stories, movies) have both fostered and challenged "fictions" in the ideological sen-
se--that is, the lies and mystifications about race that pervade American cultural life. The course be-
gins with modernism and the Harlem Renaissance, focusing on Gertrude Stein, Jean Toomer, and the
rise of jazz; other writers to be considered include William Faulkner, Willa Cather, Zora Neale Hurs-
ton, Richard Wright, James Baldwin, and Paul Bowles. We will also study landmark movies in the
history of race-relations, such as Birth of a Nation, Gone With the Wind, Imitation of Life, The Heat of
the Night, and the sci-fi allegory Blade Runner. The course concludes with late twentieth-century fic-
tion, comparing African American, Chinese American, and Native American women's writing (Toni
Morrison, Maxine Hong Kingston, Leslie Marmon Silko).

craziness. We shall be reading Joseph Heller's Catch-22, Vladimir Nabokov's Pale Fire, Thomas
Pynchon's The Crying of Lot 49, Ishmael Reed's Mumbo Jumbo, Toni Morrison's Beloved, Don De-
Lillo's White Noise, and one or two other novels. Though the class is not a seminar, all class meetings

ENGL 360(S) Joyce's Ulysses
This lecture course will explore in depth the demanding and exhilarating work widely regarded as the
most important novel of the twentieth century, James Joyce's Ulysses, which both dismantled the
traditional novel and revitalized the genre by opening up new possibilities for fiction. We will discuss
the ways in which compelling issues of character and theme (e.g., questions of heroism and betrayal,
oedipal dynamics, sexuality and the politics of gender, civic engagement and artistic isolation, British
imperialism and Irish nationalism, identity, estrangement, and community), are placed in counter-
point with patterns drawn from myth, theology, philosophy, and other literature, and will consider the
convergence of such themes in an unorthodox form of comedy. In assessing Ulysses as the outstand-
ing paradigm of modernist fiction, we will be equally attentive to its radical and often funny innova-
tions of structure, style, and narrative perspective. In addition to Joyce's novel, readings include sto-
ries from Joyce's Dubliners, his autobiographical novel A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, selec-
tions from Homer's Odyssey, as well as biographical and critical essays.

ENGL 362(F) Irish Modernism
James Joyce and Samuel Beckett are the towering figures of Irish literary modernism, so this course
begins with Joyce's Dubliners and ends with Beckett's minimalist later plays. But the aim is to restore
these writers to their historical context by examining key works by their precursors and contempo-
raries, including Oscar Wilde's plays, fiction, and essays, W.B. Yeats's poetry, and Elizabeth Bowen's
novels and short stories. Central to the course is the tug-of-war between modernist cosmopolitanism
and Irish nationalism, and the complicated ways in which these rival tendencies both thwarted and
abetted one another. The battlegrounds of religion, class, and gender will also engage our attention,
along with the cultural consequences of the Irish policy of neutrality during World War II.

ENGL 370(F) Postcolonial Theory, Historical Materialism, and American Literature*
During the height of the Red Scare, the Trinidadian Marxist C.L.R. James fought deportation orders
from the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service by giving a series of public lectures on Ameri-
can literature. From these lectures came his classic study of Melville: Mariners, Renegades, and Cast-
aways: The Story of Herman Melville and the World We Live In (1953). What is the relation between
"American" literature and (what has come to be called) postcolonial criticism? Taking James' work as
one point of departure, this course will explore the critical possibilities for studying American litera-
ture through a productive combination of historical materialism and postcolonial theory. What can a
historical materialist postcolonial theory tell us about American literary nationalisms? About the rela-
tion between culture and the state? What is the relation between postcolonial theory and African-
American literary theory? Can the concept of postcoloniality illuminate our understanding of (what
Paul Gilroy has called) the Black Atlantic? In the spirit of James, we will read a wide range of literary
texts, as well as engage with diverse critical and analytic models, in order to think through several
English
­ 163 ­
concepts central to the making of American cultural and political identities: "race" and racism; "class"
and labor; citizenship and alienism; ideology and assimilation; freedom and subjection. The literary
texts will include works by Melville, Mark Twain, W.E.B. Dubois, and Richard Wright, among
others. The theoretical readings will include influential texts by Marx, Frantz Fanon, Fredric Jameson,
and Edward Said.

ENGL 377(S) Suicides and Survivors
Adrienne Rich and Sylvia Plath were contemporaries, vying in the 1950s for the same poetry prizes
and recognition as "obedient daughters" to a literary tradition that prized craft and impersonality as
poetic virtues over confession or politics. Both poets have become feminist heroines for their disobe-
dience, each diverging radically and in her own way from this tradition in the 1960s. As biographer
Janet Malcolm puts it: "Women honor Plath for her courage to be unpleasant" about being a "good
girl" in the 1950s and about a philandering husband in the 1960s. Her suicide in 1963 was immediate-
ly followed by analyses of her poems in Ariel that directed critical interest toward her life as an ex-
planation of her craft. Her survivors have battled strenuously but ineffectually to preserve the secret of
her life from "the voyeurism and busybodyism" of eager biographers and readers. Rich's life com-
petes with her poetry for critical interest and approval because of its political shape; its dedication to
feminism. The wife and mother of the 1950s became the political activist of the 1960s: the lesbian
feminist of the 1970s. As expressions of a survivor and heroine of these movements for change, her
life and art trace the forces, both political and ideological, that have affected the lives of American
women. This course will explore the lives of each poet and the impact and understanding of their lives
has on critical recognition of their art. We will be reading from the fiction, poetry, journals, biogra-
phies, essays, and correspondence of Plath and Rich, together with interviews and reviews that have
shaped critical reception of their work.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: one 4- to 5-page essay, on 6- to 8-page essay, a field trip to

traditions. Novels will be examined under such (overlapping) rubrics as globalization, post-colonial-
ism, and postmodernism. We shall read six or seven novels by such writers as Roy, Rushdie, Coetzee,
Kundera, Sebald, Ishiguro, Marquez, and Fuentes.

ENGL 380(S) The Art of Modern Crisis
The first half of the twentieth century was marked by extraordinary social and political upheaval. The
same era witnessed a feverishly creative revolution in the nature and strategies of artistic representa-
tion. In this course we will examine what these two kinds of crisis have to do with one another: how a
wide range of startling innovations in literary and cinematic art may be seen as responses to the partic-
ular pressures of the historical crises they represent. Focussing mainly on Britain, we will study such
diverse historical crises as the spread of anarchism around the turn of the century; the sensational ad-
vent of a public discourse of homosexuality in the trials of Oscar Wilde; the Irish and the Bolshevik
revolutions; the woman's suffrage movement and the emergence of the so-called "New Woman";
English
­ 164 ­
World War I and II; and the Cold War. Novels, poems and films will be studied for their distinctive,
often dazzling aesthetic strategies for representing these crises, and will include such works as Con-
rad's The Secret Agent, Bely's Petersburg, Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway, poems of Yeats and Owen, Ford's
Parade's End, Eisenstein's Potemkin, Heller's Catch-22, and Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove..

ENGL 387T(S) Film Genres (W)
In this tutorial course, we will study briefly the idea of genre, then will focus for most of the semester
on four of the central genres of Hollywood cinema: the gangster film, the Western, the screwball com-
edy, and the film noir. We will approach the subject by reading theoretical work on literary genres
along with plays such as Shakespeare's Macbeth and A Midsummer Night's Dream. In order to ex-
plore differences between literary and film genres, we will compare these plays with films from com-
parable Hollywood genres (for example, the gangster film The Roaring Twenties and the screwball
comedy Bringing Up Baby). Our study of Hollywood genres will focus principally on films from the
1930's and 1940's, the period when these genres were developed and reached their peak: such films as
Hawks's Scarface, Ford's Stagecoach and Hawks's Red River, Capra's It Happened One Night and
Sturges's The Palm Beach Story, Wilder's Double Indemnity and Tourneur's Out of the Past. Collec-
tively, they raise questions about the temptations and limits of ambition for power, civilization's drive
to displace the wilderness and tame human savagery, class conflict and rapprochement, the subver-
sive energies of sexuality and their impact on shifting gender roles, the complicities of law and trans-
gression. We will also examine a few more recent revisionist or hybrid variations on these genres;
examples might include such films as Scorsese's GoodFellas, Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch, Wilder's
Some Like It Hot, Welles's Touch of Evil, and Polanski's Chinatown. A week's assignment, apart from
writing, will normally comprise either one film screening and one or two essays of genre criticism, or
two film screenings.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: after two weeks in which we will meet as a group to discuss the liter-
ary genres, students will meet with the instructor in pairs for one hour each week during the rest of the
semester. They will write a 5- to 6-page paper every other week (five in all), and comment on their
partners' papers in alternate weeks. Emphasis will be placed on developing skills not only in reading,
viewing, and interpretation, but also in constructing critical arguments and responding to them in writ-
ten and oral critiques.

ENGL 392(F) Wonder
We tend to imagine "wonder" as a naïve, wide-eyed response, something quite distinct from the cold
and sophisticated act of critical analysis. In this discussion class, we will consider wonder as an ana-
lyzable concept, but one that raises provocative questions about the nature and limits of our own, dis-
tinctly modern forms of critical engagement. The course examines three historical incarnations of
"wonder," each involving complex relations among the aesthetic, philosophical, and social domains:
the Renaissance tradition on wonder and the marvelous; the eighteenth-century analysis of the sub-
lime; and twentieth-century accounts of the culture of spectacle. We will consider writers such as
Shakespeare, Sir Thomas Browne, Wordsworth, Borges, and W.G. Sebald (all wonderful); painters
such as Leonardo and Vermeer, the photography of Andreas Gursky and Thomas Struth; films includ-
ing Lang's Metropolis and Scott's Blade Runner; and critical or philosophical writers, including Aris-
totle, Edmund Burke, and Walter Benjamin.

ENGL 416(S) (formerly 375) Issues in Literary History
Literary texts preserve human voice--they are "timeless"--but they are also historical objects them-
selves, rooted in time. Our reading and experience of literature is everywhere and always "historical,"
a look through time. In this course we will look closely at the ways in which time matters for readers
and writers. What does historical "context" mean, and how much attention should we pay to it? What
sort of historical objects do literary texts make? In what ways are writers and their works part of an
ongoing historical narrative? We will read a broad spectrum of literary works and critical essays. The
literary works will be primarily poetry, from various periods, with special focus on Shakespeare and
Dickinson. Critical texts will include formal literary histories and critical essays from several periods,
past and present.
Format: seminar/tutorial. Requirements: significant in-class participation and work, frequent short
writing assignments, two shorter and one longer paper, totalling 15-20 pages.

ENGL 447(F) (formerly 347) Henry James
This course will be devoted to the work of Henry James, whose brilliant, demanding innovations of
prose style and acute psychological and ethical explorations mark the shift from the nineteenth-centu-
ry to the modern novel. James writes about what it meant for American and European societies around
the turn of the century to be mutually exposed to, and by, one another. In so doing, he raises questions
about what it means to be civilized, to be smart, and to be rich. We will consider how the drama of
consciousness is played out in his characters' struggles with love and conscience, and in his own pre-
occupation with capturing stylistically the narrative logic of the passions. We will read the novellas
Daisy Miller, The Beast in the Jungle, The Aspern Papers, and The Turn of the Screw; the novels Por-
trait of a Lady, The Bostonians, The Ambassadors, and The Golden Bowl; and assorted critical writ-
ings.

CONCENTRATION IN ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
The Environmental Studies Program, within the liberal arts mission of Williams College, provides
students with an opportunity to explore how humans interact with the environment, including physi-
cal, biological, philosophical, and social elements. The program is designed so that students will grow
to realize the complexity of issues and perspectives and to appreciate that many environmental issues
lack distinct boundaries. Our goal is to aid students in becoming well-informed, environmentally-lit-
erate citizens of the planet who have the capacity to become active participants in the local and global
community. To this end, the program is designed to develop abilities to think in interdisciplinary ways
and to use synthetic approaches in solving problems while incorporating the knowledge and experi-
ences gained from majoring in other departments at the College.
Environmental Studies
­ 167 ­
The concentration in Environmental Studies allows students to pursue an interdisciplinary study of
the environment by taking elective courses in the natural sciences, the social sciences, and the human-
ities and the arts. The purpose of the program is to provide the tools and ideas needed to engage
constructively with the environmental and social issues brought about by changes in population, eco-
nomic activity, and values. Environmental controversies typically call upon citizens and organiza-
tions to grasp complex, uncertain science, contending human values, and ethical choices--in short, to
deal with matters for which the liberal arts are a necessary but not sufficient preparation. Environmen-
tal Studies accordingly includes courses in natural sciences, social sciences, humanities, and the arts,
in order to equip students with the broad educational background needed to analyze complex environ-
mental matters and to fashion pragmatic, feasible solutions.
The program is administered by the Center for Environmental Studies (CES), located in Kellogg
House. Founded in 1967, CES is one of the oldest environmental studies programs at a liberal arts
college. In addition to the academic program, CES is the focus of a varied set of activities in which
students lead and participate, often with other members of the Williams community. The Matt Cole
Memorial Library at Kellogg House holds a substantial collection of books, periodicals, unpublished
documents, maps, and electronic media. Kellogg House also houses a new Geographic Information
System laboratory as well as study and meeting facilities available to students and student groups. The
Center administers the Hopkins Memorial Forest, a 2500-acre natural area northwest of campus,
where field-study sites, a laboratory, and passive-recreation opportunities may be found in all seasons.
CES also operates an environmental analysis laboratory at the Science Center.
The Environmental Studies Program has three overlapping components:
 The concentration in Environmental Studies, which consists of a set of seven courses.
 The Four Places goal. (See below.)
 Honors in Environmental Studies, a senior thesis is encouraged but not required.
Concentration Requirements
Seven courses are required: four are core courses to be taken by all students earning the concentration;
three are distribution courses to be selected from the lists below.
Core courses
101 Humans in the Landscape
203 Ecology
302 Environmental Planning and Design Workshop
402 Senior Seminar
The core courses are intended to be taken in sequence, although there is some flexibility allowed. Envi-
ronmental Studies (ENVI) 101 is a broad introduction to the field, emphasizing the humanities and social
sciences. ENVI 203 is a course in ecology, offered in Biology, that provides a unified conceptual approach
to the behavior of living things in the natural world. ENVI 302 (Environmental Planning) puts teams of
students to work on planning projects of immediate importance in the Berkshires. ENVI 402, the senior
seminar, is an opportunity for concentrators majoring in a wide variety of disciplines to draw together their
educational experiences and provide a personal accounting of how they understand the interdisciplinary
character of environmental studies and its connections to their future lives and careers. The core course
structure affords students freedom to explore and to specialize in diverse fields of study, while sustaining a
focus on environmental questions throughout their time at Williams.
An interdisciplinary course emphasizing field science, ENVI 102 (Introduction to Environmental
Science), is strongly recommended for all students interested in the concentration. Note that enroll-
ments in ENVI 102 are limited. In order to assure enrollment, students should consult with one of the
instructors during autumn semester. ENVI 102 must be taken before the junior year.
Distribution Courses
In order to earn the concentration a student must take one course from each of the following three
groups. Courses may be counted both toward the concentration in Environmental Studies and toward
a disciplinary major.

Variations from the requirements of the concentration must be approved in writing by the director of
the program. Students are urged to consult with program faculty and the director as soon as they devel-
op an interest in the concentration.
In addition to courses fulfilling the concentration requirements, the following electives and related
electives are offered:
Environmental Studies 397, 398 Independent Study of Environmental Problems
Environmental Studies 493-W031-494 Senior Research and Thesis
Winter study courses play an important role in the program, offering opportunities to experiment in
fields unfamiliar to the student, and for interdisciplinary topics to be developed by faculty working
Environmental Studies

alone and in teams. Students are urged to review each year's winter study offerings bearing in mind
their interests in the environment.
Rationale for Course Numbering
The numbering sequence of the four required courses reflects the order in which they should be
taken, although Environmental Studies 302 may be taken in the senior or sophomore year if a student
is away junior year. Cross-listed courses are assigned the same number as the departmental number
whenever possible.
Four Places--A Goal
The human place in natural landscapes is intrinsically geographic, and learning about humans in
particular places is an essential part of environmental studies. By the time each student in Environ-
mental Studies graduates, she or he should have developed intellectual insight into and personal expe-
rience of four places: "Home"; "Here"--the Berkshires; "There"--an alien place; and "The
World"--a global perspective. For practical purposes, "There" is a place where the geography is un-
usual in the student's experience (e.g., developing country, inner city, arctic), so are the socioeconom-
ic circumstances (for example, per capita income might be a small fraction of a year's tuition at Wil-
liams), and the working language is not standard English. Although this goal is not a requirement for
the concentration, it is a significant aspect of the program, and CES resources are aimed in part at
enabling all students to meet this goal. For example, students are encouraged to pursue summer in-
ternships in their "Home" communities, or to do semester or winter study courses at locations outside
the temperate zones ("There"); field courses in natural science or history courses emphasizing New
England can deepen familiarity with "Here." Students concentrating in Environmental Studies should
plan winter study courses and summer work or study experiences with the Four Places goal in mind,
particularly the experiences "There" and at "Home." Courses not in the list of electives for the con-
centration may be considered as substitutes, on a case-by-case basis, if they also meet the Four Places
goal in a way not otherwise available in the program. Students should see the program director for
further information.
Honors in Environmental Studies
A student earns honors in Environmental Studies by successfully completing a rigorous, original
independent research project under the supervision of two or more members of the faculty, including
at least one member of the CES faculty. The research project should be reported and defended both in
a thesis and orally. A student may undertake an honors thesis and submit it to both his or her major
department and Environmental Studies; petitions for a joint honors project should be approved by the
department chair and the director of the program no later than the beginning of the student's senior
year. Students who pursue honors in Environmental Studies alone should enroll in Environmental
Studies 493-W031-494, Senior Research and Thesis, in addition to completing the requirements for
the concentration.
Because most research requires sustained field, laboratory, or library work that is difficult to com-
bine with conventional coursework, students are strongly encouraged to spend the summer before
senior year doing honors research. Funds to support student research are available from restricted en-
dowments of the Center, and an open competition is held each spring, to allocate the limited resources.
Some departments also provide limited support for summer thesis research. Students and their faculty
sponsors should plan the thesis with the possibility of summer research in mind.
A faculty recommendation for honors in Environmental Studies will be made on the basis of the
academic rigor, interdisciplinary synthesis, independence, and originality demonstrated by the stu-
dent and in the completed thesis. In contemplating an honors thesis, students should take into account
their mastery of the basic materials and skills (often in more than one academic discipline), their abil-
ity to work independently, and their commitment and desire to pursue a sometimes arduous but typi-
cally rewarding process that combines intellectual achievement with tests of character and fortitude.
ENVI 101(F) Humans in the Landscape: An Introduction to Environmental Studies
This course introduces environmental studies in the context of the liberal arts--natural and social sci-
ence and the arts and humanities. By the end of the semester, a student should be able to recognize and
to investigate the natural, economic, and industrial bases of daily life, and to analyze the social chal-
lenges of altering humans' imprint on nature. These skills are necessary but not sufficient for develop-
ing a stance toward environmental quality as an element of civilized life.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on two quizzes (testing detailed recall), written
exercises (testing ability to grasp and make use of ideas important to the course), and a final exam;
attentive participation in class and conference discussions also counts.
No enrollment limit (expected: 30-40). Required course for students wishing to complete the Environ-
mental Studies concentration.
Satisfies one semester of the Division II requirement.

ENVI 102(S) Introduction to Environmental Science
Introduction to Environmental Science introduces students to current scientific methods used to as-
sess environmental quality, rectify impaired systems, and limit future detriment. Through hands-on
study of several local sites, we probe five global themes: alteration of the greenhouse effect and car-
bon cycle; acid deposition; toxic metals in the environment; water quality; and prospects in waste
treatment and remediation.
Discussions of case studies from other parts of the world illustrate the global analogues of these local
studies. Following these group projects, students design and complete independent projects in sub-
jects of particular interest to them.
Format: two, 75-minute workshop/discussion sessions, and one, 4-hour field/laboratory session each
week. Evaluation will be based on reports of field and laboratory projects, participation in discussion,
and an independent research project.
Enrollment limit: 36 (expected: 25). Preference given to first-year students. This course is designed
for students who have a strong interest in Environmental Science.

ENVI 270T(S) (formerly 308T) Environmental Policy (Same as Political Science 270T) (W)
Over the past generation, the environment has emerged as a significant policy arena. This course dis-
cusses environmental policy and politics from the perspective of the constellation of professionals,
managers, and activists involved in the implementation and formulation of policies. The technical and
social challenges of environmental policy strain long-accepted notions of democratic representation
and rationality. We examine institutional forms, and survey the conflicts that shape the governance of
natural resources, property, and ecosystem services.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: each student completes, in stages, a research project on an environ-
mental policy or controversy. A 12-page background paper at mid-semester describes the issues and
actors. The subsequent research paper incorporates the background paper, with revisions, into a
20-page analysis of the case and its governmental dynamics, including policy recommendations.
There is also a 90-minute exam on the course readings.
Prerequisites: Environmental Studies 101; Political Science 201 are recommended. Enrollment limit:

work in the Berkshire region. The first part of the course introduces the students to planning literature
especially through analysis and discussion of case studies. In the second section of the course, stu-
dents apply their skills to the study of an actual planning problem. Small teams of students, working in
conjunction with a client in the community, research and propose solutions to an immediate environ-
mental planning problem. The project work draws on students' academic training, extracurricular ac-
tivities, and applies interdisciplinary knowledge and methodologies. The course culminates in public
presentations of each team's planning study. This course also includes field trips and computer labs.
Format: discussion/project lab. Requirements: midterm exam, short written exercises, class presenta-
tions, public presentations, final group report.
Prerequisites: Environmental Studies 101 and Biology/Environmental Studies 203, or permission of
instructors. No enrollment limit (expected: 25). Open to juniors and seniors only.

ENVI 307(F) Environmental Law (Same as Political Science 317)
In the past twenty years, environmental law has emerged as an important aspect of how we govern the
use of public and private property. This course introduces students to the study of law from the per-
spective of a litigator and legislator, and takes up both the common law of nuisance, which is the
foundation for environmental governance in the Anglo-American tradition, and an array of statutory
law, which has profound implications for our ideas about property and how we put those ideas into
practice. In our society, and increasingly around the world, these ideas are central to civil order and to
our efforts to maintain a balance between our individual wishes and our commitment to our communi-
ties.
Format: lecture/discussion.
Prerequisites: Political Science 201 and Environmental Studies 101. No enrollment limit (expected:

(See under Biology for full description.)
This course satisfies "The Natural World" requirement for the Environmental Studies concentra-
tion.
ENVI 313(F) (formerly 211) Global Trends, Sustainable Earth
This course examines the possibility of sustainable development, an economy in which material pros-
perity pursued together with preservation of the life-support systems of the human and natural world.
Over the past 200 years the human presence on the planet has changed dramatically, as seen in long-
term trends of environmental modification, population growth, and economic change. These and oth-
er data are reviewed, in an effort to illuminate the idea of a gradual transition toward sustainability.
Sustainability is examined as an emergent phenomenon--not a simple idea imposed from above, but
the product of decentralized learning, market innovations, and social changes at many scales. Simula-
tion exercises providing metaphors of emergent phenomena are used to stimulate imagination and
thinking.
Format: seminar. Requirements: a long research paper designed by the student, several simulation
exercises, and a brief final exam.

ENVI 397(F), 398(S) Independent Study of Environmental Problems
Individuals or groups of students may undertake a study of a particular environmental problem. The
project may involve either pure or applied research, policy analysis, laboratory or field studies, or may
be a creative writing or photography project dealing with the environment. A variety of nearby sites
are available for the study of natural systems. Ongoing projects in the College-owned Hopkins Forest
include ecological studies, animal behavior, and acid rain effects on soils, plants, and animals. Stu-
dents may also choose to work on local, national, or international policy or planning issues, and op-
portunities to work with town and regional planning officials are available. Projects are unrestricted as
to disciplinary focus. Students should consult with faculty well before the start of the semester in
which they plan to carry out their project.
Prerequisites: approval by the director of the Center.

ENVI 402(S) Syntheses: Senior Seminar
This course asks students in environmental studies to synthesize their learning in the field--experien-
tial and informal, as well as through courses--into a self-portrait and a statement of intellectual, pro-
fessional, and personal purpose. Questions about past, present, and possible future value systems as
they influence individual and social interactions with the natural environment will be raised. Students
will be asked to become explicitly aware of their own values and will have an opportunity to justify
them in a long synthesis paper.

FIRST-YEAR RESIDENTIAL SEMINAR
The First-Year Residential Seminar is part of a program designed to help students explore new
ways of integrating their social and intellectual lives. Students who elect this seminar live together in
the same residential unit. They take the seminar together during the fall semester, and enrollment in
the seminar is restricted to students in the program. The seminar explores topics and issues that can be
expected to promote lively discussions both in and out of class. It may be team-taught and may con-
tain interdisciplinary subject matter.
All entering first-year students have the opportunity to express interest in participating in this pro-
gram; if more students are interested than there are spaces available (usually 18-24), selection is done
randomly. Participants must commit themselves to taking FRS 101.

FRS 101(F) Introduction to Religion
This course examines the structure and dynamics of certain aspects of religious thought, action, and
sensibility--employing psychological, sociological, anthropological, and philosophical modes of in-
quiry. We will begin with a survey of stances toward religion that have come to dominate the century's
view of the place and the truth of religion. These include the phenomenological, Mircea Eliade's
Sacred and the Profane; the psychoanalytic, Sigmund Freud's Civilization and Its Discontents; the
sociological, Emile Durkheim'sElementary Forms of Religious Life; the anthropological in the works
of Clifford Geertz, Victor Turner, Claude Levi-Strauss and Carolyn Bynum; and finally the theologi-
cal in the works of Paul Tillich and Mary Daly. With the tools we develop in the first half of the course
we then turn to the study of some religious traditions: Hinduism, Buddhism, Confucianism, Judaism
and Christianity. In this portion we will read such world classics as the Bhagavad Gita, Hebrew Scrip-
tures, Gospel of Matthew, and Kierkegaard's Fear and Trembling. Emphasis on class discussion and
the writing of interpretive papers.
Requirements: weekly 1-page papers in response to assigned questions, including visits to art mu-
seums and religious services. Writing these papers should help discussions, both in the classroom and
in the dorm. Midterm paper and self-scheduled final. FRS students in the past have greatly appre-
ciated having an entry-full of companions to talk with as they thought about how to respond to the
course materials. This luxury is provided only within the framework of FRS.

MAJOR
The Geosciences major is designed (1) to provide an understanding of the physical and biological
evolution of our planet and its interacting global systems, (2) to help us learn to live in harmony with
our environment, and (3) to appreciate our place within the vastness of Earth history. Forces within the
Earth are responsible for the development of mountain ranges and ocean basins. Waves, running wa-
ter, and glaciers have shaped the surface of the Earth, providing the landscapes we see today. Fossils
encased in sedimentaryrockssupplyevidencefortheevolutionoflifeand help to record the history of
the Earth.
Students who graduate with a major in Geosciences from Williams can enter several different fields
of geoscience or can use their background in other careers. Students who have continued in the geo-
sciences are involved today, especially after graduate training, in environmental fields ranging from
hydrology to earthquake prediction, in the petroleum and mining industries, federal and state geologi-
cal surveys, geological consulting firms, and teaching and research in universities, colleges, and sec-
ondary schools. Graduates who have entered business or law have also found many applications for
their geoscience background. Other graduates now in fields as diverse as art and medicine pursue their
interest in the out-of-doors with a deeper appreciation for the natural world around them.
The Geosciences major sequence includes, after any 100-level course, six designated advanced
courses, and two elective courses.
Sequence Courses (required of majors)
201 Geomorphology
202 Mineralogy and Geochemistry
215 Climate Changes
301 Structural Geology
302 Sedimentation
401 Stratigraphy
Elective courses may be clustered to provide concentrations in selected fields. Suggested group-
ings are listed below as guidelines for course selections, but other groups are possible according to the
interests of the students. Departmental advisors are given for the different fields of Geosciences.
I Environmental Geoscience. For students interested in surface processes and the application of
geology to environmental problems such as land use planning, resource planning, environmental im-
pact analysis, and environmental law. Such students should also consider enrolling in the coordinate
program of the Center for Environmental Studies.

214 Remote Sensing and Geographic Information Systems
215 Climate Changes
(Students interested in Environmental Geosciences should consult with Professors Dethier or Stoll.)
II Oceanography, Stratigraphy and Sedimentation. For students interested in the study of modern
and ancient sedimentary environments and the marine organisms that inhabited them.
101 Biodiversity in Geologic Time
104 Oceanography
206 Geological Sources of Energy
212 Invertebrate Paleobiology
(Students interested in Oceanography, Stratigraphy, and Sedimentation should consult with Professors
M. Johnson or Cox.)
III The Solid Earth. For students interested in plate tectonics, the processes active within the
Earth, the origin and deformation of rocks and minerals, and mineral exploration.
102 An Unfinished Planet
105 Geology Outdoors
303 Igneous and Metamorphic Petrology
(Students interested in The Solid Earth should consult with Professors Wobus or Karabinos.)
With the consent of the department, certain courses at the 200 level or higher in Biology, Chemistry,
Mathematics, or Physics may be substituted for elective courses in the major. Credit may be granted in
the Geosciences major for American Maritime Studies 211/Geosciences 210 (Oceanographic Pro-
cesses) or American Maritime Studies 311/Biology 231 (Marine Ecology) taken at Mystic Seaport.
Students considering graduate work in geosciences should also take courses in the allied sciences
and mathematics in addition to the requirements of the Geosciences major. The selection of outside
courses will depend on the field in which a student intends to specialize. Most geoscience graduate
schools require a year of Chemistry and Mathematics through 105. For those going into Environmen-
tal Geoscience, courses in computer science or statistics are recommended. For those considering
Oceanography, Stratigraphy, and Sedimentation, Biology 102 and Biology 203 are suggested. For
students entering Solid-Earth fields, Physics 131 and 132 are recommended.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN GEOSCIENCES
In order to be recommended for the degree with honors, a student is expected to have completed at
least two semesters and a winter study project (031) of independent research culminating in a thesis
which demonstrates outstanding achievement of an original and innovative nature. The principal con-
siderations in admitting a student to a program of independent research are mastery of fundamental
material and skills, ability to pursue independent study successfully, and demonstrated student inter-
est and motivation.
Further advice on the major can be obtained from the department chair.

GEOS 102(S) An Unfinished Planet
The Earth is a work-in-progress, an evolving planet whose vital signs--as expressed by earthquakes,
volcanic eruptions, and shifting plates--are still strong. In a geological time frame, nothing on Earth
is permanent: ocean basins open and close, mountains rise and fall, continental masses accrete and
separate. There is a message here for all who live, for an infinitesimally brief time, on the moving
surface of the globe. This course uses the plate tectonics model--one of the fundamental scientific
accomplishments of this century--to interpret the processes and products of a changing Earth. The
emphasis will be on mountain systems (on land and beneath the oceans) as expressions of plate inter-
actions. Specific topics include the rocks and structures of modern and ancient mountain belts, the
patterns of global seismicity and volcanism, the nature of the Earth's interior, the changing configura-
tions of continents and ocean basins through time, and, in some detail, the formation of the Appala-
chian Mountain system and the geological assembly of New England. Readings will be from a physi-
cal geology textbook and primary source supplement, selected writings of John McPhee, and refer-
ences about the geology of the Northeast.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; lab (several involving field work), two hours per week; one
required all-day field trip during the last week of the semester to the Connecticut Valley and the high-
lands of western Massachusetts. Evaluation will be based on two hour-tests, weekly lab work, and a
scheduled final exam.

earthquakes, volcanic activity, and running water often pose constraints on land use. This course ex-
amines the nature of geologic materials, the physical processes that continuously change the surface
of the Earth, and how these processes affect human activity. Topics include volcanic and earthquake
hazards, surface-water erosion and flooding, landslides, groundwater, solid waste disposal, resource
issues, global climate change, and the importance of geologic information to land-use planning. Lab-
oratories emphasize field and classroom studies of surface processes and discussion of their applica-
tion to planning.

GEOS 105(F) Geology Outdoors (W)
An introduction to geology through student field projects. The mountains, lakes, rivers, and valleys of
the Williamstown area provide unusual opportunities for learning geology in the field. Student pro-
jects will include the study of streams as active agents of erosion and deposition, the effects of glaci-
ation on the New England landscape, and the history of mountain building in the Appalachians. Fol-
lowing several group projects introducing the techniques of field geology, students will pursue inde-
pendent projects on subjects of particular interest to them. This course departs from the standard sci-
ence course format with three lectures and a required lab each week. Instead, emphasis is placed on
learning through active participation in field projects and presentation of results through high quality
writing. The class will meet two afternoons each week from 1:00 to 3:45 p.m. There will be two all day
field trips. This course is designed for students who have a serious interest in geology or other natural
and environmental sciences, the outdoors, and writing.
Format: discussion/field laboratory, six hours per week. Evaluation will be based on participation in
field work and discussions, five eight-page papers based on field projects, and an oral presentation of
independent projects. Students will use detailed comments on their papers to improve their writing
style in successive assignments.
No prerequisites; no previous knowledge of geology required. Open only to first-year students. En-
rollment limit: 12 (expected:12).

The severe economic effects of interruptions in oil supply highlight the dependence of most countries
on low-cost supplies of energy. What sources of energy will supply the world economy in the twenty-
first century and which countries will control these supplies? This course is an introduction to geologi-
cal and related sources of energy. Topics covered include: solar energy; the availability and environ-
mental consequences of hydroelectric, wind, and tidal power; biomass energy; energy from nuclear
reactions; and geothermal power.

GEOS 214(S) Remote Sensing and Geographic Information Systems (Same as Environmental
Studies 214)
Remote sensing involves the collection and processing of data from satellite and airborne sensors to
yield environmental information about the Earth's surface and lower atmosphere. Remote sensing
enhances regional mapping of rock types and faults and analysis of vegetation cover and land-use
changes over time. A Geographic Information System (GIS) links satellite-based environmental mea-
surements with spatial data such as topography, transportation networks, and political boundaries, al-
lowing display and quantitative analysis at the same scale using the same geographic reference. This
course covers the principles and practice of remote-data capture and geographic rectification using a
Global Positioning System (GPS), as well as the concepts of Remote Sensing, including linear and
non-linear image enhancements, convolution filtering, principle components analysis, and classifica-
tion. Principles of GIS include display and classification, spatial buffers, and logical overlays. Weekly
labs focus on practical applications of these techniques to data from Hopkins Memorial Forest, the
Berkshire region, and other areas of North America.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, weekly.
Prerequisites: at least one introductory course in Biology, Environmental Studies, or Geosciences.

GEOS 215(F) Climate Changes (Same as Environmental Studies 215) (Q)
In recent years, there has been a growing public and scientific interest in the Earth's climate and its
variability. This interest reflects both concern over future climate changes that may result from an-
thropogenic increases in atmospheric greenhouse gases and growing recognition of the economic im-
pact of "natural" climate variability (for example, El Niño events), especially in the developing world.
Efforts to understand the Earth's climate system and predict future climate changes require both study
of parameters controlling present day climate and detailed studies of climate changes in the past. In
this course, we will review the processes that control the Earth's climate, like insolation, distribution
of heat, ocean circulation, and the greenhouse effect. At the same time, we will review the geological
record of climate changes in the past, examining their causes, positive and negative feedback effects,
and indicators of the stability or instability of the climate system.
Format: lecture/discussion, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on weekly problems
(25%), two hour exams (50%), and a final project (25%) where students will collect, analyze, and
interpret data. Weekly exercises will emphasize developing problem solving skills and using quanti-
tative analyses to assess if a given explanation is possible and reasonable. These exercises will include

GEOS 218T(S) The Carbon Cycle (Same as Environmental Studies 218T) (W)
Carbon dioxide is the most important atmospheric greenhouse gas, and human activities are adding
carbon to the atmosphere at unprecedented rates. Yet only half of the carbon we emit each year re-
mains in the atmosphere because biological, geological, and chemical processes continually cycle
carbon from the atmosphere to the ocean, to land plants and soils, and to sediments. The workings of
the carbon cycle are at the center of many controversies surrounding the causes of past climate
changes and the outcome of future global warming. How was the earth's climate steered by past
changes in the carbon cycle, billions and millions of years ago? Will natural processes continue to take
up such a high percentage of carbon emissions as emissions continue and climate changes? Can and
should we coax natural systems to take up even more carbon? How might carbon emissions be re-
duced on the scale of the Williams campus? We will explore these issues through readings of current
journal articles and reports, as well as participation in a national workshop on reducing carbon emis-
sions on campuses.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: after an initial group meeting, students will meet in pairs for one hour

Coral reefs worldwide face mounting ecological pressures from climate warming, increased inci-
dence of coral diseases, dredging, pollution, overfishing, and increased destruction caused by boat
anchors, boat groundings, and mauling by divers. Evaluating the present and long-term effects of
these factors depends on an understanding of the complex dynamics of reef systems. This tutorial will
investigate the geology, sedimentology, biogeochemistry, and ecology of coral reefs, both modern
and ancient. The course will be linked to a 2003 winter study course during which we will map a mod-
ern fringing reef complex on St. John, U.S. Virgin Islands. Participation in the winter study excursion
is not required of tutorial enrollees, but the tutorial is a prerequisite for the winter study course.
Format: tutorial. Evaluation will be based on six 3000-word (about 6 pages) papers, discussion, and
critical analysis. There will be a strong focus on polished writing and argument, and papers will be
thoroughly edited for style, grammar, and syntax. Students will improve their writing by integrating
into successive papers the editorial comments they receive and also by editing the writing of their
tutorial partners.
Prerequisites: one Geosciences course or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 12 (expected:

GEOS 301(F) Structural Geology (Q)
The structure of the Earth's crust is constantly changing and the rocks making up the crust must de-
form to accommodate these changes. Rock deformation occurs over many scales ranging from indi-
vidual mineral grains to mountain belts. This course deals with the geometric description of struc-
tures, stress and strain analysis, deformation mechanisms in rocks, and the large scale forces responsi-
ble for crustal deformation. The laboratories cover geologic maps and cross sections, folds and faults,
stereonet analysis, field techniques, strain, and stress.
Format: lecture/discussion, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours per week. Evaluation will be
based on weekly laboratory exercises, problem sets, a midterm exam, and a final exam. Many of the
laboratories and problem sets use geometry, algebra, and several projection techniques to solve com-
mon problems in structural geology.

GEOS 302(S) Sedimentation (W)
The composition and architecture of sediments and sedimentary rocks preserve information about the
rocks that were eroded to form them, the fluids and forces that transported them, the mechanisms by
which they were deposited, and the processes by which they were lithified. This course will provide
an introduction to the principles of sedimentology, including sedimentary petrology, fluid mechanics,
bedform analysis, and facies architecture.
Format: lecture/discussion, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours per week; one half-day and
one all-day field trip. Evaluation will be based on laboratory work, writing assignments, an hour
exam, and a final exam. Ten written critiques (each 1000 words) of specific assigned papers from the
sedimentological literature are designed to teach clear written expression and careful analytical read-
ing. Papers will be thoroughly edited for style, grammar and syntax. Students will improve their writ-
ing by integrating editorial comments into successive papers. Each student will compile his/her pa-
pers as a growing body of work, and each new paper will be read and edited in the context of the pre-
vious submissions.

tion of individual rock types, and important assemblages are related, where possible, to theories of
global tectonics.
Laboratory work emphasizes the study of individual rock units and rock suites in hand specimens and
by petrographic and x-ray techniques.

GEOS 404T(S) Geology of the Appalachians (W)
The Appalachians are the eroded remnants of a mountain range that once rivaled the Alps and, per-
haps, the Himalayas in elevation. They formed hundreds of millions of years ago in three distinct col-
lisions with other continents. The Appalachians record a rich geologic history of continental rifting,
formation and closing of ocean basins, continental collision, and mountain building. We will read pa-
pers that describe the history of the Appalachians beginning with the Late Precambrian opening of the
Iapetus ocean, through the Paleozoic orogenies that formed the Appalachians, and ending with the
formation of the Atlantic. The history of the Appalachians remains controversial, in part, because of
diverse perspectives that geologists bring to their work and interpretations, such as different special-
ties, guiding paradigms, and field areas. The readings are designed to illuminate the roots of the im-
portant controversies as well as the geologic history of this well studied mountain belt.
Format: tutorial; after an initial group meeting, students will meet in pairs for one hour each week with
the instructor. Each student will orally present a written paper every other week for criticism during

LANGUAGE STUDY
The department provides language instruction to enable the student to acquire all four linguistic
skills: understanding, speaking, reading, and writing. German 101-W-102 stresses basic communica-
German
­ 180 ­
tive competence and covers German grammar in full. German 103 combines a review of grammar
with extensive practice in reading and conversation. German 104 aims to develop facility in speaking,
writing, and reading. German 201 emphasizes accuracy and idiomatic expression in speaking and
writing. German 202 combines advanced language study with the examination of topics in German-
speaking cultures. Students who have studied German in secondary school should take the placement
test given during First Days in September to determine which course to take.
STUDY ABROAD
The department strongly encourages students wanting to attain fluency in German to spend a se-
mester or year studying in Germany, Austria, or Switzerland, either independently or in one of several
approved foreign study programs. German 104 or the equivalent is the minimum requirement for ju-
nior-year abroad programs sponsored by American institutions. Students who wish to enroll directly
in a German-speaking university should complete at least 201 or the equivalent. In any case, all stu-
dents considering study-abroad are advised to discuss their language preparation with a member of
the department.
LITERATURE IN TRANSLATION
The department regularly offers courses on German literature in translation for students who have
little or no knowledge of German, but who wish to become acquainted with the major achievements in
German literary and intellectual history.
ADVANCED STUDIES
The department offers a variety of advanced courses for students who wish to investigate German
literature, thought, and culture in the original. German 202 is given each year and is recommended as
preparation for upper-level courses.
THE CERTIFICATE IN GERMAN
To enhance a student's educational and professional profiles, the department offers the Certificate
in German. It requires seven courses--two fewer than the major--and is especially appropriate for
students who begin study of the language at Williams.
Students who enter Williams with previous training in German may substitute more advanced
courses for the 100-level courses; they can also be exempted from up to two of the required courses.
Students must receive a minimum grade of B in each course taken in the sequence. In addition, they
must score of at least 650 (out of a possible 800) on the ETS (Educational Testing Service) Proficiency
Test.
Appropriate elective courses can usually be found among the offerings of German, Art History,
History, Music, Philosophy, Political Science, and Theatre.

GERM 302(F) German Studies, 1830-1900
The nineteenth century in Germany and Austria was a crucial time in all areas of culture and thought.
The debates that raged in the intellectual and ideological arena (think Marx, Nietzsche, Freud) and in
the world of music (Wagner vs. Brahms) combined with the political developments that culminated in
the unification of Germany in 1871 to form a significant foundation for the political, philosophical,
and artistic landscape of the twentieth century. We will study some of the works that played a signifi-
cant role in this process, perhaps including those by Büchner, Droste-Hülshoff, Marx, B. von Arnim,
Fontane, Wagner, Brahms, Hauptmann, and the young Freud. Conducted in German.
Format: seminar. Requirements: active class participation, several short interpretation exercises, one
presentation, two papers.

tions like the department store and the cinema (Hessel, Benjamin), expressionist poetry (Trakl, Lask-
er-Schüler), generational conflict via Kafka's alienated sons, Jews in Germany (Klemperer), the pa-
triotic fervor of World War One and its aftermath (Toller, Jünger), Dadaism (Schwitters), the Weimar
Republic, inflation and the big crash (Fallada), Nazi ideology and propaganda tactics (Riefenstahl,

GENERAL STATEMENT OF GOALS
Although the History Department aspires to pursue a variety of goals, our core objectives remain
the cultivation in our students of a critical understanding and awareness of the past and the develop-
ment of our students' intellectual, analytical, and rhetorical abilities. In pursuit of the first objective,
through its curricular offerings the department seeks both to expose students to the richness, diversity,
and complexities of human history over long periods of time and in different geographic regions and
to provide students with the opportunity to explore aspects of the past in depth. At the same time, the
department endeavors to develop students' ability to think historically and to foster in them an ap-
preciation of the contested nature and the value of historical knowledge by confronting them with the
variety of ways in which historians have approached and interpreted the past, engaging them in issues
that provoke historical debate, and familiarizing them with the nature and uses of historical evidence.
By engaging students in the critical study of the past, finally, the department seeks to develop their
ability to formulate historically informed opinions and their analytical and rhetorical skills generally.
While members of the department attempt to accomplish these multiple objectives individually
through their particular courses and their other contacts with students, the department seeks to do so
collectively through the structure of the History curriculum and the requirements of the History major.
COURSE NUMBERS
The course numbering system used by the History Department reflects the different types and ob-
jectives of courses offered at each level. The different course levels are distinguished less by degree of
difficulty than by the purposes that the courses at each level are intended to serve and the background
knowledge they presume.
First-Year Seminars and Tutorials (102-199): These writing intensive courses introduce stu-
dents to the richness of historical approaches to the past and to the contested subjects on which
historians focus. They emphasize the acquisition of skills needed in the advanced study of his-
tory and are ideal for students contemplating a major in History. Each seminar is limited to
nineteen students, and each tutorial, to ten students. In the case of seminars, Preference given to
first-year students and then to sophomores. First-year students and sophomores will be given
equal preference in the case of tutorials, to which the writing of five or six essays and the oral
presentation of five or six critiques of another student's essays are central. In any case, first-
year students will not normally be permitted to enroll in a tutorial during their first semester.
Because first-year seminars and tutorials serve as an introduction to the study of history, only
one course of each type may count toward the History major; these courses can also be used to
meet the department's group and concentration requirements.
Introductory Survey Courses (202-299): These courses are open to all students and are intended to
provide a basic understanding of the history of peoples, countries, and geographic regions over rel-
atively long time-spans. Most of all, they will provide students with the background necessary for
more advanced study in history at the 300 and 400 level. They are offered in either small or large
formats, depending on the individual course.
History
­ 184 ­
Junior Seminars (301): Junior seminars offer a series of "reflections on history," are required for the
degree in History, and are normally restricted to junior History majors. Each seminar focuses in
depth on questions of methodology, historiography, and/or epistemology and is intended to
introduce students to various ways of thinking about and "doing" history, both in the present and in
the past. Each year several junior seminars will be offered; prospective majors must select two ju-
nior seminars at the end of their sophomore year and will then be assigned to one of their two
choices. If students are studying away from Williams during their junior year, they must enroll in a
junior seminar during their senior year.
Advanced Electives (302-399): These advanced, topical courses are more specialized in focus than are the
introductory survey courses (202-299) and are intended to follow such courses. Enrollment is often limi-
ted. Because these courses may presume some background knowledge, the instructor may recommend
that students enroll in an appropriate introductory course before registering for an advanced elective.
Advanced Seminars (402-479): These are advanced courses normally limited in enrollment to fif-
teen students. Each seminar will investigate a topic in depth and will require students to engage in
research that leads to a substantial piece of historical writing. All History majors are required to
complete either an advanced seminar (402-479) or a tutorial (480-492). Instructors may recom-
mend prior coursework in the area of the seminar. Preference given to senior History majors, fol-
lowed by junior History majors.
Advanced Tutorials (480-492): These are advanced reading and writing courses that offer an in-
depth analysis of a topic in tutorial format. Tutorials are limited in enrollment to ten students and
Preference given to senior History majors. All History majors are required to complete either an
advanced seminar (402-479) or a tutorial (480-492). Instructors may recommend prior coursework
in the area of the tutorial. The writing of five or six essays and the oral presentation of five or six
critiques of another student's essays are central to tutorials.
Within each of these levels, courses are further divided by geographical area:
Africa and the Middle East 102-111 202-211 302-311 402-411
Asia 112-121 212-221 312-321 412-421
Europe and Russia 122-141 222-241 322-341 422-441
Latin America and the Caribbean 142-151 242-251 342-351 442-451
United States 152-191 252-291 352-391 452-471
Transnational/Comparative 192-199 292-299 392-396 472-479
ADVISING
Both majors and non-majors are encouraged to talk at any time with Professor Wagner, the depart-
ment chair, Mrs. Swift, the department administrative assistant, or any other member of the depart-
ment about the History major.
All majors will be assigned a faculty advisor. All majors must meet with their advisor, or the depart-
ment chair, during the first week of classes during the fall semester and at the time of the spring semes-
ter registration period in order to have their courses and plans for the History major approved. Stu-
dents who are interested in the senior honors program or graduate school should contact Professor
Wong. Prospective study abroad students should contact Mrs. Swift.
ADVANCED PLACEMENT
Students will be granted one semester course credit toward the course requirement in the History
major if they receive a score of 4 or 5 on one or more of the Advanced Placement examinations in
history. Even if two or more Advanced Placement examinations are taken, and the student receives a 4
or 5 on more than one of them, only one semester course credit will be applied toward the course re-
quirement in the History major. Moreover, such credit may not be used to satisfy the group require-
ments or concentration requirements. Beginning with the class of 2008, no credit toward the History
major will be granted for AP examination results. Students receiving a grade of 5 on any AP history
examination, however, will be guaranteed a place in the 100-level seminar of their choice.
THE MAJOR
The major consists of at least nine semester courses as follows:
Required Courses in the Major
One Junior Seminar (History 301)
At least one Advanced Seminar (History 402-479) or Tutorial (History 480-492)
Elective Courses
Seven (or more) additional semester courses in History, at least one of these to be chosen from each
of the following three groups:
Group A: History of the United States
History
­ 185 ­
Group B: European History (including Russian History)
Group C: History of Asia, Africa and the Middle East, and/or Latin-American and the Caribbean
In addition, students must take at least one course dealing with the premodern period (designated
Group D in the catalog); this may be one of the courses used to fulfill the group requirement (Groups
A-C).
A single course can meet the requirement for no more than one of Groups A through C. Only one
First-year seminar and one First-year tutorial (102-199) may be used to meet the group requirements.
Concentration in the Major
All students are required to adopt a concentration within the History major. The concentration
should be selected in consultation with a faculty advisor at spring registration during the sophomore
year. A list of concentrations is appended below and a list of the courses that fall within each con-
centration is available from the History Department office and can also be found on the department's
website. Students must choose to concentrate in one of these eighteen broad areas unless they petition
the department's Curriculum Committee to substitute a concentration of their own design. A con-
centration will consist of at least three courses linked by common themes, geography, or time period;
only one of those courses can be a 100-level seminar while at least one must be a 300- or 400-level
course. Courses in the concentration may be used to fulfill the group requirements. In selecting
courses to meet their concentration requirement, students should be aware that not every course is
offered every year. Courses taken abroad may be included in the concentration with the approval of
the chair.
Concentrations:
1. Africa and the African Diaspora
2. Asia and the Asian Diaspora
3. Comparative Slavery
4. Ancient, Medieval, and Renaissance Europe
5. Early Modern Europe
6. Modern Europe
7. Gender and Sexuality
8. History of Ideas

10. Latin America and the Caribbean
11. Latin America and the Latina/o Diaspora
12. Religion
13. The Twentieth-Century World
14. Colonial North America and the United States to 1865
15. The United States Since 1865
16. Race and Ethnicity in North America
17. Urban and Environmental History
18. War and Revolution
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN HISTORY
The History Department offers a thesis route to the degree with honors in History. This involves a
ten-course major as well as an independent WSP. Students wishing to undertake independent research
or considering graduate study are encouraged to participate in the thesis program and honors seminar.
Application to enter the honors program should be made by spring registration in the junior year
and should be based on a solid record of work of honors caliber, normally defined as maintaining at
least a B+ average in courses taken for the major. Students who intend to write an honors thesis must
submit a proposal to the History Department at this time. Students who will be away during the spring
semester of their junior year should make arrangements to apply before leaving. Normally, it is the
responsibility of the individual student to procure the agreement of a member of the department to act
as his or her thesis advisor, and the student must therefore consult with a member of the department
about a thesis topic and a possible thesis advisor prior to submitting a proposal to the department. A
student who is uncertain of which member of the department might be an appropriate advisor, or who
otherwise is unable to find an advisor, should contact the chair of the honors committee. An honors
thesis proposal must be signed by a member of the History Department. Normally, the thesis topic
should be related to course work which the student has previously done. Students should be aware,
however, that while the department will try to accommodate all students who qualify to pursue hon-
ors, particular topics may be deemed unfeasible and students may have to revise their topics accor-
dingly. Final admission to the honors thesis program will depend on the department's assessment of
the qualifications of the student and the feasibility of the project.
Once the student has been notified of admission to the honors thesis program, he or she should reg-
ister for History 493, Senior Honors Thesis Research Seminar, in the fall semester, for History 031
during winter study, and for History 494, Senior Honors Thesis Writing Seminar, in the spring. In
History
­ 186 ­
addition to doing the research for and writing a thesis of approximately 75-100 pages, students will
attend special presentations under the History Department's Class of 1960 Scholars Program.
During the fall, students should work regularly on their research and consult frequently with their
advisors. Throughout the semester, honors candidates will also present written progress reports for
group discussion to the seminar (History 493). Performance in the seminar will be evaluated on the
basis of class participation and completed written work and will determine if a student will continue in
the thesis program. For students proceeding to History 031 and History 494, performance in the fall
semester will figure into the thesis grade calculated at the end of the year.
Students who are deemed to be making satisfactory progress on their research and writing at this
point will be allowed to continue with the thesis. They will devote the entire winter study period to
thesis work. They should conclude their research during winter study and complete at least one chap-
ter of their thesis for submission to their advisor before the end of winter study. At the end of winter
study, the honors committee will formally consult with advisors and make recommendations to the
department concerning which students should be allowed to proceed with the thesis. During the early
weeks of the second semester, students will present a draft chapter of their thesis to the honors semi-
nar.
Completed theses will be due in mid-April, after which each student will prepare and present a
short oral presentation of his or her thesis for delivery at the departmental Honors Colloquium. Anoth-
er student who has read the thesis will then offer a critique of it, after which the two faculty readers of
the thesis will offer their own comments and questions. Finally, there will be a general discussion of
the thesis by students and other members of the department.
LANGUAGE
Study of a foreign language is basic to the understanding of other cultures. Particularly those stu-
dents who might wish to do graduate work in History are encouraged to enroll in language courses at
Williams.

HIST 127(F) (formerly 105) The Expansion of Europe (W)
This course investigates the expansion of European power and influence over much of the rest of the
world from the late Middle Ages to the mid-nineteenth century--the early period of European Imper-
ialism. Specific topics will vary, but include the development and initial expansion of medieval and
Renaissance Europe, the discovery and conquest of the New World, the struggle with Islam for com-
mand of the seas, the establishment of European influence in the East and Far East, the slave trade, the
invasion of North America, and the initial steps toward hegemony in the Middle East and Africa. Stu-
dents will investigate the ways in which individual personality, religiosity, greed, critical first con-
tacts, and cultural misunderstandings and prejudices combined with important aspects of the Military,
Scientific, and early Industrial Revolutions to establish European hegemony on a world-wide scale
during this early period of European Imperialism.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on five short written exercises and one research paper.

HIST 129(F) (formerly 107) Religion, Race, and Gender in the Age of the French Revolution
(W)*
The French Revolution was an important turning point in world history. Besides ushering in an age of
liberté (liberty) and egalité(equality), it also postulated the existence of a new revolutionary fraternité
(brotherhood) between peoples of all backgrounds. Would revolutionary fraternity include women,
African slaves, and Jews in the new democratic polity? French men and women debated these ques-
tions in ways that have had a direct impact on our contemporary discussions of race, gender, religious
freedom and ethnicity. In this course, we will explore these debates, their Enlightenment roots, and the
legacy of these debates for France's minorities today, especially those of Arabic and Islamic origin.
Students will be introduced to various types of historical sources (rare books, art, opera, plays), as well
as to the lively historiographical debates between historians of France concerning methodology, poli-
tics, and the goal of historical research.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class participation, oral reports, several short papers, a
10-page research paper, and an oral final examination. The class will also be expected to go on a cou-
ple of field trips.

HIST 135T(S) The Great War, 1914-1918 (W)
During the nineteenth and early twentieth century Europeans and their immediate offspring created
the modern world. European industry, science, trade, weapons, and culture dominated the globe. Af-
ter a century of general peace the continual "progress" of Western Civilization seemed assured. Then,
in August, 1914, the major European powers went to war with one another. After four years of unprec-
edented carnage, violence, and destruction, Europe was left exhausted and bitter, its previous opti-
mism replaced by pessimism, its world position undermined, and its future clouded by a deeply
flawed peace settlement.
What were the fundamental causes of the Great War? How and why did it break out when it did and
who was responsible? Why was it so long, ferocious, wasteful, and, until the very end, indecisive?
Why did the Allies, rather than the Central Powers, emerge victorious? What did the peace settlement
settle? How was Europe changed? What is the historical significance of the conflict?

HIST 148(S) (formerly 102) The Mexican Revolution: 1910 to NAFTA (W)*
The first great revolution in the twentieth century, the Mexican Revolution was as dramatic and com-
pelling as later episodes in Russia, China and Cuba. Using a wide variety of sources--from films,
murals, and comic books to classic works of political and social history--this seminar will examine
the forces that exploded in over a decade of violence and produced the peculiar "institutional revolu-
tionary" government that ruled Mexico from the 1920s to the crises of the late 1990s. Was the Revolu-
tion a true social revolution or just a "palace coup"? Did workers, women, peasants, or indigenous
peoples make real gains in social or political power during the after the Revolution? How democratic
or authoritarian is the Mexico that emerged from the brutal decade of the 1910s? Finally, in light of

HIST 152(F) "New Worlds for All": European-Indian Encounters in Colonial North America
(W)*
This course focuses on the interactions between Indians and Europeans in the contexts of Spanish,
French, Dutch, and British exploration and colonization of North America. Drawing upon our critical
reading of secondary and primary sources, we will explore the political, economic, social, and cultural
transformations visited upon both Indian and Euro-American societies as a result of European at-
History
­ 188 ­
tempts to control vast North American territories from the Saint Lawrence valley to Florida and from
the Lower Mississippi valley to California. Because of the large scope of our inquiry we will proceed
both chronologically and thematically. Our themes will include: Indian resistance and adaptation to
European invasions and evangelizing efforts; diplomacy, warfare, and the evolution of North Ameri-
can geopolitics; Frontier exchange economies and the transformation of material cultures; the trans-
formation and construction of colonial identities (Euro-American and Indian concepts of "self," the
racialization of Euro-American perceptions of Indians and Indians' perceptions of Europeans).
Over the course of the semester, students will write several response papers based on secondary read-
ings to help them assess how historians have addressed these themes. These papers will serve as the
basis for our discussion of the methodologies, theories, and sources historians use to reconstruct the
history of European-Indian encounters. Short response papers will also familiarize students with
some of the most important historiographical debates of colonial North American history and will
help them conceptualize and write an original research paper based upon a combination of primary
and secondary sources.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class attendance and participation, weekly response pa-
pers and the final research paper.

HIST 159(F) The Origins of the Cold War (W)
In August of 1945, World War II ended and America looked forward to a future of peace. Five years
later, not only was the country engaged in another war (albeit a "limited" one in Korea), but it had also
constructed the institutions and ideologies of a national security state for what had come to be called a
"cold war." The rapidity with which this happened and the global reach of American security interests
is breathtaking: in this writing-intensive seminar, we will slow down the historical clock to investigate
in-depth what happened in those five years, covering such subjects as the policy of containment, the
development of nuclear arms, domestic anti-communism, the division of Berlin, and our increasing
military commitments in Asia.

HIST 165(F) The Quest for Racial Justice in Twentieth-Century America (W)*
On August 28, 1963, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. delivered arguably some of the most recognizable
phrases of the civil rights movement in his famous "I Have a Dream" speech. While significant and
clearly central to the quest for racial justice in twentieth-century America, Dr. King's leadership
should be understood within the context of ongoing national and grassroots political activism before,
during, and after the 1963 March on Washington. This introductory course focuses on the social, polit-
ical, and public policy perspectives that informed twentieth-century struggles for black civil rights.
Using a variety of sources (memoirs, photography, film, and music), we will consider historical de-
bates as well as the period's impact on our understanding of African American and American history.

HIST 166(S) The Age of Washington and DuBois (W)*
The beginning of the twentieth century saw the rise of two influential African American thinkers, W.
E. B. DuBois and Booker T. Washington. The intellectual and social programs that the two offered as
solutions to the "race problem" are often seen as diametrically opposed to one another. This course
will begin with an examination of the writings and intellectual production of these two men. Did they
share a common ground? What were their responses and solutions to "the Negro question"? How did
their ideas take effect? We will also set their work into an African American historical context, ex-
amining concurrent social developments such as the mass migration of African Americans to north-
ern cities, the workings of the sharecropping system, and the cultural production of African American
film and music artists in the first decades of the twentieth century. Readings will include works by

HIST 203(F) Sub-Saharan Africa Since 1800*
This survey of sub-Saharan African history takes up the continuing saga of African political, social
and economic developments from the aftermath of the trans-Atlantic slave trade to the present. It is
divided into three sections. The first section of the course focuses on the consequences of the slave
trade on African societies and on the Africans' interaction with European merchants, explorers, and
missionaries in the decades preceding colonial conquest. The human consequences of the trade lin-
gered long after the abolition of the slave trade across the Atlantic ocean. Many African societies were
strengthened, often at the expense of their neighbors; other societies were weakened, thus setting the
stage for colonial conquest. During the second half of the nineteenth century, however, competition
among Europeans for control of raw materials for their nascent industries led to colonization, and in
some cases, to white settlement in Africa.
The second section of the course investigates the process of colonial conquest and the dynamics of
colonial rule in Africa. It looks especially at the ways in which colonialism affected various groups of
Africans, and at the ways, both subtle and overt, in which Africans resisted or collaborated with colo-
nial rule in order to achieve their goals. The colonial period, brief in time, yet profoundly significant in
its impact, was ushered out partly by the rising tide of African nationalism.
The last section of the course, then, examines the rise of new nation-states, their colonial legacies,
post-colonial economies, and systems of justice, education, and governance.

its subsequent evolution to the contemporary political and economic phenomenon we know today.
Tracing premodern legacies that have helped shape China, the course covers the decline and fall of the
Qing dynasty through the creation of Communist China and the unfolding of the post-Mao era. The
class uses primary and secondary sources (including literature and films) to examine the origins and
impact of major social and ideological trends such as foreign imperialism, nationalism, racism/cultur-
alism, feminism, communism, Maoism, and capitalism in China. The course considers the relation-
ship between political thought and practice and how these "-isms" affected the daily life of the indi-

how various "ordinary people" have lived through the extraordinary changes of the past century and a
half. Through the perspectives of ordinary people, from a young girl working in a cotton textile facto-
ry in the 1920s to a salaryman in the post-World War II period, issues of class and status, gender, fami-
ly, education, and work will be addressed. Reading materials will include autobiographies, oral histo-

War and at times allowing for measured collaboration. This course will explore the complexities of
U.S.-Japan relations from the perspectives of both countries, with a focus on how culture, domestic
concerns, economic and political aims, international contexts, and race have helped shape the course
and nature of U.S.-Japan relations. Issues will extend beyond those of diplomatic history to examine
how various types of interactions have influenced the dynamics of power between the two countries
and have shaped the ways in which each country has understood and portrayed the other. Topics will
include early U.S.-Japan encounters, the road to World War, the politics and social history of the Oc-
cupation, trade relations, and the U.S.-Japan security alliance. Contemporary topics will also be dis-
cussed and due attention will be given to the larger context of U.S.-East Asian relations.

HIST 223(F) (formerly 218) Roman History (Same as Classics 223)
The study of Roman history involves questions central to the development of Western institutions,
religion, and modes of thought. Scholars have looked to Rome both for actual antecedents of Euro-
pean cultural development and for paradigmatic scenes illustrating what they felt were cultural uni-
versals. Yet Roman history also encompasses the most far-reaching experience of diverse cultures,
beliefs, and practices known in the Western tradition until perhaps contemporary times. A close anal-
ysis of Roman history on its own terms shows the complex and fascinating results of an ambitious,
self-confident nation's encounter both with unexpected events and crises at home, and with other
peoples. As this course addresses the history of Rome from its mythologized beginnings through the
reign of the emperor Constantine, it will place special emphasis on the impressive Roman ability to
turn the unexpected into a rich source of cultural development, as well as the complex tendency later
to interpret such ad hoc responses as predestined and inevitable. The Romans also provide a vivid
portrait of the relationship between power and self-confidence on the one hand, and violence and ulti-
mate disregard for dissent and difference on the other. Readings for this course will concentrate on a
wide variety of original sources, and there will be a strong emphasis on the problems of historical
interpretation.

What does it mean to be a Jew? The vexed question of Jewish identity emerged at the end of the eigh-
teenth century in Europe and has dominated Jewish history throughout the modern period. Although
Jewish emancipation and citizenship followed different paths in France and the German states, in both
cases Jews were confronted by unprecedented opportunities for integration into non-Jewish society
and unprecedented challenges to Jewish communal life. This course will introduce students to the
major social, cultural, religious, and political transformations that shaped the lives of Europe's Jews
from the outbreak of the French Revolution to the aftermath of World War II. We will explore such
topics as emancipation, Jewish diversity, the rise of religious denominations within Judaism, compet-
ing political ideologies, Jewish-gentile relations, the role of Jewish women, Jewish responses to Na-
zism, and the situation of Jews in the immediate postwar period. In addition to broad historical treat-

This course will introduce students to the turbulent and often vexing history of German politics, soci-

came a unified nation-state for the first time in its history under the iron fist of Bismarck. Two world
wars and several political regimes later, Germany was again united but this time as a European-ori-
ented democratic state. Throughout the intervening period, the questions of what it meant to be Ger-
man and how Germany should fit into Europe and the world were vigorously debated. The different
answers that subsequent generations of Germans arrived at have had tremendous implications for
people throughout the world. This survey will be guided by the question of German identity and by the
issue of what problems the German past poses for today. We will study modern Germany in its various
forms, from the Empire through the Weimar Republic and the Third Reich, to post-war division and
reunification. Our primary focus will be the continuities and discontinuities of German history, partic-
ularly with regard to the rise of Nazism and the issue of how far the two postwar Germanies broke with
the past.

HIST 254(S) North American Indian History: Pre-Contact to the Present*
In most renditions of North American history, Indian people only make cameo appearances as war-
riors or victims bound to disappear in the face of relentless Euro-American imperialism. All too
often, the complexity and diversity of American Indian historical experiences and Indian people's
role in shaping the political, economic, and cultural history of the United States and Canada remain
unexplored. In this course, we will examine the historical significance of North American Indian
actions and experiences from the "pre-Columbian" era to the present. Our approach will be both
chronological and thematic and will pay close attention to the methods scholars have used to recon-
struct American Indian perspectives. Our themes will include: Indian resistance and adaptation to
European colonial invasions and evangelizing efforts; diplomacy, warfare, and the evolution of
North American geopolitics; the transformation of Euro-American and Indian material cultures;

The experience of slavery necessarily dominates this history and it is the contours and nuances of
slavery that give this course its focus. We will explore the influence of African culture on early
America, the role of gender in the American slave labor system, the development of racial classifi-
cation in North America, and the cultural and intellectual significance of the abolitionist move-
ment. Our readings will include primary sources and secondary literature. Class meetings will com-

This course will introduce the major themes in Asian American history from 1850 to the present, ex-
amining the lives of Chinese, Japanese, Koreans, Filipinos, Indians, Southeast Asians, and Pacific
Islanders in America. Topics will include the anti-Asian exclusion movement, the wartime experi-
ences of Japanese Americans, the increase of Asian immigration as a result of the 1965 Immigration
Act and the Vietnam War, and the impact of the events of September 11, 2001 on Asian American
communities. These themes and others will be explored through the reading of historical texts, mem-

HIST 286(S) Latino/a History From 1846 to the Present*
This course examines the formation of Latino/a communities in the United States from 1846 to the
present. These communities were formed through conquest, immigration, and migration. In examin-
ing the causes of migration, we will consider economic and political conditions in the countries of
origin, U.S. foreign policies, and the connections between the United States and the countries of ori-
gin. We will explore the ways in which migration processes are mediated through labor recruitment,
immigration and refugee policies, and social networks. We will analyze how Latinos and Latinas have
been incorporated into the economies of the regions of the United States where they settled. Focusing

JUNIOR SEMINARS (301)
Junior Seminars offer a series of "reflections" on history, are required for the degree in History, and
are normally restricted to junior History majors. Each seminar focuses in depth on questions of meth-
odology, historiography, and/or epistemology and is intended to introduce students to various ways of
thinking about and "doing" history, both in the present and in the past. Each year several junior semi-
nars will be offered; prospective majors must select two junior seminars at the end of the sophomore
year and will then be assigned to one of their two choices. If students are studying away from Williams
during their junior year, they must enroll in a junior seminar during their senior year.

HIST 301D(S) Is History Eurocentric?
The modern historical profession is very much a European creation, originating in the Age of Enligh-
tenment. Championing reason and challenging religious views of the past, the philosophes linked the
new secular study of man and his society to a view of historical progress, of which they were the pre-
eminent spokesmen. History as the story of progress continued unabated through the early-twentieth
century, until challenged by critics within and critics without. Some of these have argued that the very
nature of the historical discipline is Eurocentric, based as it is on Western concepts of reason, science,
and historical evolution. In this course, we will study some of the important spokesmen for historical
progress (Voltaire, Condorcet, Marx, von Ranke) as well as some of their important critics. The first
half of the course will survey the history of the historical profession from the Enlightenment to the
present. In the second half of the course, we will read some of the great works of history which have
attempted to explain the rise of the west, grappling with how and to what extent these interpretations
are Eurocentric.
Evaluation will be based on informed class participation, class debates, two short papers (5 pages),
one long paper (10 pages) and a self-scheduled final exam.
Restricted to History majors.

HIST 301G(F) Westward Expansion in American History
For historians of the United States, the Anglo-American settlement of the West has been a critical lens
for viewing the development of the nation. But historians have never reached any consensus on what
the process of westward expansion, or the influence of the West as a region, has meant to American
history. Did the frontier build American character, as Frederick Jackson Turner argued in 1893? Did it
establish patterns of conquest that shaped American policy toward other parts of the world, as some
current historians would argue today? Has the West been an exceptional place or representative of the
nation at large? How should we even define "the West" or "the frontier"? These are some of the ques-
History

tions we will explore as we survey the historiographical trajectory on the subject from the mid-nine-
teenth century to the present.

HIST 302(F) Jerusalem: Myth, History and Theology (300 B.C.E-400) (Same as Classics 218
and Religion 209)
The story of Jerusalem in Greco-Roman antiquity is refracted through a triangular prism of represen-
tations: first, a city surrounding "a renowned temple" (Polybius); on the eve of its eclipse, "the most
famous city in the East" (Pliny the Elder); later, "a distinctive New (Christian) Jerusalem over against
the famous Jerusalem of Old" (Eusebius). This third representation has served as the foundation of the
Christian presence in Jerusalem to this day, while Second Temple and Later Roman Jerusalem was the
epicenter of a renewed Jewish cult and the core of its formative post-biblical culture. Such glorified
representations of the city contrast sharply with a history of internal (Jewish-Sectarian) discord, as
well as external (Hellenistic and Roman) pressure, which ultimately brought the city's devastation.
Even in the period that followed its destruction, Jerusalem became the focal point of Christian-Jewish
historical and theological dispute.
In order to come to grips with the magnificent and entangled past of this most storied of cities, we shall
"stroll" through Jerusalem's fascinating archaeological remains and view its past through the eyes of
some of its most prominent inhabitants (Josephus), its worshippers and mourners (the Rabbis), and its
lovers and great critics (Jesus and the Church Fathers).

HIST 323(S) Leadership, Government, and the Governed in Ancient Greece (Same as
Classics 323 and Leadership Studies 323) (W)
Visionary, opportunist, reformer, tyrant, demagogue, popular champion: concise characterization
of influential leaders is often irresistible. But placing leaders in their much less easily encapsulated
political, social, and religious contexts reveals them to be far more complicated and challenging
subjects. Among the questions that will guide our study of Greek leadership: Was the transforma-
tive leader in a Greek city always an unexpected one, arising outside of the prevailing political and/
or social systems? To what extent did the prevailing systems determine the nature of transformative
as well as of normative leadership? How did various political and social norms contribute to legiti-
mating particular kinds of leader? After studying such leaders as the "tyrants" who prevailed in
many Greek cities of both the archaic and classical eras, then Athenian leaders like Solon, Cleis-
thenes, Cimon, Pericles, Cleon, and Demosthenes, and Spartans like Cleomenes, Leonidas, Brasi-
das, and Lysander, we will focus on Alexander the Great, whose unique accomplishments trans-
formed every aspect of Greek belief about leadership, national boundaries, effective government,
the role of the governed, and the legitimacy of power. Readings will include accounts of leadership
and government by ancient Greek authors (e.g. Homer, Solon, Herodotus, Thucydides, Plato, Aris-
totle, Demosthenes, all in translation) and contemporary historians and political theorists.
Format: discussion/lecture. Evaluation will be based on contributions to class discussions, three
short papers (4-6 pages each), a midterm exam, and an oral presentation leading to a significant
final paper (15-20 pages).

From the ancient world to the twentieth century, war has always played an important part in European
history. Europeans have not only constantly been at war with other Europeans, but also with neighbor-
ing cultures and, indeed, most peoples around the globe. This course will introduce students to the
history of European warfare from its origins in the classical and medieval periods to its maturation in
the early modern period (1450-1815), and its disastrous culmination in the nationalist struggles of the
nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Has there been a distinctively "European Way of War" from the
beginning? How do we explain failure and success in European wars? What exactly happened at the
strategic, operational, and tactical levels of war? And what caused changes in the organization and
waging of European war from one period to the next?

Reformations, 1450-1617
This course surveys the origins, causes, characteristics, and impact of the revolutionary religious
movements of the sixteenth century that resulted in the division of Latin Christendom into two com-
peting traditions, catholic and protestant. First, we will investigate the religious histories of these
movements, examining such topics as the magisterial reformers (Luther, Zwingli, Calvin); the "radi-
History

cal Reformation"; and the Catholic resurgence and Counter Reformation. Second, we will study the
varied effects of these religious movements on earl y modern European politics, society, and culture.

state and "social discipline"; and the impact of the Reformations on gender relations.

HIST 332(S) Witchcraft in Early Modern Europe
Historians estimate that between the fifteenth and eighteenth centuries some 50,000 women, men, and
children were executed in Europe for practicing witchcraft. Yet, scholars remain divided on how to
accurately account for this remarkable phenomenon. This course rests on two assumptions regarding
early modern European witchcraft beliefs and prosecutions: first, that they resist one single explana-
tion, and, second, that they must be seen as an integral part of European society rather than a strange
aberration. Thus, utilizing primary and secondary sources, we will examine how the peoples of early
modern Europe--rich and poor, lay and religious, female and male, educated and uneducated, rural
and urban--experienced witchcraft in their lives. As we proceed, we will pay close attention to the
ways in which the witchcraft phenomenon can inform our historical perspective on such issues as
gender relationships, "popular" and "elite" religion, modern state formation, demonology, magic, and
other important topics.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: class participation, three short essays (3-5 pages), a re-

HIST 338(F) The History of the Holocaust
In twenty-first century America, the murder of approximately six million European Jews by Nazi
Germany remains a central event in our political, moral, and cultural universe. Nevertheless, the Ho-
locaust still confounds historians' efforts to understand both the motivations of the perpetrators and
the suffering of the victims. In this course, we will study the origins and implementation of the Holo-
caust from the divergent perspectives of perpetrators and victims. Our goal will be to investigate deep-
ly the interaction of individual lives and world historical events. We will also examine the Holocaust
within the larger context of the history of World War II in Europe and the historians' debates about
Germany's exterminatory war aims. Course materials will include diaries, bureaucratic documents,
memoirs, films, and historical scholarship.

HIST 342(S) Creating Nations and Nationalism in Latin America*
As it emerged from Spanish and Portuguese colonial rule between the 1790s and 1890s, Latin Ameri-
ca spawned some of the earliest self-conscious nationalisms in the world. With particular emphasis on
the interplay of race and ethnicity, regional economic and political spaces, and gender identities, this
course will examine the construction and continuing life of the modern nations and nationalisms of
the region. The aim here is double. First, we will seek to understand the historical processes that
created nationalisms and nation-states in distinct cases, including Argentina, Mexico, Brazil, Nicara-
gua, Peru, and Chile. At the same time, we will use those individual country studies to revise or better

Brazil has been "the country of the future" longer than it has been an independent nation. This course
will introduce students to the many contradictions hinted at in that label--for beyond a patriotic boos-
terism, the phrase also suggests frustrations that Brazilians have felt, as their country failed to reach
what they considered its magnificent potential. While they can celebrate their World Cup victories or
the size of their economy (among the ten largest in the world, and heavily industrialized for a "devel-
oping nation"), they also have to acknowledge a series of troubling paradoxes: the mixture of fluidity
and hierarchy apparent in racial and gender relations; the persistence of political authoritarianism and
rampant social violence amidst struggles for citizenship; the endless inventiveness of Brazilian music,
religion, and futebol and government attempts to co-opt such forms of popular culture. Combining
cultural, political, and social analyses, we will examine a range of written texts and other sources to
understand these and other themes in the history of "the U.S. of South America."
Evaluation will be based on class participation, two short papers, and a longer (10-12 page) final

ly, in addition to the famous political, military, and constitutional struggles marking this period, we
will pay particular attention to the individual and collective actions and experiences of Euro-Ameri-

HIST 373(S) (formerly 177) Va Va Vroom!--A Nation on Wheels
Arguably the single most powerful agency shaping life in the United States since the beginning of the
twentieth century has been the automobile. Making cars go--building and maintaining them and the
systems they require--is by far the nation's largest industry. From cities and towns to the smallest
hamlets and the uninhabited wilderness beyond, the American landscape has been totally transformed
by the automobile. In a hardly less important vein, automobiles have left an indelible imprint on the
dreams we dream. They have also changed forever where we live; the way we rear our children; how
and what we consume; the demands we make on government; the crimes we commit; the way we
enforce the law--even the way we go to our graves. The course will consider this protein phenome-
non selectively and in detail. Readings will be drawn from a wide variety of sources.

HIST 374(F) American Medical History
This course will cover major themes in American medical history and historiography from the colo-

tion during the period we will study. Medical education, the medical profession, and notions about
cures and care changed fundamentally, as did ideas about the nature of illness itself. Our course of
study, in addition to charting ways in which the practice of medicine in America has developed, will
make an equal effort to understand how medicine has changed and affected American society. Topics
that we will investigate include cholera, TB, and childbirth in American society, as well as other medi-
cal phenomena.

trade to human trafficking and protected by their violent and extortionate methods. This course ex-
amines the rise and expansion of organized crime in Italy and the United States, as well as China,
Japan, and Russia, to explore how and why organized crime emerges in certain societies, what shapes
its development into sophisticated and powerful enterprises, and how it continues to exist. We will
also address how organized crime has inspired popular imaginations with ideas of a vast underworld
empire distinctly modern in business operations yet traditional in structure and codes of behavior.
Topics will include the transition from disorganized gangsterism to organized crime, its structure and
business enterprises, its influence on politics and economics, how certain organized crime groups rise
in certain cities, the impact of globalization on organized crime, myths about organized crime and its
history,and how portrayals of organized crime in popular cultures have changed over time.
Format: discussion/lecture. Evaluation will be based on class participation, one short paper (5 pages),

These are advanced courses normally limited in enrollment to fifteen students. Each seminar will
investigate a topic in depth and will require students to engage in research that leads to a substantial
piece of historical writing. All History majors are required to complete either an advanced seminar
(402-479) or a tutorial (480-492). Instructors may recommend prior coursework in the area of the
seminar. Preference given to senior History majors, followed by junior History majors.
ADVANCED SEMINARS: AFRICA AND THE MIDDLE EAST (402-411)
HIST 402T(S) African Political Thought (Same as African and Middle Eastern Studies 402T)
(W)*
This course examines the ideas of major figures in the progressive tradition of African political
thought. This emancipatory tradition emerged in societies shaped by racial, cultural, and economic
exploitation, forcing both African men and women to address questions of identity and political ac-
tion. Most members of this tradition also considered the ways in which uneven power relations within
African communities shaped the personal and political landscapes. The Africans we will examine in
this course drew on resources as varied as Pan-Africanism, Nationalism, Classical Liberalism, Social
Democracy, Marxism, Black Consciousness, Negritude and Gender theory, yet each participated, at
least implicitly, in a common African intellectual project: the meaning of Africa and of being African.
Format: tutorial. Evaluation will be based on class participation, weekly papers, and a 20- to 25-page

HIST 430(S) Toward a History of the Self in Nineteenth- and Twentieth-Century Europe
The self may appear to us as a fixed and stable entity that all people have in common throughout time.
However this course puts forward a different view, suggesting that the self is context-specific and sub-
ject to the culture and society of particular places and historical eras. Using a range of sources that
include historical writing, social theory, diaries, memoirs, film, and art, we will examine changing,
coexisting, and often conflicting notions of selfhood in Western and Central Europe. From the "indi-
vidualism" seemingly legitimated by the French Revolution to modern and postmodern conceptions
of the fragmented or decentered self, different narratives of the self have been elaborated during the
prior two centuries which continue to influence how we think about identity and subjectivity. Topics
covered in the course will include: autobiography and other forms of self-writing; the effects of new
technologies on understandings of time and space; the emergence of "mass man" and "psychological
man"; the metropolis; colonial encounters; and genocide. Throughout the course, we will investigate
the intersection of class, race, gender, sexuality, and religion in fashioning the self. Although the
course readings are drawn from the European context, students are encouraged to participate regard-
less of regional specialization and to conduct research in their area of interest for the final paper.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on active participation in class, an oral presentation, 2 pa-
pers based on course readings, and one final research paper.

HIST 435(F) A Comparative History of the First World War
The old saw "the twentieth century began in 1914" may seem tired, but, this course argues, it is not
only apposite, but merely hints at the enormous political, social, economic, and cultural importance of
the First World War for the combatant countries, and many non-combatant countries as well. To this
day, in countries such as France and Great Britain, even after the horrendous experience of the Second
World War, to speak of "the Great War" is to speak of the First World War. This course will thus ex-
amine the deep cultural resonance of the war that informs the books, films and television programs of
today, just as it did--though in different ways--the literature and art during and after the war. Yet the
course is not just a cultural enquiry. It aims to be "totalistic," examining equally the military, political,
economic, and social issues arising from the war. In this sense, the comparative perspective is critical:
to entertain thematically the broad issues in order to gain a greater perspective, but also to be aware of
the historical contexts of each combatant country. We will survey secondary and primary sources, as
well as contemporary and subsequent literature, fine arts, and film.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class participation, an oral presentation, three short pa-
pers, and a research paper.

While "race" and "ethnicity" have always played fundamental roles in shaping the course of Ameri-
can history and the image of American society, our understanding of the concepts of race and ethnicity
has often been less than clear. Our goal in this course is to determine and examine how Americans
History

have defined race and ethnicity at various points in our history and how these notions have been acted
out in policy, practice, and theory. Examples of the social and legal construction of race and ethnicity
will include white-Native American relations, slavery and its legacy, the "Yellow Peril," science and
race, and contemporary race relations.

HIST 471(F) Comparative Latina/o Migrations*
Policymakers, scholars, the media, and others are increasingly describing the world as "global" and
immigrant groups as "transnational." Yet, this course will ask to what extent these are recent develop-
ments or historically rooted phenomena. Similarly, the increasing popularity of the umbrella terms
"Hispanic" and "Latina/o" can mask widely divergent migration histories. In this course, we will de-
velop the theoretical perspectives needed to untangle a complicated web of differences and similari-
ties in migration histories. We will then use these migration histories to develop a comparative analy-
sis of the experiences of different Latina/o groups in the United States. For example, how do we ex-
plain differences in socioeconomic status or political perspectives? Our discussions will also address
the emergence of Latina/o Studies as an interdisciplinary and comparative field of study, as well as
methods used in studying Latino and Latina history, specifically oral histories, government docu-
ments, newspapers, and interdisciplinary approaches.
Format: seminar/discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation and presentations, a short

HIST 474(S) The History of Oil (Same as Environmental Studies 474)
Few discoveries have so fundamentally transformed the natural world and the organization of human
life as the discovery of oil. From our concern with global warning to the international conflicts regard-
ing the price and supply of petroleum, oil clearly occupies a central place in world politics and eco-
nomics today, not to mention in our daily lives. This course will investigate the history behind this
pre-occupation with oil production, focusing on several themes. First, we will explore how the explo-
ration for oil, as well as the technologies required for refining and transporting it, have altered the
natural environment. Second, we will examine the economic nature of oil exploration and in particu-
lar the boom-bust cycles that mark oil production. With this latter theme, we will investigate both how
domestic politics have revolved around oil in the United States, as well as how international politics
have been shaped by the problems of oil production.
Evaluation will be based on class participation, weekly critical writing, and a major research paper
(20-30 pages) based on primary documents.
Enrollment limited.

HIST 475(F) (formerly 356) Modern Warfare and Military Leadership
Since the late-eighteenth century, the history of the West has been marked by a number of enormously
destructive and decisive wars fought by nation-states on a continental and global scale. This era wit-
nessed dramatic changes in the size, armaments, organization, and lethal nature of military forces at
sea, on land, and, more recently, in the air, culminating in highly mechanized warfare, and its ultimate
weapon, the atomic bomb. This course will study that warfare, paying special attention to the role
military leadership played in its development. We will concentrate our attention on the Napoleonic
Wars, the American Civil War, World War I, and World War II, and such leaders as Napoleon, Lee and
History
­ 204 ­
Grant, Haig and Ludendorff, Churchill, Hitler, Stalin, Marshall, Eisenhower, and MacArthur. Do
these great leaders provide the key to our understanding of modern warfare? Or are certain "timeless"
principles, factors, and behaviors that consistently transcend local historical contexts more impor-
tant?
Format: seminar. Requirements: a substantial (no upper limit on length) research paper on a topic of
the student's choice growing out of some aspect of the course. Participants will, in teams of two or
three, lead class discussion at least once as well as give class reports on the course readings. There will
be several required films, and the class will also play some computerized historical wargames.

HIST 476(S) Apocalypse Now and Then: A Comparative History of Millenarian Movements
(Same as Religion 217)*
"The end is near!" Millions of people around the world believe that the course of history and the se-
quence of events that will herald the end of the world are foretold in their scripture, whether Judaic,
Christian, or Islamic. These beliefs can have, and have had, widespread social ramifications. This
seminar will explore various important political and religious movements that have responded to an
apocalyptic message by calling for drastic societal change. Both the social critique of these move-
ments and why they felt that the end was imminent will be analyzed. Special attention will be paid to
millenarian movements in the Middle East, North America, and Asia. Students will also assess apoca-
lyptic themes in music, literature and the visual arts.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on student presentations, group project, and a final paper.

ADVANCED TUTORIALS (480-492)
These are advanced reading and writing courses that offer an in-depth analysis of a topic in a tutori-
al format. Tutorials are limited in enrollment to ten students and preference given to senior History
majors. All History majors are required to complete either an advanced seminar (402-479) or a tutorial
(480-492). Instructors may recommend prior coursework in the area of the tutorial. The writing of five
of six essays and the oral presentation of five or six critiques of another student's essays are central to
tutorials.
HIST 482T(S) From Angkor to the Killing Fields: The History of Cambodia (W)*
This tutorial will trace the history of Cambodia from the Angkorian era starting in the eighth century
through the tragedy of Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge Holocaust, during which two million Cambodians
(more than 21% of the population) were murdered in an attempt to turn Cambodia into a Maoist, peas-
ant-led agrarian utopia. After establishing a basic understanding of the country's early history, we will
focus on understanding the series of events--French colonization in 1884, Cambodian independence
in 1953, the US's carpet bombing in 1969 and invasion (with South Vietnam) in 1970--that led to the
Khmer Rouge's takeover of Phnom Penh in April 1975. We will finish the course with the North Viet-
namese invasion of 1978 and Cambodia's attempts of the last 25 years to reestablish a sound and func-
tional polity. This course will use films, websites, survivors' accounts, and fiction, as well as conven-
tional histories to paint a multi-dimensional picture of this fascinating but understudied history.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: students will meet with the instructor in pairs for an hour each week.
Each student will write and present orally a 5- to 7-page essay every other week on the readings as-
signed for that week. In alternate weeks, students will be responsible for offering an oral critique of the
work of their partner. Students will be evaluated on their written work and their analyses of their part-
ner's work.

HIST 486T(F) Historical Memory of the Pacific War (W)*
Over half a century after Japan's surrender, the issue of how to remember the Pacific War continues to
raise controversy both within Japan and between Japan, Korea, and China. This tutorial will consider
how individuals, groups of individuals, and nations construct and reconstruct historical memories by
examining how various Japanese have sought to remember the Pacific War. In the first section of the
course, we will discuss theoretical writings on the psychology of memory, the social and political
construction of historical memory, and the distinctions between official, collective, and historical me-
mory. The second section will consider Japanese historical memory of the Pacific War, focusing on
how Japan's unique position as both wartime aggressor and victim has shaped debates over the por-
History, History of Science
­ 205 ­
trayal of the War in Japanese museums, movies, comic books, textbooks, and the Hiroshima peace
memorial park. The third section of the course will examine the mnemonic sites contested by Chinese,
Korean, and Japanese memories by discussing issues pertaining to military comfort women, the Rape
of Nanking, history textbooks, Yasukuni shrine, and the politics of apology. Themes will include how
the construction of memory is linked to the nation, how the passage of time influences the construc-
tion of historical memory, and the dilemmas of coming to terms with pasts contested both within and
between countries.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: students will meet with the instructor in pairs for an hour each week.

Professor: D. BEAVER. Advisory Committee: Professors: D. BEAVER, V. HILL.
A major in the History of Science is not offered, but the occasional Contract Major in it or a related
interdisciplinary field is possible. Courses in the History of Science are designed primarily to comple-
ment and strengthen work in other major fields. Although any of the courses may be taken separately,
studying related courses in other departments will enhance their value, because by nature, History of
Science is interdisciplinary.
History of Science
­ 206 ­
The following will serve as examples: the 101 course is an introduction to science and technology
studies, and concentrates on key aspects of contemporary science and technology relevant to many
issues of living in a technological society. Scientific Revolutions (HSCI 224) deals with the emergence
of modern science in the 1600s and 1700s, and with subsequent revolutions in scientific thought; as
such it complements courses related to modern European history. History of Science 240 traces the
influential role of science and invention in the shaping of American culture, and complements offer-
ings in American Studies and American History. HSCI 320, an historical overview of the ideas, prac-
tice, and organization of medicine, provides context for related coursework in History, Philosophy,
and the Premed Program.
HSCI 101(F) Science, Technology, and Human Values (Same as Science and Technology
Studies 101)
A study of the natures and roles of science and technology in today's society, and of the problems
which technical advances pose for human values. An introduction to science-technology studies.
Topics include: scientific creativity, the Two Cultures, the norms and values of science, the Manhattan
Project and Big Science, the ethics and social responsibility of science, appropriate technology,
technology assessment, and various problems which spring from dependencies engendered by living
in a technological society, e.g., computers and privacy, automation and dehumanization, biomedical
engineering.
Format: seminar. Requirements: two or three short exercises, two papers (3-5 pages and 5-10 pages),
and a final exam.
Enrollment limit: 25.

HSCI 224(S) Scientific Revolutions: 1543-1927 (Same as History 294)
How much does science create the sensibilities and values of the modern world? How much, if any,
technical detail is it necessary to know in order to understand the difference between propaganda and
fact?
This course investigates four major changes of world view, associated with Copernicus (1543); New-
ton (1687); Darwin (1859); and Planck (1900) and Einstein (1905). It also treats briefly the emergence
of modern cosmogony, geology, and chemistry as additional reorganizations of belief about our ori-
gins, our past, and our material structure.
We first acquire a basic familiarity with the scientific use and meaning of the new paradigms, as they
emerged in historical context. We then ask how those ideas fit together to form a new framework, and
ask what their trans-scientific legacy has been, that is, how they have affected ideas and values in other
sciences, other fields or thought, and in society. Knowledge of high-school algebra is presupposed.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on five problem sets, two short papers (3-5
pages), and two hour exams.
Enrollment limit: 45. Open to first-year students.

HSCI 240(F) Technology and Science in American Culture (Same as History 295)
Although technologically dependent, the American colonies slowly built a network of native scientists and
inventors whose skills helped shape the United States' response to the Industrial Revolution. The interac-
tion of science, technology, and society in the nineteenth century did much to form American identity: the
machine in the garden, through the "American System of Manufactures" helped America rise to techno-
logical prominence; the professionalization and specialization of science and engineering led to their be-
coming vital national resources. Understanding these developments, as well as the heroic age of American
invention (1865-1914), forms the focus of this course: how science and technology have helped shape
modern American life.
Format: seminar. Requirements: class discussion, six short reports (1-2 pages), and a final exam.
Open to first-year students.
Satisfies one semester of the Division II requirement.

HSCI 320(S) History of Medicine (Same as History 293)
A study of the growth and development of medical thought and practice, together with consideration
of its interaction with science and social forces and institutions. The course aims at an appreciation of
the socio-historical construction of Western medicine, from prehistory to the twentieth century. The
course begins with paleomedical reconstructions, and moves to Babylonian, Egyptian and Greek [not
only Hippocratic] medicine, Greek and Roman anatomy and physiology, Arabic medical thought,
Renaissance medicine, and the gradual professionalization and specialization of medicine from the
sixteenth century. Attention is paid to theories of health and disease, ideas about anatomy and physiol-
ogy, in addition to achievements such as anesthesia and internal surgery, and advances in instruments
such as obstetrical forceps and the stethoscope.

INTR 105(F) Latina/o Identities: Constructions, Contestations, and Expressions*
What, or who, is a Hispanic or Latina/o? This course examines this question by exploring the diversity
of the populations referred to by these terms, as well as the complex nature of "identity." Viewing
identities as historically and socially constructed, we begin with a brief assessment of how racial, eth-
nic, class, and gendered identities take shape in the Hispanic Caribbean and Latin America. We then
examine the impact of migration and the rearticulation of identities in the United States. Identity is
also a contested terrain. As immigrants and migrants arrive, United States' policymakers, the media,
and others seek to define the "newcomers" along with long-term Latina/o citizens. At the same time,
Latinas/os rearticulate, live, assert, and express their own sense of identities. We conclude the course
with an exploration of those many and diverse expressions.
Format: discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, several short writing assignments
(1-2 pages), and three short papers (5-7 pages).

INTR 259(F) Society, Culture and Disease
Disease is one of the basic forces behind the growth, shape and vitality of human societies. Recogniz-
ing that understanding the effects of disease upon culture and society requires an approach that tran-
scends traditional academic disciplines, this course will examine the nature and importance of disease
from several perspectives. Focusing on the intersection of biology, economics and cultural study, we
will confront some of the most difficult and important issues of our time. How do we decide which
diseases deserve the resources required for vaccine development? Who gets the vaccine? In other
Interdepartmental Program
­ 208 ­
words, who lives, and who dies? How do we decide the value of a human life? How do we understand
and heal the wounds, individual and cultural, deriving from our confrontation with disease--with the
AIDS epidemic, for instance? In what ways has disease, as an agent of change, been a beneficial force
in our history? How do we define "health"? What, exactly, is disease? In exploring these issues, we
will use a number of different formats, including lecture, discussion, tutorial sessions, and guest lec-
turers. Texts studied will range from the scientific to the literary, and might include formal academic
papers, poetry, plays, films, historical works and cultural studies.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, several short papers, and a
final essay.

INTR 264(S) Dramatic Expression in Opera (Same as Music 218 and Theatre 218)
Devotees regard opera as the supreme collaborative art. At the same time others see operatic produc-
tion simply as the occasion for stilted and formulaic dramatic performances. This course is an
introduction to operatic performance, experimenting with acting and staging techniques that work to
release the full expressive potential of musical theatre. It will combine exercises in acting techniques
with vocal coaching, and work towards achieving a synthesis of acting and singing that encourages
students to test the limits of their physical and imaginative resources. Although the class will deal with
some critical and analytical works on opera production, the focus will be on class exercises and the
performance of operatic scenes, both solo and in ensemble. As an interdisciplinary workshop, the
course will test common misconceptions about the physical limitations imposed by vocal expression,
and will encourage singers to transcend realistic acting models entirely inadequate for the intense
physical and spiritual engagement that the operatic art demands. At the same time, we are committed
to Joseph Kerman's notion that, in opera, "music is the medium that bears the ultimate responsibility
for articulating drama," so that experimentation with acting techniques in an operatic scene will al-
ways be informed by a close analysis of the music that inspires it.
Format: interdisciplinary workshop. Evaluation will be based on class participation, interim and final
projects
Prerequisites: auditions and permission of instructors. Enrollment limit: 12. Preferences based on
auditions.

INTR 273(F) Sacred Geographies (Same as Anthropology 273 and Religion 273)*
Bringing together insights from anthropology, art history, and religious studies, this course will ex-
plore the geography of sacred space: the spatial organization of meaning across time and the world as
humans have again and again made a division between sacred and profane. We will attend to this pro-
cess as expressed in the geography, social dynamics, and architecture of sacred space, noting patterns
of similarity and difference among and between the "little traditions" of folk and traditional societies
as well as the "great traditions" of universalist and modern societies. Having developed an analytical
vocabulary for understanding sacred space, we will put our model in motion by examining the dy-
namics of change, redefinition, and contestation that have so often surrounded the history of sacred
spaces.
The course begins by introducing students of theoretical models derived from our several disciplines,
enabling them to understand the form and character of sacred spaces. Authors to be read may include
Eliade, Bachelard, van Gennep, Metcalf, Tuan, Durkheim, Lefebvre, and Harvey. We will develop
analytical tools for interpreting the meaning and aesthetics of sacred space as it is constituted in the
natural landscape (e.g., sacred mountains, rivers, trees, etc.) artificially-constructed places (e.g., tem-
ples, monuments, shrines, etc.) and the intersection of the two. We will pay particular attention to the
ways boundaries around sacred spaces are created, maintained, and violated, as well as passages to
and from sacred places (e.g., pilgrimage).
Once these interpretive tools have been developed, we will turn our attention to the ways in which
religious and political conflict are both aggravated and mediated through sacred space. Specific pro-
cesses to be examined include: exile and diaspora--what happens when a people are cut off from their
sacred space; contestation over sacred space in places like Jerusalem and the Babri Mosque in India;
supercession in which a late-coming tradition marks its relation to earlier traditions, as in the construc-
tion of the Mexican national cathedral on the ruins of an Aztec temple in the heart of Mexico City;
colonization, as in the creation of new mosques in British and American cities; and cooperation, in
which a sacred space allows for the establishment of links between competing groups and divided
ideologies, as in Mecca or monuments such as the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. We will conclude
with attention to the role of these four processes in contemporary society, where diaspora, contesta-
tion, supercession and cooperation continue to have wide relevance for articulating the character of
social conflict, reconciliation, and change.

INTR 307(F) Art and Justice (Same as ArtS 311 and Political Science 301) (W)
Although Plato dismissed painters as unreliable imitators who invariably lead viewers "far from the
truth," art has played an important role in the creation and transformation of political belief through-
out human history. This class is an interdisciplinary examination of that role, focusing especially,
though not exclusively, on the problem of how the visual arts advance and hinder the pursuit of justice.
Although the relevant visual materials span diverse periods, areas, media, and cultural traditions, we
will pay special attention to recent and contemporary American art, particularly to public art and self-
consciously political works that seek to contest prevailing institutions, norms, and social structures.
The course, then, will offer an in-depth introduction to certain aspects of contemporary art practice,
but the point of our examination is to pursue broader and more fundamental questions about art, poli-
tics, and the relationship between them. Here are some of the most important that we will consider:
How does one "read" an image and determine how it "works"? How do individuals and organizations
use imagery to mold and mobilize opinion? How does the specific kind of activity or creation called
"art" reflect and/or shape political life? What does it offer those seeking, exercising, or contesting
political power? Are such uses of art inherently more manipulative than verbal arguments over poli-
cies and political principles? Or does art have important ways of showing us things we might not
otherwise see? Can it make our political imaginations more generous? Can it bring us closer to jus-
tice? What would claiming this entail? Authors and artists considered may include Arai, Arendt, Dan-
to, Edelman, Fusco, Grand Fury, the Guerrilla Girls, Hall, Kant, Kruger, Lacy, Luna, Piper, Plato,
Rockwell, Sontag, Walker, Wodiczko and others.
Format: seminar. Requirements: regular short written critical analyses, one long independent project,

This class is designed to enhance awareness about democracy issues. It covers classic arguments
about relations within civil society, formal governmental arrangements, the availability and utility of
popular suffrage, and practices that threaten full implementation. The course responds to the assump-
tion that democracy, though widely valued, is not a finished project. The class will draw on the experi-
ences in the U.S.--routinely put forth as an advanced democracy--to identify themes and problems
in the premier democratic state with a record of discord. It will also examine some of the emerging
work in civil society and the unique efforts around democracy in southern hemispheric locations and
post-colonial states. As befits a course on democracy, this will be participatory.

Science describes the natural world as very different from what it appeared to be when the world's
major religions first developed. The universe no longer seems to revolve in eternal circles around our
particular place in space and time. Ever more complex and beautiful physical and biological struc-
tures evolve through an intricate interplay of chance, choice and natural law toward an uncertain dis-
tant future. Should the way science describes the natural world affect our ideas about religious experi-
ence? Should our ideas about religion affect our ideas about science? Are religion and science neces-
sarily in conflict? Are they essentially separate? Do they complement each other? In this course we
will explore the origins and development of religion. Next, we will explore the rise of science, the
evolution of our understanding of how science works, and the rise and fall of deterministic, reduction-
istic interpretations of the natural world. We will review the ways in which science and religion have
related to each other historically. We will explore contemporary ways of thinking about their relation-
ship, drawing our scientific examples from our current understanding of quantum uncertainty and
non-locality, from cosmology, and from evolutionary biology. The religion and science relevant to
our explorations will be presented by written materials, demonstrations, guest instructors, and ani-
mated interactive computer movies.

Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection forms the backbone of the life sciences, yet its rele-
vance for the behavioral sciences has been appreciated only recently, and remains controversial. In
this course, we will explore the burgeoning area of "evolutionary psychology," a field in which evolu-
tionary theory is used as a framework for understanding psychological phenomena. Students will gain
an appreciation of contemporary evolutionary theory and consider how (and how well) that theory
can lend itself to the study of human behavior and cognition. We will consider comparative evidence
from a variety of species (e.g., insects, birds, and non-human primates--as well as humans) and dis-
cuss avariety of objections to and critiques of evolutionary psychology. As part of the course, students
will have an opportunity to conduct original research in the area.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class participation, daily thought papers, research pro-
posal, and a written/oral report on research.

This course examines the contemporary history of Latina/o visual culture and explores the various
relations between cultural expression, identity formation, and public representation. We will begin by
considering the critical and aesthetic practices that emerged in the context of civil rights actions and
nationalist movements, which often focused on issues of visibility, self-representation, and autonomy.
The topics of immigration, transnationalism, and the "Latinization" of the United States will then be
analyzed in depth as we examine representations of and representations by Latina/os in film and tele-
vision, the visual arts, advertising, and other forms of popular media. Throughout the course, we will
investigate the role of visual culture in determining taste and trends as well as shaping notions of be-
longing and cultural citizenship.

THE PROGRAM IN JEWISH STUDIES
Jewish Studies describes the academic field concerned with the experience and culture of the Jew-
ish people. Covering a wide temporal and geographical range, Jewish Studies embraces both the wa-
ters of Babylon and the tenements of the Lower East Side. The subject cuts across numerous fields
including Ancient Near Eastern Studies, Religion, Classics, History, Anthropology, Sociology, Art
History, English, Middle Eastern Studies, Hebrew, Women's and Gender Studies, American Studies,
Comparative Literature, Romance Languages and Literature, German and Russian Studies, and Polit-
ical Science. Jewish Studies as a subject and object of scholarly inquiry is more than 100 years old,
emerging, as did the study of religion in general, in the context of nineteenth century efforts to make
religious texts open to scientific and especially historical forms of investigation.
Williams offers a variety of courses specifically directed to students interested in Jewish Studies. In
addition, many other courses incorporate topics relevant to the study of Judaism. Students are encour-
aged to integrate courses from diverse disciplines with a focus in Jewish history, religion, literature,
language, and thought. Thus, rather than emphasizing a particular method of inquiry, Jewish Studies
courses bring together students from different departments who share an interest in a common topic.
As a result, Jewish subjects are analyzed from a multitude of perspectives (religious, philosophical,
political, historical, psychological, literary, etc.). Williams offers two types of courses related to Jew-
ish Studies: Courses directly focusing on Jewish topics and courses partially devoted to some aspect
of Judaism. Most courses in Jewish Studies are open to all students without prerequisites. The specific
catalogue entry for each course should be checked for details. The concentration in Jewish Studies is
recommended for students interested in a sustained intellectual experience in the field.
CONCENTRATION IN JEWISH STUDIES
The concentration in Jewish Studies serves two primary functions. First, it provides a formal struc-
ture enabling students to develop knowledge of the history, thought, texts, and practices of the Jewish
people. Second, students will learn to apply this competency to the analysis of issues related to Jewish
Studies emerging from disciplinary perspectives. Through the Jewish Studies concentration, students
will be able to examine topics according to the methods particular to majors as well as in comparison
with other disciplinary approaches. Thus, Jewish Studies enhances one's specific knowledge of Ju-
daica and the general capacity to think interdisciplinarily.
Students wishing to concentrate in Jewish Studies must take 5 courses with at least 2 different pre-
fixes: 1 core course, 2 required courses, 1 elective, and 1 capstone course.
Core Course
[Jewish Studies 101/Religion 203 Introduction to Judaism] (required of all concentrators)
Required Courses
Students must take two required courses, one from Group I and one from Group II. There will be
offerings from the visiting Croghan Professor and other visiting professors. These may fulfill the core
requirements with approval from the Jewish Studies Advisory Committee. Only one Winter Study
course may be used to satisfy this requirement.

Students may meet the elective requirement with one of the courses partially related to Jewish Stud-
ies or another course from Group I or II. Since the elective requirement enables students to situate
issues in Jewish Studies within a broader disciplinary context, the elective must be taken after REL/
CLAS 203 and simultaneously with or after at least one core course. In a course partially related to
Jewish Studies, a student will normally focus at least one of the major writing assignments on a topic
relevant to Jewish Studies or approximately one-third of the course will be devoted to Jewish subjects.
The list of relevant electives changes constantly so the course catalogue should be checked for details.

Croghan Professorship
Each year, in addition to the regular course offerings listed above, Williams sponsors the Croghan
Bicentennial Visiting Professor in Religion who offers one course in Judaism and/or Christianity. Past
Croghan Professors have taught courses on the Mishnah (Shaye Cohen), the historical Jesus (John
Dominic Crossan), and Ancient Mediterranean Religions (Ross Kraemer).
Overseas Studies
Studying in Israel is highly recommended for students interested in Jewish Studies. Many students
have spent a semester or year at Hebrew University. With the approval of the Jewish Studies coordina-
tor, students may count a study-abroad program towards one core requirement.
Funding
The Bronfman Fund for Judaic Studies was established in 1980 by Edgar M. Bronfman `50, Samu-
el Bronfman II `75, and Matthew Bronfman `80. The Bronfman Fund provides opportunities for the
Williams community to learn about Jewish history and culture, both within the College's formal cur-
riculum and through the planning of major events on Jewish themes.
The Morris Wiener and Stephen R. Wiener `56 Fund for Jewish Studies was established in 1997
through the estate of Stephen R. Wiener `56. The Wiener gifts have provided an endowment to sup-
port a faculty position in modern Jewish thought, and are used to underwrite an annual lecture, forum
or event relevant to contemporary Jewish life.

Leadership Studies focuses on the universal phenomenon of leadership in human groups. Leader-
ship Studies asks what leadership means within a wide variety of social contexts-whether in a family,
a team, a theatre company, a philanthropy, a university, a multinational corporation, or a nation state
waging war. It seeks to understand the dynamics of the relationships between leaders and followers. It
studies authority, power, and influence. It seeks to grasp the bases of legitimacy that leaders claim, and
followers grant, in all of these relationships.
Through a wide range of courses in the social sciences and the humanities, a number of questions
are addressed through the curriculum. How have men and women defined leadership and what are the
bases of leaders' legitimacy in different historical contexts? How do leaders in different contexts
emerge? Through tradition, charisma, or legal sanction? How do different types of leaders exercise
and maintain their domination? What are the distinctive habits of mind of leaders in different histori-
cal contexts? What are the moral dilemmas that leaders in different contexts face? What are the typical
challenges to established leadership in different historical contexts? How does one analyze the experi-
ences of leaders in widely disparate contexts to generate systematic comparative understandings of
why history judges some leaders great and others failures. How and why do these evaluations about
the efficacy of leaders shift over time?
To meet the requirements of the concentration, students must complete the sequence outlined be-
low (6 courses total). Students must take their two core courses from different departments. At least
one of the core courses must be at the 300 or 400 level.

Leadership has long been a central concept in the study of politics. Philosophers from Plato to Ma-
chiavelli have struggled with the question of what qualities and methods are necessary for effective
leadership. Social scientists throughout the twentieth century have struggled to refine and advance
hypotheses about leadership in the areas of economics, psychology, and sociology. Nevertheless, de-
spite all of this impressive intellectual effort, the study of leadership remains a contested field of study
precisely because universal answers to the major questions in leadership studies have proven to be
elusive. This course is designed to introduce students to many of the central issues and debates in the
area of leadership studies.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: a midterm and final exam and 2 short papers.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 30 (expected: 30). Preference given to first-year students and
sophomores.

LEAD 212(S) Sister Revolutions in France and America (Same as French 212 and History
393)
In the late-eighteenth century, two revolutions burst forth-they were the most striking and consequen-
tial events in modern history, decisive turning-points that transformed society and politics. This
course takes an interdisciplinary approach to the study of the overarching ideas and visions of the sis-
ter revolutions. Through works of literature, correspondence, political essays and speeches, we will
seek to understand the fundamental goals and accomplishments of both revolutions. Who were their
leaders and according to what principles did they govern? Did revolutionaries in France find a model
in America for their Revolution? What is the meaning of the "Terror" in France and what light does it
shed on modern revolutionary movements? Why was the American Revolution followed by decades
of stability while the French Revolution bequeathed a turbulent succession of failed governments?
Have America and France continued to conceive of themselves as revolutionary nations? We will
read works by the following historians, novelists, and politicians: Rousseau, Robespierre, Saint-Just,
Michelet,Tocqueville, Victor Hugo, Edmund Burke, Thomas Paine, James Madison, Alexander
Hamilton, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, David B. Davis, and Hannah Arendt. Films on revolution
by Renoir, Wajda, Gance and others will be viewed. Students with a reading knowledge of French are
encouraged to read French texts in the original.
Format: seminar. Requirements: several papers and active participation in all class discussions.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15 (expected: 15). Preference given to students with backgrounds
in American history, French history or Political Science.
Satisfies one semester of the Division II requirement.
Hour: 1:10-3:50 W DUNN
LEAD 285(F) The Revolutionary Generation: Galaxy of Leaders (Same as Political
Science 285)
The American Revolution produced a galaxy of brilliant politicians and statesmen of extraordinary cour-
age, intellect, creativity, and character. They succeeded in drafting an unparalleled Constitution and estab-
lishing enduring democratic political institutions while nevertheless failing to grapple with the wrenching
issue of slavery and the rights of women. In this course, we will explore the lives, ideas, and political lead-
ership of these men, most of whom belonged to the social elite of their day:Washington, Madison, Jeffer-
son, Adams, Franklin, and Hamilton. We will study in depth their superb writings, such as the correspon-
dence between Madison and Jefferson and between John Adams and his wife Abigail, and Madison's and
Hamilton's Federalist essays. We will also read recent interpretations of the founding generation by Gor-
don Wood, Joseph Ellis, Edmund Morgan, Bernard Bailyn, and others.
Format: seminar. Requirements: three papers, four class presentations.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15 (expected: 15). Preference given to students with a background in
American History or Political Science.
Satisfies one semester of the Division II requirement.

LEAD 402(S) Domains of Leadership
A seminar on leadership in various domains, with emphasis on the application of general theoretical
principles of leadership. Students will meet periodically to discuss common readings on leadership
theory but also devote a large part of the semester to independent study. The independent work will be
conducted with the instructor and, when appropriate, other faculty in the program, and will be dis-
cussed in the seminar. Students may elect to do independent work in groups of two or three.
Evaluation will be based on class participation and a major paper or set of shorter papers.

LEGAL STUDIES (Div. II)
Chair, Professor SAUL KASSIN
Advisory Committee: Professors: JACKALL, JACOBSOHN***, JUST, KAPLAN, KASSIN. Asso-
ciate Professor: NOLAN.
Legal Studies is an interdisciplinary program designed to give students a background and frame-
works for understanding the law as a means of regulating human behavior and resolving disputes
among individuals, groups, and governments. Emanating from a liberal arts tradition, and not specifi-
cally aimed at preparing students for law school, this program provides the tools needed to think and
argue critically about how laws work, how they evolved in the course of history and in different parts
of the world, how they are enforced, and how they affect our everyday lives.
The courses in this program address a wide range of subjects, including the philosophical, moral,
historical, social, and political underpinnings of law; the U.S. Constitution; law enforcement and oth-
er aspects of criminal justice; methods of scientific proof; psychological influences on evidence,
trials, and decision-making; cultural perspectives and non-western legal traditions; and the use of law
to regulate environmental policy. Courses are taught by faculty in the Sciences, Social Sciences, and
Humanities, whose work centers on legal processes, and by visiting professors from various law
schools.
THE CONCENTRATION
The concentration in legal studies consists of six courses, including an interdisciplinary introducto-
ry course, four electives taken from at least two departments, and a senior seminar on a contemporary
topic in the law. Electives may vary from year to year according to course offerings. In addition, the
program offers local, alumni, and professional contacts for summer and WSP internships in a wide
range of government and private law-related settings.
REQUIRED COURSES
LGST 101(S) Processes of Adjudication
How are disputes resolved within social systems? Focused on this question, this interdisciplinary
course presents different perspectives on trials and other methods of adjudicating crimes, settling mat-
ters of public policy, and resolving civil disputes among individuals, groups, governments, and orga-
nizations. Topics to be addressed include the historical and Constitutional bases for juries and jury
trials; alternative means of adjudication, as seen in American drug courts and military tribunals; ad-
versarial, inquisitorial, and consensus-building approaches to dispute resolution used in past and non-
western cultures; methods of gathering and evaluating evidence; the role of forensic sciences and
technology.
Format:lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on two exams, a 10- to 15-page paper, and class
participation.
Enrollment limit: 50.
This is an interdisciplinary course to be team-taught by faculty, from a variety of departments.
Hour: 2:35-3:50 MR KAPLAN
LGST 397(F), 398(S) Independent Study
Open only to upperclass students under the supervision of a member of the Legal Studies Advisory
Committee.
LGST 401(S) The Cultural Study of Law
In the United States, the rule of law refers to more than a set of substantive norms and political proce-
dures. Law speaks more broadly to the identity of the citizen and his or her understanding of the
polity-its history and its future. At stakes is an entire world view, at the core of which is the belief that
the rule of law is rule by the popular sovereign. This seminar explores the unique nature of this world
created and maintained by the American legal imagination.
Legal Studies, Linguistics
­ 217 ­
Topics include law's time and space, the nature of legal authority, law's relationship to justice, the
judicial role, violence and the limits of law, and legal hermeneutics. Readings are interdisciplinary,
including specifically legal texts as well as works in legal and political theory.
Format: seminar. Requirements: active class participation, regular preparation of short discussion
points for class, and a final paper.
Prerequisites: Legal Studies 101 and at least two Legal Studies electives. Enrollment limit: 25 (ex-
pected: 20-25). Preference given, in order of seniority, to students for whom this course completes the

LINGUISTICS (Div. I)
Coordinator, Assistant Professor: NATHAN SANDERS
Courses in linguistics enable students to explore language from a variety of perspectives: the inter-
nal workings of language as a system of communication, the physical means by which speech is pro-
duced, the role of language in society, the history of language groups and specific languages, and the
applicability of scientific knowledge about language to various human endeavors.
Linguistics offers neither a major nor a concentration, but its courses provide a solid grounding in
formal linguistics and complement study in several other disciplines: Anthropology, Philosophy,
Psychology, Cognitive Science, Sociology, English, Comparative Literature, and all the foreign lan-
guages. Anthropology majors can receive major credit for Linguistics 101. Majors in German Studies
may receive major credit for a linguistics course with the special permission of the department chair.
Knowledge of foreign languages is helpful but not required for introductory linguistics courses.
LING 101(F) Introduction to Linguistics (Same as Anthropology 107)
This course is a general introduction to the scientific study of language, particularly its theoretical
debates, methodology, and relationship to other disciplines. With this aim in mind, we will examine
the analytic methods and major findings of various subfields of linguistics, including phonetics,
phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, and language change. The course will focus on issues in
language and society. These may include such topics as dialects, American Sign Language, the ac-
quisition of language, and the official English language movement. By the end of the course, you
should be acquainted with systematic methods of studying language, be aware of the fundamental
similarities and startling diversity of human languages, and have an informed perspective on how is-
sues of language have an impact on our society.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: participation in discussions, weekly homework, a mid-
term exam, and a final exam.
No prerequisites. No enrollment limit (expected: 25).
Hour: 1:10-2:25 MR SANDERS
LING 111(S) Articulatory and Acoustic Phonetics (Q)
Phonetics is the study of human speech sounds. This course emphasizes the International Phonetic
Alphabet, a standardized system of transcribing speech. Students learn to recognize, describe, tran-
scribe, and produce speech sounds from languages all over the world. This course also covers phonet-
ic analysis of speech, including patterns of sounds within and across languages, the acoustic proper-
ties of the speech signal, and how and why the mouth moves the way it does when we speak.

LING 121(S) The Syntactic Structure of English (Same as English 122) (W)
This course is an introduction to a rigorous, scientific approach to language study. No previous train-
ing in linguistics is assumed. A better understanding of the structure of English and of language in
general will proceed by way of class discussion and homework problems. These problems will be
designed to involve students in observation and analysis of linguistic data and in the construction and
testing of syntactic theories. The homework will require time and careful attention and will usually be
rather challenging.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: participation in discussions and about 30 pages of writing
in the form of weekly essay-style homework of 2-5 pages each.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 15).
Hour: 1:10-2:25 TF SANDERS
LING 131(F) Introduction to Logic and Semantics (Same as Philosophy 131) (Q)
This course is an introduction to both formal logic and the study of linguistic meaning. Throughout the
course, a formal system of logic will be developed, and its adequacy for describing linguistic meaning
will be tested. Topics to be covered include the meaning of words and sentences, first-order predicate
logic, logical deduction, interpretation and understanding, and context.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: participation in discussions, weekly homework, two mid-
term exams, and a final essay.
No prerequisites. No enrollment limit (expected: 20).

MAJOR
The major in Mathematics is designed to meet two goals: to introduce some of the central ideas in a
variety of areas of mathematics and statistics, and to develop problem-solving ability by teaching stu-
dents to combine creative thinking with rigorous reasoning.
Students are urged to consult with the department faculty on choosing courses appropriate to an
individualized program of study.
REQUIREMENTS (nine courses plus colloquium)
Calculus (two courses)
Mathematics 104 Calculus II
Mathematics 105 or 106 Multivariable Calculus
Except in unusual circumstances, students planning to major in mathematics should complete the calcu-
lus sequence (Mathematics 103, 104, 105) before the end of the sophomore year, at the latest.
Applied/Discrete Mathematics/Statistics (one course)
Mathematics 209 Differential Equations and Vector Calculus or
Mathematics 210 Mathematical Methods for Scientists (Same as Physics 210)
Mathematics 251 Discrete Mathematics or
Statistics 201 Statistics and Data Analysis or

a more advanced elective in discrete or applied mathematics or statistics, with prior departmental ap-
proval: Mathematics 305, 306, 315, 346, 354, 361, 433, 452, or any Statistics course 300 or above or an
appropriate course from another department as listed in the notes below.
Notes: Mathematics 251 is required in Computer Science, and Mathematics 209 is recommended in
other sciences, but double majors should understand that no course may count toward both majors.
Core Courses (three courses)
Mathematics 211 Linear Algebra
Mathematics 301 Real Analysis or Mathematics 305 Applied Real Analysis
Mathematics 312 Abstract Algebra or Mathematics 315 Groups and Characters
Completion (three courses plus colloquium)
The Senior Major Course is any 400-level course taken in the senior year. In exceptional circum-
stances, with the prior permission of the department, a student may be allowed to satisfy the Senior
Major Course requirement in the junior year, provided that the student has completed three 300-lev-
el mathematics courses before enrolling in the Senior Major Course (if it is a statistics seminar, one
of the 300-level courses may be replaced by Statistics 201).
Two electives from courses numbered 300 and above or Statistics 201.
Weekly participation as a senior in the Mathematics Colloquium, in which all senior majors present
talks on mathematical or statistical topics of their choice.
NOTES
In some cases, an appropriate course from another department may be substituted for one of the
electives, with prior permission of the Mathematics and Statistics Department. In any case, at least
eight courses must be taken in mathematics and statistics at Williams. These can, with prior permis-
sion, include courses taken away. Students with transfer credit should contact the department about
special arrangements.
APPLIED MATHEMATICS OR OTHER SCIENCES
Students interested in applied mathematics or other sciences, including economics, should consid-
er Mathematics 209, 210, 251, 305, 306, 315, 323, 342, 354, 361, 433, or Statistics 201, 231, 346, 442,
and additional appropriate courses from outside Mathematics and Statistics, including possibilities
such as Chemistry 301, Computer Science 256, Computer Science 361, Economics 255, Physics 201,
Physics 202, Physics 210 or more advanced physics courses.
Mathematics and Statistics
­ 220 ­
BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Students interested in careers in business or finance should consider Mathematics 170, as well as
courses in statistics and related areas such as Statistics 101, 201, 231, 331, 344, 346, 442, 443. Since
these courses address different needs, students should consult with the instructors to determine which
seem to be most appropriate for individuals.
ENGINEERING
Students interested in engineering should consider the courses for applied mathematics immediately
above, with Mathematics 209 and 305 especially recommended. Williams has exchange and joint pro-
grams with good engineering schools. Interested students should consult the section on engineering near
the beginning of the Bulletin and the Williams pre-engineering advisor for further information.
GRADUATE SCHOOL IN MATHEMATICS
Students interested in continuing their study of mathematics in graduate school should take Mathe-
matics 301 and 312. Mathematics 302 and 324 are strongly recommended. Many of the 400-level
courses would be useful, particularly ones that involve algebra and analysis. Honors theses are en-
couraged. Reading knowledge of a foreign language (French, German, or Russian) is helpful.
STATISTICS AND ACTUARIAL SCIENCE
Students interested in statistics or actuarial science should consider Mathematics 341, Statistics
201, 231, 331, 346, 442 and Economics 255. Additionally, students should consider taking some
number of the actuarial exams given by the Society of Actuaries, which can constitute part of an hon-
ors program in actuarial studies (see section on honors below).
TEACHING
Students interested in teaching mathematics at the elementary or secondary school level should
consider Mathematics 285, 313, 325, 381, Statistics 201 and practice as a tutor or teaching assistant.
Winter study courses that provide a teaching practicum are also highly recommended.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN MATHEMATICS/STATISTICS
The degree with honors in Mathematics/Statistics is awarded to the student who has demonstrated
outstanding intellectual achievement in a program of study which extends beyond the requirements of
the major. The principal considerations for recommending a student for the degree with honors will
be: Mastery of core material and skills, breadth and, particularly, depth of knowledge beyond the core
material, ability to pursue independent study of mathematics or statistics, originality in methods of
investigation, and, where appropriate, creativity in research.
An honors program normally consists of two semesters and a WSP (031) of independent research,
culminating in a thesis and a presentation. Under certain circumstances, the honors work can consist
of coordinated study involving a regular course and one semester plus a WSP (030) of independent
study, culminating in a "minithesis" and a presentation. At least one semester should be in addition to
the major requirements.
An honors program in actuarial studies requires significant achievement on four appropriate ex-
aminations of the Society of Actuaries and giving a second colloquium talk. Written work is a possible
component.
Highest honors will be reserved for the rare student who has displayed exceptional ability, achieve-
ment or originality. Such a student usually will have written a thesis, or pursued actuarial honors and
written a minithesis. An outstanding student who writes a minithesis, or pursues actuarial honors and
writes a paper, might also be considered.
Prospective honors students are urged to consult with their departmental advisor at the time of reg-
istration in the spring of the sophomore or at the beginning of the junior year to arrange a program of
study that could lead to the degree with honors. By the time of registration during spring of the junior
year, the student must have requested a faculty member to be honors advisor and must have obtained
the department's approval of formal admission to the honors program. Such approval depends on both
the record and the promise of the applicant. It is conditional on continuing progress.
The recommendation for honors is usually announced at the end of the spring term. Participation in
the honors program does not guarantee a recommendation for honors. The decision is based not only
on successful completion of the honors program but also on the merit of the student's overall record in
mathematics. If the student completes the program during the fall or winter study, the decision may be
announced at the beginning of the spring term, conditional on continuing merit.
ADVANCED PLACEMENT
The Mathematics and Statistics Department attempts to place each student who elects a mathemat-
ics course in that course best suited to the student's preparation and goals. The suggested placement in
an appropriate calculus course is determined by the results of the Advanced Placement Examination
(AB or BC) if the student took one, and any additional available information. A student who receives a
3, 4, or 5 on the BC examination or a 4 or 5 on the AB examination is ordinarily placed in Mathematics
105. A student who receives a 1 or 2 on the BC examination or a 2 or 3 on the AB examination is
ordinarily placed in Mathematics 104. Students who have had calculus in high school, whether or not
Mathematics and Statistics
­ 221 ­
they took the Advanced Placement Examination, are barred from Mathematics 103 unless they obtain
permission from the instructor. Students who take an Advanced Placement Exam in statistics should
consult the department for placement. In any event, students registering for mathematics and statistics
courses are urged to consult with members of the department concerning appropriate courses and
placement. In general, students are encouraged to enroll in the most advanced course for which they
are qualified: it is much easier to drop back than to jump forward. The department reserves the right to
refuse registration in any course for which the student is determined to be over-prepared.
GENERAL REMARKS
Divisional Requirements
All courses may be used to satisfy this requirement.
Alternate Year Courses
Core courses Mathematics 301, 305, 312, and 315 are normally offered every year. Other 300-level
courses may be offered in alternate years. Senior seminars (400-level courses) are normally offered
every two to four years. Students should check with the department before planning far into the future.
Course Admission
Courses are normally open to all students meeting the prerequisites. Students with questions about
the level at which courses are conducted are invited to consult members of the department.
Course Descriptions
Descriptions of the courses in Statistics follow the descriptions of Mathematics courses. More de-
tailed information on all of the offerings in the department is available in the Informal Guide to Mathe-
matics Courses at Williams that can be obtained at the departmental office.
Courses Open on a Pass/Fail Basis
Students taking a mathematics or statistics course on a pass/fail basis must meet all the require-
ments set for students taking the course on a graded basis.
With the permission of the department, any course offered by the department may be taken on a
pass/fail basis. Permission will not be given to mathematics majors to meet any of the requirements of
the major or honors degree on this basis. However, with the permission of the department, courses
taken in the department beyond those requirements may be taken on a pass/fail basis.
Graduate School Requirements
An increasing number of graduate and professional schools require mathematics and statistics as a
prerequisite to admission or to attaining their degree. Students interested in graduate or professional
training in business, medicine, economics, or psychology are advised to find out the requirements in
those fields early in their college careers.
MATHEMATICS COURSES
NOTE: STATISTICS COURSE LISTINGS FOLLOW THE MATHEMATICS COURSE
LISTINGS.
MATH 100(F) Quantitative Studies
This course is intended for all students--(first-year students and upperclass students)--who want to
strengthen their basic arithmetic and algebraic skills, and to understand the central concepts of ele-
mentary mathematics. Topics will include: signed numbers, fractions, decimals, percentages, expo-
nents, logarithms, scientific notation, polynomials, algebraic fractions, linear and quadratic equa-
tions, and graphing. Concepts will be stressed in classroom lectures and discussions; techniques will
be developed through daily assignments.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on performance on quizzes and exams.
Prerequisites: permission of instructor. No enrollment limit (expected: 6).
Depending on his or her performance on the diagnostic test administered at the beginning of the aca-
demic year, a student may be required to take Mathematics 100 or Mathematics 101 as a prerequisite
for Biology 101, Chemistry 151, Chemistry 153, Chemistry 155, Computer Science 134, Economics
110 or 120, Mathematics 103, Statistics 101, or Physics 131, 141. However, a student need not be
planning to take one of these additional courses in order to take Mathematics 100 or 101.

MATH 101(F,S) Pre-Calculus
The elementary functions--algebraic, logarithmic, and trigonometric--from both a graphical and
analytic point of view.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on homework, quizzes, and/or exams.
Prerequisites: permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 15 (expected: 15).
Hour: 10:00-10:50 MWF, 11:00-11:50 MWF First Semester: S. JOHNSON
9:00-9:50 MWF Second Semester: BURGER
MATH 103(F,S) Calculus I (Q)
Calculus permits the computation of velocities and other instantaneous rates of change by a limiting
process called differentiation. The same process also solves "max-min" problems: how to maximize
Mathematics and Statistics
­ 222 ­
profit or minimize pollution. A second limiting process, called integration, permits the computation of
areas and accumulations of income or medicines. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus provides a
useful and surprising link between the two processes. Subtopics include trigonometry, exponential
growth, and logarithms. This is an introductory course for students who have not seen calculus before.
Students who have previously taken a calculus course may not enroll in MATH 103 without the per-
mission of instructor.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on homework, quizzes, and/or exams.
Prerequisites: Mathematics 101 (or demonstrated proficiency on a diagnostic test; see Mathematics
101). No enrollment limit (expected: 50-60).
Hour: 9:00-9:50 MWF First Semester: O. BEAVER
10:00-10:50 MWF Second Semester: O. BEAVER
MATH 104(F,S) Calculus II (Q)
Mastery of calculus requires understanding how integration computes areas and business profit and
acquiring a stock of techniques. Further methods solve equations involving derivatives ("differential
equations") for population growth or pollution levels. Exponential and logarithmic functions and trig-
onometric and inverse functions play an important role. This course is the right starting point for stu-
dents who have seen derivatives, but not necessarily integrals, before. Students who have received the
equivalent of advanced placement of AB 4 or BC 3 may not enroll in Mathematics 104 without the
permission of instructor. Students who have higher advanced placement must enroll in Mathematics
105 or above.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on homework, quizzes, and/or exams.
Prerequisites: Mathematics 103 or equivalent. No enrollment limit (expected: 50-70).

MATH 105(F,S) Multivariable Calculus (Q)
Applications of calculus in mathematics, science, economics, psychology, the social sciences, in-
volve several variables. This course extends calculus to several variables: vectors, partial derivatives,
multiple integrals. There is also a unit on infinite series, sometimes with applications to differential
equations. This course is the right starting point for students who have seen differentiation and in-
tegration before. Students with the equivalent of advanced placement of AB 4, BC 3 or above should
enroll in Mathematics 105.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on homework, quizzes, and/or exams.
Prerequisites: Mathematics 104 or equivalent, such as satisfactory performance on an Advanced
Placement Examination. No enrollment limit (expected: 45).

MATH 106(F) Multivariable Calculus (Q)
Applications of calculus in mathematics, science, economics, psychology, the social sciences, in-
volve several variables. This course extends calculus to several variables: vectors, partial derivatives
and multiple integrals. The goal of the course is Stokes Theorem, a deep and profound generalization
of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. The difference between this course and Math 105 is that
Math 105 covers infinite series instead of Stokes Theorem. Students with the equivalent of BC 3 or
higher should enroll in Mathematics 106, as well as students who have taken the equivalent of an inte-
gral calculus and who have already been exposed to infinite series. For further clarification as to
whether or not Math 105 or Math 106 is appropriate, please consult a member of the math/stat depart-
ment. Credit will not be given for both Mathematics 105 and Mathematics 106.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on homework, quizzes, and/or exams.
Prerequisites: BC 3 or higher or integral calculus with infinite series. No enrollment limit (expected:

MATH 170(F,S) Mathematics of Finance (Q)
This course investigates the mathematics underlying various problems that arise in personal, consum-
er, and business finance. Topics include simple and compound interest, periodic loans (such as home
mortgages and auto loans), present value, future value, bank discounting and rediscounting, amortiza-
tion, sinking funds, corporate and municipal bonds, perpetual annuities, taxes (including itemization),
life annuities, depreciation, inflation, and the basic mechanics of life insurance. Students are required
to carry out several spreadsheet projects; instruction on the use of these systems is provided as needed.
Although the course does not prepare students for the examinations of the Society of Actuaries, it is
basically actuarial in approach, not a course in "how to invest."

MATH 209(S) Differential Equations and Vector Calculus (Q)
Historically, much beautiful mathematics has arisen from attempts to explain heat flow, chemical
reactions, biological processes, or magnetic fields. A few ingenious techniques solve a surprisingly
large fraction of the associated ordinary and partial differential equations. The mystical Pythagorean
fascination with ratios and harmonics is vindicated and applied in Fourier series and integrals. Inte-
grating vectorfields over surfaces applies equally to blood flow, gravity, and differential geometry.

MATH 211(F,S) Linear Algebra (Q)
Many social, political, economic, biological, and physical phenomena can be described, at least
approximately, by linear relations. In the study of systems of linear equations one may ask: When does
a solution exist? When is it unique? How does one find it? How can one interpret it geometrically?
This course develops the theoretical structure underlying answers to these and other questions and
includes the study of matrices, vector spaces, linear independence and bases, linear transformations,
determinants and inner products. Course work is balanced between theoretical and computational,
with attention to improving mathematical style and sophistication.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on homework and exams.

MATH 211T(S) Mathematical Reasoning and Linear Algebra (Q)
This tutorial aims to develop students' problem-solving and proof-writing techniques in mathematics
through the use of linear algebra. It is also an introduction to linear algebra, with an emphasis on its
conceptual development and the beauty of its mathematical structure. There will be weekly assign-
ments requiring clearly written proofs of theorems and facts in linear algebra, and expecting the level
of independent study of a tutorial. The topics to be covered are matrices, vector spaces, linear indepen-
dence, linear transformations, orthonormal bases, inner product spaces, and some applications such
as fractals and linear regression.
Note: This course fulfills the same requirements as Mathematics 211 but credit will not be given for
both Mathematics 211T and Mathematics 211.

MATH 285(S) Teaching Mathematics (Q)
Under faculty supervision, student-teachers will prepare and conduct scheduled weekly extra ses-
sions for calculus, for smaller, assigned groups of students. For these sessions they will prepare pre-
sentations, assign and grade homework, and answer questions on the course material and on the
homework. They will be available to their students outside of class, attend and assist at calculus lec-
tures (3 hours a week), and visit and evaluate each other's sessions. There is a busy weekly meeting,
for an hour or two, including organizational matters, deeper study of the calculus, and practical teach-
ing skills. There will be assigned readings, discussion, drills, and weekly homework or papers. The
student-teachers will participate in the design and review of exams, weighing the importance and dif-
ficulty of questions, and observing the kinds of mistakes the students make.
Format: lecture/seminar/teaching. Evaluation will be based on the overall teaching activity, responsi-
bility, participation in the seminar and other meetings, homework and papers.

MATH 301(F) Real Analysis (Q)
Real analysis is the theory behind calculus. It is based on a precise understanding of the real numbers,
elementary topology, and limits. Topologically, nice sets are either closed (contain their limit points)
or open (complement closed). You also need limits to define continuity, derivatives, integrals, and to
understand sequences of functions.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on homework, classwork, problem sets, and ex-

MATH 305(S) Applied Real Analysis (Q)
In this course, we will take a more rigorous look at the limit, the integral, and how they interact. This
will give us the background to explore Fourier series and possibly Fourier integrals. Fourier series are
fundamental in the study of many differential equations, such as the wave equation and the heat equa-
tion.

MATH 312(S) Abstract Algebra (Q)
Algebra gives us the tools to solve equations. Sets such as the integers or real numbers have special
properties which make algebra work or not work according to the circumstances. In this course, we
generalize algebraic processes and the sets upon which they operate in order to better understand,
theoretically, when equations can and cannot be solved. We define and study the abstract algebraic
structures called groups, rings and fields, as well as the concepts of factor group, quotient ring, homo-
morphism, isomorphism, and various types of field extensions.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on problem sets and exams.

MATH 313(F) Introduction to Number Theory (Q)
This course provides an introduction to the theory of numbers. Here we will examine classical issues
involving prime numbers, divisibility, and the general structure of numbers. Various applications and
consequences will be discussed. In addition, we shall examine the real and complex numbers and also
numbers which are neither real nor complex. These new numbers are called p-adic numbers and are
very interesting and important. Although many of these issues go back to the dawn of humanity, here
Mathematics and Statistics

Hour: 11:00-11:50 MWF BURGER
MATH 314(S) Polynomial Arithmetic (Q)
Polynomials play an important role in mathematics, particularly in number theory. The desire to find
solutions to polynomials over the integers led to the study of numbers such as the square root of 2 and
the cube root of 5. Polynomials themselves behave like integers in many ways. Although number
theory is typically thought of as the study of the integers, most number-theoretic questions about the
integers can be reformulated in terms of polynomials. In fact, sometimes the answers are much easier
to discover for the polynomials. In this course, we'll examine the arithmetic properties of polynomials
over a finite field including the analogy with the integers.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on problem sets, projects, and exams.

MATH 315(F) Groups and Characters (Q)
An introduction to group theory with emphasis on topics having applications in the physical sciences;
greater attention is paid to examples and to the application of theorems than to the more difficult
proofs. Topics include symmetry groups, group structure (especially properties related to order), rep-
resentations and characters over the real and complex fields, space groups (chemistry), matrix groups
(physics).

MATH 323(F) Applied Topology (Q)
In topology, one studies properties of an object that are preserved under rubber-like deformations,
where one is allowed to twist and pull, but one cannot tear or glue. Hence a sphere is considered the
same as a cube, but distinct from the surface of a doughnut. In recent years, topology has found ap-
plications in chemistry (knotted DNA molecules), economics (stability theory), Geographic Informa-
tion Systems, cosmology (the shape of the Universe), medicine (heart failure), robotics and electric
circuit design, just to name some of the fields that have been impacted. In this course, we will learn the
basics of topology, including point-set topology, geometric topology and algebraic topology, but all
with the purpose of applying the theory to a broad array of fields.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on problem sets and exams.

MATH 327(S) Geodetic Surfaces (Q)
Geodetic surfaces are studied in geodetic science, the science of Earth measurements. They are determined
directly or indirectly by measurements and models of the Earth's gravity, distribution of mass, magnetic
properties, topography and other phenomena that cover large areas or even encompass the whole planet.
Data for analyzing the surface is obtained using diverse instruments, from Global Positioning Systems
(GPS), to radar measurements taken from the space shuttle, all the way down to surveying done on the
ground. These point-set measurements are then used by computer algorithms and mesh-building graphics
software to reconstruct the surfaces. This is a beautiful subject with a tremendous amount of active re-
search, relating powerful ideas from mathematics, elegant tools from computer science, and concrete data
from geodetic science. This course is designed to introduce fundamental ideas of this subject, such as cur-
vature, polyhedral geometry, V
oronoi diagrams, Delaunay triangulations, and combinatorial topology, pos-
sibly touching on advanced topics such as noise handling, Morse theory, and smoothing. We will work
with theoretical tools as well as actual data sets using the Cocone software. This course is intended for
students interested in mathematics, physics, engineering, and computer science.

MATH 335T(F) Biological Modeling with Differential Equations (Same as Biology 235T) (Q)
Many biological phenomena can best be examined through fairly sophisticated mathematical models.
In particular, differential equation models have been used to explain fluctuations in food webs, the
spread of disease, consequences of certain fishing practices, immune system response to infection,
spatial distribution of species, formation of zebra stripes, and flux across cell membranes. We will
introduce the mathematical machinery needed for these models, including the theory of ordinary dif-
ferential equations, phase portrait dynamics, and partial differential equations. We will establish the
biological assumptions that go into these models and examine the consequent dynamics. Students will
work in pairs covering material and explaining it to one another, presenting worked problems, and
critiquing each others presentations.

MATH 341(S) Probability (Q)
The historical roots of probability lie in the study of games of chance. Modern probability, however, is
a mathematical discipline that has wide applications in a myriad of other mathematical and physical
sciences. Drawing on classical gaming examples for motivation, this course will present axiomatic
and mathematical aspects of probability. Included will be discussions of random variables (both dis-
crete and continuous), distribution and expectation, independence, laws of large numbers, and the
well-known Central Limit Theorem. Many interesting and important applications will also be pres-
ented, including some from classical Poisson processes, random walks and Markov Chains.

MATH 426(S) Hyperbolic 3-Manifolds (Q)
3-manifolds are objects that locally look 3-dimensional, the spatial universe being an excellent exam-
ple. For the last 100 years, mathematicians have tried to determine all the possible 3-manifolds and
means for distinguishing between them. In 1978, William Thurston stated the Geometrization Con-
jecture, which essentially says that any 3-manifold can be cut into pieces, each of which has one of
eight geometries. The pieces with seven of the geometries have been completely determined. But the
pieces that have hyperbolic geometry, the so-called hyperbolic 3-manifolds, remain unclassified. This
is because here is where all the action is, where the richest structure lies. Here is where geometry col-
lides with topology. In this course, we will investigate hyperbolic 3-manifolds, from their beginnings
in 1978 to the current research going on today.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based on problem sets, oral presentation and exams.

MATH 433(S) Mathematical Modeling and Control Theory (Q)
Mathematical modeling is concerned with translating a natural phenomenon into a mathematical
form. In this abstract form the underlying principles of the phenomenon can be carefully examined
and real-world behavior can be interpreted in terms of mathematical shapes. The models we investi-
gate include feedback phenomena, phase locked oscillators, multiple population dynamics, reaction-
diffusion equations, shock waves, morphogenesis, and the spread of pollution, forest fires, and dis-
eases. Often the natural phenomenon has some aspect we can control--such as how much pollution,
electric charge, or chemotherapeutic agent we put into a river, circuit, or cancer patient. We will inves-
tigate how to operate such controls in order to achieve a specific goal or optimize some interpretation
of performance. We will employ tools from the fields of differential equations and dynamical systems.
The course is intended for students in the mathematical, physical, and chemical sciences, as well as for
students who are seriously interested in the mathematical aspects of physiology, economics, geology,
biology, and environmental studies.

STATISTICS COURSES
STAT 101(F,S) Elementary Statistics and Data Analysis (Q)
It is nearly impossible to live in the world today without being inundated with data. Even the most
popular newspapers feature statistics to catch the eye of the passerby, and sports broadcasters over-
whelm the listener with arcane statistics. How do we learn to recognize dishonest or even unintention-
ally distorted representations of quantitative information? How are we to reconcile two medical stud-
ies with seemingly contradictory conclusions? How many observations do we need in order to make a
decision? It is the purpose of this course to develop an appreciation for and an understanding of the
interpretation of data. We will become familiar with the standard tools of statistical inference includ-
ing the t-test, the analysis of variance, and regression, as well as exploratory data techniques. Applica-
tions will come from the real world that we all live in.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on performances on quizzes and exams.
Prerequisites: Mathematics 100 (or demonstrated proficiency on a diagnostic test; see Mathematics

STAT 201(F,S) Statistics and Data Analysis (Q)
Statistics can be viewed as the art (science?) of turning data into information. Real world decision-
making, whether in business or science is often based on data and the perceived information it con-
tains. Sherlock Holmes, when prematurely asked the merits of a case by Dr. Watson, snapped back,
"Data, data, data! I can't make bricks without clay." In this course, we will study the basic methods by
which statisticians attempt to extract information from data. These will include many of the standard
tools of statistical inference such as the t-test, analysis of variance and linear regression as well as
exploratory and graphical data analysis techniques.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on performance on quizzes and exams.

STAT 231(F) Statistical Design of Experiments (Q)
What does statistics have to do with designing and carrying out experiments? The answer is, surpris-
ingly perhaps, a great deal. In this course, we will study how to design an experiment in order to obtain
the most information from it in the fewest number of observations. The efficient design of experi-
ments is important not only in the sciences: it has been credited for helping Japanese industry achieve
its success. The examples from this course will be primarily from the physical sciences and industry,
but will apply to the biological and to some extent the social sciences as well. The culmination of the
course will be a project where each student designs, carries out, analyzes, and presents an experiment
of interest to him or her.
Evaluation will be based primarily on performance on the project, homework, and exams.

methods. We will study both the mathematics of regression analysis and its applications, including a
discussion of the limits to such analyses. The applications will range from predicting the quality of a
vintage of Bordeaux wine from the weather to forecasting stock prices, and will come from a broad
range of disciplines.

In both science and industry today, the ability to collect and store data can outpace our ability to ana-

today's data bases and data warehouses. New methodologies in Statistics have recently been devel-
oped, designed to address these inadequacies, emphasizing visualization, exploration and empirical
model building at the expense of traditional hypothesis testing. In this course we will examine these
new techniques and apply them to a variety of real data sets using Silicon Graphics workstations.
Evaluation will be based primarily on homeworks and projects.

Department strongly recommends that students elect at least one course from each group.
It is strongly recommended that prospective majors complete Music 104, 201, 202, and 207 by the
end of the sophomore year.
Performance and Concert Requirements
Music majors are encouraged to participate in departmental ensembles throughout their careers at
Williams; i.e., for eight semesters. Majors are required to participate in departmental ensembles for at
Music
­ 230 ­
least four semesters. The student must petition to meet this requirement in an alternative way. Music
majors are also expected to attend departmentally-sponsored concerts.
Foreign Languages
Music majors are strongly urged to take courses in at least one foreign language while at Williams.
Musicianship Skills
Music majors are strongly urged to maintain, refine and improve their musicianship skills, such as
sight-singing, score reading, melodic and harmonic dictation, and keyboard proficiency, throughout
their entire Williams career.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN MUSIC
Three routes toward honors and highest honors are possible in the Music major:
a. Composition: A Composition thesis must include one major work completed during the senior year, a
portfolio of smaller works completed during the junior and senior years, and a 10- to 15-page discus-
sion of the student's work.
b. Performance: A Performance thesis must include an honors recital given during the spring of the
senior year and a 15- to 20-page discussion of a selection of the works performed. The student's
general performance career will also be considered in determining honors.
c. History, Theory and Analysis, or Ethnomusicology: A written Historical, Theoretical/Analytical, or
Ethnomusicological thesis between 65 and 80 pages in length and an oral presentation based on the
thesis is required. A written thesis should offer new insights based on original research.
To be admitted to the honors program, a student must have at least a 3.3 GPA in Music courses (this
GPA must be maintained in order to receive honors), and have demonstrated ability and experience
through coursework and performance in the proposed thesis area. A 1- to 2-page application to the
honors program, written in consultation with a faculty member, must be made to the chair of Music
before or during spring registration in the junior year.
Honors candidates must enroll in Music 493(F)-W031-494(S) during their senior year. A student
who is highly qualified for honors work, but who, for compelling reasons, is unable to pursue a year-
long project, may petition the department for permission to pursue a thesis over one semester and the
winter study term. If granted, the standards for evaluating the thesis in such exceptional cases would
be identical to those that apply to year-long honors projects. Final submission of the thesis must be
made to the Music Department by April 15 of the senior year. The department's decision to award
honors will be based on the quality of the thesis.
LESSONS
Courses involving individual vocal or instrumental instruction involve extra fees which are subsi-
dized by the department. (See Music 251-258 and Studies in the Musical Art 325, 326, 427, 428). For
further information contact the Department of Music.

100-LEVEL COURSES
MUS 101(F) Listening to Music: An Introduction
Intended for non-major students with little or no formal training.
When you listen to music--on the radio, on a CD, at a concert--how much do you really hear? This
course has two goals: to refine listening skills, thus increasing the student's understanding and enjoy-
ment of music, while at the same time providing a survey of the major composers and musical styles
of the Western classical repertory to be encountered in concert halls today. Students will be introduced
to music from the Baroque, Classical, Romantic, and Modern periods, including works by composers
such as Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Brahms, Mahler, and Stravinsky. Genres to be covered include the
symphony, chamber music, opera, song, and choral music. Attendance at selected concerts on campus
required.
Evaluation will be based on two tests, two concert reports, and a final exam.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 40.

MUS 111(F) Popular Music: Revolutions in the History of Rock
This course will trace the history of rock music from the 1950s to the present, focusing on those musi-
cians who revolutionized the genre in various periods. Such "revolutions" are discovered in the use of
new sounds and musical forms, in the relationship between lyrics and musical setting, and in the con-
ception of rock's role in society. Three objectives will underpin our studies: to develop listening skills
with music that one often hears, but perhaps rarely listens to intently; to determine in what ways popu-
lar music can be interpreted as reflecting its cultural context; and to encounter the work of several of
the more innovative musicians in the history of rock. Finally we will interrogate our own activities by
asking why the study of the "merely popular" should be pursued in a liberal arts education, whether
new approaches can be developed for this endeavor, and what makes music "popular."
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on two tests, two papers, and a final exam.
No prerequisites or musical background assumed. Enrollment limit: 80.

MUS 135(F) Isn't it Good, Norwegian Wood?: Storytelling in Music
The Beatles' song "Norwegian Wood" tells the story of a mysterious encounter between a man and a
woman that either does or does not culminate in sex and/or arson. How do the music and lyrics interact
to communicate the dramatic events, emotions, and characters of the song? More generally, how have
stories been told in music through the centuries, and why do some narratives retain a grip on our imag-
ination? Even without text, music can relate compelling narratives, such as the heroic struggle for
transcendence suggested by Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. What purely musical means do composers
employ to tell stories?
This course explores a broad range of archetypal narratives communicated in music: tales of unre-
quited love and star-crossed lovers; heroic transcendence and Faustian bargains; conflict, murder and
revenge; and exotic and comic tales. Genres covered include chant, madrigals, opera, song cycles,
concertos, symphonies, tone poems, musicals, film, and ballet, as well as popular ballads from coun-
try and western, the blues, and rock 'n roll.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on attendance and participation, several short
quizzes and papers, and a final exam.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 30 (expected: 30). Preference given by class year (will seek a bal-
ance of under- and upperclassmen) and interest in music.

study and some transcription required.
Evaluation will be based on the successful completion, rehearsal and performance of original arrange-
ments and/or compositions during the semester, to include at least one transcription of a recorded ar-
rangement, one quintet or sextet arrangement, and one arrangement for big band. Performances by the
Jazz Ensembles, as rehearsed and prepared by the students of this course, are also expected.
Prerequisites: Music 212 and permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 6 (expected: 4-6). Preference
given to students who meet the prerequisites and show a strong interest in the subject matter.

MUS 218(S) Dramatic Expression in Opera (Same as INTR 264 and Theatre 218)
Devotees regard opera as the supreme collaborative art. At the same time, operatic production is seen
by others simply as the occasion for stilted and formulaic dramatic performances. This course is an
introduction to operatic performance, experimenting with acting and staging techniques that work to
release the full expressive potential of musical theatre. It will combine exercises in acting techniques
with vocal coaching, and work towards achieving a synthesis of acting and singing that encourages
students to test the limits of their physical and imaginative resources. Although the class will deal with
some critical and analytical works on opera production, the focus will be on class exercises and the
performance of operatic scenes, both solo and in ensemble.
As an interdisciplinary workshop, the course will test common misconceptions about the physical
limitations imposed by vocal expression, and will encourage singers to transcend realistic acting
models entirely inadequate for the intense physical and spiritual engagement that the operatic art de-
mands. At the same time, we are committed to Joseph Kerman's notion that, in opera, "music is the
medium that bears the ultimate responsibility for articulating drama," so that experimentation with
acting techniques in an operatic scene will always be informed by a close analysis of the music that
inspires it.
Format: interdisciplinary workshop. Evaluation will be based on class participation, interim and final
projects
Prerequisites: auditions and permission of instructors. Enrollment limit: 12. Preferences based on

MUS 232T(S) Latin Music USA (W)*
From the nineteenth century until today, the most important foreign influence on popular culture in the
USA has been the music and dance traditions of Latin America, especially those from Cuba, Puerto
Rico, The Dominican Republic, Brazil, Argentina, and Mexico. These music and dance traditions
have enriched North American culture and served as a means by which Latinos and non-Latinos have
communicated different meanings to different people at different times. This tutorial examines the
history of Latin music and dance traditions in the United States, analyzing the meanings communi-
cated and assessing the impact of these traditions on American culture and vice versa. Although the
focus of this course is music, students may examine related dance forms.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: take-home hour exam (15%), 5 papers presented in class (80%), class
participation (5%), no final exam.
Prerequisites: permission of instructor; students wishing to take this course should email the profes-
sor. Enrollment limit: 10. Preference based on major and materials submitted.

400-LEVEL COURSES
MUS 402(S) Senior Seminar in Music
Franz Schubert reached artistic maturity during the initial phase of musical Romanticism, Johannes
Brahms during the latter phase. The relation between the two composers illuminates critical features
of this aesthetic period. Brahms cherished Schubert's music and shared many of his passions and pre-
occupations: folksong, dance, nature, childhood, love, memory, nostalgia, dreams, and death. Both
composers were awed by Beethoven's monumentality, sought a balance between tradition and in-
novation in form and harmony, and explored the relation between song and instrumental music. But
there were important differences as well. Through comparative study of Schubert's and Brahms's
works, careers, and critical reception, this seminar will explore core qualities of Romantic expres-
sion--some persisting throughout the century, others evolving. Using a number of analytical and in-
terpretive approaches, students will study works from an array of genres, e.g., Lieder, piano pieces,
chamber music, choral works, and symphonies.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on participation, frequent short papers, class presentations,
and a final research project.

Neuroscience is a rapidly growing interdisciplinary field concerned with understanding the relationship
between brain, mind, and behavior. The interdisciplinary nature of the field is apparent when surveying
those who call themselves neuroscientists. Among these are anatomists, physiologists, chemists, psycholo-
gists, philosophers, computer scientists, linguists, and ethologists. The areas that neuroscience addresses
are equally diverse and range from physiological and molecular studies of single neurons, to investigations
of how systems of neurons produce phenomena such as vision and movement, to the study of the neural
basis of complex cognitive phenomena such as memory, language, and consciousness. Applications of
neuroscience research are rapidly growing and include the development of drugs to treat neurodegenera-
tive disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, the development of noninvasive tech-
niques for imaging the human brain such as PET scans and MRI, and the development of methods for
repair of the damaged human brain such as the use of brain explants. Combining this wide range of disci-
plines, areas of research, and application for the study of a single remarkably complex organ--the brain--
requires a unique interdisciplinary approach. The Neuroscience Program is designed to provide students
with the opportunity to explore this approach.
THE PROGRAM
The program in neuroscience consists of five courses including an introductory course, three elec-
tives, and a senior course. In addition, students are required to take two courses, Biology 101 and
Psychology 101, as part of the program.
Introduction to Neuroscience (Neuroscience 201) is the basic course and provides the background
for other neuroscience courses. Ideally, this will be taken before the end of sophomore year. Either
Biology 101 or Psychology 101 serves as the prerequisite. Electives are designed to provide in-depth
coverage including laboratory experience in specific areas of neuroscience. At least one elective
course is required in Biology (Group A) and one in Psychology (Group B). The third elective course
may also come from Group A or Group B, or may be selected from other neuroscience related courses
upon approval of the advisory committee. Topics in Neuroscience (Neuroscience 401) is designed to
provide an integrative culminating experience. Most students will take this course in the senior year.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN NEUROSCIENCE
The degree with honors in Neuroscience provides students with the opportunity to undertake an
original research project under the supervision of one or more of the Neuroscience faculty. In addition
Neuroscience
­ 239 ­
to completing the requirements of the Neuroscience Program, candidates for an honors degree must
enroll in Neuroscience 493-W031-494 and write a thesis based on an original research project. Pre-
sentation of a thesis, however, should not be interpreted as a guarantee of a degree with honors. Stu-
dents interested in pursuing a degree with honors should contact the Neuroscience Advisory Commit-
tee in the spring of their junior year.

NSCI 401(S) Topics in Neuroscience
Neuroscientists explore issues inherent in the study of brain and behavior. The overall objective of this
seminar is to create a culminating senior experience in which previous course work in specific areas in
the Neuroscience Program can be brought to bear in a synthetic, interdisciplinary approach to under-
standing complex problems. The specific goals for students in this seminar are (1) to evaluate original
research and critically examine the experimental evidence for theoretical issues, and (2) to gain an
understanding of this discipline through group work, and oral presentations. Topics and instructional
formats will vary somewhat from year to year, but in all cases the course will emphasize an integrative
approach in which students will be asked to consider topics from a range of perspectives including
molecular, cellular, systems, behavioral and clinical neuroscience. Previous topics have included
memory, autism, depression, alcoholism, language development, and stress.
Format: student-led discussions and presentations, three hours a week. Evaluation will be based on
presentations, participation in class discussion, and a term paper.
Prerequisites: open only to seniors in the Neuroscience program. Enrollment limit: 24 (expected: 10).
This course is required of all senior students in the Neuroscience program.

PERFORMANCE STUDIES

Performance Studies provides an opportunity to inhabit a place where the making of artistic and
cultural meaning intersects with critical reflection on those processes. The program has as its primary
goal the bringing together of those students and faculty engaged in the creative arts, i.e., studio art,
creative writing, dance, film and video, music, and theater with those departments that reflect in part
on those activities, e.g., Anthropology and Sociology, Art History, Classics, foreign languages, Com-
parative Literature,English, History, Music, Philosophy, Psychology, Religion and Theater.
The program allows faculty and students to conduct intensive and focussed interdisciplinary stud-
ies in performance. The central ideas which performance studies confronts--action, body, frame, rep-
resentation, race, ethnicity, gender, politics, history and transcultural experience--circulate within
and through the subjects and fields upon which the program draws.
Students in Performance Studies are encouraged to do four things: 1) take Theatre 328, Approach-
ing Performance Studies; 2) try different artistic media, both in the curriculum and beyond; 3) move
between the doing of art and performance and thinking about that process; and 4) prepare a portfolio
of their work in different media. The list of courses below is divided between doing courses (practical)
and reflection/criticism courses. Voluntary portfolios are entirely optional. What we suggest is that
portfolios should draw on at least four projects or productions. They should show critical self-reflec-
tion on the creative processes, a comparison of the artistic media employed and also demonstrate per-
formance criticism on the work of others. Preparation of the portfolio should normally begin in the
second semester of the junior year. It will be done under the supervision of a member of the advisory
committee and will be presented in the senior year to faculty and students interested in the program.

PHILOSOPHY (Div. II)
Chair, Professor JANA SAWICKI
Professors: GERRARD, SAWICKI, WHITE***. Assistant Professors: BARRY, CLARKE, CRUZ*,
DUDLEY**, MLADENOVIC, WILBERDING. Visiting Assistant Professor: J. PEDRONI. Visit-
ing Part-time Lecturer: MUENCH.
To engage in philosophy is to ask a variety of questions about the world and our place in it. What
can we know? What should we do? What may we hope? What makes human beings human? These
questions, in various forms, and others like them are not inventions of philosophers; on the contrary,
they occur to most people simply as they live their lives. Many of us ask them as children, but later
either ignore them, or accept answers we can live with. Philosophers, however, seek to keep such
questions open, and to address them through reasoned discussion and argument, instead of accepting
answers to them based on opinion or prejudice.
The program in philosophy is designed to aid students in thinking about these issues, by acquaint-
ing them with influential work in the field, past and present, and by training them to grapple with these
issues themselves. The program emphasizes training in clear, critical thinking and in effective writing.
Philosophy courses center around class discussions and the writing of interpretive and critical essays.
MAJOR
Philosophy is a discipline with a long and intricate history, a history that remains an integral part of
the discipline. In this way, it differs dramatically from the natural sciences: for example, although no
contemporary physicists or biologists embrace Aristotle's physics or biology, among philosophers
there continue to be champions of Aristotle's metaphysics and of his ethics. Because of the richness
and continuing importance of the history of philosophy, the program is designed to give majors a his-
torical background that will acquaint them with a wide variety of approaches in philosophical issues,
and will provide them with a basis for evaluating and contributing to contemporary debates.
A total of nine courses is required for the major in Philosophy. Students should begin with Philoso-
phy 101 and 102, in either order; both are required for the major. These courses provide introductions
to historical figures and themes that continue to be influential in many contemporary discussions in
the two major areas of philosophical inquiry, i.e., practical inquiry into issues of ethics and politics,
and theoretical inquiry into issues of knowledge, belief, understanding, and reality. The final required
course is the Senior Seminar, Philosophy 401. Each student selects the six electives that complete the
major. The exposure to figures and topics in 101 and 102 provides students with some basis for choice,
but optimal shaping of an individual curriculum requires in addition consultation with faculty mem-
bers and other students.
Generally speaking, as students progress from 100- to 300-level courses, there will be decreasing
breadth and increasing depth. In addition, writing assignments become longer, and students assume
increasing responsibility for identifying and developing the topics of their essays. Finally, students in
300-level courses are often required to assume responsibility for making oral presentations or guiding
significant parts of class discussions.
Students considering graduate study in philosophy are strongly urged to develop reading compe-
tence in German, French, or Greek before graduation.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN PHILOSOPHY
The degree with honors in Philosophy is awarded to the student who has demonstrated outstanding
achievement in a program of study that extends beyond the requirements of the major. The extension
beyond major requirements may take the form either of independent work culminating in a senior
essay or thesis (the independent-study route) or of additional course work (the directed-study route).
Candidates must have GPAs of 3.6 or higher in their courses in philosophy, both at the time of apply-
ing for candidacy and at the end of senior year. Juniors interested in pursuing honors should so inform
the Department Chair no later than mid-April.
The independent-study route to honors requires the completion and defense of either a senior essay
produced in the fall semester plus winter study period (maximum 40 pages) or a year-long senior the-
sis (maximum 75 pages). Plans for either essay or thesis (including a brief proposal and bibliography,
worked out in consultation with an advisor) must be submitted to the department in April of the junior
year. A recommendation for graduation with honors will be made on the basis of the thoroughness,
independence, and originality of the student's work.
The directed-study route to honors required the completion of two courses in philosophy in addi-
tion to the nine required for the major. Candidates taking this route must also submit to the department
revised copies of two term papers (10 pages or longer) written for philosophy courses they have taken;
each student will be assigned an adviser to help guide the process of revision. A recommendation for
graduation with honors will be made on the basis of the scope of the student's course work, the quality
of the student's participation in Philosophy 401, and the thoroughness, independence, and originality
reflected in the submitted papers.

PHIL 101(F,S) Introduction to Moral and Political Philosophy (W)
Throughout the history of Western philosophy, there have been debates concerning how human be-
ings should live: What should we do both with our lives as wholes and in specific problematic situa-
tions? The debates have addressed us both as individuals and as members of political communities.
This course aims to aid us in responding to these debates, and in living our lives, on the basis of rea-
soned conclusions rather than from unrecognized presuppositions. The course concentrates on Plato's
Republic, the most influential ethical and political text within Western philosophy, but we assess the
Republic in light of elaborations and criticisms that have developed over the past 2500 years, in works
by Aristotle, Kant, and Mill.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: class discussion, frequent short papers (totaling 20-30
pages).
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 per section (expected: 19 per section). Preference given to first-
year students and sophomores.

PHIL 102(F,S) Introduction to Metaphysics and Epistemology (W)
Metaphysics and epistemology are the two core pursuits of theoretical philosophy (as opposed to
practical philosophy, the focus of Philosophy 101). Metaphysics is concerned with the ultimate char-
acter of reality. The metaphysician seeks to develop knowledge (as opposed to mere opinion or belief)
of all things natural, human, and divine. She asks, for example: Are we free, or are our acts deter-
mined? Is there a God? If so, what must God be like? Epistemology is concerned with how we deter-
mine the difference between knowledge and mere opinion. The epistemologist thus asks: What does it
mean truly to know something? How can we acquire such genuine knowledge? Answers to these
epistemological questions are essential if we are to have any confidence in the methods and results of
our metaphysical investigations. This course will emphasize the established historical classics that
provide the basis for understanding contemporary work on metaphysics and epistemological issues;
we will consider, among others, the work of Descartes, Hume, and Kant.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: class discussion, frequent short papers (totaling 20-30
pages).

PHIL 205(S) Socrates (Same as Classics 205) (W)
The ancient Greek philosopher Socrates was and remains an enigma. Noted for his skill at argument
and cross-examination, and for his strong ethical convictions, he was found guilty and put to death for
impiety and for corrupting the youth. He left behind no writings of his own, and he maintained that the
chief difference between himself and his fellow Athenians was his self-awareness that he was igno-
rant about important philosophical and life matters (while others, similarly ignorant, took themselves
to be knowledgeable about such things). In this course we will examine several of the texts about Soc-
rates that survive from antiquity, including works by Aristophanes, Xenophon, Plato, Aristotle, and
Diogenes Laertius. Our overall aim will be to arrive at a comprehensive picture of Socrates as a phi-
losopher and ethical figure. We will pay special attention to Socrates' trial and the defense he is re-
ported to have offered on his own behalf.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: several short writing assignments and two longer papers.

PHIL 210(S) Philosophy of Medicine
The aim of the course is to analyze and discuss philosophical questions about the nature, domain,
methods and social role of medicine, thereby generating some understanding of both the nature of
philosophical thinking and of medical practices. Some of the questions we will focus on include:
What is medicine? What are its goals? What is the nature of medical explanation? How are the con-
cepts of "health" and "disease" to be defined? What is medical reductionism and what are its limits?
Philosophy
­ 243 ­
Are there metaphysical and ideological assumptions in contemporary Western medical theory and if
so, should they be avoided? Can we avoid them, and if so, how? Some of the specific topics we will
focus on in discussing these general questions include: psychiatry as a branch of medicine, overmedi-
calization of everyday life, the conceptualization of the human body, gender bias in medical research
and practice, medical explanations of human sexuality and gender, the rise of medical authority, and
iatrogenesis.
Requirements: four short papers and a larger (6-8 pages) final paper.

PHIL 227(F) Death and Dying (W)
In this course we will examine traditional philosophical approaches to understanding death and re-
lated concepts, with a special focus on the ethical concerns surrounding death and care for the dying.
We will begin with questions about how to define death, as well as reflections on its meaning and
function in human life. We will move on to examine ethical issues of truth-telling with terminally ill
patients and their families, decisions to withhold or withdraw life-sustaining treatments, the care of
seriously ill newborns, physician-assisted suicide, euthanasia, and research efforts to extend the hu-
man life-span. In addition to key concepts of death, dying, and terminal illness, we will develop and
refine notions of medical futility, paternalism and autonomy, particularly within the context of ad-
vance directives and surrogate decision making.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: active participation in class discussions, two mid-length
papers (7-10 pp), and weekly short writing assignments (2 pp.). Possible experiential learning compo-
nent.

PHIL 228(S) Feminist Bioethics (Same as Women's and Gender Studies 228) (W)
In this course we'll explore the ways in which feminist approaches to moral thinking have influenced
both the methodology and the content of contemporary bioethics. The first portion of the course will
address the emergence of the "Ethics of Care," critically assessing its origins in feminist theory, its
development within the context of the caring professions, and its potential as a general approach to
bioethical reasoning. The second portion of the course will use feminist philosophy to inform our un-
derstanding of the ways in which gender structures the individual's interactions with the health care
system. To do this, we'll explore topics that might traditionally be considered "women's issues" in
health care, such as medicine and body image (e.g., cosmetic surgery, eating disorders), reproductive
and genetic technologies, and research on women and their health care needs. In addition we'll also
look at feminist analyses of topics that traditionally haven't been identified as particularly gender spe-
cific, such as resource allocation and end of life issues.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: active participation in class discussions, two mid-length
papers (7-10 pp. each), and weekly short writing assignments (app. 2 pp. each).
No prerequisites, although previous coursework in Women's and Gender Studies is desirable. Enroll-

(See under Political Science for full description.)
PHIL 236(S) Contemporary Ethical Theory
In this course we will examine in depth the two most influential approaches to ethics in the twentieth
century: utilitarianism and deontology. According to the first, the moral status of an action depends
Philosophy
­ 244 ­
entirely on its consequences for human happiness. According to the second, the morality of an action
has a more complex relation to the intrinsic nature of the action and the interpersonal relationship in-
volved. While both theories have their roots in earlier thinkers--utilitarianism in Bentham and Mill,
deontology in Kant--our central focus will be on contemporary developments of these views. After
examining the debate between these two rival theories in some depth, we'll turn our attention to re-
cently developed alternatives that attempt to transcend the dichotomies that continue to divide utilitar-
ian and deontological approaches. Readings will include works by the following authors: Bentham,
Mill, Feinberg, Nozick, Railton, Brink, Williams, Wolf, Taurek, Rawls, Smart, Scheffler, Nagel, Kant,
Kamm, Quinn, Kagan, Ross, Scanlon.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: two seven-page papers, take-home essay exam, atten-
dance and participation.
Prerequisites: Philosophy 101. Enrollment limit: 30 (expected: 10-20). Preference given to Philoso-

PHIL 255(F) Scepticism
We are all mistaken sometimes; who is to say we are not mistaken all of the time? By pressing this
question, philosophers known as `sceptics' call into question a vital ability we ordinarily take for
granted--the ability to distinguish appearance from reality. Sceptics are an eclectic group, but they all
confront us with the prospect that our beliefs about the nature of reality might be mistaken in deep and
pervasive ways. Scepticism originated in ancient Greece, was then revived during the Renaissance,
and has arguably been with us in some form ever since.
We will study some of the most influential sceptical writings with an eye to the following questions:
How do sceptical challenges bear on our ability to sustain political convictions and meaningful human
relationships? How did the arguments of the ancient Greek sceptics change when they resurfaced in
modern Europe? How have philosophers responded to the sceptics? Are certain sorts of social or in-
tellectual conditions conducive to scepticism? What role does scepticism play in the political and pop-
ular culture today? We will read a number of authors from antiquity to the present including some or
all of the following: Plato, Sextus Empiricus, Martin Luther King Jr., Cervantes, Descartes, Mon-
taigne, Hume, Iris Murdoch, G.E. Moore, Thomas Nagel.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: several short assignments, midterm, final paper, participa-
tion.

PHIL 260(S) Medieval Philosophy (Same as Religion 219) (W)
The Medieval period is probably both the longest in the history of philosophy--it spans about 1000
years--and the most neglected. Yet it is also an extremely exciting period, where eclectic remnants of
ancient thought become embedded in an alien religious setting. As virtually all medieval thought is
influenced by and/or in reaction against Neoplatonism, this course will begin with a relatively brief
examination of that movement (initiated by Plotinus in 3rd C. C.E.). From there we will progress in a
more or less chronological manner, dividing our attention roughly equally among three religious
traditions: Islam, Judaism and Christianity. Islamic authors will include Al-Farabi, Ibn-Sina (Avicen-
na), Al-Ghazali, and Ibn-Rushd (Averroës). The main Jewish philosopher studied will be Moses Mai-
monides, with perhaps some discussion of the cabalistic tradition. Christian authors will include Au-
gustine, Aquinas and others.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: three 7-page papers, informal presentation, attendance
and participation.

PHIL 271T(S) Woman as "Other" (Same as Women's and Gender Studies 271T) (W)
At mid-century, Simone de Beauvoir, perhaps the greatest feminist theorist of the twentieth century,
described woman as "living is a world where men compel her to assume the status of the Other." In
other words, man is the absolute subject, and woman takes on all of the negative qualities (bodily,
mortal, irrational) that he prefers not to see in himself. At the same time, Beauvoir asserts: "One is not
born a woman, one becomes one." How, given the fact that woman historically have been reduced to
objects for men, that they have internalized the gaze of men, can they become subjects for them-
selves? How can (and do?) they become self- rather than other-determined? What are the conditions
of possibility for authentic, self-determining womanhood? For authentic personhood? Is authenticity
Philosophy
­ 245 ­
even possible? Must the relation between self and other inevitably be one of objectification and domi-
nation? Is reciprocity and mutuality in self- other relations possible? In our effort to deepen our under-
standing of these important philosophical questions, questions that have been at the center of social
and political thought at least since Hegel introduced the dialectic of master and slave, we will engage
in close readings of influential works by Beauvoir, Luce Irigary and Judith Butler.
Format: tutorial; students will work in pairs. Requirements: each student will write and present orally
a five-page essay every other week. Students not presenting essays will prepare oral critiques of their
partners' essays.

Hour: TBA SAWICKI
PHIL 280(F) Analytic Philosophy: Frege, Russell, and the Early Wittgenstein
Frege, Russell, and Wittgenstein (along with G. E. Moore) are often considered the founders of ana-
lytic philosophy and are associated with the "linguistic turn" in philosophy. In Russell's book on Leib-
niz (1900) he wrote "[t]hat all sound philosophy should begin with an analysis of propositions, is a
truth too evident, perhaps, to demand a proof." I expect that many students will find that claim not
only not evidently true, but plainly false. We will examine why our three authors considered it to be
true. We will ask (and try to answer) such questions as: Is there something unique about analytic phi-
losophy? What is analytic philosophy? A constant theme will be the relationship of our three philoso-
phers to the history of philosophy, both to our philosophers' predecessors and successors. Among the
predecessors we will discuss are Descartes, Locke, Leibniz, Hume, and Kant. Among the chief suc-
cessors are the Logical Positivists, J. L. Austin, Quine, and Davidson. Our texts will include Gottlob
Frege, The Foundations of Arithmetic, Bertrand Russell, Principles of Mathematics, and Ludwig
Wittgenstein, Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus.
Format: seminar. Requirements: three short papers (3-5 pages) and one longer final paper (10-12
pages).
Prerequisites: Philosophy 102. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 12-15).

PHIL 286T(F) (formerly 215) Conceptions of Human Nature (W)
We are all human, and in our daily lives, we seem to know what we mean when we make that claim.
However, when we start reflecting on what it is to be human-whether all human beings in spite of
individual and social differences, share the same nature, whether that nature is unchangeable, whether
it is animal, or divine, or neither, and whether anything follows from the way we naturally are about
the ways we should lead our lives, treat others, and organize our societies, we can see that the com-
monsensical assurance about there being an easily identifiable human nature in all of us gives way to a
myriad of questions and problems. Conceptions of human nature--sometimes explicit, sometimes
implicit--have shaped many philosophical, scientific and religious views, in addition to providing
grounds for many human practices, such as Law, arts, medicine and education. The aim of the course
is to examine a variety of accounts of human nature, and a variety of consequences different thinkers
derived from their accounts. We will read seminal writings of Western and non-Western thinkers and
we will try to articulate, in each reading, what the favored conception of human nature consists in;
what kind of evidence is provided in its support; what are the consequences derived from it about
human happiness, the ways we should lead our lives, the manner in which we should treat others, and
the ways in which human societies should be organized; how are such norms derived from a descrip-
tive account of human nature, and can such derivations be justified. Finally, we will confront and eval-
uate the two central assumptions which all of the different accounts share: that there is a universal
human nature, an "essence of humanity," and that an understanding of it is necessary for thinking
about morality, Law, politics, human knowledge and religion.
Format: tutorial, each pair of students meeting with the instructor for an hour once a week. Require-

PHIL 333(S) Aristotle's Ethics (Same as Classics 333)
The lecture notes that have come to be known as "Aristotle's ethics" provide a beautiful elaboration of
the idea that humans can't be happy unless they are good, and that they can't be good unless they
exercise virtues such as generosity, courage, honesty (and even wit). Aristotle's ethics has inspired
everyone from Thomas Aquinas, who ingeniously renovated it to mesh with Christian ideals, to Sha-
quille O'Neal, who cited it when explaining his strategy for improving his free-throw average (and
dubbed himself "the big Aristotle"). Shaq notwithstanding, many recent commentators--sympathiz-
ers as well as detractors--have argued that Aristotle's moral philosophy cannot be renovated to fit the
modern liberal state. It appears to be suited to cohesive societies, such as the ancient Greek city-state
or the medieval church-state, not the ideologically diverse society that is the ideal of the modern
world.
We will consider the extent to which Aristotle's virtue-centered ethics can be our ethics through a
close reading of the Nicomachean Ethics. Along the way, we will pay special attention to Aristotle's
(arguably problematic) views about moral development, the unity of the virtues, and weakness of the
will. We will supplement our reading of the Nicomachean Ethics with some secondary texts; we may
also consult parts of Aristotle's Politics and Eudemian Ethics for the light they throw on our topic.

PHIL 335(F) Moral Objectivity (W)
We often speak as if moral judgments can be true or false, well-reasoned or not. That is, we speak and
think as if morality can be objective. But how should objectivity in this domain be understood? Is it
best thought of as being like scientific objectivity, assuming we have a clear sense of what that in-
volves? Or should objectivity in ethics be conceived of differently? While answers to such questions
are implicit in historical accounts of morality, these issues have become the topic of explicit, sustained
debate in the twentieth century. Our focus will be on the most recent and sophisticated work in this
area. We will examine several different approaches in depth, including non-naturalist and naturalist
forms of realism, constructivism, and various well-developed forms of anti-realism (both skeptical
and non-skeptical). Readings will include works by the following authors: Moore, Stevenson, Har-
man, Mackie, Railton, Boyd, Blackburn, Williams, McDowell, Korsgaard, and Nagel.
Format: seminar. Requirements: final paper, several shorter assignments, attendance and participa-
tion.
Prerequisites: Philosophy 101 required; one 200- or 300-level Philosophy course highly recom-

(See under Religion for full description.)
PHIL 357(F) Aristotle (Same as Classics 357)
Aristotle has been often credited (and sometimes blamed) for single-handedly changing the way we
think about philosophy and the world. The scope of his work spans the entire range of the humanities
and sciences: biology, physics, cosmology, logic, language, poetry, ethics, politics and metaphysics.
This course will aim at understanding the theoretical side of Aristotle's thought by focusing on his
contributions to science, epistemology, and metaphysics. Some of the core questions in this area in-
clude: To what extent is Aristotle's thought compatible with Plato's? What is "first philosophy" and
where is it to be found? Why does Aristotle deny the unity of natural sciences (or doesn't he?) In addi-
tion, particular attention will be paid throughout the course to Aristotle's notions of nature, soul, and
God. All reading will be in translation, and no knowledge of Greek is necessary. Reading assignments
will consist of both primary and secondary texts.

tions.

PHIL 379T(S) American Pragmatism (Same as American Studies 379T) (W)
Along with jazz, pragmatism stands as the greatest uniquely American contribution to world culture.
As the music wails in the background, we will study the classic pragmatists: William James, C. S.
Peirce, and John Dewey. We will continue with the contemporary inheritors of the tradition: Cornel
West, Richard Rorty, and Hilary Putnam. Although it has influenced both analytic and continental
philosophy, pragmatism is a powerful third philosophical movement. Always asking what practical
difference would it make, our authors investigate the central questions and disputes of philosophy,
Philosophy
­ 247 ­
from epistemology and metaphysics to ethics and religion. Rather than seeing philosophy as an eso-
teric discipline, the pragmatic philosophers (with the possible exception of Peirce) see philosophy as
integral to our culture and see themselves as public intellectuals.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: students will meet with the professor in pairs for an hour each week;
they will write a 5- to 7-page paper every other week, and comment on the partner's paper in alternate

PHIL 390T(F) Truth (W)
Is a true account one that corresponds to things the way they are? Or is it one that fits optimally with
other accounts we accept? Or is it one that successfully guides us in our actions within the world?
Positive answers to these questions point, respectively, towards correspondence, coherence, and
pragmatist theories of truth, all of which continue to have their champions. Within the broader context
of Euro-American philosophy through the twentieth century and up to the present, they are joined by
phenomenological, postmodernist, semantic, deflationary, prosentential, and pluralistic approaches
to the problem of truth (all of which are interesting and important, although more difficult than the first
three to get at by means of a single question). In this tutorial, we will investigate this terrain. The first
ten tutorial meetings of the semester will consider defenses of and objections to each of these approa-
ches. In the final two meetings, tutorial partners will take turns presenting the positions they deem
best.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: students meet with the instructor in pairs for roughly an hour each
week; students will write essays every other week (6 in all), and comment on their partners' papers in
alternate weeks. Emphasis will be placed on developing skills in reading, interpretation, and oral ar-
gument, as well as critical reasoning and writing.

Hour: TBA A. WHITE
PHIL 392(S) Hegel and Systematic Philosophy
Hegel defines philosophy, in the opening sentence of the Introduction to his Phenomenology of Spirit,
as "the actual cognition of that which in truth is." Philosophy, in other words, is metaphysics. But if
metaphysics is to be secure, it must be preceded by epistemology, by an account of the proper method
for achieving "actual cognition." Hegel's Phenomenology thus examines the most important epis-
temological options, including rationalism, empiricism, and Kantian transcendental idealism. Hegel
argues that each of these options fails, on its own terms, to provide the requisite basis for knowledge.
He also claims, however, that consideration of these failures shows the way to success: absolute
knowledge can be had, but only if philosophy is developed into a presuppositionless and systematic
science. With this conclusion the Phenomenology gives way to the Logic, which initiates Hegel's own
attempt to develop a truly systematic philosophy and thus achieve metaphysical cognition. In this
course we will endeavor to understand and evaluate Hegel's project, one of the most ambitious, in-
fluential, and important in the history of philosophy.

PHIL 393(F) Kierkegaard
Søren Kierkegaard's first major work, The Concept of Irony with Continual Reference to Socrates,
develops the radical thesis that Socrates was through and through an ironist, someone who consistent-
ly maintained an ironic standpoint towards his fellow citizens and everything that made up Athenian
society. In the process of arguing for this view, Kierkegaard takes his readers on a whirlwind tour of
the main classical texts about Socrates (by Xenophon, Plato, and Aristophanes), offers up some
searching reflections about the nature of irony more generally, and sets himself against Hegel's read-
ing of Socrates while joining Hegel in his criticism of the German romantics and the modern man-
ifestation of irony. To make matters more complicated, a number of recent scholars have argued that
Kierkegaard's work about irony is itself thoroughly ironic. Is this a book that defends a serious philo-
sophical thesis or a work designed to reduce the entire philosophical enterprise to rubble? Our aim in
this course will be to give this very unusual, arguably profound meditation on Socrates and the nature
of irony a thorough and searching examination.
Format: seminar. Requirements: weekly short writing assignments (1-2 pages), regular class presen-

The instructional Physical Education Program at Williams is an integral part of the student's total
educational experience. As a part of the liberal arts concept, the program develops the mind-body
relationship, which is dependent upon the proper integration of physical and intellectual capacities.
The main objective of the physical education program is to develop in students an appreciation of
physical fitness and wellness, and to expose them to a variety of activities that are suitable for lifetime
participation.
Four credits of physical education represent one of the requirements for the College degree. There
are five physical education units during the year. In the fall semester, there are two six-week physical
education quarters. Winter Study is another unit, and there are two physical education quarters in the
spring semester. Four sections meet two times per week in seventy-five minute periods and two sec-
tions meet three times per week in fifty-minute periods.
The following courses are offered at various times during the year. A schedule listing all courses
offered is issued to every student before each quarter and Winter Study. Classes may vary according to

What is light? How does a transistor work? What is a black hole? Why are metals shiny? What is
wave/particle duality? There are people for whom questions like these are of more than passing inter-
est; some of them become Physics or Astrophysics majors. A physics student experiments with the
phenomena by which the physical world is known and explores the mathematical techniques and
theories that make sense of it. A Physics or Astrophysics major serves as preparation for further work
in physics, astrophysics, applied physics, other sciences, engineering, medical research, science
teaching and writing, and other careers involving insight into the fundamental principles of nature.
ASTROPHYSICS MAJOR
The Physics Department, in cooperation with the Astronomy Department, offers a major in astro-
physics consisting of (at least): 6 or 7 courses in Physics, 3 or 4 in Astronomy, and 1 in Mathematics.
The core sequence of the Astrophysics major is the same as the Physics major described below (ex-
cept that Physics 302, although strongly recommended, is not required). Students intending to pursue
graduate study in astrophysics will need to take upper-level physics electives beyond the basic re-
quirements for the major. Honors work in Astrophysics may be in either physics or astronomy. Stu-
dents majoring in Astrophysics are expected to consult early and often with faculty from both depart-
ments in determining their course selections. The detailed description of the Astrophysics major is
given under "Astronomy," along with a description of the Astronomy major also offered by that de-
partment (see page 87).
PHYSICS MAJOR
Introductory courses
Students considering a major in physics should take both physics and mathematics as first-year
students. A student normally begins with either Physics 131 or Physics 141:
1) Physics 131 Particles and Waves. This is designed as a first course in physics. It is suitable for
students who either have not had physics before or have had some physics but are not comfortable
solving "word problems" that require calculus.
2) Physics 141 Particles and Waves--Enriched. Students in this course should have solid back-
grounds in science and calculus, either from high school or college, including at least a year of high
school physics.
The Department of Mathematics will place students in the appropriate introductory calculus
course. The physics major sequence courses all make use of calculus at increasingly sophisticated
levels. Therefore, students considering a Physics major should continue their mathematical prepara-
tion without interruption through the introductory calculus sequence (Mathematics 103, 104, and 105
or 106). Students are encouraged to take Physics 210 as early as possible. Physics 210 is cross listed as
Mathematics 210 for the benefit of those students who wish to have the course listed with a MATH
prefix.
Advanced Placement
Students with unusually strong backgrounds in calculus and physics may place out of Physics 141
and either: 1) begin with the special seminar course Physics 151 in the fall (typically followed by
Physics 210 in the spring), or 2) begin with Physics 142 in the spring (possibly along with Physics
210). Students may take either 151 or 142 but not both. On rare occasions a student with an exception-
al background will be offered the option of enrolling in Physics 201.
Placement is based on AP scores, consultation with the department, and results of a placement
exam administered during First Days. The exam can also be taken later in the year by arrangement
with the department chair. The exam covers classical mechanics, basic wave phenomena, and in-
cludes some use of calculus techniques.
Requirements for the Major
A total of ten courses in physics and mathematics are required to complete the Physics major.
Students who place out of both Physics 141 and Physics 142 and begin their studies in Physics
201 are required to take a total of nine courses.

Students entering with Advanced Placement in mathematics may obtain credit toward the major for
the equivalent Mathematics 105 or 106 taken elsewhere.
At least two more physics or other approved courses must be taken, bringing the total number of
courses for the major to ten.
Options
1) Mathematics 104 may be counted if taken at Williams
2) Mathematics 209 may substitute for Physics 210.
3) Astronomy 111 may count in place of Physics 141 if a student places out of 141 (see "advanced
placement" above).
4) An additional Astronomy or Astrophysics course above the introductory level that is acceptable for
the astrophysics major may be counted.
5) Two approved Division III courses above the introductory level may be substituted for one Physics
course. Approval is on an individual basis at the discretion of the department chair.
6) Honors work is in addition to completion of the basic major so Physics 493 and 494 do not count
towards the ten courses in the major.
Preparation for Advanced Study
Students who may wish to do graduate work in physics, astrophysics, or engineering should elect
courses in both physics and mathematics beyond the minimum major requirements. The first-year
graduate school curriculum in physics usually includes courses in quantum mechanics, electromag-
netic theory, and classical mechanics that presuppose intermediate level study of these subjects as an
undergraduate. Therefore, students planning graduate work in physics should elect all of the follow-
ing courses:
Physics 402T Applications of Quantum Mechanics
Physics 405T Electromagnetic Theory
Physics 411T Classical Mechanics
Advising
Both majors and non-majors are encouraged to consult with the department chair or course instruc-
tors about course selections or other matters.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN PHYSICS
The degree with honors in Physics will be awarded on the basis of a senior thesis presenting the
results of a substantial experimental or theoretical investigation carried out under the direction of a
faculty member in the department. There is no rigid grade point average required for admission to the
program or for the awarding of the degree with honors, but it is normally expected that honors students
will maintain at least aBaverage in physics and mathematics. Students will normally apply for admis-
sion to the program early in the spring of their junior year and during senior year these students will
normally elect Physics 493, W031, and 494 in addition to the usual requirements for the major. At the
end of winter study, the department will decide whether the student will be admitted to honors candi-
dacy. Both a written thesis and a colloquium presentation of the results are required. The degree with
honors will be awarded to those who meet these requirements with distinction. The degree withhigh-
est honors will be awarded to those who fulfill them with unusually high distinction.
Honors candidates will also be required to participate in departmental colloquium talks.
OPTIONS FOR NON-MAJORS
Many students want to take a self-contained and rigorous full-year survey of physics. For such stu-
dents, the most appropriate sequence will be either Physics 131 or Physics 141 followed by Physics
132, depending on the student's background in science and mathematics (see Introductory Courses
above). Either of these sequences satisfies the physics requirement for medical school.
The department also offers one semester courses designed for non-majors. This year there are three
such offerings: Physics 100, Physics 109, and Physics/Religion 342.
PHYS 100(S) Physics of Everyday Life (Q)
How do things work? What makes a car go or a bird fly? Why do microwaves heat food? How does a
CD player work? Why are diamonds hard and metals shiny? How do we see?
Science is all around us. From common objects to high technology, science is part of our everyday
Physics
­ 251 ­
lives. Amazingly, with a few powerful principles we can understand the materials that make up our
world and the rules that govern their behavior--that's physics.
In this course we will explore the world we know and the microscopic components from which it is
made, and we will extract from this exploration the central concepts underpinning contemporary
physics. The mathematics used in the course will be basic algebra and trigonometry.
Format: lecture, three hours per week/home experiments. Evaluation will be based on weekly home-
work, a midterm, a project, and a final exam, all with a significant quantitative component.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 120 (expected: 75).
Hour: 1:10-2:25 TF WOOTTERS
PHYS 109(F) Sound, Light, and Perception (Q)
Light and sound allow us to perceive the world around us, from appreciating music and art to learning
the details of atomic structure. Because of their importance in human experience, light and sound have
long been the subject of scientific inquiry. How are sound and light related? How do physiology and
neural processing allow us to hear and see the world around us? What are the origins of color and
musical pitch? This course introduces the science and technology of light and sound to students not
majoring in physics. We will start with the origins of sound and light as wave phenomena, and go on to
topics including color, the optics of vision, the meaning of musical pitch and tone, and the physical
basis of hearing. We will also discuss some recent technological applications of light, such as lasers
and optical communications.
The class will meet for two 75-minute periods each week for a variable mixture of lecture, discussion,
and hands-on, interactive experiments.
Format: lecture/lab/discussion, three hours per week; occasional mini-tutorial-like meetings. Evalua-
tion will be based on class participation, problem sets, in-class exams, oral presentations, and a final
exam, all with a quantitative component.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20 (expected: 20).
This course is part of the Critical Reasoning and Analytical Skills initiative.
Hour: 9:55-11:10 TR AALBERTS and MAJUMDER
PHYS 131(F) Particles and Waves (Q)
We focus first on the Newtonian mechanics of point particles: the relationship between velocity, ac-
celeration, and position; the puzzle of circular motion; forces; Newton's laws; energy and momen-
tum; and gravitation. The historical context in which these ideas developed will be discussed. We then
turn to the basic properties of waves, such as interference and polarization, with emphasis on light
waves. Finally, we bring the two strands together with a brief discussion of the wave-particle duality
of modern quantum mechanics.
This course is intended for students who have not studied physics before or who have had some phys-
ics, but are not comfortable solving "word problems" that require calculus. (Students with strong
backgrounds in the sciences are encouraged to consider taking Physics 141 instead.) Physics 131 can
lead to either Physics 132 (for students wanting a one-year survey of physics) or Physics 142 (for
students considering a physics or astrophysics major).
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours every other week. Evaluation will be
based on weekly problem sets, hour tests, labs, and a final exam, all of which have a substantial quan-
titative component.
Prerequisites: Mathematics 103. No enrollment limit (expected: 60).
Hour: 11:00-11:50 MWF Lab: 1-4 M,T,W K. JONES
PHYS 132(S) Electromagnetism and the Physics of Matter (Q)
This course is intended as the second half of a one-year survey of physics. In the first half of the semes-
ter we will focus on electromagnetic phenomena. We will introduce the concept of electric and mag-
netic fields, and study in detail the way in which electrical circuits and circuit elements work. The
deep connection between electric and magnetic phenomena is highlighted in a discussion of Fara-
day's Law of Induction. In the second half of the semester, we introduce several of the most central
topics in twentieth-century physics. We will discuss Einstein's theory of special relativity as well as
aspects of quantum theory. We will end with a treatment of nuclear physics, radioactivity, and uses of
radiation.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours every other week. Evaluation will be
based on weekly problem sets, labs, hour tests, and a final exam, all of which have a substantial quan-
titative component.

PHYS 141(F) Particles and Waves--Enriched (Q)
This course covers the same topics as Physics 131, but with a higher level of mathematical sophistica-
tion and more emphasis on waves. It is intended for students with solid backgrounds in the sciences,
either from high school or college, who feel comfortable solving "word problems" that require calcu-

Hour: 11:00-11:50 MWF Lab: 1-4 M,T,W TUCKER-SMITH
PHYS 142(S) Foundations of Modern Physics (Q)
The twentieth century has been an extremely productive and exciting time for physics. Special relativ-
ity has extended physics into the realm of high speeds and high energies. Quantum mechanics has
successfully described phenomena at small energies and small distance scales. Our understanding of
atoms, molecules, and solids has developed from a few revolutionary ideas into a sophisticated frame-
work which today supports technologies that were unimagined in 1900.
This course will introduce many important developments in physics, including special relativity, the
Bohr model of the atom, Schrodinger's wave mechanics in one dimension, the chemical bond, energy
bands in solids, and nuclear physics.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours every other week/conference, one hour
every other week. Evaluation will be based on weekly problem sets, labs, two hour tests, and a final
exam, all of which have a substantial quantitative component.
Prerequisites: Physics 141 and Mathematics 103, or equivalent; students may not take both Physics
142 and Physics 151. Physics 131 may substitute for Physics 141 with the permission of instructor.No
enrollment limit (expected:50).
Hour: 11:00-11:50 MWF Lab: 1-4 M,T,W WHITAKER
PHYS 151(F) Seminar in Modern Physics (Q)
Why does a hot coal glow red rather than blue or green or some other color? Remarkably, this simple
question could not be answered before the year 1900, because the answer depends on a radical as-
sumption introduced in that year by Max Planck. His work on thermal radiation marked the beginning
of a revolutionary era in the history of physics that culminated in a new framework for our understand-
ing of the physical world. The two pillars of this framework, quantum mechanics and relativity, to-
gether with the ideas of statistical physics that allow us to apply quantum mechanics to macroscopic
objects (such as hot coals), constitute the core of this course. As we study this material, we will also be
exploring the process of research in physics, partly by doing some experiments of our own. We will
discuss the interaction between experiment and theory, as well as the roles of simplicity, elegance and
unity in the search for explanations. This is a small seminar designed for first-year students who have
placed out of Physics 141.
Format: lecture/discussion, three hours per week; laboratory, every other week. Evaluation will be
based on class participation, labs, weekly problem sets, an oral presentation, two hour-exams and a
final exam, all of which have a substantial quantitative component.
Prerequisites: placement by the department (see advanced placement above). Students may take ei-
ther Physics 142 or Physics 151 but not both. Enrollment limit: 20 (expected: 14).
Hour: 11:00-11:50 MWF Lab: 1-4 W WOOTTERS
PHYS 201(F) Electricity and Magnetism (Q)
In this course, we study electromagnetic phenomena and their mathematical description. Topics in-
clude electromagnetic induction, alternating circuits, and the electromagnetic properties of matter.
We also introduce Maxwell's equations, which express in remarkably succinct form the essence of the
theory.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on
weekly problem sets, labs, two hour tests, and a final exam, all of which have a substantial quantitative
component.
Prerequisites: Physics 142, Mathematics 105 or 106. No enrollment limit (expected:25).
Hour: 10:00-10:50 MWF Lab: 1-4 M,T STRAIT
PHYS 202(S) Waves and Optics (Q)
Wave motions are characteristic of almost every type of material, including strings, springs, water,
and solids. They also describe the behavior of electromagnetic fields and elemental matter. Despite
these diverse settings waves exhibit many common characteristics, so that the understanding of a few
simple systems can provide insight into a wide array of phenomena. In this course we begin with the
study of oscillations of simple systems with only a few degrees of freedom. We then move on to study
transverse and longitudinal waves in continuous media in order to gain a general description of wave
behavior. The rest of the course focuses on electromagnetic waves, and in particular on optical exam-
ples of wave phenomena. In addition to well known optical effects such as interference and diffrac-
tion, we will study a number of modern applications of optics such as short pulse lasers and optical
communications. Throughout the course mathematical methods useful for higher-level physics will
be introduced.

PHYS 210(S) Mathematical Methods for Scientists (Same as Mathematics 210) (Q)
This course covers a variety of mathematical methods used in the sciences, focusing particularly on
the solution of ordinary and partial differential equations. In addition to calling attention to certain
special equations that arise frequently in the study of waves and diffusion, we develop general tech-
niques such as looking for series solutions and, in the case of nonlinear equations, using phase por-
traits and linearizing around fixed points. We study some simple numerical techniques for solving
differential equations. A series of optional sessions in TrueBasic will be offered for students who do
not already have a background in programming.
Format: lecture, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on weekly problem sets, a midterm
exam and a final exam, all of which have a substantial quantitative component.
Prerequisites: Mathematics 105 or 106 and familiarity with Newtonian mechanics at the level of
Physics 131. No enrollment limit (expected: 20).
Hour: 9:55-11:10 TR WOOTTERS
PHYS 301(F) Quantum Physics (Q)
This course serves as a one-semester introduction to the history, formalism, and phenomenology of
quantum mechanics. We begin with a discussion of the historical origins of the quantum theory, and
the Schroedinger wave equation. The concepts of matter waves and wave-packets are introduced.
Solutions to one-dimensional problems will be treated prior to introducing the system which serves as
a hallmark of the success of quantum theory, the three-dimensional hydrogen atom. In the second half
of the course, we will develop the important connection between the underlying mathematical formal-
ism and the physical predictions of the quantum theory. We then go on to apply this knowledge to
several important problems within the realm of atomic and nuclear physics.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on
weekly problem sets, labs, a midterm exam, and final exam, all of which have a substantial quantita-

PHYS 302(S) Statistical Physics (Q)
The natural world is built with many small components interacting in a simple but coordinated way.
With a statistical view, we may make sense of the cooperative phenomena which emerge.
For example, we can associate macroscopic thermodynamic properties with ensembles of microscop-
ic states. With calculations and simple numerical exercises we shall probe a wide variety of physical
phenomena: magnetism, gasses, heat engines, thermal radiation, electrons in solids, polymers, ran-
dom walks in fluids or in the stock market, and genomic information.
Format: lecture, three hours per week /computer laboratory, 1 1/4 hours per week. Evaluation will be
based on weekly problem sets, quizzes, labs and a final exam, all of which have a substantial quantita-
tive component.

PHYS 315(F) Computational Biology (Same as Computer Science 315 and INTR 315) (Q)
The goal of bioinformatics and biological physics is to find the right models to capture the essence of
genomic and other biological data and provide quantitative predictive power that enables new ques-
tions to be posed. Statistical physics provides a mathematical framework and tools for finding and
characterizing biological information. Students will learn the algorithmic tools to match genomic se-
quences, locate sequences that code for proteins or that control gene expression, identify the function
of genes, or model protein folding.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, 1.5 hours per week. Evaluation will be based on
weekly problem sets, programming assignments, a midterm exam and a final exam, all of which have
a significant quantitative or formal reasoning component.

PHYS 332(S) (formerly 318) Materials Science: The Chemistry and Physics of Materials (Same
as Chemistry 332) (Q)
Materials Science is a broad study of the physical properties of substances, such as hardness, elastic-
ity, electrical conductivity, and optical properties. This course investigates the relationship between
microscopic structure and macroscopic properties of polymers (plastics, elastomers, liquid crystals),
electronic materials (semiconductors, conducting polymers, and superconductors) and solids (metals,
magnets, ceramics, minerals, and glasses). We approach these topics from both physical and chemical
perspectives, reflecting the interdisciplinary nature of the field. For instance, we explore how the un-
derlying structure of materials arises from quantum mechanics and how temperature determines col-
lective response properties such as elasticity or conductivity. This course also studies the design of
new materials and their synthesis at the molecular level.
Format: lecture, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on weekly problem sets, reviews of
research articles, a midterm exam, a final exam, and a final paper, all of which have a significant quan-
titative component.
Prerequisites: one year of introductory Chemistry (101,102 or 103, 104, or 151, 156 or 153, 156 or
155, 156 ), one year of introductory Physics (131,132 or 141,142), and one 200-level course in either

cal tools.
The class will meet as a whole once per week for an hour lecture on new material and to discuss ques-
tions on the readings. Each week a second tutorial meeting with the instructor will be scheduled; here,

PHYS 418(S) Gravity (Q)
This course is an introduction to the currently accepted theory of gravity, Einstein's general theory of
relativity. We begin with a review of special relativity in terms of spacetime vectors and tensors, and
we introduce the stress-energy tensor, which is the source of gravity. We study the mathematical de-
scription of curved spacetime and develop an intuitive justification for Einstein's equation, relating
the stress-energy tensor (matter) to the curvature of spacetime (gravity). Finally we study in some
detail two solutions of Einstein's equation: the Schwarzschild solution, which applies to a spherically
symmetric star, and the Friedmann model of an expanding universe.
Format: lecture, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on weekly problem sets, a midterm
and a final exam, all of which have a substantial quantitative component.
Prerequisites: Physics 301 or Physics 405 or Physics 411 (students with strong math backgrounds are
invited to consult with the instructor about a possible waiving of the prerequisites). No enrollment

POLITICAL ECONOMY (Div. II)
Chair, Associate Professor JAMES E. MAHON
Advisory Committee: Professor: MAHON. Associate Professors: GOLLIN***, C. JOHNSON,
SHANKS, ZIMMERMAN. Assistant Professors: BAKIJA**, OAK.
The Political Economy major is designed to give students a grasp of the ways in which political and
economic forces interact in the shaping of public policy. The major includes substantial study of the
central analytical approaches in both political science and economics and seeks to surmount the
sometimes artificial barriers of specialization that may characterize either discipline taken by itself. In
the junior and senior years a conscious merging of the approaches in the two fields is undertaken in the
three required Political Economy courses. (These courses are designed by, and usually are taught
jointly by, political scientists and economists.) Political Economy 301 examines major writings in
political economy and analyzes economic liberalism and critiques of economic liberalism in the con-
text of current policy issues. Political Economy 401 examines interactions of political and economic
forces in contemporary international affairs. Political Economy 402 examines such interactions in se-
lected current public policy issues. Background for these senior courses is acquired through courses in
international economics, public finance, and domestic and international/comparative politics and
policy.
Students in Political Economy 402 visit Washington, D.C. Sunday night through Wednesday of the
first week of spring vacation to conduct interviews relating to their Political Economy 402 group proj-
ects. This is a course requirement.

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN POLITICAL ECONOMY
Due to the special demands of this interdisciplinary major, the only route to honors in Political
Economy is the thesis. Seniors may pursue the honors thesis course (Political Economy 493-W031)
during the fall semester and winter study period. The third course contributing to such an honors pro-
gram would normally be an elective in Political Science or Economics taken during the junior year.
This course, which may be one of the required electives, must be closely related, indeed must prepare
the ground for the honors thesis.
Juniors in the Political Economy major with at least a 3.5 GPA in the program may apply for the
honors thesis program by means of a written proposal submitted to the chair before spring registration.
Written guidelines for such proposals are available in the chair's office or on the program website. The
proposal should have been discussed with at least two faculty members, and at least one faculty advi-
sor from each discipline should be solicited by the student prior to submission of the proposal.
Final decisions about admission to the honors program will be made in early summer, when spring
grades become available.
To achieve the degree with honors in Political Economy, the thesis must be completed by the end of
winter study period and be judged of honors quality by a committee consisting of the two advisors and
a third reader. A thesis judged to be of particular distinction will qualify its author for the degree with
highest honors.
COURSE NUMBERING SYSTEM
The numbering system for courses offered and required in Political Economy is identical to the
system outlined on page 44.
POEC 301(F) Analytical Views of Political Economy (Same as Economics 301 and Political
Science 333)
This course explores the relationship between politics and economics by surveying influential works
of political economy. Its first part examines three major systems of thought in relation to the historical
development of capitalism in Western Europe: the classical liberalism of Adam Smith, Karl Marx's
revolutionary socialism, and the reformist ideas of John Stuart Mill, R. H. Tawney, and John Maynard
Keynes. The second part considers more recent writings that revise and critique liberalism from a va-
riety of perspectives. The historical focus of the course permits you to appreciate the ongoing dialogue
between classical and contemporary views of political economy, while classroom discussion involves
frequent reference to current public policy issues.
Format: discussion/lecture. Requirements: eight 2-page papers and a final exam.
Prerequisites: one course in Economics and either Political Science 201 or 203 or AP credit in Ameri-
can Politics (or permission of instructor). Enrollment limit: 35 (expected: 32). Preference given to
Political Economy majors and sophomores intending a Political Economy major.
Required in the Political Economy major but open to non-majors.

Politics is most fundamentally about community--it is how we manage to live together and craft a
common destiny. Communities, however, need power, and political science therefore attends to the
ways power is grasped, maintained, challenged, or justified. The contest over power gives politics its
drama and pathos. Since power may be used wisely or foolishly, rightly or cruelly, politics affects our
lives most profoundly. No matter whether we find it distasteful, inspiring, appalling or alluring, poli-
tics is for high stakes. For this reason, the effort to understand politics aims not only to describe and
explain, but also to improve political life.
The Political Science major is structured to allow students either to participate in the established
ways of studying politics or to develop their own foci. To this end, the department offers two routes to
completing our major, both requiring nine (9) courses. On the one hand, we invite students to organize
their major through the subfields that structure the discipline of political science (American politics,
international relations, political philosophy, and comparative politics). On the other, we encourage
students to develop individual concentrations reflecting their particular interests regardless of sub-
fields.
MAJOR
SUBFIELD CONCENTRATION ROUTE: Upon declaring a major, students choose a subfield
from American politics, international relations, political theory, and comparative politics. The sub-
field concentration draws at least four (4) of the nine courses from one subfield, and includes the ap-
propriate core course from 201-204, two electives at the 200 or 300 level of the student's choice and
the senior seminar (or an individual project) in the student's subfield. (A degree with honors in Politi-
cal Science requires two (2) additional courses which DO NOT count toward the nine (9) major requi-
rements.) With permission of the department chair, students may take a senior seminar in a different
subfield, providing the student takes a third elective in the subfield of concentration. In addition, stu-
dents must take courses in two subfields outside the subfield of concentration to satisfy the breadth
requirement (all courses at the 100 level and all methods courses also count toward the breadth re-
quirement).
INDIVIDUAL CONCENTRATION ROUTE: Alternatively, students may devise a concentration of
their own. In this event, the student prepares a curricular plan in consultation with a faculty advisor,
explaining the nature of the concentration and the courses the student will take. The individual con-
centration also requires nine (9) courses, with at least five (5) thematically linked courses constituting
the concentration. Of these five courses, four are electives at the 200 or 300 level, including one from
201-204, and one is a senior seminar or individual project. In addition, students pursuing an individual
concentration must take at least two other courses that illustrate breadth in political science. To com-
plete the requirement, the student has his or her choice of any two other courses within the Political
Science Department. The faculty advisor and the department chair must approve the student plan.
ADVISEMENT
When a student chooses to major in Political Science (usually at the end of the sophomore year), he
or she may register with any Political Science faculty member at the designated time and places. The
Political Science
­ 258 ­
registering faculty member will ask for preferences for a permanent faculty advisor and will assist
undecided students in finding an advisor whose interests match theirs. In all cases students will be
paired by the end of their sophomore year with an advisor who will continue with them through gradu-
ation.
COURSE NUMBERING
The course numbering used by the Political Science Department reflects the format and specializa-
tion of a course more than its level of difficulty. The 100-level courses are designed to address ques-
tions of broad political interest. The courses are pitched both to those considering and not considering
political science as a major. The 200-level courses are divided between our core courses and our elec-
tives. The core courses, numbered between 201-204, serve as introductions both to the substance of
the politics and the subfields organizing the study of politics. The core courses, which were previously
numbered at the 100 level, are open to all students, including first-year students and non-majors. The
200-level elective courses provide general overviews of political processes, problems and philoso-
phies in a way generally accessible without prerequisites. 300-level courses are more specialized and
usually require prerequisites. 400-level courses are senior seminars offered for students in the major;
senior seminars also are open to juniors and to non-majors.
WINTER STUDY PROJECT
The department welcomes relevant WSP 99 proposals that can make important contributions to the
student's understanding of public affairs and politics. Majors, seniors, and students without previous
WSP 99 experience have preference.
THE JUNIOR YEAR ABROAD
A major in Political Science can be readily and usefully combined with study in a foreign country.
Normally, no more than two semester courses taken abroad in a program approved by the College
may be counted toward the requirements for a degree in Political Science.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE
The Political Science Department grants honors to candidates who, (1) complete the Senior Semi-
nar, (2) receive at least a grade of 3.50 on a Senior Thesis (493-W031-494), and (3) have a minimum
GPA of 3.5 in Political Science.
To become a candidate for honors the student must, (1) apply in the second semester of the junior
year, (2) submit a research proposal acceptable to the department's honors committee and for which
an appropriate advisor is available, and (3) have a minimum GPA of 3.5 in Political Science for the
first six semesters. (Political Science 493-W031-494 DO NOT count toward the total of nine required
of all majors.)
ADVANCED STUDY IN AMERICAN POLITICS
The Department of Political Science provides the opportunity for an unusually gifted student to
engage in an entire year's advanced research in American politics under singularly favorable condi-
tions. Supported by income derived from an endowment fund, the student, designated the Sentinels of
the Republic Scholar (after the name of the fund), receives a substantial research stipend to cover costs
associated with the proposed project.
This unique research course (Political Science 481-W033-482) is designed to encourage the pur-
suit of excellence among the most talented Williams students of Political Science. Admission to it is
awarded to the most distinguished candidate on the basis of demonstrated capacity for outstanding
work and of the project's promise for creative contributions to the understanding of American politics,
political institutions and thought.

PSCI 101(F) (Section 01) Seminar: Moral and Political Reasoning (W)
How do we make difficult moral decisions: from empathy and concern, or impartial reason? How
should we make moral decisions? Do justice and morality require that we give equal consideration to
everyone in society? And what about concern for the lives and conditions of people outside one's
country? Moral and political thinkers have always disagreed on the motives and considerations that
should guide people's judgements. Nowhere is this disagreement more apparent than in political
theory and practice. When considering whether a public policy is fair and just, some say we should
consider only whether it contributes to the overall or public good. Others say we should pay attention
to how a policy affects specific groups--or even how a policy or action affects those we love. This
course examines these and other dilemmas in our moral and political reasoning and decision-making

PSCI 102(S) Seminar: The War on Terrorism
In the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks, the Bush administration declared a "war on terror-
ism." This seminar will address the war on terrorism, what is meant by it, what it entails for domestic
and international policies, and what rides on defining the enemy as "terrorism" (as opposed, say, to
Bin Laden). It will examine the implications for the Republican and Democratic parties of declaring
the war on terror (looking at the early presidential campaign where appropriate) and the tension be-
tween heightened security concerns and civil liberties. Finally, we will consider the war with Iraq, the
relationship of the Iraq war to the war on terrorism, and the extent to which the war on terrorism is
motivating American foreign policy versus the extent to which it is rationalizing policies that origi-
nate independently of the war on terrorism.

PSCI 120(F) America and the World After September 11
The terrorist attacks of September 11 and the war in Afghanistan raised fundamental questions about
the past and future course of American foreign policy. While virtually no one defended the terrorist
attacks, many academics argued that the root causes of September 11th were supposedly to be found
in the flaws of the American approach to the world. In this view, America is an arrogant, unilateralist
country that ignores the views and perspectives of the rest of the world community, relies far too much
on its overwhelming military power, and often acts against its ideals and values by supporting repres-
sive and unpopular regimes. This course has three primary objectives. First, we will assess important
critiques of contemporary American foreign policy from both the left and right of the political spec-
trum. Second, we will examine the historical and intellectual background of both supporters and crit-
ics of American foreign policy in the post Vietnam War era. Third, in the aftermath of September 11
we will attempt to answer the most important question of all for any analysis of American foreign
policy: What is to be done? While current issues of American foreign policy will be addressed in this
class, potential students should note that its primary focus is not placed on the technical/military ele-
ments of combating terrorism.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: assignments will include weekly response papers, two 5-
to 7-page papers, and a comprehensive in-class final exam. Students will also be required to obtain
free online subscriptions to the New York Times and other current periodicals.

PSCI 198T(S) The Democratic Deficit (W)
Today more people than ever before live in democracies, yet more and more individuals feel that they
have decreasing say in decisions that affect their lives. International organizations make decisions
about everything from government spending on education to how much an ivory poacher should be
fined, technocrats make decisions about missile programs and interest rates, and intelligence agencies
make decisions about civil liberties and internet access. Poverty, illiteracy, and intimidation effective-
ly disenfranchise citizens within each country, while international boundaries legitimate the voice-
lessness of those outside. If democracy is so important to us, why do we allow, and even encourage,
this distancing? Whose interests does this "democratic deficit" serve? Should it be challenged? By
whom? This tutorial confronts these questions on a theoretical and philosophical level, and on an em-
pirical one. Throughout the semester, we will consider what democracy is, and why it is valued and
decried. We will examine formal mechanisms set up to encourage participation and to overcome de-
mocracy's weaknesses, and informal strategies that citizens and noncitizens, criminals and lobbyists,

PSCI 201(F,S) (formerly 110) Power, Politics, and Democracy in America
Begun as an experiment over 200 years ago, the American constitutional order has grown into a polity
that is simultaneously praised and condemned, critiqued and mythologized, modeled by others and
remodeled itself. This course will introduce students to the dynamics and tensions that have animated
the American political order and that have nurtured conflicting assessments. Topics will include the
primary institutions of national government (Congress, the Presidency, and the Supreme Court) as
well as the politics of policy-making in the United States. We will study structures, processes, key
events, and primary actors that have shaped American political development. In investigating these
topics, we will explore questions such as these: How is power allocated? What produces political
change? Is there is a trade-off between democratic accountability and effective governance? How are
tensions between liberty and equality resolved? Do our institutions produce good policies, and how
do we define what is good? How are the politics of America different from the politics of other mod-
ern democracies?
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: two short papers, one exam, multiple one-page reading re-

PSCI 202(F,S) (formerly 120) World Politics: An Introduction to International Relations
International politics differs from domestic politics in the absence of centralized, legitimate institu-
tions. Anarchy characterizes the world of sovereign states--there is no world government, nor agree-
ment that one is desirable or even possible. This lack of a common authority means that any dispute
among countries is up to the countries themselves to settle, by negotiating, appealing to shared norms,
or using force. For this reason, while international relations involves many of the same topics that
consume domestic politics--ethnic antagonisms, spending on aid, war, national identity, inequality,
weapons manufacture, finance, loans, pollution, migration--it shares few of the same processes for
dealing with them. This course covers problems central to international relations. It considers the im-
portance that this radical decentralization has for achieving values we hold, and examines processes
that might undermine or support the anarchical system in which we live.
Format: fall semester is lecture, possible discussion sessions; spring semester is a "lecture" class and
requirements are two papers, a final exam, reading response papers, and class participation.

PSCI 203(F,S) Introduction to Political Theory
What is justice? What does it entail for individuals and communities? How can it be secured, socially
and politically? Who decides? On what basis? These questions have been controversial since their
earliest formulations, and they remain controversial now. This course introduces the study of political
theory by exploring some of the key controversies. Drawing on both contemporary and classic theo-
ries, and using practical examples from today's world, we will examine justice in relation to such
themes as authority, equality, democracy, power, oppression, liberalism, capitalism, bureaucracy,
community, cultural pluralism, and rights. Specific theorists will vary from year to year, but may in-
clude such thinkers as Plato, Aristotle, Hobbes, Machiavelli, Locke, Rousseau, Marx, Mill,
Nietzsche, Weber, Arendt, Rawls, and Foucault.

cal theories have been advanced to explain poverty? Why has the United States government adopted
certain kinds of policies to address poverty but not others? We will discuss the validity of these theo-
ries and policies from an empirical as well as a normative perspective.

PSCI 211(F) Public Opinion and Political Behavior
The focus of this course is the role of public opinion in democracy. The influence of public opinion on
public affairs and popular governments is a relatively new phenomenon in the history of governments
(largely subsequent to the American and French revolutions). We can see from recent events the im-
pact of public remain: In the early 1990s the American public quickly becomes interested in drought
and starvation in Somalia, though starvation is not a problem just experienced in Somalia, and the
American government intervened, if briefly and unsuccessfully. Some have claimed that American
journalists successfully provoked the American public to go to war (the Spanish-American War,"Re-
member the Maine"), or to withdraw from war (another Viet Nam). We see political leaders make use
of the "bully pulpit" to rally support for their agendas, efforts that sometimes succeed and other times
fail.
We shall explore public opinion in American politics. There are many interesting questions awaiting
us this semester. Among these: How do events and crises influence public opinion? Which psycho-
logical, sociological, and political variables affect the public opinion? When and under what circum-
stances do pressure groups influence the formation of public opinion on current domestic and interna-
tional issues? When do mass beliefs alter individual voter's choices? When and how do political lead-
ers influence public opinion and when does public opinion influence political leaders? In addition, we
will have direct access to the holdings of the Roper Center, using iPOLL, which enables direct explo-
ration of the thousands of polls on American public opinion from 1937 to today.

To study the presidency is to study human nature and personality, constitution and institution, strategy
and contingency. This course will examine the problems and paradoxes that attend the exercise of the
most powerful political office in the world's oldest democracy: Can an executive office be constructed
with sufficient energy to govern and also be democratically accountable? How much do we attribute
the shaping of politics to the agency of the individual in the office and to what extent are politics the
result of structural, cultural, and institutional factors? Are the politics of the presidency different in
foreign and domestic policy? How are national security concerns balanced with domestic priorities
such as the protection of civil rights? How is the office and purpose of the presidency affected by an
economic order predicated on private capital? Exploration of these questions will lead us to examine
topics such as presidential selection, the bases of presidential power, character and leadership issues,
congressional-executive relations, the media, and emergency powers. Attention will focus largely on
the modern presidency, though older historical examples will also be used to help us gain perspective
on these problems.

PSCI 219(F) Constitutional Law I: Structures of Power
Constitutional Law is offered in two courses. Students are encouraged to take them in sequence but
may elect not to, or to enroll in only one. The focus of both courses is on one of the most vital aspects
of politics: interpreting and applying the nation's fundamental rules. The emphasis is on the United
States Supreme Court and the exercise of judicial review. In this class we examine the structure of
power in a constitutional democracy, exploring contests over authority from John Marshall and
Thomas Jefferson to Bill Clinton and Kenneth Starr. Some of the topics to be considered include: the
powers of the federal and state governments, the executive's emergency powers, and the Supreme
Court's authority to nullify the acts of other branches. Under these general headings are to be found
such issues as the power to regulate firearms, the power to establish an office of independent counsel,
the power to overturn a judicial decision through congressional action, the power to deprive citizens
of rights during wartime, the power to define the terms of impeachment, and the power to decide the
outcome of a presidential election. Much of the reading is of Supreme Court opinions that highlight
the politics of constitutional development.

What is security? While international security once primarily referred to military conflict and the

and chemical weapons, and other non-traditional sources of insecurity. This class examines a wide
range of conceptions and problems of international security, traditional and non-traditional, and con-
siders the prospects for cooperation to overcome these threats. It first asks whether the focus of securi-
ty studies should be individual human beings, states, the world as a whole, or something else. It then
asks whether security should be seen as primarily competitive, so that one's security can only be en-
hanced by threatening the security of another, or primarily cooperative, so that one's security is best
protected by increasing the security of others. It also evaluates the various mechanisms by which
states and non-state actors can act to increase the security of individuals, groups, and the world, as well
as the extent to which they are likely to act in these ways.

PSCI 229(S) Global Political Economy
Thirty years ago the production, distribution, consumption and accumulation of goods, services and
capital were predominantly national, organized by nation-states and within national territories. Today
they all are increasingly global in scope, and nation-states find themselves more and more the subjects
of mobile transnational corporations, international trade tribunals, global currency markets and natu-
ral resources cartels than their masters. All of these developments have direct and far-reaching effects
on the power of states, the wealth of societies, and the life chances of billions of people around the
world. This course offers a broad introduction to the politics of global economic relations, emphasiz-
ing the inherent and inseparable intertwining of politics and economics, power and wealth, the state
and the market. It begins with a short overview of liberal, economic Nationalist, Marxist and green
theoretical traditions (including Smith, Keynes, List, Marx, Polanyi and others) and a study of the
emergence of the contemporary global order. We will examine both global trade and global finance,
along the way focusing on important issues of current interest including free trade and the WTO, the
spread of transnational corporations, dollarization, international labor standards, uneven develop-
ment and the cultural underpinnings of consumerism.

PSCI 235(S) Multiculturalism and Political Theory*
Some cultural minority groups in democratic states demand "special" social and political arrangements to
accommodate their distinct identities, languages and ways of life. Is this a requirement of justice in plural
societies? What exactly is the basis for these claims? Do demands for community autonomy--such as
separate religious schools, instruction in one's own language, or native self-government--jeopardize dem-
ocratic commitments to universal rights and citizenship, or to a division of church and state? Or are such
arrangements required in order to make good on liberal and democratic commitments to justice for all in
culturally plural societies? We'll look at recent responses by several political philosophers to the justice
claims of cultural minority groups.

PSCI 240(S) (formerly 342) Intolerance and Political Tolerance
At the beginning of the last century, most people and analysts expected steady democratization and
prosperity. We now know better. The twentieth century, for all its economic and technological im-
provements, has also witnessed terrible intolerance, from attacks on civilians in war to ethnic purging
to the holocaust. Intolerance has led to wars between states, to violence within states (such as Bosnia,
Rwanda, and Kosovo, among the most recent). However, there are successes, Chile, South Africa,
Germany, Portugal, and others, recovered as stable democracies from authoritarian rule. Hence the
three questions posed by this course: 1) what are the most important factors in producing and increas-
ing intolerance; 2) what are the factors that produce and strengthen tolerance; and 3) what can be done
to increase a society's tolerance, both in the United States and abroad? This course makes use of his-
torical, political, and literary sources.
The course begins with the standard explanations of what makes societies prosperous and peaceful as
well as explains malevolence in its various forms. We then turn to the events of the twentieth century
to explore what accounts for instances of success and of failure.

PSCI 245(F) Nationalism in East Asia (Same as Asian Studies 245 and History 318)*
The disintegration of the Soviet Union, violence in East Timor, conflict between North Korea and
South Korea and similar phenomena have signaled the continuing importance of nationalism and at
the same time the increasing instability of nations. What is a nation? Under what conditions is nation-
hood formed and under what circumstances do nations collapse? Are national identities immutable
and exclusive of other forms of identification? Is, as Frantz Fanon once wrote, "Europe literally the
creation of the Third World?" This course will critically investigate the questions of nationalism and
cultural identity as they have arisen in East Asia. In the first part of the course, we will examine semi-
nal theoretical texts --coming from disciplines such as anthropology, history, literary studies, and
philosophy --that have informed our contemporary understanding of the nation and nationalism and
attempt to arrive at a conceptual clarification of the subject. The second part will focus on various
nationalist projects as they have unfolded across East Asia - Japan, China, and Korea. Through careful
thematic comparisons of these cases, we will explore the extent to which non -European nationalisms
are modular or derivative; examine the often fraught relationships between nation and state as well as
gender and nation; and investigate the ways in which modern nationalist projects provide new ways of
synthesizing culture, power, and history.

PSCI 248(S) Visuality, Modernity, and Power in South Korea
This seminar explores the central theoretical and political questions posed by the rise of nationalism,
the aftermath of colonialism and imperialism, and modernization in South Korea primarily through
the lens of visual culture. We will investigate the course of economic, political, social, and cultural
transformations that has brought the `Hermit Kingdom' into the modern world and consider salient
issues such as the representation of the nation, the construction of historical memory, the formation of
national ideology. We will take into serious consideration Guy Debord's dictum--that under moder-
nity, "all of life presents itself as an immense accumulation of spectacles. Everything that was directly
lived has moved away into representation."
Every other week will be structured around a primary visual text--ranging from cinematic, monu-
mental, photographic, or televisual--which will be analyzed in relation to critical-theoretical read-
ings. By examining the multiple operations of visuality in historical context, we will address questions
such as, how is nationness reproduced and consolidated, what is the relation between visual modes of
address and struggles over national culture, ethnic identity, and state legitimacy, in what ways is visu-
ally inscribed in the experiences of modernity in South Korea and elsewhere, in what ways do popular
forms of visual culture inform what is meant by being "Korean" and "Asian"?

tive and to investigate the historical experiences of imperialism and the process of social, political,
economic, and cultural change that empires wrought. Emphasis also will be placed upon examining
the practices, agents, and techniques of imperial rule. In the last part of the course, we will explore
some of the post-colonial theoretical literature and study the lasting legacy of imperial and colonial
rule in both post-colonial and imperializing nation-states.

The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, focused world attention on political Islam. Political
movements defined in terms of Islam have been an important and growing force in the politics of the
Middle East and beyond for several decades, however. Islamic politics takes many forms beyond al
-Qaeda: the Iranian revolution, the domestic violence after canceled elections in Algeria, the violence
as well as civil society in Egypt, the electoral successes in Jordan, Lebanon and Yemen, the violent
struggles against Israel in Lebanon and Palestine, the politicization of Muslim immigrant communi-
ties in Europe and America, the social arguments over women adopting the veil and Islamic educa-
tion, theoretical debates about the compatibility of Islam with democracy, the rise of new media
forms, and much, much more. This course explores many of the difficult questions surrounding the
rise of Islamic politics in a wide range of political contexts. What is political Islam? Why, how, and to
what extent has it succeeded? What are its goals? Is it inherently violent, anti -Western, or hostile to
modernity, as many claim, or is it potentially progressive, democratic, and moderate? How have dif-
ferent states dealt with the challenge--and does their repression explain the turn to violence? What is
the meaning of jihad? How have other Islamists responded to the violent terrorism of al -Qaeda? Can
Islam and the West peacefully co -exist, or is the war on terror leading towards an inexorable clash of
civilizations?

PSCI 305T(F) The Challenges of Knowing: The Holocaust
Although we may be mistaken about something we have ourselves experienced, we often take direct
experience to be valid on its face. How do we know about events that occurred outside our ken? The
distinction between knowledge as truth, based on direct knowledge, and mere opinion unhinged from
direct observation, has a long lineage. It has given birth to the field of epistemology, the study of truth
and how best to obtain and represent it. The tutorial will consider the matter of truth and its telling
using events in the Holocaust. How can we, who have no direct personal knowledge of the events of
the Holocaust, come to know it? There is a wide variety of ways of representing truth: memoir, testi-
mony, documents of the time, oral history, each derived from participants. There are also accounts
given by non-participants: documentary producers, historians, sociologists, and others using their dis-
ciplines. In addition to concerns about inaccuracy, truth is often altered by the purpose of the inquiry.
For example, legal proceedings consider evidence under specific rules to determine issues of guilt.
We will begin with some classic philosophical statements on truth (Plato, Aristotle, and James Madi-
son). In all of the instances we shall explore what it means to determine facts; gain comprehension,
assign blame (legal or moral, or both); and, the challenge of point of view (contrasting objective his-
torical depiction at a distance as against subjective intimate experience as a participant).
Format: tutorial. Requirements: each student will write and present orally an essay of approximately
seven double-spaced pages every other week on an assigned topic (the written essays will be briefer in
the first month, 5-6 pages, somewhat longer in the second, 6-7, and 7-9 in the third). Students not
presenting have the responsibility of critically reviewing the work of the colleague. There will be a
final written exercise and students will be evaluated on this exercise, their essays, and their critical
reviews.

PSCI 306(S) Practicing Feminism: A Study of Political Activism (Same as ArtS 306 and

This course will explore the issues and problems of putting feminism into practice. What constraints
and opportunities confront feminists as they struggle for social change? What are the sources of and
limits on their power? How and when do they choose to compromise and negotiate, or object and
fight? How are these issues represented in the culture through the press, through other media, through
art? We will examine issues such as organizational dynamics, budgetary and administrative
constraints, client-staff interactions, power and dependency, and mother-child-family relationships.
We will also look at artwork about social issues; activist in nature, and critique imagery from ads to
websites that portray women in a range of manners. Students will do fieldwork at community agen-
cies involved in health care, social services, and work. A variety of interactions with these organiza-
tions are encouraged, ranging from administrative and service work to public art projects that might
raise awareness of feminist issues in the community.
Format: discussion. Requirements: 1) Students will intern at community agencies. These internships
require a minimum of 4 hours per week. The internships are to begin the first week of class-OR a total
of at least 48 hours during the semester. 2) Weekly response papers of 1-2 pages are expected; these
will relate the worksite to the issues and readings of each week, and the questions to be addressed will
be posed week by week. 3) There are three projects required through the semester that center on the
work sites; these may be public art projects or written papers. 4) Class participation is expected as the
principle format of the class is discussion.

PSCI 309(F) Comparative Constitutionalism
One way to mark the beginning of the twenty first century is to note the extraordinary amount of
constitution making going on around the world. The heightened activity surrounding recent funda-
mental restructurings of polities has led to a renewed interest in the old subject of constitutionalism.
This course will explore alternative traditions of constitutionalism, connecting them to the broader
political cultures from which they have emerged. It will examine the various shades of meaning un-
derlying political values and moral theories that inform concepts--for example, liberty, autonomy,
equality, and community--within various constitutional traditions. It will seek to account for the sim-
ilarities and differences within the constitutional ideas and arrangements of the nations under consid-
eration. It will also look closely at the ways in which foreign constitutional experience might illumi-
nate and possibly improve American constitutional understandings. This will be done through a study
of such issues as abortion, hate speech, religious freedom, judicial review, federalism, and constitu-
tional change. Some of the countries receiving close examination will be Germany, Ireland, Canada,
India, and Israel.

PSCI 315(S) Parties in American Politics
Political parties have played a central role in extending democracy and organizing power in the
United States, yet their worth is a continuing subject of debate. In one ideal formulation, parties not
only link citizens to their government, they also provide the coherency and unity needed to govern
in a political system in which power is widely dispersed. But there is also an American tradition of
antipathy toward parties. They have been criticized for inflaming divisions among the people and
for grid-locking the government. For others, political parties fail to offer citizens meaningful
choices; the Republican and Democratic parties are likened to a choice between "tweedledee and
tweedledum." This course will investigate this debate over parties by examining their nature and
role in American political life, both past and present. Throughout the course, we will explore such
questions as: What constitutes a party? Why were parties invented? For whom do parties function?
Why a two-party system, and what role do third parties play? Is partisanship good or bad for democ-
racy? For governance? And, in the age of technology and mass communications, are parties still
relevant?

PSCI 328(S) The International Politics of Oil (Same as Environmental Studies 328)
Since the early 1900s oil has grown increasingly important to economic growth, military power, and
political influence. This course will explore why oil became central to both state power and economic
growth by examining how control over oil resources and markets has been used by states and corpora-
tions to achieve their often divergent objectives (e.g., states-alliance maintenance, companies-cartel
maintenance/source country pliancy). Among the contending actors seeking to establish order over
oil resources (e.g., great powers, private oil companies, producing and demanding countries, and car-
tels among companies or producing states), leading states' interests often appear to determine out-
comes despite periodic challenges from producing states. This course will examine how these
struggles for order and advantage amidst varying degrees of state and corporate competition have af-
fected international relations and the broader economic structure of the world economy.
After reviewing the post-WWI competition among rival great powers and leading oil companies for
political autonomy and oil source control, we will examine how producing countries paradoxically
gained greater political leverage and earning from their own oil resources in the 1960s and 1970s by
binding themselves financially to the leading great powers through reinvestment of their earnings
with these states' banks.
The final part of this course will examine whether the world's existing oil-based economic and securi-
Political Science

ty relationships will continue. We will explore the possibility of upsetting technological advances,
rising great powers' demands, the competition over new supply sources, and greater producing coun-
try leverage over the leading industrial states.

PSCI 332(S) Rhetoric and Democracy: Three Debates
What role should rhetorical arguments play in a healthy democracy? How can the inspiring oratory of
a reformer be distinguished from the inflammatory rhetoric of a demagogue? When politicians at-
tempt to be persuasive by appealing to our emotions and our self-interest, when they use images as
well as arguments, are they contributing to democratic deliberation or corrupting it? The course will
investigate these questions by studying three debates in the history of political thought: Plato versus
Aristotle, Thomas Hobbes versus Giambattista Vico, and John Rawls versus Richard Rorty. Along the
way we will read and listen to examples of actual political rhetoric, both historical and contemporary.
Format: seminar/discussion. Requirements: two 4-page papers, one 10- to 12-page paper, and one

This course focuses on political theorizing about sex and gender. We take up a range of perspectives
on the "gendered" nature of political concepts and categories, and examine the place occupied by
women within mainstream political theory. Some questions we'll address include: Does inequality in
the private and social realms reflect public and political forms of inequality, and vice versa? How
should we explain differences and inequities between men and women: by invoking biological fac-
tors, or by pointing to social and historical explanations? Is there a unified conception of "woman"
which can ground these generalizations and secure a common basis for political solidarity? And can
we make general claims about women's and men's lives and differences without negating important
differences in terms of race, ethnicity, class, and sexuality? In addition to surveying the development
of different contemporary feminist perspectives--such as liberal, socialist, radical, and postmodern
feminist views--we will examine the application of these arguments to particular issues in theory and
practice: reproductive choice and new reproductive technologies, pornography, body image, mother-
hood, and prostitution.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: class participation, presentations, 2 papers (6-8 pages) and

PSCI 349T(F) Cuba and the United States (W)*
Between Cuba and the US there is a long and deeply felt history of dependence and conflict. After the
collapse of the USSR, Cuba entered a deep economic depression and in response, began a decade-
long "special period" that has combined new repression with an opening to religious practice, and
strong official protection of the social "conquests of the Revolution" with a vigorous popular pursuit
of the Yankee dollar. Where is Cuba headed? Can the US do anything constructive at this juncture?
This course examines Cuba's relationship with its often troublesome and demanding neighbor to the
north, from José Martí and 1898 to the present. Materials include journalism, official pronouncements
of the Cuban revolutionary regime, travel accounts, polemics by émigrés, policy statements of the US
government, and a wide range of academic works.
In the first week the entire class will meet once for lecture and discussion on Cuba's colonial political
economy. In the next ten weeks we will consider ten themes. In the final week we will discuss the
twelfth theme, the future of Cuba, in another meeting of the entire group.
Format: tutorial (The posted class hour will only be used for two meetings, in the first full week and
the last week of classes.). Requirements: students write five-page papers and two-page responses for
alternate sessions, for a total of five papers and five responses. In the tutorial session, essays will be
read aloud or presented in outline form, then critiqued by the discussant, and then defended.
Prerequisites: any course on Latin America or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 10 (ex-
pected: 8). Preference given to Political Science majors and seniors.

SENIOR COURSES
PSCI 410(F) Senior Seminar in American Politics
In American politics today, complaints about representation are common. Certain interests, usually
labeled "special", are somehow over represented, while other interests, always laudatory, are ignored.
Members of Congress are praised for their representation of constituents, and then criticized for repre-
senting too well. We typically understand elected officials as those who represent, but many argue that
the bureaucracy and courts can and should represent as well. Individuals are supposed to be repre-
sented, but so too are political units, geographical entities, and important American norms and values.
This seminar will center on dilemmas in representation, including discussion of who or what is being
represented, and who is doing the representation.
Format: seminar. Requirements: class participation, weekly assignments, and a research paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 16 (expected: 16). Preference given to senior Political Science
majors.

PSCI 420(F) (Section 01) Senior Seminar in International Relations: American Hegemony
and the Future of the International System
Since the time of Thucydides, world politics has always been a story of several great powers compet-
ing for power, wealth, and security. The collapse and dissolution of the Soviet Union, however, left the
United States in a position of dominance that has no parallel in history. This course examines how
international relations theorists and American policymakers have grappled with the dilemmas and
opportunities of global hegemony since 1989, with a particular focus on the challenges that have
emerged in the aftermath of September 11. Will other powers, such as China or a united Europe, inevi-
tably challenge American dominance? Should America actively seek to promote its ideas and values
throughout the world? Does a hegemon have unique and special responsibilities for advancing inter-
national justice? What kind of grand strategy should the United States pursue, both now and in the
future? Why does so much of the world seem to resent American hegemony?
Format: seminar. Requirements: course assignments will include weekly papers and a 25- to 30-page

PSCI 420(F) (Section 02) Senior Seminar in International Relations: Theories of International
Relations and Crises in Contemporary International Relations
The world of international politics has taken some unusual twists and turns since 9/11. This senior
seminar proposes to consider two kinds of issues in relation to developments since the attacks. First,
we will read some major international relations theorists--Kissinger, Kennan, and Cox, among oth-
ers--with an eye to determining whether they have much to say about the challenges posed by inter-
national terrorism. Do classical theories provide adequate guidance to contemporary international
politics? Second, we will read the work of those who believe the world has been fundamentally
changed by 9/11, such as Kagan and Kristol, as well as that of their critics to determine how well vari-
ous interpretations account for the turns international relations are taking and how well they respond
to the new situation.
Format: seminar. Requirements: students are required to participate in class discussion, write a long
seminar paper (25- 35 pages), and organize class presentations of their work.
Prerequisites: senior standing; Political Science major; two classes in international relations; permis-
sion of instructor. Enrollment limit: 16 (expected: 16). Two sections.

PSCI 420(S) (Section 03) Senior Seminar in International Relations: Imperialism
The international system is often assumed to be anarchic, i.e. ruled by none. States are formally sover-
eign, there is no global policeman, and war is frequent. At the same time, some states are clearly more
powerful than others, some regions richer than others, some societies more developed than others,
some cultures more dominant than others. Thus despite formal anarchy and the political equality
among states and societies that it implies, there is nonetheless a pervasive international hierarchy born
of unequal political_economic relations, domination and exploitation at the global level. This course
seeks an understanding and explanation of imperialism, i.e. this hierarchy and the politics which build
and sustain it, primarily from within the broad critical or (neo)Marxist tradition. The course is both
historical--tracing the evolution of imperial policies from the late nineteenth century to the present,
the political-economic effects of such policies, and the ever-evolving efforts of scholars influenced by
Marx to understand and explain them--as well as contemporary--interested in the current fashion of
both the right and the left to identify the United States as an imperial power for the twenty-first centu-
ry. Key questions asked in the course include: Is the US the latest incarnation of the Roman Empire? Is
'free trade' a pathway to wealth or dependency? What role do writers and intellectuals play in build-
ing up an empire? Does Western consumerism facilitate imperialism? Are environmentally friendly
practices in the Global North only possible as the result of exporting environmentally destructive
practices to the Global South?
Format: seminar. Requirements: weekly short critical papers, discussion questions, final research pa-
per, class participation.
Prerequisites: senior standing, Political Science major, two classes in International Relations, permis-
sion of instructor. Enrollment limit: 16 (expected: 16).

PSCI 430(F) Senior Seminar in Political Theory: Democracy and its Critics
This course focuses on several of the key political challenges directed at contemporary democratic
theory and practice. It has become commonplace to claim that liberal democratic states are insuffi-
ciently democratic in their political processes and that they are neither as representative nor as inclu-
sive of the citizens they purport to represent. We will examine these and other criticisms of contempo-
rary politics as well as of the liberal and democratic political theories that underpin them. The course
also provides an opportunity to explore some democratic alternatives advanced by proponents of such
approaches as deliberative democracy, associative democracy, multicultural or pluralist democracy,
and republicanism. Among the authors we will read are Seyla Benhabib, James Bohman, Joseph Ca-
rens, Robert Dahl, John Dryzek, Lani Guinier, Jürgen Habermas, Phillip Pettit, Anne Phillips, and Iris
Marion Young.
Format: seminar. Requirements: regular seminar response pieces; one mid-term essay (8-10 pp) and
one final research paper (15-20 pp).
Prerequisites: junior or senior standing and two courses in political theory, permission of instructor is
required for this course. Enrollment limit: 15 (expected: 15). Preference given to Political Science

PSCI 481(F)-W033-482(S) Advanced Study in American Politics
A year of independent study under the direction of a member or members of the Political Science
faculty, to be awarded to the most distinguished candidate based upon competitive admissions. Can-
didates submit a research proposal to the department prior to May of their junior year. The successful
candidate, designated the Sentinels of the Republic Scholar, receives a substantial research stipend to
cover costs associated with the proposed project. The Sentinels Scholar may submit her/his essay for
consideration for honors in Political Science.
Admission is awarded on the basis of demonstrated capacity for distinguished work and on the pro-
posal's promise for creative contributions to the understanding of topics on: the federal system of gov-
ernment; the American political economy; civil liberties; state, local, and federal relationships; or the
philosophical foundations or problems of American constitutional democracy. Proposals that deal
with these topics from a variety of perspectives (such as domestic, comparative, international, or phil-
osophical) are welcome. Anyone with a prospective proposal should contact the department chair for
further guidance.

PSCI 493(F)-W031-494(S) Senior Thesis
The senior major, having applied for and been accepted into the honors program during the second
semester of the junior year, will devote the senior year to researching and writing a substantial and
original work of scholarship, under the supervision of a faculty mentor to be assigned by the depart-
ment. The final work will be submitted for evaluation by a committee made up of the faculty supervi-
sor and two additional readers to be chosen by the department, in consultation with the supervisor.
Thesis writers will not only work with their advisors but will participate in a weekly honors seminar
supervised by a faculty member in political science. The seminar (which is one component of the
493-W031-494 designation and not a separate course) will meet for the entire year and will provide a
focused forum for the exchange of ideas among the honors students. Students will regularly circulate
sections of their theses-in-progress for peer review and critique. The faculty seminar leader's primary
role is one of coordination and guidance, not evaluation.

people of color, and on the role of self-esteem in stereotyping and prejudice, and (2) interpersonal
suspicion, including an examination of factors that might reduce suspicion in interracial or cross-cul-
tural dyads or groups. Students will research and critically analyze and integrate the relevant litera-
tures concerning these topics, and will design and conduct original research to test empirically several
hypotheses that emerge from these literatures. We will examine a variety of types of research design
and statistical techniques.

RELIGION (Div. II)
Chair, Professor GEORGES DREYFUS
Professors: DARROW, DREYFUS, TAYLOR. Associate Professor: BUELL. Assistant Professors:
LEVENE, ROBSON. Sterling Brown Visiting Professor: PINN§§§.
MAJOR
The major in Religion is designed to perform two related functions: to expose the student to the
methods and issues involved in the study of religion as a universal phenomenon of psychological,
sociological, and cultural/historical dimensions; and to confront students with the beliefs, practices,
and values of specific religions through a study of particular religious traditions. It is a program that
affords each student an opportunity to fashion his/her own sequence of study within a prescribed basic
pattern constructed to ensure both coherence and variety. It consists of at least nine semester courses
as follows:
Required sequence courses
Religion 101 Introduction to Religion
Two seminars (courses numbered 301-309)
Religion 402 Issues in the Study of Religion
Elective courses
Five additional courses in Religion are to be selected in such a way that at least one course is taken
in both the Western and non-Western traditions. Students will construct their sequence in consultation
with departmental advisors and subject to their approval. In order to achieve a deep coverage of a
particular religious tradition or set of related problems in the study of religion, students are urged to
select three electives that together have some kind of coherence, be it cultural, historical, or topical.
Related courses from other departments or programs may be included among the three courses, and
the point of coherence can be the subject of research papers in the senior seminar.
Students are advised to elect additional courses in related fields (e.g., psychology, sociology, an-
thropology, art, history, philosophy) in order to gain a clearer understanding of the social and cultural
contexts in which religions appear.
For those who wish to go beyond the formally-listed courses into a more intensive study of a partic-
ular religious tradition, methodological trend, or religious phenomenon (e.g., ritual, symbol-forma-
tion, mysticism, theology, etc.), there is the opportunity to undertake independent study or, with the
approval of the department, to pursue a thesis project.
The value of the major in Religion derives from its fostering of a critical appreciation of the com-
plex role religion plays in every society, even those that consider themselves non-religious. The major
Religion
­ 279 ­
makes one sensitive to the role religion plays in shaping the terms of cultural discourse, of social atti-
tudes and behavior, and of moral reflection. But it also discloses the ways in which religion and its
social effects represent the experience of individual persons and communities. In doing these things,
the major further provides one with interdisciplinary analytical tools and cross-cultural experience
and opens up new avenues for dealing with both the history of a society and culture and the relation-
ships between different societies and cultures. What one learns as a Religion major is therefore re-
markably applicable to a wide range of other fields of study or professions.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN RELIGION
The degree with honors in Religion requires the above-mentioned nine courses and the preparation
of a thesis of 75+ pages with a grade of B+ or better. A thesis may combine revised work done in other
courses with new material prepared while enrolled either in Religion 493-W031 or Religion
W031-494. Up to two-thirds of the work in the thesis may be such revised work, but at least one-third
must represent new work. The thesis must constitute a coherent whole either by its organizing theme
or by a focus on a particular religious tradition. Candidates will also be expected to present the results
of their thesis orally in a public presentation. Students who wish to be candidates for honors in
Religion will submit proposals and at least one paper that will be included in the thesis to the depart-
ment in the spring of their junior year. Students must have at least a 3.3 GPA in Religion to be consid-
ered for the honors program.
The chair will serve as advisor to non-majors.
REL 101(F,S) Introduction to Religion
As an examination of the structure and dynamics of certain aspects of religious thought, action, and
sensibility--employing psychological, sociological, anthropological, and philosophical modes of in-
quiry--the course offers a general exposure to basic methodological issues in the study of religion,
and includes consideration of several cross-cultural types of religious expression in non-literate and
literate societies.

THE JEWISH TRADITION
REL 201(F) Reading the Hebrew Bible (Same as Comparative Literature 201) (W)
The Hebrew Bible or TaNaKh serves, to different degrees, as a foundational document in Judaism,
Christianity, and Islam, and it has been an immensely rich source for over two thousand years of artis-
tic and literary creativity. This course seeks to broaden students' knowledge of the basic legal, pro-
phetic and wisdom texts that constitute the TaNaKh while addressing the broader question of how we
might read the Hebrew Bible in the contemporary world. As students increase their knowledge of the
Hebrew Scripture's contents, they will confront and evaluate diverse ways of reading this text, includ-
ing historical, rhetorical, literary and feminist approaches, as well as methods employed in archaeolo-
gy, theology, history of religions, and folklore studies. All readings are in translation.
Format: discussion with some lecture. Evaluation will be based on participation in class discussion
and website-postings, in-class presentations, a 3- to 4-page paper to be presented in a tutorial setting,
four 2- to 3-page papers, and a 9- to 11-page research paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 14). Open to first-year students.
This course is part of the Critical Reasoning and Analytical Skills initiative.

scholars of early Christianity answered these questions? What are the implications of their various
readings of early Christian history? In the first half of this course, we shall address these questions by
examining the formation of Christianity from its origins as a Jewish movement until its legalization,
using a comparative socio-historical approach. In the second half of the course, we shall examine the
earliest literature produced by the Jesus movement and consider it within a comparative framework
developed in the first half of the course.

During the twentieth century, alterations took place in the "doing of theology" based upon the experi-
ence, concerns, and needs of oppressed peoples around the globe. This theological discussion ad-
dressed to suffering communities has received the label liberation theology. One version of liberation
theology, black theology, developed in the United States, combining the best of the Christian Tradi-
tion and the energy of Black Power. Giving theological weight to the expression "black is beautiful,"
black theology changed the nature and content of theological discourse in the United States. Through
readings and group discussions, students will explore the history, sources (including popular music),
and defining elements of black theology.

THE ISLAMIC TRADITION
REL 230(F) Reading Reading: An Introduction to the Qur'an and Islam (Same as
Comparative Literature 260) (W)*
One of the two most consequential texts in human history, the Qur'an is more conscious of itself as
text and the work of interpretation that is part of the life of a text. Because it is God's most important
sign (and also because it is relatively short) millions have memorized it and the art of Qur'anic recita-
tion is one of the supreme Islamic performing arts. Nevertheless it is primarily a text that Qur'an exists
in itself and in the minds of Muslims. The text of the Qur'an will thus be the focus of this course,
reading it extensively, intensively and repeatedly throughout the semester. We will attend to the struc-
ture and variety of styles and topics in the text and to the Qur'an's understanding of itself in relation to
Religion
­ 281 ­
other forms of literary expression. We will place the form and content in the context of seventh centu-
ry c.e. Arab society and attend to the life of the Prophet (PBUH) that provides one crucial framework
to the text. Through the lens of tafsir, Qur'anic commentary, we will also use the text to give an initial
survey of some of the main theological, philosophical, mystical and legal developments in the Islamic
tradition. Finally we will explore some of the aspects of the place of the text in the life of Muslims,
including the development of calligraphy and recitation.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: three essays (6-8 pages) based on class materials (at least
one will have a revision process). Students able to read the Arabic text may substitute work in a collat-
eral reading group of the Qur'an in Arabic for one of the essays.

The collapse of the Soviet Union, the recognition of untapped mineral wealth, and Islamic resurgence
have all led to an increased focus on Central Asia and its neighbors, Russia, China, the Middle East.
This course will be an introduction to both the Caucasus and the Central Asian Republics and the in-
terests of their neighbors, including now the United States in those areas. This will be a team-taught
lecture course that will introduce the salient themes and issues that are necessary for understanding
these areas. The course will inevitably be deeply comparative focusing on themes of "the clash of
civilizations," the construction of national identities, notions of ethnicity and the treatment of ethnic
minorities, resurgent religious movements, and the relation of state and civil society. The class will
meet three times per week, twice for lecture presentations and once in a discussion section. This
course will also function as an introduction to doing social scientific research on these areas and spe-
cial attention will be devoted to the preparation of a research paper.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: weekly responses, midterm, one short essay (4-6 pages),
and one research paper (12-15 pages).

siders the discourses and practices which construct ideas about the body, purity and pollution, and the
nature of male and female. These discourses involve a disciplining of the body and sex through the use
of moral codes, ethics, social institutions, ritual practices, and popular culture. This course also ad-

amine the roles that Buddhism has played in traditional societies where it is often connected with
magical and shamanistic practices. We also consider the complex relation that Buddhism has enter-
tained with the political realm, focusing more particularly on the place of statecraft and violence in the
Buddhist ethical universe. We then move to consider the transformations that Buddhism undergoes in
contemporary societies, examining the changing role of monks and laity as well as the development of
Buddhist social activism. Throughout the course we track key issues and themes in the development
and transformation of Buddhism over time-from the ancient to the modern world-and in relation to its
changing social contexts-from South Asia to China and Japan.

The religious landscape of modern Japan is filled with surprises around every corner. There are now

fered a proper burial, and students (or more likely their parents) can pray for success on school en-
trance exams. While these practices are clearly related to social and economic changes brought by
modernity, they should not be dismissed as aberrant "commercialized" practices that depart from os-
tensibly "pure" religious movements like Buddhism and Shinto. Popular practices have long been
intertwined with Buddhism and Shinto and have been actively supported and propagated in modern
Japanese religious institutions. This course will trace the historical development of Japanese religions
(including their doctrinal positions) in relationship to popular movements from early shamanistic
practices and folk religion, through the recent flourishing of "New" religious movements. Some of the
main themes that will be covered in this course include: beliefs in ghosts and fantastic demons, moun-
tain pilgrimages, religion and healing, the effects of modernity on new religious movements, religion
and the modern Japanese state, Aum Shinrikyo and religious violence, community festivals, and
religious themes in anime and manga.

COMPARATIVE INQUIRY
REL 270T(S) Father Abraham: The First Patriarch (W)
The figure of Abraham in the Hebrew scriptures is interesting for at least two reasons: he comes first
and seems more universal rather than particular. He first received the covenant and the promise of the
land of Israel, but before the full revelation of the Torah to Moses. He fathers both the Jewish people
and the Arabs and the significance of that wider identity was later captured both by Christianity in the
work of Paul and in the Qur'an where Muhammad identified with Abraham as the prototypical and
Religion
­ 283 ­
non-sectarian monotheist prophet. This course will trace the figure of Abraham by a close and multi-
disciplinary reading of the Jewish, Pagan, Christian and Muslim sources on Abraham. Our task is not
to decide on the historicity of Abraham, but rather to explore the history of the figure and his continu-
ing relevance for today in understanding Jewish/Christian/Muslim conflict and cooperation. We will
begin with an intensive reading of the Genesis material on Abraham (12-25), where the issues of idol-
atry and mono-theism, the covenant and circumcision, relations of the patriarch to his women and
sons, and primal model of faith all are articulated. We will then turn to later Jewish developments in
the figure of Abraham in midrash and apocalypse. We will then explore the view of Abraham in the
classical world, the uses made of Abraham by Christianity as it broke from an emerging Rabbinic
Judaism and the development of Abraham's specific connection with the view of the afterlife. We will
then treat the figure of Abraham in the Qur'an and later Islamic traditions. We will conclude with an
examination of the cult surrounding Abraham in the city of Hebron, a currently-contested site on the
West Bank where we will consider the current religious practice regarding Abraham by both Jews and
Muslims. The purpose of this tutorial is to read closely a variety of primary religious texts and to ex-
plore the variety of tools available for the reading of those texts.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: each student in the tutorial will write and present orally five 5- to
7-page essays every other week on the readings for the week and a final 7- to 10-page essay. Students
not presenting an essay will be responsible for offering an oral critique of the work of their colleague.
Evaluation will be based on written work and critiques.

REL 273(F) Sacred Geographies (Same as Anthropology 273 and INTR 273)*
Bringing together insights from anthropology, art history, and religious studies, this course will ex-
plore the geography of sacred space: the spatial organization of meaning across time and the world as
humans have again and again made a division between sacred and profane. We will attend to this pro-
cess as expressed in the geography, social dynamics, and architecture of sacred space, noting patterns
of similarity and difference among and between the "little traditions" of folk and traditional societies
as well as the "great traditions" of universalist and modern societies. Having developed an analytical
vocabulary for understanding sacred space, we will put our model in motion by examining the dy-
namics of change, redefinition, and contestation that have so often surrounded the history of sacred
spaces.
The course begins by introducing students to theoretical models derived from our several disciplines,
enabling them to understand the form and character of sacred spaces. Authors to be read may include
Eliade, Bachelard, van Gennep, Otto, Tuan, Durkheim, Casey, and Harvey. We will develop analyti-
cal tools for interpreting the meaning and aesthetics of sacred space as it is constituted in the natural
landscape (e.g., sacred mountains, rivers, trees, etc.) artificially-constructed places (e.g., temples,
monuments, shrines, etc.) and the intersection of the two. We will pay particular attention to the ways
boundaries around sacred spaces are created, maintained, and violated, as well as passages to and
from sacred places (e.g., pilgrimage).
Once these interpretive tools have been developed, we will turn our attention to the ways in which
religious and political conflict are both aggravated and mediated through sacred space. Specific pro-
cesses to be examined include: exile and diaspora--what happens when a people are cut off from their
sacred space; contestation over sacred space in places like Jerusalem and the Babri Mosque in India;
supercession in which a late-coming tradition marks its relation to earlier traditions, as in the construc-
tion of the Mexican national cathedral on the ruins of an Aztec temple in the heart of Mexico City;
colonization, as in the creation of new mosques in British and American cities; and cooperation, in
which a sacred space allows for the establishment of links between competing groups and divided
ideologies, as in Mecca or monuments such as the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. We will conclude
with attention to the role of these four processes in contemporary society, where diaspora, contesta-
tion, supercession and cooperation continue to have wide relevance for articulating the character of
social conflict, reconciliation, and change.

REL 275(S) Shopping: Desire, Compulsion and Consumption
If the workplace was the essential site of modernity, then the shopping mall is the quintessential site of
postmodernity; the place where consumption trumps production and, it has been argued, our only re-
maining public space. This course will focus on the experience of shopping, focusing on three themes.
First we will explore the manufacturing of desire on which consumption must depend. We will cri-
tique the tired critiques of advertising and explore in more depth the neurotic and erotic dimensions of
Religion
­ 284 ­
the creation of desire for objects. We will then turn to some comparative and historical analysis con-
trasting the experience of shopping in traditional bazaars and contemporary malls, as well as explor-
ing the history of consumerism from the eighteenth century through the current phenomena of global-
ization. Finally, we will explore the place of shopping in our collective imaginations, attending espe-
cially to the relation between the gendering of the shopping experience and expressions of contempt
and outrage toward consumerism, with a special focus on the discourse on Christmas in American
society.

REL 287(S) The Dynamics of Globalization: Society, Religion and the Environment (Same as

Recent events have demonstrated the importance of religion in the contemporary world. What is per-
haps less obvious is the reason for this role, which is often misconceived as a return of the past. This
course provides a different picture by examining the social, cultural and environmental dynamics of
globalization and their consequences for religion. We begin with a general investigation of globaliza-
tion and raise questions such as: What is the nature of globalization and its relation to (post)moderni-
ty? Is it a new phenomenon? What are the cultural dynamics that globalization favors? What are its
consequences for the exercise of power? What are its environmental consequences? We then shift to
religion, arguing that its renewed relevance is a function of globalization and the transformations that
the latter brings about. We examine some of the religious expressions favored by globalization as
markers of identity, from personal quests as manifested in interest in Buddhism, ecology or mountain
climbing, to various forms of fundamentalism, such as Pentecostalism, the fastest growing religious
denomination in the Americas, and the most radical forms of Islam.

This course offers a sustained inquiry into the place of religion in society and the place of the social/
communal within selected religious traditions. The course will focus on two organizing themes--sac-
rifice and praxis. In the first, the multifaceted interest of the early twentieth century in the "primitive"
and the violence of "totemic" cults will be explored as a theme in the works of Durkheim, Levi-
Strauss, Griaule, Jay, Bataille, Agamben and Bloch, with special emphasis on the hold that the notion
of sacrifice had on formulating these issues. In the second part, the character and comparison of sepa-

What is reality? While as old as thought itself, this question assumes new urgency in modern and post-
modern thought and culture. In an increasingly complex world where reality and appearance, the
fashioned and the discovered and the real and the virtual are becoming indistinguishable, does it any
longer make sense to think about the real? Or does thinking about the real become unavoidable? This
investigation will probe the problem of the real through a careful reading of the writings of three major
philosophers: Hegel, Kierkegaard, and Nietzsche. Far from provoking mere historical interest, these
thinkers present compelling perspectives, which represent distinct alternatives for understanding the
world in which we dwell.

REL 304(F) From Hermeneutics to Post-Coloniality (Same as Comparative Literature 344 and
English 386)*
This course explores some of the theoretical trajectories available in "our" pluri-cultural and (post)modern
world by focusing on the relation between truth and interpretation, particularly in a pluri-cultural context.
We start with Gadamer's hermeneutics, which stresses the importance of being aware of one's cultural
background and prejudices, an important prerequisite for understanding cultural differences. Hermeneutics
has also, however, several blind spots, which we examine through the critiques of Derrida, Foucault and
Said. With Derrida we learn the critical tools and the rigor necessary to question some of the central notions
such as identity and difference which are often taken for granted. With Foucault we question the relation
between truth and power in interpretation, and thematize the complexities of power. With Said's Oriental-
ism, a seminal description of the ways in which the West has (mis)represented the "East," we examine the
nature of (mis)interpretation of other cultures and the role that ethnocentrism has played in the formation of
modernity. We also consider some of the more compelling critiques of Said's work such as Bhabha's warn-
ing against the essentialization of difference and Spivak's argument against the often too easy appropri-
ation of cultural differences. We conclude by considering two concrete situations in India and Egypt which
illustrate the relevance of the post-colonial critique and its main proponents, Said, Spivak and Bhabha
(otherwise known as the "Holy Trinity"). Reading list: H.G. Gadamer, Truth and Method. F. Saussure,
Course in General Linguistics. J. Derrida, Of Grammatology. P. Rabinow, Foucault Reader. E. Said,

REL 305T(F) (formerly 285) Haunted: Ghosts in the Study of Religion (W)
Haunting offers a powerful way to speak about forces that affect us profoundly while remaining invis-
ible or elusive. "What is it that holds sway over us like an unconditional prescription?.The distance
between us and that which commands our moves-or their opposite, our immobility-approaches us: it
is a distance that closes in on you at times, it announces a proximity closer than any intimacy or famil-
iarity you have ever known" (Avital Ronell, Dictations: On Haunted Writing [1986] xvi-xvii). The
figure of the ghost has been developed by those seeking to grapple with the ongoing effects of modern
slavery, colonialism, state-sponsored terrorism, the holocaust, and personal trauma and loss. Building
upon the insights about memory, history, and identity that haunting has been used to address, this
course will challenge students to explore the study of religion by way of its "seething absences." We
shall ask how the study of religion has endeavored to address loss, trauma, and its persistent effects,
what "holds sway" over various approaches to the study of religion, as well as how "religion" consti-
tutes its own ghostly presence, haunting other domains.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: meeting in pairs, each student will either write and present a paper or
respond to their partner's paper. Each student will write and present three 3- to 4-page papers, three 5-

FRENCH
MAJOR--French Language and Literature
The French major consists of nine courses above the 103-104 level with optimally one course each
from the following areas:
1) Poetry and Poetics
2) Prose Narrative and Fiction
3) Theatre and Dramatic Literature
4) Thematics, Special Topics, Survey Courses
Students must also take a 400-level capstone seminar which may count toward any of the four
required areas.
Working with the major advisor, the student will formulate a curricular plan that will ensure balance
and coherence in courses taken. Such balance and coherence will be based on the above areas of liter-
ary and cultural investigation. Prospective majors should discuss their program with the major advisor
by the end of their sophomore year. This is especially imperative for students who are planning to
spend a part or all of their junior year in France.
The major seeks to provide training in literary and cultural analysis and linguistic expression
through the study of selected texts. Emphasis is placed on the changes in form and subject matter from
the Renaissance to the modern era.
Inasmuch as all courses in French assume the active participation of each student in discussions
conducted in the foreign language, regular attendance at class meetings is expected.
MAJOR--French Studies
The major in French Studies is an interdisciplinary program that provides students with the oppor-
tunity to acquire skills and knowledge embracing the cultural, historical, social, and political heritage
of France. The program allows for an individualized course of study involving work in several depart-
ments and the opportunity to study abroad.
Romance Languages
­ 287 ­
Students electing the French Studies major should register with the French Studies faculty advisor
during their sophomore year. At that time they should submit a feasibility plan that articulates their
projected program.
The French Studies major consists of ten courses satisfying the following requirements:
1) at least two courses in French language and/or literature above the French 103 level;
2) a senior seminar;
3) Electives: The remaining courses needed to complete the major must be drawn from at least
three different departments and relate primarily to an aspect of the culture, history, society, and poli-
tics of France. These courses will be selected in consultation with members of the Department of Ro-
mance Languages. Appropriate electives might include:
History 331 The French and Haitian Revolutions
Religion 301 Psychology of Religion
All courses in French literature and language above the 103 level.
In addition, students should take at least two non-language courses that are taught in French.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN FRENCH
Two alternative routes are available to those who wish to apply for the degree with honors.
The first of these involves the writing of a senior thesis. Honors candidates are required to devote to
their theses two semesters of independent study (beyond the nine courses required for the major) and
the winter study period of their senior year (493-W031-494). The thesis will be written in French and
will usually be in the range of from forty to sixty pages. Candidates are expected to submit thesis pro-
posals in May of their junior year. By the end of the first semester of the senior year, students will
normally have finished the research for the thesis. By the end of the winter study period, candidates
will submit to the department an outline and rough draft of their work. At this time, the student will
make a presentation of his project at a departmental colloquium. The thesis will be discussed and eva-
luated to determine whether or not the student should continue in the honors program. The second
semester of independent thesis work will be spent revising and rewriting the thesis. The completed
dissertation in its final form will be due at the end of April. The second route is a group of three clearly
related courses (offered by the Department of Romance Languages or by other departments, such as
History, Art, Philosophy, English, etc.), only one of which may be counted in the nine courses com-
prising the major. One of the courses will be an Independent Study (plus senior year WSP 030). At the
end of the spring semester the student will write an essay that synthesizes the content of the three re-
lated courses. Students may apply for this route by November 2 of the senior year.
In the case of both routes to the degree with honors, the department's recommendation for gradua-
tion with honors will be based on the originality and thoroughness of the finished project.
PLACEMENT
A placement test in French is administered at Williams at the opening of the fall semester. Incoming
first-year students who register for any French course above the 101-102 level must take this test,
regardless of their previous preparation.
STUDY ABROAD
French majors are strongly advised to complete part of the requirements for the major by studying
abroad either during the academic year or the summer. Most American study-in-France programs re-
quire applicants to have completed a fifth-semester, college-level French course (French 105, for ex-
ample) before they go abroad. A special affiliation with the Hamilton Junior Year in France program
enables Williams students (who have completed 105) to participate in a comprehensive academic and
cultural experience in a French-speaking environment. Major credit for study abroad will normally be
assigned as follows: up to 1 credit for one semester and up to 3 credits for a full year or two semesters.
The final assignment of credit will be authorized in consultation with the student's major advisor once
the student has returned to Williams. Such credits can only be determined by review of course format,
course materials, and evidence of satisfactory academic performance. Students interested in studying
abroad need to consult with faculty members in French by the second semester of their first year. Early
planning is essential. Because the academic quality of certain programs of study in France may well
be beneath the pedagogical standards normally associated with a Williams education, students will
receive credit for only those programs recommended by the department. Please consult a faculty
member to find out which programs are acceptable. Normally, the department does not administer
proficiency exams (for study abroad) to any student who has not completed a French course at Wil-
liams.

LITERATURE COURSES
RLFR 109(F) Introduction to French Literature: Laughter and Despair
Through an organized web of obsessions, this course will introduce students to some seminal mo-
ments of French literature and culture. In the face of human misery and futility, the writers selected
respond in a multiplicity of ways, ranging from despair to laughter. The course will gravitate around
dialectically opposed though not exclusive notions such as seriousness and frivolity (frivolous seri-
ousness, serious frivolity), depth and superficiality, being and appearance, the Court and the City. By
establishing connections between the various genres and periods, the course will show how the read-
ing of one text infects and enhances our understanding of another. Readings will include: Villon, Du
Bellay, Ronsard, Pascal, Molière, Perrault, Constant, Flaubert, and Ionesco. Conducted in French.
Requirements: class participation, several short papers, an oral presentation, and an hour exam.

"We are so used to disguising ourselves for others," wrote the seventeenth-century author, La Roche-
foucauld, "that we wind up disguised to ourselves." Through the study of short masterpieces from the
sixteenth through twentieth centuries, we will study a variety of authors' different approaches to ques-
tions of self-deception, self-discovery and self-understanding. Writers to be studied include Mon-
taigne, Pascal, Voltaire, Rousseau, Chateaubriand, Mme de Duras, Balzac, Maupassant, Sartre, Ca-
mus, Sarraute. Conducted in French.

RLFR 111(F) Introduction to Francophone Literature: Roots, Families, Nations*
Mothers, sisters, fathers, brothers, cousins. Orphans, illegitimate children, runaways, exiles. As Leo
Tolstoy wrote in the opening of his 1877 novel, Anna Karenina, "All happy families resemble one
another; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own fashion." The Francophone world, stretching
across Europe, Africa, the Middle East, Asia and the Americas, has often been described as an unhap-
py family, joined by a shared language, but also by a problematic history. Through novels and films,
this course will examine how writers and filmmakers from the Francophone world have approached
the idea of family both literally and metaphorically, using the idea of family to explore questions of
identity, origins, colonialism, resistance, nationhood and interconnectedness in a global community.
Authors we will read include: Mariama Bâ (Senegal), Leila Sebbar (France), Driss Chraibi (Moroc-
co), Dany Laferrière (Haiti), Maryse Condé (Guadaloupe), Assia Djebar (Algeria). Conducted in
French.
Format: lecture/seminar. Requirements: active class participation, reading journal, two short papers,
an oral presentation, and a one-hour exam.

RLFR 202(S) French Film
In this course we will discuss a series of films that are representative of the rich and varied tradition of
French cinema from its origins to the recent past. We will be paying particular attention to the ways in
which films engage the spectator and use moving images and recorded sound to tell their stories. We
will also be considering how the films reflect on and interrogate aspects of twentieth-century French
and Francophone culture and society, and in particular on the role of film itself as a vehicle of cultural
perception. In addition to reading a selection of short texts on film criticism, we will be viewing the
early films of the Lumière brothers, films from the twenties and thirties of Jean Vigo, Abel Gance and
Jean Renoir; films from the fifties of Robert Bresson and Jacques Tati, films from the New-Wave
cinema of the sixties by such directors as Truffaut and Jean-Luc Godard and more recent films of
Agnès Varda, Claude Chabrol and others. Conducted in French.
Format: seminar. Requirements: frequent short writing assignments on each of the films, two short
papers, one longer paper, one presentation.
Prerequisites: French 109, 110 or 112, or permission of instructor.Enrollment limit: 20 (expected: 20).

RLFR 206(F) (formerly 307) The Female Prison: Convents and Brothels
In this course, we will examine eighteenth-, nineteenth-, and twentieth-century texts in which
woman's destiny is defined in terms of spatial, social, and psychological confinement in mysticism or
sexuality, excluding her from marriage and society. Convents and brothels, schools that teach ambig-
uous sexuality, subversion, and revolt, may be more interchangeable than antithetical. Texts include
Diderot's La Religieuse, Prévost's Manon Lescaut, Laclos's Les Liaisons Dangereuses, Mme. de La-
fayette's La Comtesse de Tende, Mme. de Duras's Ourika, Maupassant's La Maison Tellier, Zola's
Nana, Colette's Gigi, and Beauvoir's Le Deuxième Sexe. Conducted in French.
Format: seminar. Requirements: several short papers and class presentations.
Prerequisites: any French literature course. No enrollment limit (expected: 12).
Hour: 2:35-3:50 MR DUNN
RLFR 207(S) Nineteenth-Century French Novel
Still perceived as a "minor" genre at the end of the eighteenth century, the novel was quickly elevated
as the literary form of choice in the years following the French revolution. In this course we will trace
the evolution of the novel with respect to the broad contexts of nineteenth-century French history and
culture. We will focus in particular on the rise of French realism and its relation to the development of
modernity in France, examining the treatment of such themes as revolution, money and commercial-
ism, urban space (the street, the arcade, the barricade), the changing role of women in French society
and the emerging contours of modern identity - along with its distinctively modern pathologies (alien-
ation, boredom, addiction). Texts will include Stendhal's La Chartreuse de Parme, George Sand's
Indiana, two shorter works of Balzac (Le Colonel Chabert, Gobseck), Flaubert'sMadame Bovary and
Zola's Au Bonheur des Dames. To help illuminate the problem of literary realism, we will take up the
question of realist representation in the visual arts as well, examining relevant works by such artists
and photographers as Courbet, Millet, Daumier, Manet, Degas, Nadar and Atget. We will also view
film adaptations of several of the works we'll be reading, which will allow us to investigate the seem-
ingly natural affinity between the nineteenth-century novel and the cinema. Conducted in French.
Format: seminar. Requirements: class participation, an oral presentation, three short papers and a final
longer paper.

Do human beings need solitude to discover our true, authentic selves, to confront our mortality, to
push ourselves to the limits of human experience? Or are we essentially sociable beings who find
meaning and even transcendence through solidarity and fraternity? We will explore variations of
these visions of the human condition in writers from the sixteenth to the twentieth centuries. Authors
include Montaigne, Pascal, Voltaire, Rousseau, Michelet, Maupassant, Saint-Exupery, Mauriac, Ca-
mus, Ionesco, and Beckett. Conducted in French.
Format: seminar. Requirements: three short papers and three class presentations
Prerequisites: any course in French literature. No enrollment limit (expected: 12).

RLFR 226(S) Contemporary Short Stories from North Africa: Fast Cars, Movies, Money,
Love and War*
Today the countries of North Africa are experiencing rapid social change. Rap music and the Spice
Girls can be heard spilling out of windows while television sets broadcast a call to prayer. In the
market place, those selling their goods compete to be heard over the ringing of cell-phones. Old and
new exist side by side, albeit sometimes very uncomfortably. During the past decade, literature has
emerged in both French and Arabic examining the effects of globalization: unequal modernization,
unemployment, cultural change and cultural resistance. In this course, we will read short stories that
address these issues alongside Moroccan, Algerian and Tunisian newspapers on the web in order to
explore contemporary transformations of life in North Africa. Readings by Maissa Bey, Abdelfat-
tah Kilito, Zeina Tabi, Mohamed Zafzaf, Ahmed Bouzfour, Soumaya Zahy and Abdelhak Serhane
among others. Conducted in French.
Requirements: active class participation, reading journal, two short papers, an oral presentation and
a final paper.
Prerequisites: French 109 or above or results of the College Placement Examination, or permission

RLFR 408(S) The Age of Mirrors: Proportions and Disproportions in the
Seventeenth-Century Text
One of the most luminous architectural images of Louis XIV's court is the Hall of Mirrors at Ver-
sailles. As an exercise in decorative bluff, it embodies the aspirations of a culture fascinated by strate-
gies of deception, the simultaneous harmonizing and dislocation of one's sense of space and vision.
This course will examine some of the consequences of this displacement in a literary culture which
too often has been conceived in the strictly neoclassical terms of order and codification. Among the
themes and topics to be considered will be court spectacle, man's disorientation and reconciliation in
the cosmos, the art of silence and conversation, the strategies and limits of rhetoric, the `je ne sais
quoi', the tragic and comic visions, and the portraits of court and bourgeois society. Readings will
include selections from the works of Pascal, Boileau, Descartes, La Fontaine, Corneille, Racine, Mo-
lière, Madame de Sévigné, Saint-Simon, La Bruyère, and Fénelon. Conducted in French.
Requirements: class participation, three shorter papers, an oral presentation, and an hour-long exam.
Prerequisites: French 109, 110, 111 or permission of instructor.

SPANISH
The Spanish major consists of nine courses above the 103-104 level. These nine courses include 301,
any 200 level or above (excluding RLSP 205 and RLSP 303), and 403.
The major seeks to provide training in literary analysis and linguistic expression, as well as an appreci-
ation of Hispanic civilization, through the study of the major writers of the Spanish-speaking world.
Students majoring in Spanish may replace one of their Spanish electives with a course in Comparative
Literature, with one course in Latin-American Studies that is 200-level or higher, or with a course in Lin-
guistics.
Inasmuch as all courses in Spanish assume the active participation of each student in discussions con-
ducted in the foreign language, regular attendance at class meetings is expected.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN SPANISH
Candidates for a senior thesis must have maintained a 3.5 GPA in the major by the time of proposal
submission. Two alternative routes are available to those who wish to apply for the degree with honors.
The first of these involves the writing of a senior thesis. Honors candidates are required to devote to their
theses two semesters of Independent Study (beyond the nine courses required for the major--and the win-
ter study period of their senior year (493-W031-494). The thesis will be written in Spanish and will usually
be in the range of from forty to sixty pages. Candidates are encouraged to submit thesis proposals in May
of their junior year. By the end of the first semester of the senior year, students will normally have finished
the research for the thesis. By the end of the winter study period, candidates will submit to the department a
completed first draft of their work. At this time, the student will make a presentation of his project at a
departmental colloquium. The thesis will be discussed and evaluated to determine whether or not the stu-
dent should continue in the honors program. The second semester of independent thesis work will be spent
revising and rewriting the thesis. The completed dissertation in its final form will be due at the end of April.
The second route is a group of three clearly related courses (offered by the Department of Romance
Languages or by other departments, such as History, Art, Philosophy, English, etc.), only one of which
may be counted in the nine courses comprising the major. One of the courses will be an Independent Study
(plus senior year WSP 030) in the spring of the senior year, at the end of which the student will write an
essay that synthesizes the content of the three related courses. Students may apply for this route by Novem-
ber 2 of the senior year.
In the case of both routes to the degree with honors, the department's recommendation for graduation
with honors will be based on the originality and thoroughness of the finished project.
THE CERTIFICATE IN SPANISH
The Certificate in Spanish Language and Culture consists of a sequence of seven courses for which the
student must earn a cumulative grade average of B or higher. In addition, the student must take a proficien-
cy test and achieve a score of "Advanced." The test will be administered by the department once a year
during the month of April to all students desirous of obtaining the Certificate. Those so interested should
express their intent to the chair of the department by March 1 or earlier.
For students with no prior Spanish background, the course sequence will consist of Spanish 101-102,
Spanish 103 and 104, and three courses in Spanish above the 104 level, with at least one of these courses at
the 200-level or higher taken at Williams. If the student starts out the sequence at Spanish 103, in addition
to the three courses in Spanish beyond the 104 level (including a 200-level course or higher), two electives
may be taken in other departments. One elective should be in Spanish or Latin-American cultural history
(art, literature, drama, music) and the other in Spanish or Latin-American intellectual, political, or social
history. Spanish 200, 201, or 208 can be counted for the elective requirement.
List of possible electives in other departments:
Anthropology 215 The Secrets of Ancient Peru: Archaeology of South America
Anthropology 216 Native Peoples of Latin America
Anthropology 217 Mesoamerican Civilizations
ArtH 200 Art of Mesoamerica
ArtH 209/Anthropology 219 The Art and Archaeology of Maya Civilization: A Marriage Made in

Other electives may likewise be considered as departments create new courses. However, students should
consult with the chair of Romance Languages before making any enrollment decisions.
PLACEMENT
A placement test in Spanish is administered at Williams at the opening of the fall semester. Incoming
first-year students who wish to register for any Spanish courses above the 101 level must take this test.

RLSP 201(F) (formerly 111) The Cultures of Spain
Each of the many cultures and civilizations that has settled in Spain has left its mark. Linguistically,
culturally, and historically Spain is a composite of the groups that have inhabited the peninsula in the
past, which include Iberians, Celts, Phoenicians, Greeks, Carthaginians, Romans,Visigoths, Arabs,
and Jews. The contributions of these different groups, combined with other factors such as geography
and climate, will be our starting point in understanding Spain's past. Today, Spain's cultural diversity
also reflects the many distinct autonomous regions of which the country is composed, such as Cata-
luña and the Basque country, and the recent influx of immigrants from all over the world. In this
course we will consider Spain past and present. We will study periods of tolerance and cultural bril-
liance, such as the co-existence of Arabs and Jews in Medieval Cordoba, as well as times of censor-
ship and repression such as the Inquisition and the post Civil War under Franco. Materials will include
representative works from literature, art, architecture, music, and film. Secondary texts will also be
provided for historical and socio-political background and reference.
Conducted in Spanish.
Requirements: active participation in class discussions, an oral presentation, several short writing as-
signments, a midterm and a final.

RLSP 208(S) The Spanish Civil War in Literature and Film
The Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) has generated a vast bibliography and filmography that to this
day reflect widely antagonistic interpretations of the conflict itself, its roots, and its impact. From the
Spanish perspective, the war is the most important single event in understanding modern Spain. The
ideals, passions, and consequences of the Spanish Civil War still divide Spaniards and have been rec-
reated and relived by writers, artists, and filmmakers, and debated by historians. The course will begin
with a historical introduction to the origins, development, and outcome of the war. Was the Spanish
war a national struggle or an international struggle played out on Spanish soil? Along with studying
internal Spanish political divisions, we will also consider the impact of the foreign policy positions of
other countries-including Germany, Italy, the United States, and Russia--vis-a-vis Spain, as well as
the role of the thousands of foreign volunteers who formed the International Brigades and came from
all over the world to fight against Franco. With this historical basis, we will see how the themes and
issues of the war are reflected in Spanish poetry, short fiction, novels, and films from the time of the
war up through the present day. Readings will include works by Ayala, Cernuda, Neruda, Goytisolo,
Sender, Fernan-Gomez, and Matute. Films will include documentaries as well as classic and contem-
porary features.Conducted in Spanish.
Evaluations will be based on lively class participation, an oral report, short written assignments, and

during this period. Our readings will highlight the reflection of key historical, socio-political, and cul-
tural moments and tendencies in several novels and plays. The eras we will consider are: the immedi-
ate postwar period (the 1940s), the socially and politically engaged 1950s and 1960s, the transition to
democracy and la movida, and finally the 1990s and the beginning of this new century. We will study
the concerns and themes of Spanish literature today and consider their evolution since 1939. A guid-
ing question throughout the course will be the nature of Spain's relationship to its past--especially to
the memory of the Civil War and the post-war--and how this relationship affects Spain's present and
future. Readings will include novels and plays by Carmen Laforet, Camilo José Cela, Antonio Buero
Vallejo, Luis Martín Santos, Carmen Martín Gaite, Antonio Muñoz Molina, Dulce Chacón, Almude-
na Grandes. Conducted in Spanish.

theme of love as constructed by the greatest dramatists and authors of the period. Works by Lope de
Vega, Tirso de Molina, Calderón, Cervantes, San Juan de la Cruz, and others will show us how the
theme was treated from diverse perspectives, and how it related to key concepts such as honor,
religion, and artistic creativity. Conducted in Spanish.

Miguel de Cervantes is rightfully known as the father of the modern novel, and admired worldwide
for his unforgettable Don Quijote. This tutorial will offer the students the opportunity to read another
masterpiece by Cervantes, his collection of short prose works collectively titled La novelas ejem-
plares (The Exemplary Novels). These tales are remarkable for their lively plots and characters, their
heightened consciousness of literary tradition, and above all their courageous--and successful--
originality of design. The tutorial will generally focus on one tale per week, with the possibility of
devoting two weeks to a tale in cases where the narrative requires deeper analysis. Attention will be
given to the structure and design of the tales, the literary world that shaped them, and the often unset-
tling implications of Cervantes' approach to themes such as insanity, woman's honor, man's relation-
ship to Nature and animals, and the role of chance in art and life.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: students will meet in pairs with the instructor one hour per week.
They will write a 5-page paper in alternate weeks, and comment on their tutorial partner's paper in
other weeks. They will be expected to conduct research for each paper (secondary sources will ac-
company each reading) and to formulate their oral and written arguments with great care. The tutorial
is designed to accommodate both Spanish and non-Spanish speakers, paired according to language.
Credit for Spanish major given only to students who take the Spanish option.
Prerequisites: students in the Spanish side will require permission of instructor, or the appropriate re-
sults of the Williams College Placement Test, or evidence of prior College-level work in Spanish liter-
ature. All students must have taken at least one 200-level literature course at Williams.

RLSP 403(F) Senior Seminar: Revolution in Latin American Literature and Film (W)*
What do we mean when we speak of "revolution" in Spanish-American history: a time of sudden and
momentous socio-political change, or a simple rotation, as the word's Latin root (revolvere: to turn
Romance Languages, Russian
­ 296 ­
over) would suggest? This year's senior seminar will investigate the literature and films that have al-
ternately fostered, resisted and recounted the long series of revolutions that punctuate Spanish Ameri-
ca's history from the late 1700's to the present. We will examine the connections between the region's
earliest revolutions (the Haitian Revolution and the Independence Wars) and twentieth-century up-
heavals in Mexico, Cuba and Nicaragua, paying particular attention to the cyclical, even circular
structures of many of these texts. We will explore the relationship between cultural and political dis-
course, in terms of both the propagandistic uses of language and the ways in which changing historical
circumstances (or the desire for historical change) have prompted artists to search for new forms of
creative expression. Other issues to be explored include the individual vs. collective experience of
revolution, and the efforts of marginal subjects (racial minorities, women and gays) to inscribe them-
selves in collective narratives of social change. Writers to be considered may include: Simón Bolívar,
Fray Servando Teresa de Mier, Karl Marx, V.I. Lenin, Joseph Conrad, Alejo Carpentier, Mariano
Azuela, Elena Garro, Carlos Fuentes, Ché Guevara, Nicolás Guillén, Gabriel García Márquez, Ernes-
to Cardenal, Giaconda Belli. Films may include Vámonos con Pancho Villa (Fernando de Fuentes),
De cierta manera (Sara Gómez) and Memorias del subdesarrollo (Gutiérrez Alea).
Format: seminar. Requirements: attendance and active participation, brief reaction papers, oral pre-
sentations, 5-page paper, proposal and 15-page paper.

LANGUAGE STUDY
The department provides language instruction to enable the student to acquire all four linguistic
skills: understanding, speaking, reading, and writing. Russian 101-W088-102 covers the basics of
Russian grammar. Russian 103 and 104 offer additional instruction in grammar and provide extensive
practice in reading and conversation. Russian 201 and 202 aim to develop facility in speaking, writ-
ing, and reading.
STUDY ABROAD
The department strongly encourages students desiring to attain fluency in Russian to spend a se-
mester or year studying in Russia or one of the former Soviet republics. Students generally apply to
one of several approved foreign study programs. Russian 104 or the equivalent and junior standing are
normally prerequisite for study abroad.
LITERATURE AND CULTURE IN TRANSLATION
The department regularly offers courses on Russian literature and culture in English for those stu-
dents who have little or no knowledge of Russian, but who wish to become acquainted with the major
achievements in Russian literary and cultural history.
THE CERTIFICATE IN RUSSIAN
To enhance a student's educational and professional profiles, the Certificate in Russian offers a use-
ful tool for using the language in a wide variety of disciplines. The sequence of language and culture
courses is designed to supplement a student's major at Williams by enabling the student to expand his
or her knowledge in a related field.
The course of study for the certificate gives credit for Russian 101 and 102, which do not count
toward the major. Students who enter Williams with previous training in Russian may substitute more
advanced courses for the 100- and 200-level courses; they can also be exempted from up to two of the
required courses. Thus, in order to earn a certificate a student must take no fewer than five courses
(including three language courses) after enrolling at Williams.
Students must receive a minimum grade of B in each course taken in the sequence. In addition, they
must receive a score of at least 85% on a standardized language proficiency test administered by the
department.

RUSS 402(S) Senior Seminar: Russia Confronts the East
Islamic threat? Noble savage? The true Russia? Since the beginning of her history, Russia has been
confronting the East in a variety of ways. The East has been a source of danger, a target of imperial
ambitions, an exotic dreamland, a place of refuge for rebels and outcasts, a window to the past, and a
crucial touchstone for questions of national destiny, morality, and identity. It has also been an essential
theme of Russian literature, central to such writers as Pushkin, Lermontov, and Tolstoy. Finally, it is a
topic of immense contemporary relevance, as Russia continues to fight a war in the Caucasus and
struggles to define its role vis-à-vis the Middle East and Central Asia. This course will examine the
ways in which the East has been represented in Russian culture, paying special attention to the wider
historical and cultural context. Our texts will range from medieval epics to Romantic travelogues,
from lyric verse to contemporary films, and from literary stars to the justly and unjustly forgotten.
Discussion and primary readings will be in Russian, with additional readings available in English.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class participation, several short position papers, a class
presentation, and a longer research project.

SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY STUDIES (Div. II)
Chair, Professor DONALD deB. BEAVER
Advisory Committee: Professors: ALTSCHULER***, D. BEAVER, DETHIER, KAPLAN,THO-
MAN. Assistant Professor: MLADENOVIC.
Science and Technology Studies (SCST) is an interdisciplinary program concerned with science
and technology and their relationship to society. In addition to being concerned with the historical
development and a philosophical understanding of the ideas and institutions of science and technolo-
gy; Science and Technology Studies also examines their ethical, economic, social, and political im-
plications.
The role that science and technology have played in shaping modern industrial societies is gener-
ally acknowledged, but few members of those societies, including scientists and engineers, possess
any understanding of how that process has occurred or much knowledge of the complex technical
and social interactions that direct change in either science or society. The Science and Technology
Studies Program is intended to help create a coherent course of study for students interested in these
questions by providing a broad range of perspectives. At present, courses are offered which ex-
amine the history or philosophy of science and technology, the sociology and psychology of sci-
ence, the economics of research and development and technological change, science and public
policy, technology assessment, technology and the environment, scientometrics, and ethical-value
issues.
To complete the requirements of the program, students must complete six courses. The introduc-
tory course and senior seminar are required and three elective courses are chosen from the list of
designated electives. Students may choose to concentrate their electives in a single area such as
technology, American studies, philosophy, history of science, economics, environment, current
science, or current technology,but are encouraged to take at least one elective in history, history of
science, or philosophy. The sixth course necessary to complete the program is one semester of labo-
ratory or field science in addition to the College's three-course science requirement. Other science
courses of particular interest include Chemistry 110 and Biology 134.
The program is administered by a chair and an advisory committee of faculty who teach in the pro-
gram. Students who wish to enroll normally register with the chair by the fall of their junior year.

SCST 401(F) Senior Seminar: Critical Perspectives on Science and Technology
A research-oriented course designed to give students direct experience in evaluating and assessing
scientific and technological issues. Students initially study particular techniques and methodologies
by employing a case study approach. They then apply these methods to a major research project. Stu-
dents may choose topics from fields such as biotechnology, computers, biomedical engineering, ener-
gy, and other resource development. Students will apply their background of historical, philosophical,
and technological perspectives in carrying out their study.
Requirements: research paper or project.

WILLIAMS PROGRAM IN TEACHING
Director, SUSAN ENGEL
The program in teaching is designed to enable Williams Undergraduates to study the ideas, ques-
tions, and practices involved in good teaching at all levels. The program seeks to promote and facili-
tate an exchange of ideas about teachers, learners and schools, within and beyond the Williams
campus. The program offers a range of opportunities including courses on education, intensive su-
pervised student teaching, workshops, advising, lecture series, and ongoing peer groups for those
who teach. Students may participate in a variety of ways, ranging from taking one course to a sus-
tained in-depth study of teaching and learning geared to those who want to become teachers, or edu-
cational psychologists. We seek to connect students with one another, to bring in expert teachers to
provide mentoring, and to create links across the curriculum so that students can see the vital con-
nections between what they study (French, Algebra or Biology for instance) and the process of
teaching those topics to elementary and high school students. The program is open to any student
interested in education and offers opportunities for all levels of interest, including those who want
to find out about certification and graduate study. Students seeking certification through an arrange-
ment with the Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts (MCLA) should consult with Susan Engel be-
fore the end of their sophomore year.
The following provides a sample outline of the sequence of courses and experiences that an inter-
ested student might take
zPsychology 101 Intro to Psych (required for further psychology courses);
zPsychology 232 Developmental Psychology and/or
zPsychology 242 Social Psychology;
zPsychology 272 Psychology of Education;
zPsychology 336 Adolescence;
zIn 2004-2005, the programs plans to offer an advanced seminar in teaching, with a significant
emphasis on student teaching.
zAt least one Winter Study in an intensive teaching practicum. The major programs are in Berk-
shire County (under PSYC) or in New York City (under SPEC), although other opportunities
may be listed elsewhere in the Winter Study section of the course catalogue.
No specific major is required to participate in the program--although some lend themselves easily
to certification, such as Mathematics, English, Biology, American history, or French, almost all of our
majors can provide the basis of teacher certification. Alternately, students can major in Psychology,
take a concentration of courses in a different field, and then pursue that content area more intensively
in graduate work.
Other courses of interest include:
Philosophy 208 The Philosophy of Education
Psychology 351 Peer Relations
Mathematics 285 Teaching Mathematics
Economics 359 The Economics of Higher Education
Psychology 342 The Psychology of Leadership

THEATRE (Div. I)
Chair, Professor ROBERT BAKER-WHITE
Professors: BAKER-WHITE, BUCKY, EPPEL*. Assistant Professors: BEAN, JOTTAR. Visiting
Associate Professor: LANDWEHR. Visiting Assistant Professor: SALAMENSKY. Lecturers:
BROTHERS, CATALANO. Visiting Lecturers: SEITEL, B. SHEPARD. Arthur Levitt, Jr. '52 Art-
ist-in-Residence: PLISKA§§.
As a reflection of the theatre's historical relationship to literature and the arts, stage production is
studied in the context of the literary and artistic movements which have informed theatrical endeavor.
The major in Theatre emphasizes the collaborative nature of the discipline by drawing upon courses
offered by faculty of the Language, Literature, Music, and Art Departments. Although students will
be equipped to proceed to graduate and professional schools in theatre, the major is primarily directed
toward those interested in studying the theatre as an artistic phenomenon and as an interpretive tool.
Because a deep understanding of theatre requires training and experience with the synthesis on stage,
the major includes curricular study of production and performance, as well as continued participation
in departmental stage production.
Williamstheatre, the production arm of the Department of Theatre, operates under the supervision
of the departmental faculty. Major departmental productions as well as laboratory and experimental
productions of all kinds are mounted on both the MainStage of the Adams Memorial Theatre, and the
DownStage Theatre. Participation in acting or technical work is open to all members of the Williams
College community. Students majoring in Theatre will be asked to consult regularly with departmen-
tal advisors in devising the sequence of courses and production participation that will constitute their
major.
MAJOR
The Theatre Department course requirements are Theatre 101, Theatre 102, Theatre 301, Theatre
401(F)(S), and one course from Studies in Dramatic Literature (Theatre 311-321) or Theatre 210, 211,
212, 213T, 215, 322T, 325, 328, 329. In addition students are then asked to choose five courses from
the Theatre Department offerings, paying special attention to the prerequisites. Please note that there
are several routes to the major. Students are encouraged to speak with the Chair of the Department in
the spring of their sophomore year at the very latest.

Production requirement for the major: All majors in Theatre are required to participate in a mini-
mum of eight productions in addition to the laboratory requirement for Theatre 102. Participation in at
least three of the eight must be in technical production, and one must be in stage management. Assign-
ment to productions is normally made in consultation with the department and chair.
Theatre majors are strongly urged to include dance and fencing in fulfilling their Physical Educa-
tion requirements.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN THEATRE
Candidates for Honors will apply for admission through the submission of a portfolio to the Depart-
ment Chair by February of their junior year, as well as a description of their proposed project. The
portfolio will be comprised of four parts:
1. The first part will include a list of the courses students have taken relevant to their work towards the
major, This list will include courses offered by the Theatre Department, but may also include classes
taken other Departments. Students should also list and describe relevant independent studies and pro-
duction credits.
2. The second part of the portfolio will include a selection of materials developed for these courses and
productions listed in Part 1. The selection should include at least three papers or samples of other
written work, and might also include design projects, directors notebooks, studio art projects, actor's
journals or other forms of documentation of the candidate's work. For students who have taken a
semester away, it is particularly important that they provide the Department with a detailed picture of
their activities while studying off-campus. Course descriptions and syllabi should be submitted in
addition to a list of courses taken and activities performed.
3. The third part of the portfolio is a annotated bibliography of dramatic texts which the student has
read, drawn from a list supplied by the Department. Annotations should reflect a particular angle of
engagement with the text, that reflects the area or areas that the student has chosen to emphasize in
their theatrical training. For instance, one might choose to write from the point of view of an actor, a
designer, a director, a playwright, or a dramaturg.
4. The portfolio should conclude with a retrospective essay that reflects on the materials that are being
submitted. Students should look for connections between the various aspects of their work, state any
theoretical positions that they have come to embrace, assess their strengths and weaknesses, and dis-
cuss their educational goals for their work with the Department during their Senior year.
The portfolio will be examined alongside the student's record and their project description; a deter-
mination will then be made as to their admission into the Honors program. Students intending to apply
for Honors, should meet with the Department Chair by the end of the fall semester of their junior year.
THEA 101(F) Introduction to Theatre
Introduction to Theatre is intended to prepare students for future courses in acting, directing, dramatic
literature, performance studies, and design by introducing them to the contributions theatre has made
to our global cultural history. We will focus on a diversity of critical moments in the history of theatre.
Examples might be: Aristotle's writings on lyric poetry and the Oedipus play trilogy of Sophocles, the
proliferation of theatrical versions of Harriet Beecher Stowe's anti-slavery novel Uncle Tom' Cabin
throughout the US in the mid-nineteenth century, and the rampant popularity of Tony Kushner's epic,
two-part chronicle of the AIDS pandemic, Angels in America.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: students are responsible for group presentations, play
analyses, a midterm and a final.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 35 per section (expected: 70). Preference given to first-year stu-
dents and sophomores, juniors and seniors by permission of instructor only. Two sections.

THEA 102(S) Introduction to Technical Theatre
As an overview of performance spaces, play technologies, and production, the course will examine
how and where plays are performed, produced, and designed. Students will attend lectures, participate
in labs in drafting and technical production, and will be required to participate on the production crew
of one or more departmental productions.
Prerequisites: Theatre 101.

THEA 201(F) Theatrical Design: Creating the Mise-En-Scene
The designer creates the physical and sensory environment for a dramatic work, building a space that
engages the observer by answering some questions and asking others. This environment-the sets,
lights, costumes, sounds, and the atmosphere that is the synergy of these elements-is the mise-en-
scene. This course examines the designer's process in the creation of this framework: Careful script
reading; formation of a point of view; analysis of physical and emotional requirements; creation of an
overall production concept which supports the point of view; and development of individual design
Theatre
­ 304 ­
elements. We will investigate specific plays, operas, and other dramatic works, and develop and dis-
cuss scenic, lighting, costume and sound designs. Once-a-week lab sessions will focus on developing
the techniques and skills necessary for clear articulation of these designs, including drawing, render-
ing, working in scale, drafting, and model making. The texts for this course will be the texts and scores
of the plays and operas that we will examine as designers.
Every effort will be made to make positions on the design teams of departmental productions avail-
able to students of this class. Students are encouraged to participate as assistant designers, and possi-
bly, if a student's skills and desires and a production's circumstances make it appropriate, as the pri-
mary designer for a major element.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on committed class participation and thoughtful
and thorough completion of weekly design projects. Though instruction in technical skills (such as
drawing and drafting) will be provided, the evaluation will emphasize concept, not technique. Stu-
dents will be graded not upon their technical skills but rather upon the intellectual content of their
designs.
Prerequisites: Theater 102 or ArtS 100 or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 16.
This course is a prerequisite for all upper-level design courses.

THEA 204(F) Interpretation and Performance II
Building on the foundation of Theatre 203, students will develop performance skills in the realist
tradition, primarily through intense scene work. Readings will include selections by Stanislavsky,
Meisner, Adler, or similar theorists. Improvisation may be used to explore simplicity, clarity of ex-
pression, listening, and specificity in the actor's task. Focus on the imagination and creation of charac-
ter will be emphasized through the scene work. The dramatic literature employed will range from ear-
ly realist/naturalist classics to contemporary playwriting. Students will reflect critically on their prog-
ress through written and oral critiques. Scene work will require extensive preparation outside of class.
Prerequisites: Theatre 203. Enrollment limit: 14.

THEA 211(S) Topics in African American Performance: The 1960s, the Civil Rights and Black
Arts Movement*
The 1960s are often said to be the most political moment in African American history because of the
emergence of two sociopolitical movements simultaneously. The black theatre of and about the peri-
od reflects the two movements that shaped it--the mostly Southern, rural-based Civil Rights Move-
ment, and the mostly Northern, urban-centered Black Arts Movement. In this seminar, we will look at
plays that are representative of each movement (such as Purlie Victorious by Ossie Davis and Dutch-
man by Amiri Baraka) and those that are perched stylistically and politically between the two (A Rai-
sin in the Sun by Lorraine Hansberry). We also will spend significant time on The Free Southern The-
ater, active in Jackson, Mississippi and New Orleans; and the New Lafayette Theatre, located in Har-
lem. At the end of the semester, we will look at plays written about the black movements of the 1960s,
such as The Huey P. Newton Story by Robert Guenvenor Smith.
Format: seminar. Requirements: each student will be responsible for leading a discussion on a play
and submitting a 5-page paper summarizing his/her lecture. Students, split into several groups, will
also be responsible for producing a 30-minute excerpt from a play of the period at the end of the se-
mester, as well as a 10-page final paper chosen from a list of topics.
Evaluation will be based on the discussion he/she leads; the short paper summarizing the lecture; the
final paper; the group presentation of a play excerpt; and general discussion participation.
Enrollment limit: 15.

This course provides advanced examination of theatre modes and theories, further explored through
writing exercises and an intensive workshop process. Students will employ their learning toward de-
veloping detailed proposals for the senior year performance or thesis project. We will combine an
overview of different theatrical modes with critical perspectives on theatre--what it is, how it works,
what it should be--from Plato to the present. We will also develop and workshop potential capstone
projects for the senior year, focusing on our processes of transition from theory to practice and from
the page to the stage, where histories, theories, texts, and inspirations become realities.
Format: seminar. Requirements: short analytic papers, senior project proposal, workshop project.
Prerequisites: limited to junior Theatre majors. No enrollment limit (expected: 7).

A study of the art and techniques of stage lighting. This class will provide instruction in the basic
physics of light and color; the use of angle, intensity, color, texture and movement of light as composi-
tional tools; various kinds of stage lighting instruments and their uses; conceptual development of a
lighting design; translation of concept into light plot and channel hookup; focusing the plot in the the-
ater; and writing cues.
Texts for the course will be the texts and scores of the plays, operas and other dramatic works that we
will examine from the lighting designer's perspective, supplemented with readings that address the
technical aspects of stage lighting. The class format will be a combination of lecture/discussion ses-
sions and practical labs.
Every effort will be made to provide students with lighting design opportunities on departmental pro-
ductions as a part of their coursework, in accordance with students' abilities and interests and in con-
sultation with directors and other faculty. Students are encouraged to seek out lighting design opportu-
nities outside the department as well, and may incorporate these projects into their coursework.
Evaluation will be based on class participation, successful completion of weekly projects, thorough
technical understanding of a basic stage lighting system, and performance on a final exam.

THEA 330(S) The Aesthetics of Resistance: Contemporary Latino/a-American Theatre and
Performance (Same as American Studies 330)*
This course explores the theories and current practices of Latin American theatre and performance.
Particularly how Latin American theatre and performance has developed within, against and after
contexts of dictatorships and neocolonialism. We will analyze how Latino/a American theorists/prac-
titioners use the scripted and the performative to intervene in social spaces. We will explore how they
construct counter-public spheres, and how their performances create aesthetics of resistance. The first
half of the course focuses on Latin America and the second half examines if these aesthetics of resist-
ance are performed by Latino/as in the context of the United States.
Format: seminar. Requirements: class participation and presentations, one short essay (5-7 pages) and
two longer essays (7-10 pages). Students are expected to visit the Hemispheric Institute of Perfor-
mance and Politics website (http//hemi.ps.tsoa.nyu.edu).

identities are manifested through various forms of expressive culture. We will explore the notions of
transculturation and mestizaje as theoretical tools to understand the production of race as representa-
tional discourse, particularly through music and dance practices. We will pay particular attention to
the intersections of class, race, gender and sexuality. Our focus will be on Cuba, Brazil, and Puerto
Rico, as well as on the U.S. based Diaspora.
Format: seminar. Requirements: class participation and presentations, two short essays (3-4 pp.) and
one final essay (10 pp.)

THEA 333(F) World/Theatre/History: Contemporary to Classical (Same as Comparative
Literature 323 and English 320)
In this course, we will examine world dramatic and theatre history via select plays and production
styles--with a twist. Our investigation will proceed from the familiar--the postmodern present--to
less familiar works of the earliest historical periods. We tend to regard historic works with, at once,
insufficient reverence (stepping-stones toward later advancements), and, at the same time, with ex-
cess reverence (stiff, near-untouchable `classics'). Moving from the modern period inversely `for-
ward' to world antiquities, with major stops (eighteenth century through middle ages) in-between, we
will explore historic forms deeply and freshly, in all their beauty, bizarrity, theoretical, complexity,
and performance potential. A course for Theatre, English, and Literature scholars, playwrights, direc-
tors, actors, designers, techies--and for students who don't really like theatre, but wish they did.
Format: lecture/seminar. Evaluation will be based on weekly responses, midterm and final papers,
and a final project.
Prerequisites: one 100-level course in Theatre, English, Comparative Literature or permission of
instructor. Enrollment limit: 15 (expected: 15). Preference given to Theatre/English/Comparative Lit-

THEA 401(F), 402(S) Advanced Project in Theatre
To complete the degree in theatre, majors are required to complete an independent project for their
senior year, either in fall (Theatre 401) or in the spring (Theatre 402). In the fall of the junior year,
students should propose several possible projects to the Department, which may or may not include a
production component. Part of THEA 301 (The Junior Seminar) will be devoted to guiding senior
project proposals. By the end of the fall semester in the junior year, final proposals should be sub-
mitted for consideration by the Department. Collaborative projects between two or more seniors are
preferable. A collaborative project involving the entire class is also a possibility, and this should be
discussed with the Chair of the Department early in the junior year. The schedule in the junior year for
proposals for the senior theatre project is:
1) Initial, BRIEF proposals (several per student) submitted to the Department by October 16.
2) Proposals reviewed by the Department and returned to the students for revision by November 1.
3) Final proposals submitted by students to the Department by December 1.
Format: seminar/production.

Women's and Gender Studies can be defined as the study of how gender is constructed, how it is
inflected by differences of race, ethnicity, sexuality, class, and so on, how gender affects the experi-
ences and situations of men and women, and how assumptions about gender influence the construc-
tion of knowledge and experience. Scholarship in Women's and Gender Studies has brought ne-
glected material into established fields and raised important methodological questions that cross dis-
ciplinary boundaries and challenge established intellectual frameworks. The program in Women's
and Gender Studies thus includes courses from a wide variety of disciplines that focus in a coherent
way on gender issues, as well as core courses that acquaint students with the interdisciplinarity of the
field.
THE MAJOR
The Women's and Gender Studies major encourages exposure to the interdisciplinary character of
feminist scholarship. In addition, majors are required to gain some knowledge of methods within a
field or discipline (3 courses in one of the categories listed below), to appreciate the importance of
diversity (racial, sexual, class, ethnic, national, etc.) in scholarship on gender, to gain exposure to fem-
inist theory, and to pursue work at an advanced level (3 courses at the 300-level).
In order to ensure that students reflect about the paths that they choose through the major, each
major will be assigned to an advisor in the spring of the sophomore year. With the advisor, the student
will establish a revisable course of study for the following two years. Students interested in declaring a
major should contact the chair of the Program (Sawicki, x2305).
[ ] Courses not offered in 2003-2004 are listed in brackets.
Required Courses
The major consists of at least 9 courses. The following are required:
Women's and Gender Studies 101 Introduction to Women's and Gender Studies

WGST 101(F,S) Introduction to Women's and Gender Studies (W)
This team-taught lecture and discussion course introduces a range of feminist issues, theories, and contro-
versies. It has several aims: to provide critical and analytical tools for thinking about gender as it is inflected
by race, class, sexuality, and culture; to explore key issues confronting women in American society, and to
discuss strategies for addressing them. The course will examine issues such as: body politics, sexuality,
reproductive freedom, sexual violence, gender and work, motherhood and family.
Requirements: regular short essays, class presentations, and two 5- to 6-page papers, with revisions. Evalu-

CRITICAL REASONING AND
ANALYTICAL SKILLS (CRAAS) COURSES
To one degree or another, every class at Williams goes beyond its subject--be it mathematics, Ma-
chiavelli, or modernism--to teach intellectual skills that have wide application in other fields as well
as outside of the academy: scientific reckoning, expository writing, rhetorical analysis, oral presenta-
tion, and so on.
Courses offered under the CRAAS initiative foreground such analytical skills. While each CRAAS
class covers a different topic, all are aimed particularly at developing the processes necessary for ex-
cellence in a range of fields: techniques for analyzing ideas, data, texts or artworks; approaches to
interpreting, synthesizing, and developing arguments; strategies for presenting ideas and results.
CRAAS classes typically emphasize the practices of meta-analysis--self-criticism, editing, and re-
vision--with the goal of constant improvement. Many classes feature peer tutoring, small group
work, and intensive one-on-one engagement with the professor. Students should leave a CRAAS
course with a substantially heightened ability to approach problems, analyze texts, and craft argu-
ments in whatever discipline they may go on to explore.
A few CRAAS courses are restricted to advanced students, but the majority are open to all, and
some are specifically targeted for first year students. Most have strictly limited enrollment. Because
these classes cultivate the general strategies of effective scholarship, students are encouraged to con-
sider taking a CRAAS course early in their academic careers.

PEOPLES AND CULTURES COURSES
The peoples and cultures requirement is intended to help students to begin to understand the cultural
diversity of American society and the world at large, so that, as citizens of an increasingly interconnected
world, they may become better able to respond sensitively and intelligently to peoples of varied social
backgrounds and cultural frameworks. Courses which fulfill this requirement are thus designed to familiar-
ize students with some dimension of American cultural diversity or that of the non-Western world. Each
student must complete one graded semester course primarily concerned with: (a) the peoples and cultures
of North America that trace their origins to Africa, Asia, Latin America, Oceania, or the Caribbean; Native-
American peoples and cultures; or (b) the peoples and cultures of Africa, Asia, Latin America, Oceania, or
the Caribbean. Although this course, which may be counted toward the divisional distribution requirement,
may be completed any semester before graduation, students are urged to complete the course by the end of
the sophomore year.

QUANTITATIVE/FORMAL REASONING COURSES
Williams students should be adept at reasoning mathematically and abstractly. The ability to apply
a formal method to reach conclusions, to use numbers comfortably, and to employ the research tools
necessary to analyze data lessen barriers to carrying out professional and economic roles. Prior to their
senior year, all students must satisfactorily complete a Quantitative/Formal Reasoning (QFR)
course--those marked with a "(Q)." Students requiring extra assistance (as assessed during First
Days) are normally placed into Mathematics 100/101, which is to be taken before fulfilling the QFR
requirement.
The hallmarks of a QFR course are the representation of facts in a language of mathematical sym-
bols and the use of formal rules to obtain a determinate answer. Primary evaluation in these courses is
based on multistep mathematical, statistical, or logical inference (as opposed to descriptive answers).
Courses that may be used to meet the requirement in 2003-2004:

RELATED COURSE LISTINGS
There are a number of significant areas of studies in which Williams offers many relevant courses,
yet no formal program. To alert students to the opportunity for integrating courses from diverse disci-
plines into a focus area and to encourage them to do so, the courses in this section are organized as lists
of topic-related courses. For their full descriptions, see the respective departmental sections.
Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual Studies
Gay, lesbian, and bisexual studies focuses on the social construction of sexuality, past and present.
Although, at present, Williams does not have a formal concentration in gay, lesbian, and bisexual
studies, the College offers a number of courses which examine how social, cultural, and political insti-
tutions shape sexualities, as well as the responses and resistances thereto, through a variety of texts
and contexts. The following courses include significant components on gay, lesbian, and bisexual
studies (at least two weeks out of the semester).

WRITING-INTENSIVE COURSES
Courses designated as "writing intensive"--those marked with a "(W)"--stress the process of
learning to write effectively. Such courses include a substantial amount of writing (a minimum of 20
pages), usually divided into several discrete assignments. Instructors pay close attention to matters of
style and argumentation. Enrollments are limited to 19.
All Williams College students are required to take two writing-intensive courses: one by the end of
the sophomore year and one by the end of the junior year. Students will benefit most from writing-in-
tensive courses by taking them early in their college careers and are therefore strongly encouraged to
complete the requirement by the end of the sophomore year.
Courses that may be used to meet the requirement in 2003-2004:

WILLIAMS OFF-CAMPUS PROGRAMS
WILLIAMS-EXETER PROGRAMME AT OXFORD UNIVERSITY
Director, Professor CHRIS WATERS
THE PROGRAMME
Williams College offers a year-long programme of studies at Oxford University in co-operation
with Exeter College (founded in 1314), one of the constituent colleges of the University. Williams
students will be enrolled as Visiting Students at Exeter and as such will be undergraduate members of
the University, eligible for access to virtually all of its facilities, libraries, and resources. As Visiting
Students in Oxford, students admitted to the Programme will be fully integrated into the intellectual
and social life of one of the world's great universities.
Although students in the Programme will be members of Exeter College, entitled to make full use
of Exeter facilities (including the College Library), dine regularly in Hall, and join all College clubs
and organisations on the same terms as other undergraduates at Exeter, students will reside in Ephraim
Williams House, a compound of four buildings owned by Williams College, roughly 1.4 miles north
of the city centre. Three students from Exeter College will normally reside in Ephraim Williams
Williams-Exeter Programme at Oxford

House each year, responsible for helping to integrate Williams students into the life of the College and
the University. A resident director (and member of the Williams Faculty) administers Ephraim Wil-
liams House, overseas the academic programme, and serves as both the primary academic and per-
sonal advisor to Williams students in Oxford.
Students enrolled in the Oxford Programme must enroll for the full academic year, which consists
of three academic terms, each of which includes eight full weeks of instruction: MICHAELMAS
TERM (early October to early December), HILARY TERM (mid-January to mid-March), and TRIN-
ITY TERM (late April to late June). Students are expected to be in residence to write their first tutorial
papers before the eight weeks of instruction begins and to remain in residence during the week after
the term ends in order to sit their final examinations. Between the three terms there are two intervening
four-five week vacations, during which students may be expected to continue reading as preparation
for their upcoming tutorials.
THE TUTORIAL SYSTEM
Undergraduate instruction at Oxford University is largely carried out through individual or small-
group tutorials, in which students meet weekly with their tutor to present and discuss an essay they
have written, based on an extensive amount of reading undertaken from an assigned reading list they
will receive at the beginning of each term. In addition to the weekly tutorial, students are from time to
time encouraged to attend a pertinent course of lectures offered by the University that corresponds to
the material being addressed in their tutorials.
Each student will plan a course of study for the three terms of the academic year in consultation
with the director of the Programme. In his or her capacity as the Tutor for Visiting Students at Exeter
College, the director, working closely with Exeter's subject tutors, will arrange the teaching for the
students, monitor student progress, be in regular contact with the student's tutors, supervise the ex-
aminations that students will sit at the end of each academic term, and report on each student's aca-
demic progress to the Senior Tutor at Exeter College. There are no "add/drop" periods at Oxford; once
a student has made a commitment to a particular tutorial course, and the director has then secured a
tutor to teach that course, students cannot back out.
Over the course of the three terms, students are required to enroll in a minimum of FOUR full tutori-
al courses (each consisting of eight individual tutorial meetings and requiring the preparation of eight
essays) and ONE half tutorial course (consisting of four individual tutorial meetings and the prepara-
tion of four essays). Some students choose to substitute a fifth full tutorial course for the half tutorial
course and a few will decide to enroll in two full tutorial courses each term. The average course load
undertaken by most students in residence in Oxford during the past has been five full tutorial courses
or their equivalent.
GRADES AND CREDIT
Grades for each tutorial course reflect the grade assigned to all eight (or four) tutorial sessions, in-
cluding their related essays, considered together, as well as the grade for the final examination on
work accomplished in the individual tutorials and supplementary readings. Final examinations last
three hours in the case of full tutorial courses and two hours in the case of half tutorial courses and are
always sat in the ninth week of term, following the eight weeks of instruction each term. The final
grade recorded on the Williams transcript is calculated by counting the grade for the tutorial meetings
and essays as two-thirds of the grade and the final examination as one-third of the overall grade. For
some tutorial courses (especially in writing and the studio arts), tutors may offer the student the option
of a final paper or project in lieu of an examination.
Upon satisfactory completion of the requirements for the Williams-Exeter Programme at Oxford
University, students receive academic credit for a regular Williams academic year, the four tutorial
courses replacing the regular eight semester courses the student would normally take at Williams, the
half tutorial course replacing the Winter Study Course. Grades eventually become a part of their Wil-
liams transcript in the summer after their completion of the Programme and are included in the com-
putation of their Grade Point Average.
Tutorial courses in Oxford may be used toward fulfilling the divisional distribution requirement; a
student may earn a year maximum of three distribution requirements, with no more than one from
each division, for the year. All tutorial courses at Oxford meet the Williams College "Writing Inten-
sive" designation, except for those in the studio arts, mathematics, and the sciences.
Tutorial courses in Oxford may also be used to meet major requirements. Some departments at Wil-
liams will grant a two-course credit towards the major for each full tutorial course taken at Oxford,
and one course towards the major for each half tutorial course taken at Oxford. Most departments,
however, will grant a one-course credit towards the major for each relevant tutorial course taken at
Oxford (whether a full or a half). Students are encouraged to check with their department chair(s) to
confirm official department policy.
THE COURSE OF STUDY
Students are encouraged to pursue a course of study during their three terms at Oxford that both
reflects the strength of the University's offerings and the interests of the Tutorial Fellows at Exeter
College (go to the Exeter College website--www.exeter.ox.ac.uk--click on "About the College,"
Williams-Exeter Programme at Oxford
­ 325 ­
then click on "The Rector and Fellows," and then on "Fellows arranged by subject"). In addition to the
opportunity to pursue British and Commonwealth Studies, students in Oxford will be able to pursue
tutorial work in fields which are represented only marginally or infrequently in the Williams curricu-
lum (Classics, Theology, etc.) and in fields in which Oxford is particularly noted (English Literature,
History, Modern Languages, Philosophy, Politics, etc.). Exeter also has a Fellow in English Literature
(with interests ranging from the Renaissance--including Shakespeare--to the mid-nineteenth centu-
ry) committed to teaching Williams students, and students are thus encouraged to consider undertak-
ing at least one tutorial course in these fields as part of their course of study.
What follows is a list of tutorial courses normally available to students studying with the Williams-
Exeter Programme at Oxford. The tutorials listed below (WIOX 311-382) represent a selection of
some of the standard "papers" (courses) that comprise the Oxford degrees in various subjects and that
are taught in tutorial format. Normally, but not always, tutors can be secured who can teach these sub-
jects to Williams students, although demand, leave patterns, and other constraints, sometimes mean
that not all of these subjects can be staffed in all terms. Students are normally free to choose the term in
which they want to undertake most of these tutorial courses, although in some cases it is recom-
mended that they enroll in them during the term in which the accompanying lectures are being deliv-
ered. Where this is the case, the suggested terms are listed in parentheses following the tutorial course
description.
While many students enroll in the tutorial courses listed below (WIOX 311-382), roughly half the
tutorial courses selected by students come under the heading of WIOX 390, a general rubric for more
specialized tutorial work. This is described in more detail below.

WIOX 390 Specially Arranged Subjects
Specially arranged tutorial courses in some subject areas other than those covered by the WIOX 311-382
courses--or in some non-listed subfields of the areas covered--might also be possible. It must be stressed,
however, that a WIOX 390 is not simply what would be called an "independent study" course at Williams.
Rather, a WIOX 390 is normally a "paper" (course) regularly offered at Oxford as either a required or
optional part of the degree in various disciplines and normally taken by Oxford students in their second or
third year of residence. For a list of the "papers" that make up the degree requirements in certain fields,
students should consult the University of Oxford Examination Regulations, a recent copy of which can be
found in the Dean's Office. Guidelines for how to make sense of this complex and weighty tome (the
equivalent of the Williams College Bulletin) are available from the Dean's Office and also from the direc-
tor. Students might also wish to consult the various department websites at Oxford on-line, some of which
list the papers taught as part of the degree offerings by that department (go to the Oxford University home
page--www.ox.ac.uk--and then click on "Departments"). It is often easier to find tutors for a WIOX 390
in some fields (Classics, English, History, Philosophy, Theology, etc.) than in others (Psychology, the natu-
ral sciences, etc.). Again, students should first familiarize themselves with the curricular strengths of Exeter
College before requesting a WIOX 390 course. All WIOX 390 tutorial courses must be approved by the
director. Students should also realize that it is not always possible for the Programme to accommodate their
requests.
A sample list of Specially Arranged Subjects (WIOX 390) staffed during the past three years is offered
below. This list is not comprehensive. Furthermore, students who wish to undertake work under the gener-
al rubric of a WIOX 390 are encouraged to consult the appropriate catalogues and websites rather than
simply opt to undertake WIOX 390 tutorial course work that other students in the past have undertaken.

NON-CREDIT FOREIGN LANGUAGE STUDY
In addition to their regular tutorial courses, students may begin or continue the study of a wide
range of foreign languages on a non-credit basis through a variety of arrangements available through
the University as well as a number of other educational and cultural institutions in the city of Oxford.
The Programme normally subsidizes such study.
STUDENT LIFE
By virtue of the fact that, while in Oxford, they are officially Visiting Students at the University--and
full members of Exeter College--Williams students are offered every opportunity to become fully inte-
grated into student life in Oxford. Both Exeter College and Oxford University are home to an exceptional
variety of sports clubs, debating societies, interest groups, cultural organizations, and social activities, virtu-
ally all of which are available to Visiting Student members of the University. Students are encouraged to
participate fully in the social life of Exeter College--to dine in Hall as often as they wish, to frequent the
College bar, to use the College's athletic facilities, and to become members of the various College clubs
and organizations. Furthermore, Williams students also have access to the University's athletic events, con-
certs, theatrical productions, museums, and libraries. All Williams students in Oxford are provided with
membership in the Oxford Union, which, in addition to its debating activities and club rooms, possesses
dining facilities and the largest lending library in the University.
At the Ephraim Williams House, all Williams students are housed in capacious double rooms and enjoy
full access to the House's library (recently expanded and refurbished), common rooms, laundry facilities,
computer lab, and a large dining room, in which a weekly catered meal is served during the eight weeks of
term. There are also a number of small kitchens in the House which students may use. All rooms are fully
wired for high-speed internet access and are fully equipped with furnishings, bed linens, and a telephone.
The grounds include a courtyard where basketball can be played, sheltered bike racks, barbecue facilities, a
reflective garden and a gnome garden. A number of student jobs are available during the academic year for
students who wish to earn a little spending money by helping to maintain the facilities and organize Pro-
gramme activities. Ephraim Williams House is a short bike or bus ride (or a twenty-minute walk) from
Exeter College and the center of town, and is within easy walking distance of the University parks and the
local shops, restaurants and banks of Summertown. The Programme will partially subsidize student bus
passes or bicycle purchase or rental to facilitate travel around Oxford.
Before the academic year begins--at the end of September and in early October--ten days of orienta-
tion activities are scheduled. Students are expected to be in residence for all of these many activities, some
of which take place in Ephraim Williams House, others at Exeter College. At this time students will be-
come acquainted with the workings of the Programme, of Exeter College, and of the University, and will
be familiarized with the rules and regulations they are expected to abide by during their residence in Ox-
ford.
Throughout the academic year, provision will be made for trips to a number of sites of historical, cultur-
al, or political interest. In the past these have included the Cotswolds, Stratford, Stonehenge, Bath, Wells,
Warwick Castle, Blenheim Palace, and various sites of interest in London. Students will also be given the
opportunity to attend a number of theatrical productions and other cultural events. Oxford's proximity to
London gives students ready access to that city's multiple attractions and many resources. The Oxford-
London train service is frequent and the journey takes just over an hour. The buses to London run even
more regularly (and are cheaper), and the one-way journey takes about ninety minutes. In recent years,
Williams-Exeter Programme at Oxford, Williams-Mystic Maritime Studies Program
­ 330 ­
students have also enjoyed a group overseas excursion at the outset of the break between Hilary and Trinity
terms, in 2002 to San Sebastian and Bilbao, in 2003 to Nice and Monte Carlo.
During the summer before students arrive in Oxford, they will receive a copy of the latest edition of
Ephs Among the Dreaming Spires, which will further explain the perks, policies, and procedures of
the Programme, the rules and regulations they are expected to follow, and tips for how best to enjoy a
fulfilling year in and around Oxford.
ILLNESS AND INSURANCE
Students must ensure they are covered either by the Williams College health insurance policy or by
some other comprehensive health insurance plan (generally a family health insurance policy). While in
Britain, students will be covered by the National Health Service (NHS) for routine visits at the Group Med-
ical Practice used by Exeter College and for emergency hospital treatment. Prescription drugs are available
through the NHS for a nominal fee. There are limited outpatient psychological counseling services avail-
able through the NHS and the Programme, although, as Visiting Students at the University, Williams stu-
dents are entitled to make use of the University Counseling Centre. Any extensive or long-term counseling,
however, would need to be covered by the student's personal health insurance policy. Finally, students are
not likely to be covered under the NHS for medical services received in foreign countries, especially those
countries that do not enjoy membership of the European Union.
FEES
The tuition and room fees paid by students on the Williams-Exeter Programme at Oxford are the same
as those for a year spent in residence at Williams. Students are responsible for some of their own meals and
for all of their personal expenses. They are also responsible for the cost of their air travel to and from Brit-
ain, although they may select to take the group flight to London arranged by the Programme at competitive
rates. They are provided with three meals a day for the first four or five days in Oxford and with a weekly
catered meal in Ephraim Williams House during the eight weeks of term. They may also eat lunch and
dinner on any day of the week at Exeter. They will pay a small charge for lunch at Exeter, but dinner will be
provided free of charge. Students will not be charged the full Williams board fee during their year in Ox-
ford, but they will pay a proportion of the board fee to help cover these costs. For planning purposes, stu-
dents and their parents should expect the cost of a year on the Programme to be roughly the same as a year
at Williams. Financial aid eligibility will be figured on the usual basis of tuition, fees, room, board, and
personal and book expenses, as if the student were at Williams for the year. Similarly, the normal self-help
contribution would be expected. Since the academic year ends later at Oxford than at Williams, the sum-
mer earning expectations for students for the following year will be reduced by one half and the difference
will be made up by additional Williams aid.
APPLICATION
Admission to the Programme is on a competitive but flexible basis. Students must apply to the Dean's
Office by the prescribed deadline (normally early in February) and, prior to applying, should consult with
the chair of their major department. Any questions students might have about curricular offerings at Ox-
ford can also be raised with the director of the Programme in Oxford. In addition to completing the formal
application form, students can expect to be interviewed at Williams and will subsequently need to com-
plete an application for Visiting Student status at Oxford University. All admissions to the Programme are
subject to approval by Exeter College. Students can expect to be notified of acceptance before Spring
Break. It is normally expected that they will have completed the College's distribution requirement by the
end of their sophomore year. In making its decisions, the Admissions Committee of the Williams-Exeter
Programme at Oxford University takes student GPA into account, expects all applicants to have demon-
strated capacity for rigorous independent work and extensive essay writing, and looks favorably on those
students whose intellectual maturity, curiosity and enthusiasm would best prepare them for a demanding
course of study in Oxford. All applicants must identify two Williams faculty members who are willing to
provide references (the Committee will contact those faculty members). Because of the emphasis at Ox-
ford on weekly written work for each tutorial course, at least one of those faculty members should be able
to offer an assessment of the applicant's writing ability.
WILLIAMS-MYSTIC MARITIME STUDIES PROGRAM
Director, JAMES T. CARLTON
Faculty: MARY K. BERCAW EDWARDS (University of Connecticut), JAMES T. CARLTON
(Williams College), JANA DAVIS (Williams College), GLENN S. GORDINIER (University of
Connecticut), CATHERINE ROBINSON HALL (Mystic Seaport).
Williams College sponsors a one-semester interdisciplinary program which includes credit for one
winter study in American Maritime Studies in cooperation with Mystic Seaport Museum. Courses are
taught as part of the College's off-campus program in Mystic, Connecticut. Students apply for either
the fall or the spring semester and take four of five courses offered. Students also take part in a non-
credit maritime skills class of their choice, choosing from celestial navigation, sailing, music of the
sea, art of the sea, ship smithing, and the outdoor demonstration squad. Students live in cooperative
Williams-Mystic Maritime Studies Program

WINTER STUDY PROGRAM
REMINDERS ABOUT WSP REGISTRATION
All students who will be on campus during the 2003-2004 academic year must register for WSP.
Registration will take place in the early part of fall semester. If you are registered for a senior thesis in
the fall which must be continued through Winter Study by departmental rules, you will be registered
for your Winter Study Project automatically. In every other case, you must complete registration.
First-year students are required to participate in a Winter Study that will take place on campus; they
are not allowed to do 99's.
Even if you plan to take a 99, or the instructor of your first choice accepts you during the registration
period, there are many things that can happen between registration and the beginning of Winter Study
to upset your first choice, so you must list five choices. You should try to make one of your choices a
project with a larger enrollment, not that it will guarantee you a project, but it will increase your
chances.
If you think your time may be restricted in any way (ski meets, interviews, etc.), clear these restric-
tions with the instructor before signing up for his/her project.
Remember, for cross-listed projects, you should sign up for the subject you want to appear on your
record.
For many beginning language courses, you are required to take the WSP Sustaining Program in
addition to your regular project. You will be automatically enrolled in this Sustaining Program, so no
one should list this as a choice.
The grade of honors is reserved for outstanding or exceptional work. Individual instructors may
specify minimum standards for the grade, but normally, fewer than one out of ten students will qualify.
A grade of pass means the student has performed satisfactorily. A grade of perfunctory pass signifies
that a student's work has been significantly lacking but is just adequate to deserve a pass.
If you have any questions about a project, see the instructor before you register.
Finally, all work for WSP must be completed and submitted to the instructor no later than Thursday,
January 29th. Only the Dean can grant an extension beyond this date.
WINTER STUDY 99'S
Sophomores, juniors and seniors are eligible to propose "99's," independent projects arranged with
faculty sponsors, conducted in lieu of regular Winter Study courses. Perhaps you have encountered an
interesting idea in one of your courses which you would like to study in more depth, or you may have
an interest not covered in the regular curriculum. In recent years students have undertaken in-depth
studies of particular literary works, interned in government offices, assisted in foreign and domestic
medical clinics, conducted field work in economics in developing countries, and given performances
illustrating the history of American dance. Although some 99's involve travel away from campus,
there are many opportunities to pursue intellectual or artistic goals here in Williamstown.
99 forms are available online:
http://www.williams.edu/Registrar/winterstudy/99direct.html
The deadline for submitting the proposals to faculty sponsors is Thursday, 25 September.

ANTHROPOLOGY AND SOCIOLOGY
ANSO 011 Berkshire Farm Internship
A field placement at Berkshire Farm Center and Services for Youth in Canaan, New York. Berkshire
Farm Center is a residential treatment facility for troubled, at-risk adolescent boys who have been
remanded to the Farm by the Family Court. These youths come primarily from lower socio-economic
strata, are very ethnically diverse, and hail from both urban and rural areas throughout New York
State. The problems that they bring to Berkshire Farm are multiple. These include: the psychological
scars of dysfunctional families, including those of physical, emotional, and sexual abuse; chemical
dependency; juvenile delinquency; inability to function in school settings; and various other issues.
Residential treatment is a multi-modal approach that includes anger-replacement training, social
skills training, and behavioral modification.
Williams students will commute to Berkshire Farm and work under supervision in one of the follow-
ing areas: school, cottage life, chemical dependency unit, research, recreation, performing arts, or in
individual tutoring.
Requirements: students will keep a journal reflecting on their experiences, and a weekly seminar with
the instructor will draw on service learning experience. Students will also be required to submit a final
10-page paper at the end of the course.
Prerequisites: interview with instructor. Enrollment limit: 15--please note: all queries about this
course should be directed to the instructor, who can be reached at 518-781-4567 ext. 322.

ANSO 012 Children and the Courts: Internship in the Crisis in Child Abuse
The incidence of reported child abuse and neglect has reached epidemic proportions and shows no
signs of decreasing. Preventive and prophylactic social programs, court intervention, and legislative
mandates have not successfully addressed this crisis. This course allows students to observe the Mas-
sachusetts Department of Social Services attorney in courtroom proceedings related to the care and
protection of children. Students will have access to Department records for purposes of analysis and
will also work with social workers who will provide a clinical perspective on the legal cases under
study. The class will meet regularly to discuss court proceedings, assigned readings, and the students'
interactions with local human services agencies. Access to an automobile is desirable but not re-
quired; some transportation will be provided as part of the course.
Requirements: full participation, a journal, and a 10-page paper to be submitted at the end of the
course.
Enrollment limit: 15--please note: all queries about this course must be directed to the instructor,

ANTHROPOLOGY
ANTH 013 Deciphering Ancient Maya Civilization
Ancient Maya civilization of the first millennium A.D. was one of the most advanced and complex
societies of pre-Hispanic Central America. Its art, monuments, ruined cities and writing have fasci-
nated art historians, visitors and scholars alike. After a short introduction to Maya civilization and
archaeology, the course will focus on the Maya hieroglyphic writing systems. We will then apply the
principles of Maya epigraphy to translate a variety of texts from stone monuments and from elaborate
and beautiful polychrome vases of important sites such as Tikal, Dos Pilas, Aguateca, Yaxchilan, and
Palenque. The final project will consist of creating your own stela about your life using the Maya hi-
eroglyphic writing system.
Requirements: two or three small papers.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20 (expected: 10).
Meeting time: afternoons; 2 or 3 sessions per week of two-or three hours.

SOCIOLOGY
SOC 012 Organizational Communications
Students will examine the central role communication plays in a variety of organizations including
business, government, education, and non-profits. This discussion course will be taught using the
case-based approach and simulations to provide understanding of how theory translates into practice.
We will use cases developed by the Harvard Business School and Harvard Negotiation Project. Cases
will focus on interpersonal communication, group dynamics, negotiation and conflict resolution,
communicating change, influence and persuasion, and ethics. Students will be responsible for learn-
ing how to diagnose specific organizational communication problems and developing appropriate re-
sponses for effectively managing organizational communication. You will be expected to improve on
how well you demonstrate effective critical thinking, problem-solving, and communication skills.
Format: Case discussion and role-playing. Students will be expected to meet in small study groups in
the afternoon or evening before class to discuss their findings with other classmates and to "warm up"
for the class case discussions.
Students will be evaluated on their ability to work together in problem set reviews, preparation of two
summary papers of five pages each, and active case discussion in the classroom. (Students will be ex-
pected to do 85% of the talking in class.)
Enrollment is limit: 20.

The course would concern itself with the role of women as architects in a traditionally male dominated
field. It would begin with the role of the wife in shaping the "look" of the house; to the winning entry
of Sophia Hayden's Woman's Building in the Chicago Columbia Exposition in 1890; to the break
through work of Julia Morgan for William Randolph Hearst and ultimately to more modern and pro-
gressive architects and urban designers of today. Guest lectures will be delivered by architects in cur-
rent practice, and a field trip will be scheduled.
Requirements: one 10-page paper and reading as assigned.

ARTH 012 Master Drawings
This course will provide an introduction to European master drawings, from the Italian and German
Renaissance to the present day, primarily through the study of actual works in the distinguished
collection of the Clark Art Institute. We will begin with the materials, technique and function of draw-
ing in the artist's working process. Then we will discuss how these informal working sketches became
desirable to collectors, a subject of critical study, and eventually a key factor in the practice of con-
noisseurship, a fundamental discipline in traditional art history. We will also consider finished draw-
ings produced for exhibition and sale, the effect of the invention of photography in the nineteenth
century, and the changing role of drawing through the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Above
all, we will consider the nature of style in drawing and in the finished paintings or objects created
through it in relation to the personality of the individual artist and his development.
The course, depending on enrollment and other factors, will include field trips to Cambridge, to spend
a day in the drawings study of the Fogg Art Museum at Harvard, and to New York, to view the January
exhibitions of drawings at major auction houses and dealers.
Evaluation will be based on classroom performance and a 10- to 15-page research paper, or (subject to
approval by the instructor) a substantial artistic project.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15. Preference given to advanced Art majors.
Meeting time: afternoons; 6 two-hour sessions at the Clark after an introductory classroom meeting,
with one or two extra meetings for discussion and research preparation, as needed. There will be two
full-day field trips.
Costs to student: $60 in textbooks; approximately $30-40 expenses for the field trips.

ARTH 013 Images of War
This course will explore the uses and meanings of images of war. By considering photography, paint-
ing, prints and performance art, we will ask questions about how images disseminated to the public
have been used to justify and promote war and how they have been harnessed to protest it. When do
depictions of war arouse sympathy and when might they deaden it? Relying on Susan Sontag's recent
work, Regarding the Pain of Others, as the primary text for the class, we will concentrate on war im-
agery of the recent past, including The Spanish Civil War, WWII, Vietnam, Rwanda, Bosnia and Iraq.
Evaluation will be based on class participation, twice weekly listserver submission that respond to
course readings, and an oral presentation.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 14.
Meeting time: afternoons; 2 three hour sessions per week.
Cost to student: approximately $100 for readings.

Films based on artists' lives have done a great deal to shape our impressions of the creative individual.
This course will explore this issue, studying films about artists from the Renaissance to the modern
period including Michelangelo, Vincent Van Gogh, Camille Claudel, Frida Kahlo, and Jackson Pol-
lock. We will focus on the construction, in these films, of a notion of artistic genius, paying particular
attention to the role played by gender. Our discussions will be based on the films themselves as well as
comparative material-biographical and art historical readings on the various artists.
Evaluation will be based on class participation and a 10-page paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 12.
Meeting time: afternoons; 2 three hour sessions per week. Some film viewing will be required outside
class hours.

ARTH 026 Contemporary Art in Los Angeles
This course offers a unique opportunity to experience and study an expansive selection of contempo-
rary art in Los Angeles. Once considered an eclectic artworld outpost, in recent decades Los Angeles
has emerged as one of the most significant and vibrant global cities for the production and exhibition
of contemporary art. During the 10-day travel component of the course, we will visit a range of mu-
seums, galleries, and alternative artist-run spaces in L.A. Specific museums we will attend include:
the Getty, Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Museum of Contemporary Art, Museum of Jurassic
Technology, Pasadena Museum of California Art, and the Santa Monica Museum of Art. We will also
view art in a variety of galleries including those in Chinatown, at Bergamont Station in Santa Monica,
and LACE (Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions) on world-famous Hollywood Boulevard. In
addition to viewing art prepared for public exhibition, we will have the opportunity to see art "in pro-
cess" by visiting some of the region's influential art schools and participate in several studio visits
with well-known artists living in Los Angeles, many in the Downtown and Silverlake neighborhoods.
Since, the city is known as "the mural capital of the world," we will also consider the rich history of
public arts in Los Angeles.
An important aspect of this course will involve exploring the history of the built environment in Los
Angeles and examining the interaction between the diverse physical and social spaces of the city and
the production of visual culture. We will tour downtown Los Angeles with a community historian,
tour the historical Broadway Theater District with a film historian, and visit the nation's largest barrio,
East L.A., with an urban planner and historian. Although much of our time in Los Angeles will in-
volve organized field trips, there will also be time for independent exploration.
Before our departure, we will engage in an intensive study focused on the history of contemporary art
in Los Angeles. We will also examine the region's cultural geography through historical and theoreti-
cal readings that consider the issues of urban development, immigration, cultural diversity, and glob-
alization.
Interested students must consult the instructor before registration. There will be a mandatory orienta-
tion session held during the fall semester.
Evaluation will be based on class participation, an on-site gallery talk, and a 10-page paper at the con-
clusion of the course.
Enrollment limit: 12. Preference will be given to students with course work in Art Studio, Art History,
American Studies, and/or Environmental Studies.
Cost to student: $1750, includes airfare, lodging, museum entrance fees, and organized transportation
for many of our day trips in Los Angeles. Students will be responsible for most meals and other inci-
dentals.

ARTS 011 Refiguring the Body
This course is a studio seminar exploring various approaches to and uses of the body. Students will
investigate and interrogate issues of nude/naked, subject/object, self/other, and a variety of themes,
such as gender/sex/sexuality, death, and power, as they relate to representing the body. Drawing and
collage techniques will be used in relationship to twentieth century and contemporary developments,
attitudes and styles.
Requirements: model sessions in the studio, critique, slide discussions. Evaluation will be based on
participation in discussion sections, effort, attendance, the quality of work produced, and the final ex-
hibition of work.

(See under Asian Studies--Japanese for full description.)
ARTS 013 Abstracting and Translating: Sculpture to Drawing
Can the constructed object or installation serve as model, structure or source for drawing? This course
will explore the relationship between the sculpted object or installation and the drawing. By abstract-
ing from nature with non-traditional materials, students will develop a three dimensional vocabulary
of patterns, networks, or volumetric forms (less than 2x2x2') that can be used as foundation for two-
dimensional works. The first part of the course will be an introduction to building sculptures using
simple means of attachment, such as hot glue, tape and wire. Students will do research outside of class
to find source material for the three dimensional works (living organisms, books, the internet). The
final project "drawings" may refer to, originate from and/or incorporate sculptural elements, but are
not limited to these interpretations. There will be a mandatory class trip to Mass MoCA.
Evaluation will be based on regular attendance and class participation. Requirements: several small
assignments, a daily journal/sketchbook, and a final project for an open studio or exhibition.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 12. Preference given to Art majors.
Meeting time: afternoons; 3 times per week. Students will also be expected to work during open stu-
dio hours.

ARTS 014 Figure Drawing
In this course students will develop representational, technical, and expressive skills through studies
in drawing from live models. We will inform our practice in drawing through the study of accom-
plished figure drawings from the history of western art. Creating your own studies "in the manner of"
such drawings, you will learn to develop methods suitable for varied approaches to the human figure.
In addition to working directly from the model during class meetings, you will also be expected to
develop drawings outside of class times, including anatomical studies, self portraiture, and working
up figure sketches into more elaborate compositions. In addition to studio work we will allow some
time for brief slide lectures and for critique.
Evaluation will be based on the level of achievement in her/his drawings, attendance, participation,
and effort. Satisfactory performance in the course will require a commitment of at least 6 hours per
week in addition to class meetings.
Prerequisites: ArtS 100. Enrollment limit: 15.

The term collage is from the French verb coller, meaning "to glue." Throughout art, film and literature
of the twentieth century we regard the process of making collage an aggregate of ideas, materials and
textures; a work composed of both borrowed and primary material. The assembled information pro-

ARTS 018 Dreams, Art, and the Personal Narrative
This class is a laboratory in which one's artistic identity (style, process, technique, inspiration, and
visual language) will be supplemented by the practice and tracking of dreams. How can we use the
unconscious to access a deeper, poetic site of creativity? The class will be based on a mixture of art
practices and dreaming techniques; creative field studies and studio assignments, group dreamwork,
and critique will be grounded in lectures in the science and theory of dreams and slide presentations.
How have dreams inspired artists such as Remedios Varo, Max Ernst, Matta, Maya Deren, Bill Viola,
and Frederico Garcia Lorca? We will also look at the role dreams play in the art of non-western cul-
tures such as Islam, India, indigenous America, and Aboriginal Australia. How do dreams question
our sense of self, our relationship to time, and ways we construct meaning from non-linear fragments
of information? What are persistent themes that arise in both our art and dreams? A final group exhibi-
tion will document our findings. The use of and exploration in any artistic media is encouraged. Stu-
dents are responsible for their own materials.
Evaluation will be based on willingness to try new techniques, participation in group discussions and
activities, keeping a dream journal, and successful completion of studio assignments and readings.
Prerequisite: while not required, it is recommended that students have Drawing I or Drawing II. En-
rollment limit: 10.

ing pinhole cameras and making images from these cameras. It is also a darkroom course. Students
will learn how to process their film and print from both paper and film negatives. The student will be
required to make two different types of cameras and be required to present a portfolio of 15 to 20
successful pinhole images. There will be specific shooting assignments that will teach them to recog-
nize the special and very specific characteristics of a pinhole image.
Evaluation will be based on final portfolio.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 10.
Cost to student: $150 for lab fee.

CHIN 011 Business Chinese: It is More Than Just a Chinese Business
This course is NOT an advanced-level Chinese language course. Rather, it is designed to provide fun-
damental training in Chinese language to people who are interested in doing business with China in
the future. In this course, we will learn the proper pronunciation of Mandarin Chinese, the official
language in China and Taiwan. You will also gain basic understanding of the Chinese syntax and writ-
ing system, which can also be the basis for future language learning when necessary. In addition, a
wide range of knowledge necessary for effective cross-cultural communication in the business con-
text, such as social etiquette, business practices, and interpretation of verbal and non-verbal state-
ments will be covered. Local merchants with extensive experience in conducting business with Chi-
nese communities will be invited as guest speakers to share their insights with the class.

CHIN 012 Chinese Painting and Culture
This course provides a wonderful opportunity to explore Chinese art by fostering appreciation and
understanding of the aesthetics of Chinese painting. Students will gain a broad knowledge of Chinese
art as well as the basic skills to facilitate further practice. More specifically, students will learn how to
use gradations of black ink, one of the major techniques in Chinese painting, on rice paper. Students
will also learn how to draw the "four gentlemen" series, which stands for the four seasons of the year:
plum blossom, mountain orchid, bamboo, and chrysanthemum. Techniques used in Chinese land-
scape painting, such as drawing of mountains, trees, and water, will also be covered.
In addition to the techniques of Chinese painting, students will also be introduced to elements that are
integral parts of Chinese painting, such as calligraphy, seal, and unique methods of mounting. This is a
course of exploratory nature and requires no previous background in art.

JAPN 011 Theatre of the Body: A Transcultural Model for Physical Theatre Performance
(Same as Theatre 011)
This course is designed for anyone that wishes to increase their performative skills by engaging in exer-
cises adapted from contemporary and traditional Japanese arts. The course draws from butoh, noh, and
aikido to propose a training model for physical theatre performance. Performance training may have pro-
found value for people pursuing disciplines both within and outside of the performing arts.
The goals of this course are sweeping in their scope: 1) increased power, presence, and flexibility; 2) in-
creased integration of breath and movement; 3) increased kinesthetic sense, including postural and struc-
tural awareness in movement; 4) increased `performative fluency' or the capacity to embody an idea in
performance. The method will be intensive studio instruction in specific kata (or `roadmaps' for move-
ment), limb and joint mobilizations, and tightly structured improvisations.
This will be a highly physical class, consisting of exercises that move through the space, and those that
require direct physical interaction among students and between instructor and student. The students are
encouraged to maintain optimum health during the term of this course and to arrive to each class on time,
fed, rested, and otherwise prepared to enter into a prolonged period of physical and mental engagement.
Each class will be structured to account for the students' physiological progression from hour to hour (i.e.,
we will not attempt to stretch cold muscles or begin with activities that are highly aerobic, but rather will
follow a sequence that accounts for the participants' evolving body state). Loose, comfortable and layered
(to account for climate) clothing is a must. We will work mostly in bare feet.
Evaluation will be based on their daily commitment to in-class activities, and the quality and timely
completion of outside assignments. Assignments will include reading materials addressing core issues
from a variety of viewpoints; written summaries of one or more of those selections; regular journal writing;
and a short in-class presentation.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15. No prior performance training necessary, however students should
come to class prepared to enter into an extended period of mental and physical engagement.
Meeting time: mornings and afternoons; Monday through Thursday 10a.m.-1p.m. (10-12 hours per week).
Cost to student: approximately $40 for materials and course packet.

ASTRONOMY
ASTR 011 Image Processing in Science and Medicine
Images have long been fundamental in the sciences such as astronomy. With the discovery of x-rays
this became true in medicine as well. Digital imaging has become a staple throughout our society but
the nature and processing of a scientific image differs from that of an image obtained for artistic or
commercial purposes. This course will cover the principles and practice of image processing as ap-
plied to the sciences and medicine, particularly to astronomy and to magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI). We will discuss how images are acquired, including transformations from raw data to mean-
ingful images. We will cover images, their generalization to dimensions other than two, and many
fundamental operations that may be applied to enhance features or extract particular kinds of informa-
tion. Students will obtain their own images using one or more of the following: an MRI scanner, an
astronomical telescope, or an electron microscope. Students will learn to use one or more image proc-
essing software packages, and will have the opportunity to create their own software.
Evaluation will be based on attendance, weekly assignments, and a final project which will be pre-
sented both in written form and as an oral presentation at a simulated scientific conference.
Prerequisites: Mathematics 105 or 106, or equivalent. Enrollment limit: 10. Preference given to stu-
dents with experience in a programming language.
Meeting time: mornings; 3 two-hour sessions per week. Other times include a field trip to a medical
MRI facility (9a.m.-5p.m.), a night of observing on the Hopkins Observatory 24" telescope
(7p.m.-10p.m.), and a visit to the electron microscope on campus.

BIOL 011 Envisioning a Sustainable Future (Same as Environmental Studies 011)
If humanity is to survive the next century, a massive movement towards ecological sustainability must
occur. What is a sustainable lifestyle like? Will we have to sacrifice? How do we get there from here?
In this course, we will first look at key technologies and resource management issues required for (and
also driving!) the movement towards sustainability, including energy, water and agricultural practic-
es. By considering the ramifications of these issues, it will be possible to envision in some detail what
a sustainable lifestyle must be like. We will then consider how the mindset and practices of the devel-
oped world must evolve to allow the sustainability movement to truly take hold. Students will read
several short background papers before each class.

situations in which healthcare delivery is difficult. Relying on brief readings, guest speakers and expe-
riential field trips, students will explore the problems and potential solutions specific to some cultures
and conditions within American society, including poverty, migrant workers and Native Americans,
GBLT, and others.
Evaluation will be based on class participation and the completion a project to be presented at a poster
session at the end of the course. Access to transportation would be helpful but is not required.
No prerequisites, but previous experience in any aspect of healthcare is encouraged. Enrollment limit:

BIOL 014 Orchids! (Same as Environmental Studies 014)
This course explores the world of orchids. First we will consider the aesthetics of orchids and how this
fueled both the exploration for new species in the nineteenth century and the production of modern
hybrids. Next we will study the biology of orchids particularly the structural and physiological
adaptations that have permitted these plants to inhabit sites as diverse as the treetops of tropical forests
and the frozen meadows of New England. The complex relationship between flower structure and the
behavior of pollinators is of special interest. The fascinating world of the orchid hybridizer will be
examined. How is it possible to combine four genera to make one plant? The commercialization of
orchids led to the destruction of many natural populations. Is it possible to protect and possibly rees-
tablish endangered species through the cultivation and propagation of orchids from seed? Orchid hy-
bridization and the discovery of methods for the tissue culture of rare plants have revolutionized the
commercial availability of orchids. Globalization has affected the orchid industry. We will discuss
these recent trends and what it means for those hoping for a career with orchids.
Students will be given the opportunity to examine living plants and flowers of various orchid genera.
We will demonstrate the techniques for growing the plants in the greenhouse and within the home.
Mature specimens will be repotted and students will deflask seedlings and set up community pots.
Two field trips are planned, one to Mountain Orchid of Ludlow, VT, a leader in growing cloud forest
species, and the second to Conway Orchids of Conway, MA, a grower of championship Cattleya hy-
brids.
Students will be required to write a 10-page paper or develop an equivalent oral presentation to the
class on the orchid topic of his/her choice, and production of a poster. The poster will be displayed at
an orchid show we will present on the last day of Winter Study (students will be required to be present
for the show and to help set it up).

CHEM 011 Science for Kids (Same as Special 011)
Are you interested in teaching? Do you enjoy working with kids? Do you like to experiment with new
things? Here is a chance for you to do all three! The aim of this Winter Study Project is to design a series of
hands-on science workshops for elementary school children and their parents. Working in teams of 2-4,
students spend the first two and a half weeks of Winter Study planning the workshops. This involves de-
ciding on a focus for each workshop (based on the interests of the students involved) followed by choosing
and designing experiments and presentations that will be suitable for fourth-grade children. On the third
Winter Study Program
­ 344 ­
weekend of Winter Study (January 24, 25) we bring elementary school kids with their parents to Williams
to participate in the workshops. You get a chance to see what goes into planning classroom demonstrations
as well as a sense of what it's like to actually give a presentation. You find that kids at this age are great fun
to work with because they are interested in just about everything and their enthusiasm is infectious. You
also give the kids and their parents a chance to actually do some fun hands-on science experiments that
they may not have seen before, and you are able to explain simple scientific concepts to them in a manner
that won't be intimidating. It is a rewarding experience for all involved.
Evaluation will be based on participation in planning and running the workshops. Each group is expected
to prepare a handout with descriptions of the experiments for the kids, parents, and teachers.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 25. You need not be a science major; all that is needed is enthusiasm.
Meeting time: mornings; 3 three-hour sessions per week. The workshop is run on the third weekend of
Winter Study (January 24, 25) and attendance from 9a.m. to 3p.m. is mandatory that weekend. There are
also one or two brief meetings held in the fall term for preliminary planning.

CHEM 015 Materials of the Artist: Uncovering Fakes and Forgeries (Same as ArtH 015 and
ArtS 015)
Many artists' materials (in the form of support, pigments, coatings, and binding media) existed in very
specific times throughout history. Knowing this, we can create a timeline and begin to date art objects
by examining their material and how each object was manufactured. In this class, we choose an object
of questionable authenticity and immerse ourselves in it. For example, a painting of questionable au-
thenticity will have the pigments analyzed, the media analyzed, an x-ray will be taken, showing the
paint strokes and method of application. In some cases, a technique called an infrared reflectography
will be utilized to view the underdrawing--the artist (or forgers) original sketches. Visual examina-
tions combined with sophisticated analytical instrumentation will be used to identify the materials of
the object and its method of manufacture. Instruments may include: x-ray fluorescence analysis,
Fourier transform infrared spectrometer, x-ray diffraction, gas chromatography, and scanning elec-
tron microscope. All classes will be held at either the Williamstown Conservation Center under the
direction of the analytical chemist and conservator, or in the Bronfman Science Center.
Evaluation will be based upon class participation and a 10-page final paper.

CHEM 025 Archaeological Excavation at the Paleolithic Site of Attirampakkam, India (Same
as Anthropology 025)
This course will travel to Attirampakkan, a site in Southern India that has so far yielded well-pre-
served cultural artifacts of Lower, Middle and Upper Paleolithic deposits, including an Acheulian liv-
ing floor and animal footprints in association with artifacts. Excavations at the site are sponsored by
Earthwatch, which specializes in sending talented and interested amateurs to help professional scien-
tists. It is one of relatively few opportunities for Williams students to participate in professional ar-
chaeological research. The excavating season is January and February, making it ideal for a Winter
Study trip.
The vast majority of human prehistory studies have focussed either on Africa or Europe. While there
have been occasional investigations in the Indian subcontinent (the first stone tool was found by a
British geologist in 1863), systematic studies have only been started in the last 10 years. The goal of
the project, of which Attirampakkan is a major part, is to build up a picture of the region in prehistory
that will allow paleoanthropologists to test models of hominid behavioral strategies. One question is
whether these are affected by climate change in ways also seen in other parts of the world.
When students return to campus after the holidays, we will spend several days in orientation activities
related both to the site itself and to the practical aspects of field archaeology. They will spend approxi-
mately two weeks, plus travel, on site and return to Williamstown to write up the results of their work.
While on site they will participate in all aspects of excavation including digging, cleaning artifacts,
curating them and analyzing collections. Dr. Shanti Pappu, the archaeologist on this site, will lead
discussions on Indian prehistory to supplement the earlier references. Students will keep a daily jour-
nal as well as a field notebook. Potential analyses include determining the appropriate attribution of
material to a given Paleolithic period, correlating artifacts with possible sources of raw material, and
interpreting the geology of the site in terms of climate change. However the primary result for students
is the knowledge of what `real' archaeologists do.
Enrollment limit: 6.
Cost to student: approximately $3300 (includes airfare).

CLASSICS
CLAS 010 Sappho's Poetry in Greek: Eros the Sweet-Bitter (Same as Comparative Literature
013 and Women's and Gender Studies 010)
Sappho of Lesbos (early 6th century bce) enjoys a privileged status in almost any history of sexuality
or history of love poetry. Although only a small portion of her large poetic corpus has survived to us,
we have retrieved enough to appreciate why Plato called Sappho "the tenth Muse" and why Solon, the
great Athenian lawgiver who was himself a poet, responded to one of Sappho's poems upon hearing it
for the first time: "Let me hear it again so that I may learn it and die." Readers of English translations
respond to Sappho's poetry with similar enthusiasm, but no translation can fully capture the effects of
her word choice, word order, syntactic shifts, sounds and rhythms. No translation can convey the pas-
sion, or the restraint, of her every poetic gesture in Greek. This course is intended for students who do
not know any ancient Greek but who would like to read Sappho's poetry in Greek. We will not pretend
to "learn Greek" in a month. Rather, this course will provide an introduction to Aeolic Greek, the dia-
lect in which Sappho composed her poems. Through a specially prepared set of lessons, students will
learn the Greek alphabet (really very easy) and just enough grammar, syntax, and vocabulary to read
closely a selection of Sappho's poetry in Greek and to discuss problems of translation. (Sappho's syn-
tax is unusually straightforward, even simple, so students need not worry about having to learn
Greek's complex constructions.) We will also explore the dynamics of eros in her poetry and consider
questions that this poetry, and its original occasions for performance, raise for the histories of not only
sexuality and love poetry but even the education of young women and men.
Requirements: attendance at all classes, short quizzes on grammar and vocabulary, and preparing and
presenting to one another translations and critical discussions of several poems and a number of frag-
ments.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 12. Preference given to majors (or intended majors) in Compara-

CLAS 011 Writing With Wedges II: Introduction to Sumerian
The war with Iraq and the recent looting of the antiquities museum in Baghdad make the study of
ancient Mesopotamian culture all the more pressing. This course will present an introduction to the
Sumerian language in the context of its ancient Mesopotamian culture, and to cuneiform, the world's
first writing system. Sumerian, which is not related to any other language, ancient or modern, pro-
vides a unique opportunity to study the way language works. The writing system, which was invented
by Sumerian speakers around 4000 BCE and later adapted to different languages, was used for more
than three millennia and is preserved on thousands of clay tablets and stone monuments in museums
around the world. In this course we will learn the basics of the language and read original documents
(including some in the Williams Art Museum) and become familiar with the history and the material
culture of the region, which has long been known as the "Cradle of Western Civilization."
Requirements: weekly assignments from a language textbook and one 4- to 5-page research paper.
This course presents an in-depth exploration of a topic touched on in Writing With Wedges: Language
and Literature of Mesopotamia (2003); it is appropriate both for students who took that course and
students who are new to the subject.
Prerequisites: love of language and an affinity for puzzles. Enrollment limit: 12.
Meeting time: afternoons, six hours a week (3 two-hour sessions).
Cost to student: $45 for textbook.

COMPARATIVE LITERATURE
COMP 010 Living by Words: Surviving and Thriving in the Art and Sport of Rhetoric (Same
as English 010, Leadership Studies 012, and Special 012)
Whether dealing in the realms of public life, commerce, or academe, the speaker who can clearly and
cogently define or defend a policy, product, or theoretical position is usually the most successful. De-
pending on the venue and the aim of the speaker, the words might be artful and poetic, cajoling and
competitive, formally read from the page or seemingly delivered impromptu. This course will briefly
examine some of the classic styles of oratory from Ancient Greece to Madison Avenue. Students will
make visits to a variety of venues that employ a special style of professional discourse (TV and radio
stations, the Albany and Boston state houses) and learn a range of methods and techniques for practic-
ing the basics of effective spoken communication. The practical intent of the course is for participants
to develop confident, cogent, and dynamic presentation styles, to reinforce tight organizational focus
and relaxed, natural delivery, and to develop creative approaches to speaking in front of a group. The
course will guide participants through the presentation process from conception, outlining, and devis-
ing the message, to development of visual aids, message delivery, and handling question and answer
sessions. Methods employed will include vigorous pursuit of improvisational theater techniques and
vocal training. Participants will deliver brief presentations at each session and receive intensive per-
sonal coaching and a videotaped record of their personal progress. The final project will be a presenta-
tion at a public forum.
Evaluation will be based on active participation in the class, a written evaluation of a public presenta-
tion the student has attended, and successful completion of mini-presentations during Winter Study
and the final presentation at the end of term.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 12.
Meeting time: mornings; 3 two-hour sessions per week and 2-3 field trips outside of Williamstown.

COMP 012 Proust: In Search of Lost Time (Same as French 012 and English 024)
This course will be dedicated to Marcel Proust's great novel In Search of Lost Time, whose published
English title, Remembrance of Things Past, falsifies the sense of quest that the French conveys. The
novel is a search for the meaning of time that has been wasted, or lost, in love and society. For Proust,
erotic life and society pose profound difficulties that he proposes find their single solution in art. The
extraordinary length of the work precludes reading all of it, so we will read the first two major sections
of Swann's Way and Within a Budding Grove. In them, many of the great themes and problematics of
the novel are introduced which find their amplification, intensification and finally even their resolu-
tion in the rest of the novel. By becoming sensitive to them, students will be readied to approach read-
ing Proust on their own. Knowledge of French is not required; all class readings will be in English.
Evaluation will be based on regular attendance, class participation, and one 10-page paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15. Preference will be given to advanced students in Comparative
Literature, English, and Romance Languages.

COMPUTER SCIENCE
CSCI 010 C, UNIX and Software Tools
This course serves as a guided tour of programming methods in the UNIX operating system. The
course is designed for individuals who understand basic program development techniques as dis-
cussed in an introductory programming course (Computer Science 134 or equivalent), but who wish
to become familiar with a broader variety of computer systems and programming languages. Students
in this course will work on UNIX workstations, available in one of the Department's laboratories. By
the end of the course, students will have developed basic proficiency in the C programming language.
The increasing success of UNIX as a modern operating system stems from its unique ability to "proto-
type" programs quickly. Students will use prototyping tools, such as Awk and "shell scripts" to write
"filters" for transforming data from a variety of sources. It will become clear that in many cases the
overhead of programming in languages such as C, C++, or Java is unnecessary. Moreover, students
will learn to effectively use software tools such as debuggers, profilers, and make files.
Evaluation will be based on several programming assignments due throughout the term. While none
of the projects in the course will be particularly large, the successful student will develop a tool chest,
which will extend their computing "effectiveness" in their particular field. Students with computing
needs particular to their field are encouraged to advise the instructor before the first meeting.
Prerequisites: Computer Science 134 or equivalent programming experience. Enrollment limit: 20.
Cost to student: texts.

new and novel ways of thinking about computers and biology. Labs experiment with parameters of
the evolving problems shared between the two scientific disciplines.

ECONOMICS
ECON 010 East Asia: Miracle and Crisis
This course is intended to help CDE fellows integrate the material they studied in the first semester by
applying it to the circumstances of a particular group of countries. During the 2004 Winter Term ses-
sion the course will focus on case studies of what are widely perceived to be successful development
experiences--those of the East and Southeast Asian "miracle" economies. Among the issues to be
considered are the desirability of the economic transformations that took place in these countries, the
conditions that may have made such transformations possible, the roles that specific policies may
have played in bringing them about, the causes of the recent economic crisis in the region and its im-
plications for future growth in the affected countries, as well as the lessons that the East and Southeast
Asian experience may hold for other developing countries.
Evaluation will be based on three 5-7 page papers plus an oral presentation.
Prerequisites: Economics 252 or its equivalent. Undergraduates are welcome to take this course, but
they should first seek the permission of the instructor, since the number of undergraduate slots avail-
able will depend on the size of the CDE enrollment.
Meeting time: mornings; 3 days per week.

ECON 011 Public Speaking
In a world in which most of us are asked at one time or another to say something to a group, public
speaking is a skill which everyone should learn. This course will help you become an organized and
persuasive public speaker. You will create your own public speaking style that is comfortable, confi-
dent, and conversational. We will focus on organizational techniques, handling visual aids effectively,
eye contact and body language. A supportive atmosphere will give each person an opportunity to re-
ceive feedback.
Requirements: 4-5 oral presentations to the class, most of which will be videotaped and critiqued.
Evaluation will be based on in-class presentations, class participation, and a 10-page written critique
of the student's own videotaped presentations.

ECON 012 Women and Development (Same as Women's and Gender Studies 017)
The processes of economic development in developing countries have had a different impact on
women than on men. This is because of their differing social and economic roles - and perceptions
thereof - and their substantial exclusion from resources and decision-making. This course will offer a
brief introduction to some economic and related human development tools that are useful in under-
standing these processes, and also critique their shortcomings. We will look at the position of the
woman in intra-household bargaining, and examine its relation to issues such as women's access to
credit, women's `voice' and the informal sector, skewed sex ratios and women vis-a-vis the current
global HIV/AIDS pandemic. We will read accounts by feminist economists of the significance of the
unpaid `care' economy, and other `invisible' female contributions to development. Literature by
Third World writers, documentaries and feature films will also be used to expand our sense of the tex-
ture of people's lives in `income-poor' countries. Students are expected to participate in class discus-
sions of the readings, feature films and documentaries. The final assignment for the course will be a
ten-page essay on a women and development issue of the student's choice.
Evaluation will be based on class participation, brief reaction e-mails and the final essay. Format: lec-
tures and discussion.

This course will examine the theoretical and practical aspects of financial accounting. Although the
beginning of the course will explore the mechanics of the information gathering and dissemination
process, the course will be oriented mainly towards users, rather than preparers, of accounting infor-
mation. The project will include discussion of the principles involved in accounting for current assets,
plant assets, leases, intangible assets, current and long-term debt, stockholders' equity, the income
statement and the statement of cash flows. Students will be expected to interpret and analyze actual
financial statements. The nature of, and career opportunities in, the field of accounting will also be
discussed.
This course will present a substantial body of material and will require a considerable commitment of
time by the student.

ECON 016 How to Buy a Car
The premise of this course is that car buyers get more for their money if they are aware of the econom-
ic principles involved at the time of purchase. At our first meeting, students will participate in an auto
purchase bargaining game; students will be paired off, one playing the role of the "dealer" and the
other the role of the "purchaser." In subsequent meetings we will discuss various issues including: the
decision to buy a new or used car, foreign or domestic car; supply side determinants of car prices such
as optimal pricing strategies of manufacturers and dealers, unit costs, options' pricing, rebates, special
interest rates, product quality, product safety, advertising, and the roles of government, insurance
companies and banks; demand side determinants of car prices such as preferences, demographics,
exchange rate fluctuations, seasonal buying cycles, and business cycles; leasing. At the sixth meeting,
students will participate in a second auto purchase simulation. Although the practical side of car pur-
chasing is the focus, microeconomics is viewed through the lens of the car buying process.
Requirements: required readings, participation in both simulations, two 2-page synopses of the simu-
lations, and a 5-page paper at the end of the program discussing the reasons why the material we cov-
ered helped (or hurt) them in negotiating their second car purchase.
Prerequisites: Economics 110. Enrollment limit: 20 Preference given to students who have had Eco-

ECON 017 Business Economics
In this course, the class will carry out a real-time forecast of the U.S. economy and explore its implica-
tions for the bond and stock markets. The course will build upon principles of both macro and micro-
economics. It will provide an introduction to the work done by business economists and the tech-
niques they use. An economic database, chart-generating software and a statistical analysis program
will be available to each student on the Jessup computers and, if necessary, on a disk for IBM-compat-
ible computers.
The first week will focus on becoming familiar with the database, looking for relationships between
key economic variables, and studying movements in interest rates over the period 1960-2002. Early in
the first week, the class will be divided into teams of 2 students with each team choosing a particular
aspect of the economy to forecast.
During the second and third weeks, the class will work with various leading indicators of economic
activity and will prepare forecasts of the key components of gross domestic product and other key
Winter Study Program

variables. We will also have several invited guests from the Wall Street investment world speaking on
various aspects of the stock market at regular and optional class sessions. The fourth week will feature
a formal presentation of the economic forecast with invited guests from the Williams College faculty.
To put the forecasting exercise in context, there will be class discussions of business cycles, credit
cycles, long waves in inflation and interest rates and the impact of the Internet on the economy and the
stock market.
Because essential concepts and tools are covered during the first week, all students are expected to
attend the first class.
Requirements: homework, participation in short presentations of their analyses, a formal presentation
during the last week, and a 3-page paper summerizing the result of the forecast project.

ECON 018 For Richer or Poorer: A Multimedia View of Historical Economic Performance
The world today is awash in inequality. In rich countries, the majority of people take expensive vaca-
tions and purchase larger and larger televisions and automobiles. On the other hand, in poor countries
people struggle for access to safe drinking water, basic health care, and enough calories. Why is it that
some countries are rich and others so poor? Economists and other scholars have attempted to answer
this question from a number of different perspectives. In this class, we will examine this question from
a somewhat unique perspective. We will read and critique Jared Diamond's Guns, Germs, and Steel
and David Landes' The Wealth and Poverty of Nations, which offer different perspectives on the his-
torical development of economies. We will supplement the readings by playing and analyzing Civili-
zation II and/or Age of Empires II. The objective of these games is to build the most successful society
among a group of players. We will specifically attempt to learn about the algorithms the games use to
determine successful societies. The we will compare and contrast those strategies with the ideas of
Diamond and Landes.
Evaluation will be based on a 10-page paper and class participation. Game play will also be required
outside of class.

ECON 019 Finding the Right Neighborhood
What do looking for an apartment, advising a client on the best location for a new retail store, or trying
to understand the impacts of rent control and fair housing laws have in common? They all involve
trying to describe and understand the nature of neighborhoods. How is finding the `right' neighbor-
hood possible without the detailed knowledge that comes from having lived in the area? This course
will introduce you to information sources that are available for describing, mapping, and understand-
ing characteristics of neighborhoods and for defining and identifying local markets. At the end of the
course you will be able to produce maps and descriptions that will enable you or others to find the
`right' neighborhood.
Each student will be required to prepare a written report, at least 10 pages in length, describing the city
they have chosen to examine and presenting the information they have collected. Each student will be
required to make an oral presentation of their analysis. The presentation and written material will
serve as the basis for evaluation. Evaluation will be based on the above presentation and written mate-

ECON 025 Oriental Rugs: Art and Commerce (Same as ArtH 025)
People, primarily women, have been weaving rugs for thousands of years, and rugs have played a
central role in the culture and commerce of many societies. This course will explore the world of
oriental rugs, with an emphasis on the aesthetics and economics of these extraordinary weavings. The
course will be divided between classes in Williamstown for the first part of Winter Study and a trip to
Turkey, one of the great rug weaving centers of the world, for the second part. We will discuss the
origins and ethnography of oriental rug weaving and designs, the methods by which rugs are made,
and the tactile and visual characteristics that separate "a rag from a rug," and a great rug from a good
rug. We'll discuss as well the economics of the "rug trade," a world in which "caveat emptor" rules
with a vengeance. We'll examine what factors determine the cost of making new rugs; what deter-
mines the value of "collectable rugs;" the role of "bargaining" in the market for rugs; and the role of
auction "bidding pools" and the methods that rug dealers use to divide the gains when they collude at
auctions.
After a series of classes in Williamstown and the examination of rugs and textiles from several Massa-
chusetts collections, the class will proceed to Turkey for about two weeks in Istanbul, Konya (Central
Anatolia), and the vicinity of Bergama (Western Anatolia). Dr. Nicholas Wright, a rug collector and
authority on rugs, will lead the trip. In Istanbul, we will see classical rugs in two museums and see the
market up close in the Grand Bazaar in Sultanahmet. Traveling to Konya, we will visit museums and
see production of kilims (flatwoven rugs) and felt rugs. We will visit at least one repair workshop in
Istanbul/ and possibly also Sultanhami (near Aksaray, in Central Anatolia east of Konya) and then
discuss conservation issues. There may also be an opportunity for dye analysis in the lab of Dr. Harald
Bohmer of Marmara University in Istanbul, who is world-renowned for reviving the art of weaving
with natural dyes in Turkey in the early 1980s. (If political or other conditions preclude a trip to
Turkey, this course will run as a regular length Winter Study in Williamstown.)
Evaluation will be based on classroom discussion, one 3-page paper discussing an individual rug (or
group of rugs) from an aesthetic perspective, and one 7-page paper on any topic that addresses either
the aesthetics or economics of rugs. The papers will be due prior to the trip to Turkey.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 10. Placement is through interview prior to registration for the
course.
Meeting time: several mornings and some afternoons for extensive meetings each week for first part
of Winter Study; travel to Turkey for the second part of Winter Study.
Cost to student: approximately $100 per student for books and local travel, and about $1950 for travel
to, and within, Turkey.

ECON 027 The Green Revolution (Same as Biology 020 and Environmental Studies 027)
Beginning in the 1950s, agriculture in developing countries underwent a dramatic transformation, as
modern scientific techniques of plant breeding were applied to tropical and semi-tropical crops and
agroecosystems. This Green Revolution led to massive increases in the production of staple foods
Winter Study Program
­ 354 ­
within some developing countries. Growth of food production in turn allowed for increases in average
consumption, even in the face of historically unprecedented increases in human population. But the
expansion of food production was not without costs - environmental, social, and economic. And in the
end, the Green Revolution did not "solve" problems of hunger or rural poverty.This course will look
in depth at the Green Revolution. We will consider the underlying science, the institutions involved,
and the economic, social, and environmental impacts. We will also talk about implications for the im-
pending "Gene Revolution" and its management. Most class meetings will consist of lectures and dis-
cussion. We will also view a number of videos and perhaps explore cooking and eating some of the
foods we are considering!
Evaluation will be based on a 15-paper addressing some feature of the Green Revolution, along with
class attendance, participation, and overall effort. A brief presentation of the paper near the end of
Winter Study will be required.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15. Preference given to those students with some prior interest or
experience in agriculture.
Meeting time: mornings.
Cost to student: approximately $100 (books and reading packets).

ENGL 011 Anxious Allegories: Horror and Sci-Fi Films
This film course will also be a casual tutorial on popular American moods, both cultural and political,
and it will seek to place the films we study in the context of such trends as Fifties conformism, dread of
Communism, the post-Watergate mistrust of government, suspicion of science and technology, and
the entertaining of Biblical prophecies. The class will examine the possibility that what unites these
loose allegories in not only their expression of once-popular fears, but also their campiness--their
impulse to subvert our solemnities, whether intentionally or inadvertently. The films will include
Nightmare on Elm Street, Halloween, Jaws, Village of the Damned, Invasion of the Body Snatchers,
The Andromeda Strain, The Seventh Sign, The Exorcist, Forth of July, Alien, ET, Starship Trooper,and
Minority Report.
Requirements: short oral presentations and one 10-page paper.

ENGL 012 Looking at Contemporary Documentary Photography
This course explores the evolution of modern documentary photography. We will start with Robert
Frank's The Americans, and how Frank's singular vision deeply shaped the next generation of pho-
tographers working the American streets and landscape. Diane Arbus, Bruce Davidson, Lee Freid-
lander, William Klein, Danny Lyon, Gary Winogrand are some of the photographers whose work we
will get to know well . Discussions will include the new wave of independent and Magnum photojour-
nalists (Phillip Jones Griffiths, Josef Koudleka, Susan Meiselas, Gilles Peress, James Nachtwey, Alex
Webb, Ron Haviv and Tyler Hicks) and the wars from Vietnam to Bosnia to Iraq they cover as well as
the personal visions they explore. Insight into the diverse currents of documentary photography will
be explored through the work of Robert Adams, Bill Burke, Larry Clark, Lois Conner, Linda Connor,
Larry Fink, Nan Goldin, Emmet Gowin, Sally Mann, Mary Ellen Mark, Nicholas Nixon, and Abelar-
do Morell. Slide presentations will occupy half of the first meetings and give way to discussion of
Winter Study Program

issues in documentary photography. Students will be encouraged to work on individual projects of
their own choice. Each student will be required to make a brief presentation to the class on a documen-
tary topic of their choice. A final paper expanding on this documentary topic will be due at the end of
the course. A field trip to New York will let us see first hand works from the collections at the Museum
of Modern Art, Whitney Museum of American Art and the International Center of Photography and
meet with curators of photography at these institutions.
Evaluation will be based on their classroom presentation, general participation and their written work.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 12. Preference given to upper class students.
Meeting time: mornings; 3 two-hour sessions per week.

ENGL 013 Gender and Science Fiction (Same as Women's and Gender Studies 013)
This course will focus on the development and current range of science fiction, fantasy and utopian
fiction-predominantly by women-that is explicitly and centrally engaged with gender issues. We will
begin with Charlotte Perkins Gilman's Herland (1915), a utopian novel about an all-female world.
Likely further readings include work by Ursula LeGuin, Marge Piercy, Margaret Atwood, Joanna
Russ, Sheri Tepper, Octavia Butler, Melissa Scott, Rachel Pollock, Paul Park, and others. Issues to be
considered include the function and value of non-realist fiction as a locus for theorizing or speculating
about male and female culture and identity, sexuality, the uses and dangers of technology, and the role
of violence in human culture. Students will have opportunities to pursue particular authors or types of
fiction that interest them, and the course will also offer some opportunity to meet with some contem-
porary writers in the field.
Requirements: reading journal or a 10-page essay, relatively heavy reading load.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20. Preference given to seniors and English majors.
Meeting time: mornings; 3 two-hour sessions per week.
Cost to student: approximately $50 for books.
CASE
ENGL 014 Turnpike Vernacular
No state in the nation is more important to modern American poetry than is New Jersey. Poems of
Walt Whitman, William Carlos Williams, LeRoi Jones, Allen Ginsberg, and Bruce Springsteen will
take us to Camden (where Whitman spent the last years of his life, "receiving many buffets and some
precious caresses"), Paterson (maniacal focus of Williams's book-length poem), Newark (birthplace
of Ginsberg and Jones) and Asbury Park. Films by Kevin Smith will provide comic relief, of sorts.
These works variously create a state of mind rooted in a physical sense of place-but this "place" never
stays still, always amounts somehow to less than the sum of its dreams. Using the resources of every-
day language these poets express longing, displacement, a love of mean streets and angry rivers: Wil-
liams said, "in the very lay of the syllables Paterson as Paterson would be discovered." Following
Williams we'll ask what it means for a piece of art to be "particular to its own idiom." The course will
include a mandatory trip (January 13, 14, 15) to places we've read about: including Whitman's grave
in Harleigh Cemetery and the site of his "shanty" at 328 Mickle Street; the Passaic River and the Falls
at Paterson; and the "City Secrets" tour of Newark.
Requirements: attendance, participation in three day field trip, 10 page paper.
Prerequisites: previous experience with poetry; permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 15.
Meeting time: afternoons; full days during field trip January 13-15.
Cost to student: $300 (three-day field trip).

ENGL 015 The Hours and Mrs. Dalloway
The Hours, a 1998 novel by Michael Cunningham and a 2003 film directed by Stephen Daldry (star-
ring Meryl Streep, Nicole Kidman, and Julianne Moore), weaves together scenes of Virginia Woolf
writing her ground-breaking modern novel, Mrs. Dalloway, a fifties housewife who is reading the
novel, seeing herself in Mrs. Dalloway, and a woman who relives the novel in a highly contemporary
way while planning a party for a friend dying of aids in 2001. After discussing the film of The Hours,
we will spend a week exploring Virginia Woolf's life, reading selections from her letters, diaries,
memoirs, and biographies, discussing her artistic innovation, the radical social experiments of the
Bloomsbury group, Woolf's mental illness, and suicide. In the second week we will examine Mrs.
Dalloway along with the 1999 film adaptation (directed by Marleen Gorris, starring Vanessa Red-
grave), discussing social and artistic experimentation and convention, and the ways in which Woolf's
high modernist form is adapted to the cinema. In the final week, we will return to The Hours, analyz-

ing Cunningham's novel (along with the film) as an innovative work of art which is at once an insight-
ful tribute to and a thoughtful interpretation of Woolf's life and work.
Requirements: attendance at all classes and scheduled screenings of films, completion of readings,
taking an active and informed role in class discussions, and writing a series of short essays.

ENGL 016 Sebald
This course will mainly involve reading the four major works (perhaps you could call them documen-
tary novels) of the contemporary German writer, W.G. Sebald. In a curious style (it combines
photographs, biographies of actual people, fictional biographies, odd topics, dreams), Sebald consid-
ers the deepest issues of twentieth-century history. A lot of critics think he may be the most important
writer of the last decade. We'll read his books, including The Emigrants, Rings of Saturn, and Auster-
litz, in translation.
Requirements: regular attendance and 10 pages of writing.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15.
Meeting time: mornings; 3 times a week.
Cost to student: $50 for books.
LIMON
ENGL 017 Film Direction
Much labor by many people goes into the making of a feature film, yet it is the director who, by a
possibly regrettable shorthand, is normally regarded as the principal "author" of a film. In this course
we will try both to understand the nature of a director's work, in relation to that of his or her colleagues
(the screenwriter, actors, cinematographer, editor, and so on), and to learn how to distinguish in fin-
ished films the particular marks of the director's influence. We will examine closely two films by each
of a number of distinguished directors, in order to pinpoint some of the essential devices and stylistic
qualities that characterize each director's work. We will pay especially close attention to the way in
which a director imagines and constructs an individual scene, analyzing in depth for this purpose a
film directed by Andrew Litvack, Merci Docteur Rey. There will be screenings (normally one in ad-
vance of each class) of films by such directors as Ernst Lubitsch (Trouble in Paradise, To Be or Not To
Be), Jean Renoir (Grand Illusion, The Golden Coach), Luis Buñuel (Belle du Jour, The Discreet
Charm of the Bourgeoisie), Robert Altman (Nashville, The Long Goodbye), and Pedro Almodóvar
(Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown, All About My Mother).
Requirements: faithful attendance and active participation in class discussion, and exercises amount-
ing to about 10 pages of writing.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limited: 15.
Meeting time: mornings; 3 sessions per week.

ENGL 018 David Foster Wallace's Infinite Jest
In 1996 David Foster Wallace published a brilliant, hilarious, intricate novel, Infinite Jest, which won
critical acclaim and zealous readers. While the novel is vastly entertaining and provocative, it is also
vastly long and complicated. Winter Study Period is an ideal time to read and discuss this remarkable
work. This course will explore, enjoy, and analyze Infinite Jest.
Requirements: regular attendance, participation, and completion of several brief writing assignments
and seminar reports.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15.
Meeting time: mornings; 4 sessions per week.
Cost to student: nominal.
R. BELL
ENGL 019 Artificial Preservatives
A course designed to explore the "mummification" of contemporary culture: fantasies of virtuality,
suspended animation, and forensic revivification that aim to deny the necessity of loss and ruin. We'll
look at a variety of texts, from Toy Story II to Paul Auster's City of Glass, but much of our time will be
spent considering the implicit logic of American museums. The course will combine class discussions
with field trips to museums and collections in Pittsfield, the Hudson Valley, and New York City. Read-
ings will include fiction, museum histories, and works of cultural theory. Museums to be visited may
include the Berkshire Museum; Dia:Beacon; The Museum of Natural History; and the Isabella Gar-
dner.
Evaluation will be based on attendance, participation, and the creation of an exhibit demonstrating
understanding of the issues treated during the course. This exhibit will be displayed in a group show
on the final day of Winter Study.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 12. Preference given to seniors. All interested students must con-

Meeting time: afternoons; Monday & Wednesday class sessions, plus a Friday field trip January 9; an
overnight field trip January 13 and 14; and a three-day trip to New York January 20-22. Students who
cannot make the field trips may not take the course.
Cost to student: approximately $390 for course materials, transportation, overnight lodging, and ad-
missions.
ROSENHEIM
ENGL 020 Henry James: The Golden Bowl
In this course we will closely analyze Henry James' The Golden Bowl, which all consider to be his
last, and many his greatest, novel. This long, demanding and capacious book dramatizes many of
James' most powerful preoccupations. Centered on a wealthy American collector living in England at
the turn of the twentieth century, the novel examines the personal and cultural costs of an American
obsession with amassing relics of a collapsing European empire, as well as the effects of wealth and
refined sensibility on tangled love relations. The novel's ethical and perceptual subtlety is conveyed in
an ingeniously complex style that requires close concentration.
Requirements: faithful attendance, active participation and 10 pages of writing.
Prerequisites: a 100- or 200-level English course other than English 150. Enrollment limit: 15.
Meeting time: afternoons; 3 times each week.
Cost to student: $8.

ENGL 022 Environmental Journalism: The Payoffs and Perils (Same as Environmental
Studies 013)
(See under Environmental Studies for full description.)
ENGL 023 Charles Brockden Brown, "Father of the American Novel"
A half-crazed man kills a panther with his bare hands; covered in blood and disoriented, he is shot at
by settlers who mistake him for an Indian. A man able to mimic voices uses his uncanny skill to tor-
ment a brother and sister whose father has been struck dead by lightning while at prayer. Such bizarre
plots and disturbed characters characterize the writing of Charles Brockden Brown, whose novels
Wieland (1798), Edgar Huntly (1799), and Arthur Mervyn (1799-1800) this course examines. We will
investigate Brown's technique of psychological narration, which relates the characters' experiences
of terror, fury, and anticipation in breathless, suspenseful prose. We will also consider how the focus
on untrustworthy individual minds, driven by emotions rather than reason, critiques the ideals of
America at the end of the eighteenth-century. The era's republican philosophy held that citizens dis-
coursed rationally about questions of rights and justice; in contrast, Brown's novels showed individu-
als manically voicing the power of attraction, hatred, and greed. Yet Brown also represented the at-
tempts of reason to triumph amid entirely surreal circumstances; he is finally torn between fealty to
the ideal of rational discourse (he sent his novels to Thomas Jefferson) and his deep skepticism about
its relationship to psychological reality. Although he embraces the tormented reality of his characters,
he presents that reality as so untrustworthy and volatile that it seems to cry out for some kind of exter-
nal discipline. Brown's interest in the constant struggle between the rational and the irrational, and
between the conscious and the subconscious, became a hallmark of American authors such as Poe and
Melville, making the novelist a crucial figure in American literary history.
Evaluation will be based on one 8- to 10-page paper.
Prerequisites: 100-level English class other than 150.
Meeting time: afternoons; 3 times a week.
Cost to student: approximately $40 for books.

ENGL 025 Contemporary Film: New Voices Above and Below the Radar
A course in contemporary film with a significant travel component. The course will spend its first and
final week-and-a-half's worth of class sessions in Williamstown, and its middle portion--an eight day
period extending from 1/15 to 1/22 --in New York City. The first week and a half will be spent in
classroom time considering recent trends and developments in contemporary filmmaking; the final
week and a half will be spent in consideration of all that was absorbed in the course's middle portion.
As to that middle portion: the class will divide its time in New York between the film festivals at the
Brooklyn Academy of Music and Lincoln Center. The former--the BAM Cinématek at the BAM
Rose Cinemas--features first-run independent films, documentaries, and sneak previews of the sort
that will almost certainly never arrive in Williamstown, often including question and answer sessions
with the filmmakers, actors and screen writers. The latter--run by the Film Society of Lincoln Cen-
ter--is renowned for its first-run series involving independent film from neglected traditions: Mexi-
can, Bulgarian, Tibetan. Students will stay at the Williams Club and attend class at the Club on four of
the eight days, as well as attend multiple film showings: frequently twice a day. The rest of the time
Winter Study Program

will be the students'.
Evaluation will be based on in-class exercises and one 10-page paper.
Prerequisites: English 204 or permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 15.
Meeting time: afternoons; 3 times a week for two hours (Williamstown)-mornings (New York).
Cost to student: $800 --Travel to and from NY: $80; Accommodations at the Williams Club (includ-

ENGL 027 My Favorite Director
This course gives students an opportunity to do research on their favorite film directors and in an oral
presentation share what they have learned. The first half of the course will be devoted to developing a
filmography and an annotated bibliography of 10 items (e.g., reviews, articles, books or chapters) on
the director each student chooses. We will be working with a librarian to facilitate this part of the
course. One reading about each director or one of his/her films will be recommended for reading by
the whole class (this should be approximately 10-15 pages long). During this time, we will also screen
one film by each director for the whole class to view. There will be oral presentations during the sec-
ond half of the course, and students should also turn in their filmographies, bibliographies, and an
outline of their oral presentation at the end of Winter Study. Students may choose to augment their oral
presentations with video clips from the directors' films.
Requirements: annotated bibliography, filmography, oral presentation.

Dillard's An American Childhood (Pittsburgh, PA) are just some of the many books to emerge in re-
cent years that cultivate attentiveness to place. In this workshop, we'll read and discuss selections of
place-based literature from around the world, but the primary focus will be on personal writing about
places each student knows well--his or her hometown, Williamstown, etc. We'll begin with exercises
designed to free one's creative writing energies and hone skills of observation and description, and
build toward each student's completion of a 10- to 15-page piece of fiction, memoir, or other nonfic-
tion set in a familiar community. The course will encourage students to consider local landscapes and
species, but no special natural history knowledge is required and writing from urban and suburban
settings is welcome.

ENVI 013 Environmental Journalism: The Payoffs and Perils (Same as English 022)
Environmental journalism is fundamentally journalism, with all that implies about reporting, re-
search, accuracy, understanding the subjects and the audience, clarity, and style. In this course we will
read and critically analyze noteworthy recent examples of this special genre. The point is to under-
stand the techniques and elements of a successful feature article on an environmental subject. Aspects
of journalism we will cover include: audiences, goals, research, sources (including the internet), bias
and objectivity, interviews, plus the nuts and bolts of structuring your story, finding a fresh approach,
writing a good lead, handling quotations effectively, making deft transitions, and concluding with a
punch.
Issues we may cover (on local and national levels) include air and water pollution, hazardous materi-
als transportation and disposal, extractive industries including fisheries, endangered and threatened
species, land-use, global trends, disasters and other events, heros and villains, etc.
Participants will write a series of short pieces, including news reports, reviews, photo essays, and edi-
torial commentaries. We will also develop one major feature article on a subject of your choice, from
selection of subject, framing the story, research, outline proposal and "pitch" letter to the finished fea-
ture, which will be shaped to meet the needs and demands of a specific magazine or newspaper or
other medium. This will be considered a "live fire" exercise.
The course will be conducted as a workshop, with comment and analyses by the instructor, by guest
writers and editors, and by student participants.
Evaluation will be based on class participation and completion of all writing assignments.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 12. Preference given to Environmental Studies concentrators and

ENVI 016 The Lay of the Land--A Survey of the Business of Land Conservation
Today, there are more than 1,300 local land trusts operating throughout the country. There are numer-
ous other regional or nationwide organizations with missions pertaining to the conservation of land or
other natural resources. Miscellaneous agencies, at all levels of government, regulate, fund, own and/
or manage public lands. Ballot questions increasingly include land-related measures. Issues pertain-
ing to land in urban, suburban, rural and wilderness areas are highlighted in the news on a daily basis.
Land and resource-related policy debates are, as much as any other issue, a defining moment in the
differentiation between candidates, and parties. What is this all about? Why should I care? This course
will be an energetic hike across the field of land conservation today. Topics will include: Who are the
players? What are they doing and where are they doing it? How does land conservation happen (what
are the tools, the business-side of the deals)? And, importantly, why does land conservation happen?
Winter Study Program

trends, etc.).
Evaluation will be based on class participation, and an oral presentation. Some reading material will

ENVI 017 The New England Forest (Same as Biology 017)
This field-oriented course explores (first hand and through readings and discussions) the ecology, nat-
ural history, utilization and conservation of New England's most abundant natural resource: the fore-
st. A comparative approach to forest communities will be taken: we will visit different forests across
the New England landscape delving into some of the reasons why they may vary. Specific topics will
include community dynamics, tree and shrub identification, adaptation, wildlife, threats to the forest,
forest management and conservation issues. There will be three to four meetings per week, at least
two of which will be in the field (some field trips will require students to be engaged in the class be-
yond normal WSP class hours). The course will culminate in a two to three day trip to investigate a
more distant forest region. Accordingly, students should be prepared to spend many hours in the out-
doors coping with the elements.
Evaluation will be based on a 10-page paper, technical report or comparable creative work on a topic
relevant to the course.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 10-12--this course is appropriate for any student who possesses a
healthy interest in natural history and the outdoors.
Meeting time: TBA with some all-day field trips.
Cost to student: approximately $170 (covers field trips, equipment, readings, etc.).

GEOSCIENCES
GEOS 010 Geology of the National Parks (Same as Environmental Studies 010)
A vicarious trip through selected national parks of the U.S. and Canada with emphasis on the geologi-
cal basis for their unique scenery. Areas to be studied will be chosen in order to illustrate a wide variety
of geologic processes and products. Readings will include a paperback text as well as short publica-
tions of the U.S. Geological Survey and of various natural history associations. The second part of the
month will involve independent study of topics chosen by the students in preparation for half-hour
oral presentations during the last week. The oral reports will be comprehensive, well illustrated ex-
planations of the geology of a particular national park or monument of the student's choice, using
maps, slides, and reference materials available within the department and on the internet. A detailed
outline and an accompanying bibliography will be submitted at the time of the oral presentation.
Evaluation will be based on attendance and participation and on the quality of the final report.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 12. Open only to students with no previous college-level study of
geology. Preference given to first-year students.
Meeting time: mornings; during the first two weeks for lectures and discussions supplemented with
lab work devoted to the interpretation of topographic and geologic maps and to the study of rock sam-
ples.

WOBUS
GEOS 012 Landscape Photography (Same as Environmental Studies 019)
This class will broaden students' appreciation for the appearance and history of the landscape and
teach the skills of making a successful photograph. Williamstown, situated in a valley between the
Green and Taconic Mountains and bisected by the Green and Hoosic Rivers, is a place of great natural
beauty. The local landscape is a subject that inspires both professional and amateur photographers
alike. While Williamstown will be the subject of most of our work, we will use it to learn principles of
universal application. Students will discover the importance of light in making a photograph. They
will also learn camera skills and the mechanics of photography to make slides, which will be reviewed
at biweekly class meetings. In addition to photographing and critiquing slides, the class will visit
collections at the Clark Art Institute and WCMA to see original work and examine and discuss books
on reserve at Sawyer Library. An overview of the history of landscape photography will be provided
with an emphasis on American workers such as Carlton Watkins, William Henry Jackson, Edward
Weston, Ansel Adams, and Alvin Langdon Cobern. We will also demonstrate examples of different
cameras such as medium format, view cameras, and panorama cameras. Students will produce a body
of successful photographs/slides that will be projected at the Winter Study presentation day.
Evaluation will be based on attendance, the student's photography, and their presentation.
Prerequisites: students will need a 35mm camera. Enrollment limit: 15. Preference given to first-year
students and sophomores.
Meeting time: mornings; 3 days a week for the first two weeks and 2 days a week after that; short field
trips will supplement the morning meetings.
Cost to student: approximately $50 for film and materials.

GEOS 014 Mapmaking and Ambiguity (Same as Environmental Studies 028)
Including maps for the visual presentation of data is often an effective means of getting your point
across, but are the data accurately represented?Students will learn the basics of mapping software,
how to find and import data sets, the elements of generating professional looking maps and printing
techniques. We will also study how maps are used to encourage people to draw incorrect conclusions
about data. Specific topics will include: color use and perception; data classification; aggregation of
data; making the point.
Evaluation will be based on class attendance, a 5-page paper including student generated maps, and a
class presentation supported by visual displays including maps.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 12. Preference given to students that have not taken ENVI/GEOS

Participants will spend two weeks camping and conducting field work on St. John in the US Virgin
Islands. In 1998 a group of Williams students mapped the Mary Creek Reef Complex and docu-
mented that large-scale sedimentologic and ecologic transformation had occurred since a previous
mapping in 1968, but we were not able to explain why these changes had occurred. We will return in
2004 to remap the reef. Looking at any modifications that have occurred in this six-year period will
allow us to better understand this reef complex and to put constraints on models for its recent evolu-
tion.
Evaluation will be based on participation in field mapping and on field notebooks.
Prerequisites: Geoscience 253T in fall of 2003. Enrollment limit: 12.
Cost to student: approximately $1000, but will depend on airfare and food expenses. There will be no

GERM 011 The Future of "Old Europe"
From the banal to the world-historical, from rancor over bananas to splits on Iraq, the signs are mount-
ing that the leading powers of continental Europe are not only chafing at their traditional place in the
American hegemony but itching to go their own way. Where will it lead? Focusing on Germany and
France, we'll consider four major topics: overt anti-Americanism, the possibility and feasibility of a
"United States of Europe," social democracy as a European alternative, and the increasingly divergent
stances of Europe and the U.S. in relation to the rest of the world. After undertaking a fast study of
Europe's shapes, systems, and vital statistics, we'll explore and discuss current issues and viewpoints
as reflected in the major American and European media. All texts in English, but students with compe-
tence in German and/or French will have the opportunity to work with materials in those languages.
Requirements: active participation in discussions, two presentations to be reworked into two short
papers.

HISTORY
HIST 010 "The Fatherland in Cleats:" Soccer and Identity in the Americas (Same as
American Studies 010)
This course will examine the cultural meaning of futebol in inter-American contexts. Across the
Americas people have used this often low-scoring sport to define themselves, their nations, and even
their civilizations. Looking on both the darker tendencies (especially violence) and the aesthetically
pleasing products (such as Brazilian "football-art" or "the beautiful game" of soccer, we will discuss
the boundaries involved in such definitions--between Latin American countries, the United States,
and other regions of the world; between men and women; between macho and non-macho men; be-
tween radical and ethnic groups. Among the questions we will address are: What does soccer repre-
sent for players and spectators in Boston and Buenos Aires? How and why do nations develop distinct
styles of play? Will the rise of women's teams challenge soccer machoism? Students will also explore
the themes of the course in a project on a specific team, game, athlete, or league.
Requirements: regular attendance and a 10-page paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20.
Meeting time: mornings; 3 sessions per week.
Cost to student: $50 for books and photocopies.
KITTLESON
HIST 011 Racism and the Colonial Legacy in Modern Europe
Europe is in a tumultuous period of growth and change, not least because of the strong and increasing
presence of non-European immigrants within its borders. Where do these immigrants come from?
When and why did they arrive in Europe? How have they been greeted in France, England, and Ger-
many? In this course, we will explore how Europeans today are grappling with these immigrants.
Film, newspapers, music, literature, and historical works will give us insight into such diverse topics
as Afro-Caribbean culture in England, the European debate on multiculturalism, radical Islamic fun-
damentalism, Rai music, and the affaire des foulards (headscarves) in France and Germany.
Evaluation will be based on class participation and a 10-page research paper/presentation on a topic
chosen by the student.

an intensely personal experience. This course will explore how Latinas and Latinos have told their
migration stories. After a brief historical overview of a particular group's migration history, we will
read fictional and autobiographical accounts to address what life was like in the home country, the
experience of the journey, and the challenges of adjusting to life in the United States.

American culture has been reflected in some of the classics of the genre such as A River Runs Through
It and The Big Two-Hearted River as well as more recent writings by men and women who enjoy
casting bits of feathers and fur in search of trout.
Evaluation will be based on attendance and participation and two 5-page papers or one 10-page paper.

HIST 015 How to Survive "Regime Change" and "Pre-Emptive Attacks" in Latin America,
and be a Journalist at the Same Time
Drawing on the instructor's own first-hand experience as a correspondent in South America, the
course will focus on the current war in Iraq and how it compares with what has happened in Latin
America in the past, as well as on issues that arise from being a journalist abroad.
Winter Study Program
­ 364 ­
The course will start with a discussion of the US doctrines of "pre-emptive attack" and "regime
change" and ask: Are these policies as novel as US officials suggest? After all, in the old days of the
Spanish American War (1898), Theodore Roosevelt was credited with being the first to proclaim--in
the context of Latin America--that the U.S. (to paraphrase him) has a right to do what they like in, or
with, Latin American countries, so long as it could plead special U.S. interests or a vague duty to po-
lice the Western Hemisphere on behalf of a civilized world. So are the differences between what hap-
pened in Iraq in 2003 and what occurred in Latin American countries over the last century--e.g.,: in
Mexico (1908), the Dominican Republic (1916 & 1965), Chile (1973), Grenada (1983), Panama
(1989), and El Salvador and Nicaragua (for most of the 1980's)--differences of degree or technology
or differences of principle? And have the principles themselves stayed vague and elusive?
Suggesting some parallels, key figures associated with George W. Bush's current Middle East policies
also played a major role in President Ronald Reagan's Latin American agenda. To name a few: John
Negroponte, now ambassador to the United Nations, was in the 1980s ambassador to Honduras dur-
ing the time the Contras were being trained and receiving aid in defiance of US laws banning it. Rich-
ard Perle, a prominent ideologue in the Bush administration on the war in Iraq and until recently chair-
man of the Defense Policy Board, in the 1980s in the Pentagon promoted President Reagan's proxy
wars in Nicaragua and El Salvador. Otto Reich, now advisor on Latin America in Condoleeza Rice's
office, was then head of a covert Contra-propaganda program that operated out of the State Depart-
ment. Elliott Abrams, now senior director for Near East and North African Affairs at the National
Security Council, was during the Reagan administration assistant secretary of the state for Western
Hemisphere Affairs; John Poindexter, now Director of the Information Awareness Office at the Penta-
gon's research agency, was in the 1980s national security advisor...and so on.
Delving into this subject of US relations with Latin America in the past, and how they compare with
US foreign policy goals today, the course will highlight some fundamental issues facing a journalist in
foreign assignments and/or in war-like and/or repressive situations. For example, how important is it
for a journalist to ask difficult questions--the ones officials don't like--and to know about history?
How can a journalist get beyond propaganda? Can you distinguish between good and bad journalism?
What sources can you trust and/or even find in a repressive situation? How can a journalist cope with
censorship? Are ethics important for a journalist?
Evaluation will be based on attendance and participation in classes, as well as a 10-page required
essay on a Latin American country of the student's choice that endorses or refutes how a regime
change or a change of government was brought about by US military and/or US business pressure.
Final classes may be spent giving examples of how such written work may be edited for publication.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20.
Meeting time: mornings; Tuesdays and Wednesdays.
Cost to student: $40-$50 for books and newspapers. The course will include other media--films--
and a comparison of they way newspapers in different countries (or in the same country) cover the
same topic.

HIST 016 A Failure of Trust: American Indians Seek an Accounting from the U.S.
Government (Same as American Studies 016)
This Winter Study course examines the complex legal and political issues regarding the Federal Gov-
ernment's management as a trustee of extensive land holdings on behalf of tribes and individual In-
dians. After examining the legislation that created the Government's trusteeship long ago for the In-
dian beneficiaries, we will study why this trusteeship has been so contentious, why individual Indians
have sued the Government, and why several high officials in both the Clinton and Bush II administra-
tions have been held in contempt by the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C. The course will also
study related problems, such as weak schools for the Indian population, devastating unemployment,
and issues of self-governance.
After reviewing the basic historical documents and issues, students will be asked to determine solu-
tions that benefit all of the parties: Indian country, the Court, the Congress and the Administration.
Requirements: two 5-page papers, a short oral presentation, and active class participation.

HIST 017 History in Pieces
Burgoyne Surrounded, Mexican Cross, Log Cabin, Texas Star, Mariner's Compass, Storm at Sea,
Drunkard's Path, Underground Railway are just a few of the many quilt patterns designed by our
American ancestors, representing events, political or social, in this country in the eighteenth and nine-
teenth centuries.
In this course, students will study American history through quilts. At the same time, they will learn
traditional and contemporary methods of quilt making. Each student will select a traditional Ameri-
can quilt pattern and reproduce that pattern into a 45" x 60" quilt. In addition, each student will design
either an original pattern representing an event in late-twentieth- early-twenty-first-century history or
keep aJanuary journal of life as a twenty-first-century quilter. The completed quilts will be the basis of
a quilt show to be scheduled during the second semester.
Evaluation will be based on regular participation in class and completion of the quilt and original de-
sign or journal. Students should understand that these are time-consuming projects and they must be
prepared to put in considerable time beyond actual class hours.
No prerequisites, but sewing experience is useful. Enrollment limit: 15.

HIST 018 Genre-Bending: Literature and Politics in the Modern Middle East
Political and historical issues have often been embedded within questions of literature in the modern
Middle East. At times, the very use of certain genres--including the novel and autobiography--has
been critiqued as a preference for the imported over the authentic. Yet writers in the Middle East have
used even "indigenous" forms to advance larger political critiques. As both a site of contestation and a
means of communication, literature has played a prominent role in twentieth century Middle Eastern
political life.
In this course we will examine a selection of twentieth century prose and poetic literary works with an
eye to elucidating their relationship to larger historical events. These works will be supplemented by
historical and theoretical readings intended to provoke critical assessment of the role of literature in
particular Middle Eastern contexts.
Works to be considered include: Cities of Salt, Return to Childhood, The Story of Zahra, Arabesques,
An Apartment Called Freedom, poems by Nizar Qabbani, and selected short storied by Ghassan Ka-
nafani.
Evaluation will be based on regular response papers and a final paper. Students should anticipate addi-
tional activities, including possible film screenings.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15.
Meeting time: mornings; Mondays and Thursdays.
Cost to student: $25 for a reading packet and two books.

HISTORY OF SCIENCE
HSCI 010 "Taking the Waters" Then and Now: A History of Spa Culture (Same as ArtH 010)
Have you ever wondered why you desire a brand of sparkling water the likes of Perrier or Poland
Springs? Or why you enjoy soaking in a hot tub or whirlpool after a workout on sweat-inducing ma-
chinery? Or why you feel energized after a long, vigorous walk? Or why families and individuals
alike seek healthful destinations for their vacations? The answers may be found in this course, an in-
terdisciplinary study that traces the historical development of the spa--from its origins in antiquity,
through its efflorescence around 1900, to our present time--as an architectural ensemble within its
unique therapeutic context.
For millennia, the healthful elements of nature--good waters, pure airs, and serene settings--have
been recognized by practitioners of medicine and by architects for cultivating "mens sana in corpore
sano" (a sound mind in a sound body). These aspects of nature have served as the foundation of sites
Winter Study Program

both sacred and secular. The spa emanates from a special relationship humans have cultivated with
these elements, particularly with water. We will explore how this relationship, shaped over time by
cultural values, has evolved from medical and spiritual pilgrimage to health tourism and fitness wor-
ship, and how water, serving as a curative means and design element, has in turn shaped the built envi-
ronment to accommodate better health of mind and body.
Specifically, we will see how the therapeutic value of mineral waters and high altitudes has been ana-
lyzed, prescribed, and commercialized by medical experts for the good of their patients. We will ex-
amine the evolving relationship between doctor and patient, in particular regarding women's health
and the current surge in alternative therapies. We will glimpse some of the bath complexes, spa towns
and sanatoria where patients have endured a rigorous schedule of water treatments, exercise, and diet.
Our "travels" include stops at, among other places, the Asklepion sanctuary at Kos, Lourdes, Bath,
Pyrmont, Karlsbad, Marienbad, Davos, Saranac Lake, Battlecreek, as well as an actual site visit to
Saratoga Springs, NY, where we will indulge in a bath and massage at the historic Lincoln Baths. A
spa, however conceived, represents a place where a short-term stay, whether a month, a weekend, or
an hour or two, is meant to induce long-term effects.
Using the collections at Williams and Yale University, we will examine these places through the mate-
rial culture (period medical treatises and journals, guidebooks, maps, promotional brochures, prints,
photographs, picture postcards, architectural plans) that have steered health-seekers toward these sa-
lubrious destinations as well as shaped their curative experiences. To augment the visual materials, the
readings will tap literary selections, including the following: Hippocrates, Vitruvius, Illich, Vigarello,
Schnitzler, Mann, Appelfeld, and Sontag.
Evaluation will be based on active class participation, 2 brief essays--one, a literary response, the
other, a site analysis--and a final creative project (for example, design a curative treatment or a health
facility, compare cross-cultural roles of bathing) presented in class.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20. Preference given to students with a reading knowledge of
French or German as well as those planning a career in medicine or architecture.
Meeting time: mornings; 2 two-hour sessions per week. Full day and half day field trips may include
evening sessions.

From the 1920s-1940s, a movement called Legal Realism assailed the notion of an objective and im-

backgrounds, and idiosyncrasies of decision-makers(usually judges and juries). In the most extreme
formulation, what a judge eats for breakfast has a greater effect on the outcome of a case than the rules
or laws that ostensibly govern the case. Modern-day descendents of the Legal Realism proclaim that
"law is politics." Is this radical skepticism on the mark? Insightful but exaggerated? Fundamentally
flawed? This course will probe the Realist perspective in the context of major legal controversies,
including Roe vs. Wade, Bush vs. Gore, the O.J. Simpson trial, the impeachment of Bill Clinton, and
the fight over the Supreme Court nominations of Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas.
Requirements: mandatory attendance, participation in discussions, short writing assignments, and a
final paper (8-10 pages).
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20.
Cost to student: $50-$100.

LGST 012 The Death Penalty and the Problem of Innocence
During the past decade, more than one hundred people convicted of murder and sentenced to death
have been subsequently proven innocent and freed. The most recent study has shown that more than
half of all trials that result in a death sentence are tainted by serious legal and procedural errors. These
statistics become even more shocking when we realize that only a tiny fraction of people on death row
are ever afforded the counsel and resources needed to prove their innocence. This course will explore
the legal and systemic tensions which have made the death penalty so difficult to administer in a just
manner. Among the subjects we will address are: the failure of the assigned counsel system, the im-
pact of habeas corpus reform, problems with eyewitness identification and human memory, and the
persistent problem of prosecutorial misconduct.
Evaluation will be based on a final paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 25.

MATH 010 Humor Writing (Same as English 040)
What is humor? The dichotomy inherent in the pursuit of comedic intent while confronting the tran-
sient nature of adversity can ratchet up the devolving psyche's penchant for explication to a cata-
strophic threshold, thwarting the existential impulse and pushing the natural proclivity for causative
norms beyond the possibility of pre-situational adaptation.
Do you know what that means? If so, this is not the course for you. No, we will write funny stuff, day
in and day out. Or at the very least, we will think it's funny. Stories, essays, plays, fiction, nonfiction,

we'll try a little of each. And we'll read some humor, too.
Is laughter the body's attempt to eject excess phlegm? Why did Plato write dialogues instead of mono-
logues? Who backed into my car in the Bronfman parking lot on the afternoon of March 2, 2003?
These are just a few of the questions we will not explore in this course. No, we won't have time be-
cause we will be busy writing. (But if you know the answer to the third question, there's a $10 reward.)

MATH 011 Lessons in Go
Go is probably the oldest board game in the world, originating in China more than 4,000 years ago,
and played today by millions of people. Unlike (Western) Chess, which focuses on hierarchical soci-
ety and strictly defined and limited powers, and unlike (Middle Eastern) Backgammon, which is pre-
occupied with fate, chance and a wave of luck, Go has an Eastern spirit, where every piece is of equal
value and can be played anywhere on the board. The aim is not to destroy but to build territory, where
single stones become groups, and groups become organic structures. Two players alternate in placing
black and white stones on a 19 - 19 ruled board with the aim of surrounding territory. The stones are
left as they stand throughout the game, so that the game itself takes shape as a visible record of the
thinking that went into it. The result is an amazing aesthetic and intuitive movement with deep com-
plexity. Although easy to learn, no computer program exists which can beat a strong amateur player
(even with a $5 million reward incentive). We look at how Go helped shape Asian culture, namely in
Japan, and how this game is a reflection of Asian values. Strategic topics include: Joseki (openings),
Tesuji (tactical magic), life and death, territory and influence, endgame, and handicap strategy. We
will analyze famous games, discuss problems, as well as moderate a tournament among students and
computer programs.
Evaluation will be based primarily on attendance, participation, problem sets and a final exam.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20. No slackers need apply.
Meeting time: mornings.
Cost to student: approximately $40 for books and supplies.

MATH 012 Introductory Photography: People and Places
This will be an introductory course in photography, with an emphasis on color photography. The main
themes will be portraiture and the landscape. No previous knowledge is assumed, but students are
expected to have access to a 35 mm camera, preferably with manual override or aperture priority. The
use of a digital camera may be possible, after consultation with the instructor. The topics covered will
include composition, exposure, camera use and properties of film, direction and properties of light,
and digital imaging (scanning and printing). Students will develop their eye through the study of the
work of well-known photographers and the critical analysis of their own work. We will discuss the
work of contemporary photographers such as Mary Ellen Mark, Joel Meyerowitz, Constantine Man-
os, and Eugene Richards. Students will be expected to spend a considerable amount of time practicing
their own photography outside of class (using 35mm color slide film). There will be one required local
half-day field trip. Students will also be introduced to the program Photoshop used to manipulate im-
ages digitally, and will work on their own pictures with this program. The film used will be color slide
film, but students will learn to scan their slides and produce prints using a digital printer.
Evaluation will be based on class participation, two quizzes and a final project.

MATH 016 The Art and History of Knitting (Same as ArtS 023 and History 023)
Creating fabric out of interlocking loops can be traced back to the Neolithic period, and knitted arti-
facts 1600 to over 2000 years old have been found in Egypt, Peru, and Sweden. Knitting requires little
machinery and can be done almost anywhere -- walking, riding, even in poor light-- yet requires a
significant amount of learned skill. Knitting techniques have been handed down through generations,
shared in small groups, and transferred between cultures as trade routes emerged. The social history of
knitting is a rich reflection of the history of culture.
This course examines the history and technique of this important skill. We will examine the history of
knitting from a global and social perspective through a sequence of readings and lectures. Reading list
includes: History of Knitting, by Richard Rutt; No Idle hands: The History of American Knitting, by
Anne L. MacDonald; and The Age of Homespun, by Laurel Thatcher Ulriche.
We will engage a series of project samples designed to introduce and improve skills of beginning knit-
ters, starting with simple blankets and culminating in a final project of the students choosing. Students
will also be required to select and research some aspect of knitting and write a 10-page research paper.
Topics will need pre-approval of the instructor.
Evaluation will be based on participation, final project, and final 10-page research paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15. Preference given to beginning knitters.
Meeting time: three 2-hour evening periods every week.
Costs to the student include materials and about $55 for textbooks.

PHIL 010 German Cinema (Same as English 028 and German 010)
This course will take a broad look at German cinema. We will begin with an intensive study of the
`golden age' of German film -Weimar cinema, a period which includes such classic films as Fritz
Lang's Metropolis and M, F.W. Murnau's Nosferatu and Faust, Robert Wiene's Das Cabinet des Dr.
Caligari, Josef von Sternberg's Das Blaue Engel, and many, many more. In addition to viewing many
of these films, we will look at some of the classic literature on the period, including the now notorious
readings offered by Siegfried Kracauer and Lotte Eisner. The class will pay particular attention to the
various genres that span the length of German cinema including Berg- and Heimatfilme, Strassen-
filme, Problemfilme, and Trümmerfilme. This study of genres will propel to class forward chronolog-
ically to explore other periods including National Socialist films (e.g., Riefenstahl) and New German
Cinema (e.g., Fassbinder, Herzog, Schloendorff). All films will be in German with English subtitles.
All reading and discussion will be in English.

PHIL 011 Why New Englanders Eat What They Eat (Same as American Studies 011 and
History 019)
Have you ever wondered why the food of New England is sugary and bland: is it the people, the land,
the economy? Do New Englanders like their diets or are they forced into them? This course will inves-
tigate these kinds of questions by looking at the political, economic, cultural, and climatic factors that
have shaped the diet and culture of New Englanders.
We will begin our course by learning about the ecology and culture of food developed by Native
Americans: how did they hunt, gather and farm, and how did their methods of procuring food form
their relationship to nature and to each other? Then we will consider the diet of the first European set-
tlers and their interaction with Native Americans. Issues such as differing uses of the land, what was
considered by the term "property," and what was being sold by the Native Americans to the settlers
will be considered. Next we will examine how food was used to try to socialize the next wave of immi-
grants to New England and how women used food to gain entrance to higher education, which also
opened the door to science in food. Finally we will look at international issues such as genetically
modified foods, the economic and cultural impact of agribusiness, over-fishing the seas and pollution
as it relates to our food. We will enjoy a historically accurate demonstration of life in the 1700's at His-
toric Deerfield and a guest speaker. The reading list will include: Change in the Land, William Cro-
non; Unredeemed Captive, John Demos; Cod, Mark Kurlansky; Perfection Salad, Laura Shapiro;

PHIL 025 History and Philosophy of Biology: The Galapagos Islands (Same as Biology 025)
"If there is the slightest foundation for evolution, the zoology of the Galapagos will be well worth
examining..." Charles Darwin
On September 16, 1835, the HMS Beagle , with young Charles Darwin as the boat's naturalist,
reached the Galapagos Archipelago, a cluster of islands on the equator, 600 miles west of South
America. During his five weeks in the Galapagos, Darwin found distinct types of giant tortoises in
different islands, land and marine iguanas, thirteen different types of finches whose beaks were modi-
fied to different sub-environments on the islands, and discovered many plant and animal species
found nowhere else on earth. His ground-breaking theory of evolution by natural selection took shape
on the islands, and the major evidence provided for it in The Origin of Species, published some 20
years later, comes from Darwin's Galapagos notes and diaries. After a long period of neglect, in 1959
the Galapagos islands became Ecuador's first National Park; in 1978, UNESCO declared the Islands a
World Heritage Site, of unique and universal significance for our world and our science.
Aims of the course: The Galapagos Islands provide an unique opportunity to understand science as a
dynamic process, focused on nature but influenced by human needs, desires and institutions. The Is-
lands occupy an important place in the history of science: after the evidence of adaptation they pro-
vided, young Darwin was "... almost convinced (quite contrary to the opinion I started with) that spe-
cies are not (it is like confessing a murder) immutable." We will examine the concept, nature and
strength of evidence in evolutionary biology, with the implied comparison with the nature of evidence
in other scientific fields. Simultaneously, we will discuss the relationship between scientific theories
and a larger intellectual (religious, political) context of the time, following the same line of thought to
the present day, in the tensions between `pure' scientific research at the Darwin Station, the conserva-
tion efforts, and "ecotourism," sometimes understood as a form of popularization of science, and
sometimes as a new form of exploitation of the environment. In order to pursue these general ques-
tions in depth, we will undertake a detailed study of the Galapagos islands, focusing on the following
specific topics: Charles Darwin and the voyage of the Beagle; formation and geology of the Galapa-
gos islands; Galapagos sea birds; Darwin's finches and other land birds; reptiles of the Galapagos; sea
mammals of the Galapagos; plants of the Galapagos; and human history in the Galapagos.
Tentative itinerary: The trip will probably take 11 days: one full day of travel on each end, a full day in
Quito, Ecuador's capital in the Andes, and a 7-night cruise in the islands. Following our tour of old
Quito, we will travel about 45 minutes north of the city to spend an afternoon at the equator. The next
day, we will fly to the Galapagos island of Santa Cruz, where we will board a boat. Our first important
stop will be at the Charles Darwin Research Station, which develops and supports various internation-
al research projects, and advises the Ecuadorian government on minimizing the impact of tourism on
the islands. It contains a national-park information center and a museum. The station is also an tortoise
breeding and rearing center, where tortoise of different subspecies are prepared to be reintroduced
back to their natural habitat. After leaving Santa Cruz, we will cruise for 7 days among the islands,
visiting Baltra, Genovesa, Espanola, San Cristobal, Bartolome, Santiago, Isabela and Fernandina, fi-
nally returning to Santa Cruz. Each day will include a morning and afternoon excursion, during which
we will walk along trails and experience first-hand the islands' amazing wild life. Our daily discus-
sions will take place after dinner. There will also be ample opportunity for swimming and snorkeling
with Galapagos sea-lions, beautiful fish, sea turtles, and penguins.
Requirements: this course falls into three parts: preparation for the trip, the trip itself, and work after
our return. In general, each student will be responsible for a segment of the course, and required to
participate in joint activities. Specifically: before departure, there will be 10 contact hours, during
which we will set the main aims and methodology of the course, start our discussion of Darwin's
seminal work, The Origin of Species, and see an introductory video of the Galapagos islands. Stu-
dents should count on doing 20-30 additional hours of research and reading. During the trip, each
student will: (a) give an on-site presentation, prepared in Williamstown; (b) serve as the source for a
particular area of information (for example, geology of the islands, giant tortoises, land and marine
iguanas, etc.); (c) participate in daily discussions of the assigned readings and the day's itinerary; and
(d) collect documentation for the final class project (drawings, photography, film, naturalist diary...).
Upon return to Williamstown, each student will submit a 5-7 pages long paper, and contribute to the

PHYS 012 Meet the Right Side of Your Brain: Drawing as a Learnable Skill (Same as ArtS
019)
Representational drawing is not merely a gift of birth or a magical ability granted by angels, but a
learnable skill. If you ever wanted to draw, but doubted you had the ability or believed you could not
learn, then this course is for you. This intensive course utilizes discoveries in brain research to teach
representational drawing. By using simple techniques and extensive exercises you will discover and
develop the perceptual shift from your symbol based left hemisphere to your visually based right
hemisphere. This cognitive shift enables you to accurately see and realistically represent the physical
world. You will learn to draw a convincing portrait, self-portrait, and still life. This course is designed
to develop your powers of observation and enhance your innate creative problem solving abilities,
which are applicable in any field.
Requirements: keeping a sketchbook recording of progress, attendance and participation in all ses-
sions, and a final project.
No prerequisites--students need no previous artistic experience, just the willingness and desire to
learn a new skill. Enrollment limit: 30 (two sections of 15). Preference given to juniors and seniors.
Meeting time: afternoons; 3 times per week (about 10 hours lecture and group exercises) with sub-
stantial additional independent student work.
Cost to student: approximately $15 for text and drawing materials.

Films has long been used as a medium for conveying political views and ideologies, and for exploring
social injustice and political scandal. In this course, we'll screen a wide range of early and more recent
films and documentaries whose primary object is to convey a particular political viewpoint or to offer
a pointed critique of prevailing social, political, or economic arrangements. Special attention will be
paid to the ways in which film has been used to shift prevailing opinions and beliefs about particular
political systems. Some of the films we may view include Eisenstein's The Battleship Potempkin

PSCI 011 Violence, Testimony, and the Culture Wars: Speaking, Truth, and Power (Same as
American Studies 011)
This course is about how the experience of genocide and other forms of state-sponsored mass murder
is given narrative form by those who survive it, and about the expectations or demands that shape
readers', and in particular American readers', responses to such testimony. We will consider some
accounts by survivors of the Shoah or Holocaust. We will engage related, but more philosophical
work on the problems of testifying about suffering and violence. Our central case study, however, will
be of Nobel Peace Prize-winning activist and author Rigoberta Menchú, whose narrative of life and
struggle in Guatemala, I, Rigoberta Menchú, has been celebrated by some as a classic account of in-
digenous resistance to oppression and challenged by others as systematically distorted and fundamen-
tally dishonest. In exploring this case, we will learn something about both the civil war in Guatemala
of which Menchú writes and the Latin American testimonio tradition on which she draws, and we will
make sense of how and why this particular book and author came to play such a prominent role in the
"culture wars" that marked U.S. intellectual and political life in the nineties. Though we concentrate
especially on one particular battle in those conflicts, the goal is to come to understand broader prob-
lems of speaking, truth, and power in the Americas.
Evaluation will be based on class participation and a 10-page paper.
Enrollment limit: 15. Preference given to those with prior work in Political Science, American Stud-
ies, or Latin American Studies.

PSCI 012 Hollywood's Version of Politics
This course will include the showing of several movies based on important aspects of political life in
America. Each movie will also be followed by a class discussion of the political theme depicted and its
relevancy to political events today. The movies shown will be: Inherit the Wind (based on the Scopes
trial) and its relevancy to the politics of today's Christian right, Advise and Consent (a story of con-
gressional machinations over presidential appointments) and today's congressional handling of such
appointments, The Candidate (a satirical depiction of the hypocrisy and complicity in the American
political world), and today's political world, The Last Hurrah (loosely based on Boston's past, great
political machines) and what constitutes political machines today. And if time permits either or both
All the President's Men (the story of politics and the press) or Wag the Dog (the story of a fabricated

PSCI 013 European Integration, Globalization and International Business
The intent of this course is to increase appreciation of the course of European integration. The contin-
uing effort of western European countries to develop an ever-closer economic and political union rep-
resents the most advanced case of globalization and international cooperation. The European Union
(EU), founded in 1956 to foster economic development as well as avoid a third World War, has in the
last few decades formed a common market, expanded to 15 members (and is set to increase to 25), and
introduced a common currency. Its convention has already submitted a set of recommendations that
will lead to further political as well as economic integration. These efforts have been spurred by in-
stant communication, rapid transportation, and increased competition. What opportunities and chal-

PSCI 014 Objective Journalism During Times of Conflict (Same as English 029)
Can a newspaper editor or reporter from a nation fighting terror separate their patriotism and be mem-
bers of a medium whose goal it is to reveal the truth, report objectively and let the reader judge for him
or herself? This class will follow personal experiences of two Israeli journalists, Aviva Lori and Shlo-
mo Papirblat, through major recent events in the Middle East such as the current Intifada, the war in
Lebanon, military reserve duty and many other current topics. Students will examine actual journalis-
tic dilemmas of the instructors and discuss their perspective vis-à-vis the reality of the situation. Top-
ics for discussion include whether a governing body can require journalists, during times of national
peril, to favor national interest and potentially compromise their journalistic integrity. Can a true de-
mocracy restrict and regulate press coverage during times of emergency? What is the influence of the
international media on the political developments in a contiguous region? And how much should
political leaders consider the influence of the media on the success or failure of their planned political
strategy? A central question will be whether journalism is just another profession or is a journalist an
intermediary between the public and the decision-makers and thus partake in the evolution of national
events? In addition, the course will address the foreign press coverage of events and will question
whether a foreign correspondent, who is not familiar with the local language and culture and the com-
plexities of the local realities, can report in a manner that conveys the whole picture.
Evaluation will be based on a final 10-page paper.

PSCI 015 The Development of Inuit Art
Inuit art (which includes the following genre of art: sculpture, graphic arts, as well as jewelry, wall
hangings, pottery and other modes) is a very modern development. It can be dated very precisely to
the early 1950s. Since that beginning it has gained world-wide attention. There are galleries of Inuit
art not only through out Canada and the United States but also Europe and Asia. Inuit art is included in
the collections of major museums throughout the world. The production of Inuit art developed in re-
sponse to the sudden change in Inuit life from nomadic subsistence in the norther arctic regions of
Canada to fixed settlements on Baffin Island and areas around Hudson Bay and the consequent need
to create a cash based economy. The course will cover the development of Inuit art focusing on the
major centers (Cape Dorset, Baker Lake, Arviat, etc.), the major artists (Kenojuak, Oonark, George
Arlook, Latcholassie, Parr, Pauta, etc.) and the major forms of sculpture and print making. The chang-
ing character of Inuit life and governance (the Canadian government recently completed a major re-
consitution granting much of the people of the arctic north autonomy as a self-governing region called
Nunavut. In addition to the technical development of the art, its history and the biography of the major
artists, we will be exploring the cultural context of Inuit art to the Inuit as well as to the international
market.
Requirements: assigned readings and a 10- to 15-page paper assignment with students choosing from
the following topics: a study of a particular work of art, the work of a particular artist, some aspect of
Inuit life or politics, or economic analyses (e.g., using Inuit art auction results over the years). There
will be visiting lectures by major Inuit art dealers.

PSCI 017 Film and Politics in Mexico
With the international success of movies such asThe Crime of Padre Amaro and Amores Perros, Mex-
ican films are getting notice again. The story of this industry is actually longer and more politically
complicated than it may seem today. This course offers a history of Mexican post-Revolutionary poli-
tics through film, with special attention to the "golden age" of the late 1940's and early 1950's, the
figure of Cantínflas, the economics and politics of the different genres of film in Mexico, and the re-
cent resurgence of high-quality feature-length movies that combine
international influences with aspects of the locally established genres.
Evaluation will be based on class participation and a 10-page paper.

PSCI 021 Power, Authority and Decisionmaking in the Public Sector
This course is an internship experience in which students both work in and analyze governmental and
related nongovernmental organizations. The goal of this course is to develop the ability to analyze
power, authority and decisionmaking in public organizations; in short, to better understand leader-
ship. Students may have internships in government and nonprofit organizations. They may have in-
ternships in for-profit organizations if the internship involves significant involvement with public is-
sues. Examples include: town government offices; state or federal administrative offices such as envi-
ronmental agencies or housing authorities; interest groups that lobby government such as the Cham-
ber of Commerce or the ACLU; and nonprofit organizations such as think tanks or service providers.
The instructor will work with each student to arrange an internship, and such arrangements must be
made in advance of the Winter Term. Students are expected to spend the better part of the day, five
days a week, with the organization. Each student's internship mentor shall send a confirmation letter
to the instructor verifying the internship and describing the nature of the work to be performed by the
intern. All students will read a few short articles and engage in on-line discussion with other students
about the issues raised in these articles in relation to their internship. All students are expected to
maintain weekly contact with the instructor. A group meeting of all students will occur after winter
study to discuss experiences.
Requirements: internship work, participation in on-line discussion, and a 10-page paper analyzing
issues of power, authority, and decisionmaking in the organization. Evaluation will be based on the
mentor's assessment, participation in discussions, and the paper.
Enrollment limit: 15. At the time of registration, interested students should send a brief resume and
letter of interest to Professor Johnson.
Cost to student: $5 for readings, transportation costs to and from internship site.

PSYCHOLOGY
PSYC 010 Mental Illness in Film
This course examines the depiction of mental illness and the therapeutic process on the silver screen.
How do films influence our perceptions of normality and abnormality? How do they shape our beliefs
about the causes of mental illness, as well as our expectations about the content and process of treat-
ment? Films have the potential to serve a variety of functions, ranging from a form of advocacy for the
mentally ill to a mechanism for furthering stigma and intolerance. In this course, we will sample a
variety of powerful films (both contemporary and classic) representing multiple perspectives on men-
tal illness. Some of the films to be viewed include: One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Frances, Basic
Instinct, and The Three Faces of Eve.
During the first half of the course we will view films as a group, explore their explicit and implicit
messages about mental illness, and contrast their media portrayal with first person accounts. In the
second half of the course, students will focus their attention on a clinical disorder of personal interest.
Students will view a film that pertains to that disorder, and compare the cinematic depiction with more
"real-world" clinical manifestations as described in a first person account or in current research litera-
ture. Students will present their projects to the larger group during the final week of winter study.
Evaluation will be based on class participation and a 10-page research paper.

PSYC 011 Rat Olympics
Behaviorism is a school of psychological thought founded on the idea that the expression of a particu-
lar behavior is the consequence of stimulus-response experiences. For example, the behaviorist might
argue that people engage in particular behaviors because doing so has been associated with reinforce-
ment in the past. Over the course of Winter Study, we will read classic writings from the founders of
Behaviorism (e.g., John Watson, B.F. Skinner) and we will consider ways in which these principles
apply to our everyday lives. Students will use behaviorist principles to modify human behavior. We
will also use these principles to train rats to perform amazing feats. The course will culminate in a "Rat
Olympics" in which the success of the conditioning efforts will be assessed in head-to-head competi-
tion of conditioned animals.
Evaluation will be based on a written report of their experiences conditioning a change in human be-
havior as well as a written report of the conditioning methods used in training their rat Olympians. The
Olympics will be held on the final day of Winter Study.
No prerequisites.
Meeting time: mornings; Monday, Wednesday, Friday 10 a.m.-noon. Extensive time will be spent

PSYC 012 Dreams, Problem-Solving and Self-Understanding
In this course, students will learn how paying attention to nighttime dreams can help solve daytime
problems and lead to increased self-understanding, in support of living a more satisfying and creative
life. These benefits of working with dreams will be illustrated through assigned readings, then
brought to life in class, where students will discuss the readings, as well as share and work with their
own dreams. A variety of skills for understanding dreams will be taught and practiced, covering the
perspectives of many schools of thought in the history of dream interpretation.
Evaluation will be based on a final research paper and classroom discussion of assigned readings.
Participation in discussion of dreams will also be taken into account.
Requirements: assigned readings and Internet search, and keeping a dream journal for the duration of
the winter session.

PSYC 015 Principles of Psychotherapy
Outlining the principles underlying the "talking cure", this course represents the kind of overview of
psychotherapy the instructor wishes he had received as an undergraduate. Topics covered will include
the particular arrangements for therapy, how they differ from other social situations, the initiation of
therapy, and principles of transference, counter-transference, personal history investigation and inter-
pretation. Of particular interest will be to describe how, during psychotherapy, persons change. By
using both imagined therapy dialogues and published student autobiographies, efforts will be made at
each stage to illustrate ways in which the general principles work out in practice. For the course paper,
students will be asked to describe an issue of concern in the student's own experience and to imagine
how a therapist might collaborate in working on that issue. At the end of the course the instructor will
discuss each paper individually with each student.
Requirements: readings, class discussion, and a 10-page paper.

PSYC 016 The Examined Life
"The unexamined life is not worth living." This ancient maxim gains contemporary meaning in the
context of the burgeoning field of behavioral health with its emphasis on the integral role of self-
awareness to physical and psychological well-being. This course takes off from this premise and in-
vites students on a journey of self-discovery and increased self-awareness. Through a variety of read-
ings and presentations, the course will introduce central concepts of behavioral health such as mind-
fulness, learned optimism, and confronting vs. inhibition (our theoretical mentors being J. Kabat-
Zinn, M. Seligman, and J.W. Pennebaker). The primary focus of the course, however, will be practical
application rather than theoretical mastery and to facilitate an experiential engagement with these
concepts in students' lives. A variety of in-class demonstrations and experiential exercises (e.g., ex-
pressive art work, guided visualization, meditation practice) will be used to foster students' personal
integration of course content. A required field trip to the Kripalu Center will provide another kind of
entry into the observation of mindfulness. The experiential process of self-discovery will include the
subjective "lens" of working with dreams and personal journal activities augmented by the objective
"lens" of self-administered instruments (e.g., Myers-Briggs, the Coping Style Inventory, and others)
providing formalized information on one's personality and coping style, career interests, and aptitu-
des. At the end of this course, a student will know more about her/himself, the value of examined
living in decreasing stress and increasing psychological health, and an array of ways to continue the
journey of self-discovery.
Evaluation will be based on 1) class attendance and participation, 2) keeping a journal, both for first-
hand experience of the value of writing as "confronting" and as a personal record of experiential exer-
cises, dream work, etc. and 3) a final paper (10 pages) or project.
Prerequisites: students considering this WSP should note that the nature of some of the experiential
exercises and group processing in class calls for modest levels of self-disclosure. Class participants
can and may choose to "pass" in some instances, but most students find the exercises to be interesting
and non-problematic. Some aspects of the course might be helpful to those students making transi-
tions and/or decisions such as declaration of major, career choices, etc. Enrollment limit: 15.
Meeting time: mornings.
Cost to student: approximately $60 for books and psych test batteries.

REL 010 The Zen Monastic Experience
This course combines the academic and experiential study of Zen Buddhism as it is lived and prac-
ticed in an authentic American Zen monastic setting. It will offer students a rare chance to spend a
week at the Zen Mountain Monastery in Mt. Tremper, NY, in a specially-designed program introduc-
ing them to the basics of Zen monastic practice. Students will participate in the full monastic schedule,
including group meditation practice in the mornings and evenings, liturgy, caretaking, interviews with
a Zen teacher, and a traditional Zen lecture. There will also be a series of classes in the morning and
afternoon. The morning classes will introduce students to the history and foundational teachings of
Zen through the reading and discussion of the Platform Sutra of the Sixth Patriarch. In this way the
morning classes will try to provide a critical context to help students place their experience in a histori-
cal, cultural, and ideological
perspective. The afternoon classes, taught by monastery staff, will introduce students to the basic ele-
ments of monastic practice (meditation, liturgy, work, interaction with teachers) as well as offer a
"Zen" perspective on the text read in the morning class.
Founded over twenty years ago, the Zen Mountain Monastery is one of the most stable and successful
Zen monastic communities in North America. It is distinguished by its highly articulated vision of Zen
practice (as detailed in The Eight Gates of Zen) and its many-faceted instructional program in the arts,
academic study, environment, etc. (see www.mro.org/). At the end of the week, students will also have
an opportunity to visit the neighboring Tibetan Buddhist Monastery, Karma Triyana Dharmacakra
(www.kagyu.org/), in Woodstock, NY, which should offer an interesting point of contrast in style.
Required Texts: Philip Yampolsky, trans., The Platform Sutra of the Sixth Patriarch Daido John Loori,
The Eight Gates of Zen: Spiritual Training in an American Zen Monastery Robert Buswell, The Zen
Monastic Experience . This course will involve lectures, discussions, demonstrations and individual
participation.
Schedule: Two classes will meet at Williams College in the week prior to the departure that will in-
volve introductory lectures on the history and study of Zen and will serve as an orientation. There will
also be two class meetings at Williams during the week following the return from New York.
Requirements: students will keep a daily journal and will be required to write a 7-8 page critical reflec-
tion on their experience (to be turned in at last class meeting). Enrollment limit: 10-12 students
Cost to student: approximately $400 to cover all expenses for their stay at Zen Mountain Monastery
(lodging, meals, and instruction). I would ask that Williams cover the cost of providing transportation
to and from Mt. Tremper in New York.

REL 012 The Spirit and Practice of Yoga: Coming into Alignment
This class provides an orientation to yoga and builds a foundation for an effective and rewarding per-
sonal yoga practice. Each class begins with centering and discussion of selected readings on Pa-
tanjali's Yoga Sutras,providing a historical, cultural, and philosophical background for yoga. The sec-
ond part of each class is an extended yoga practicum where students will learn and refine yoga poses
including standing poses, vinyasa (flow), inversions, abdominals, hip-openers, backbends, twists,
forward bends, and restoratives. In this way the class develops lung capacity and builds strength, flex-
ibility, and awareness. Students receive individualized attention on how to work with principles of
alignment in their particular bodies, express poses with balanced energy, and embody heart qualities.

REL 025 Explorations in Solidarity: A Meeting of Minds and Hearts in Rural and Urban
Nicaragua
This course will explore the lived realities of the hemisphere's second most impoverished nation, and
the relevance of faith and religious community to the struggle for social justice. Students will reflect
on these realities and struggles in the company of subsistence farmers, urban factory workers, and
those working for progressive social change. The effects of an increasingly globalized economy, a
series of natural disasters (most notably hurricane Mitch), and the changeable attentions of the devel-
oped world will be explored through conversations with ordinary people, using some of the methods
of popular education and oral history. Significant attention will also be given to the efficacy of libera-
tion theology and the base Christian community movement, as well as other influences, Christian,
Marxist and neo-Liberal - on the material and spiritual well-being of Nicaraguan people. The experi-
ence of the course will include approximately one week of living (with minimal amenities) in a subsis-
tence farming community; students will also attend a number of Christian religious services. (The
course is open to students of any religious background or no affiliation.) Travels and encounters in
Nicaragua will be facilitated by Elena Hendrick and Luis Aguirre of the Asociacion Kairos para la
Formacion, an organization that links Christian communities north and south through solidarity to-
ward the goal of transformed relationships. Throughout, students will be invited to enter as deeply as
possible the story of Nicaraguans, and to reflect on their own stories as North Americans and the
sometimes-volatile interaction between these stories. The goal is to begin to reflect on the relevance of
religious community to the possibilities for restorative justice, and to discover what it would mean to
shape a relationship with the people of Nicaragua according to a paradigm of solidarity - contrasted
with the more familiar paradigms of national self-interest, on the macro level, and charity on the micro
level.
Requirements: daily reflection sessions-for which a journal will be kept, attendance at three orienta-
tion sessions, approximately 250 pages of reading on Nicaraguan history and current political and
economic situation prior to departure, participation in a group oral presentation to the college commu-
nity upon return to Williamstown, and a final 10-page paper.
Prerequisites: conversational knowledge of Spanish, though not required, will be helpful. Willingness
to live in physically demanding situations is essential. Enrollment limit: 14 (expected: 8).
Cost to student: $1,800 (including all food, lodging, round-trip airfare from Miami, and in-country
transportation). Students are individually responsible for the cost of travel to and from Miami at the
beginning and at the conclusion of the program.

RLFR 010 Asterix the Gaul: French Culture through the Prism of the Comic
The longevity and popularity of the Asterix comic strip series over successive generations of French
(and foreign) readers can be explained, in part, by its subtle and incisive rendering of Europeanism
through caricature. This course will examine some of the most enduring texts in the Asterix saga as
interpretations, first, of French culture and the way the French view themselves with respect to the rest
of Europe and, second, of the way they view Europe in dialogue with French cultural norms. Such
issues as "la patrie" (homeland), linguistic characteristics, the idea of France, French provincial dis-
tinctiveness, France's view of homogeneous national character seen through its own cultural diversi-
ty, and the relationship of France to other specific regional cultures will be studied as a way not only of
defining the nation's historic legacy, but of coming to terms with the way it sees its place within the
vision of the European Union. Among the texts to be studied will be Asterix the Gaul, Asterix and the
Banquet, Asterix and the Normans, Asterix in Corsica , Asterix in Britain, Asterix and the Goths, As-
terix in Belgium, Asterix in Switzerland. Analysis of the primary texts will be complemented by sec-
ondary cultural readings by prominent interpreters in French culture. Readings will be in English, but
those students who wish to read the texts in the original French should make arrangements in advance
with the instructor. Conducted in English.
Requirements: class participation and a 10-page paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 10.

RLSP 011 Jungle Fever: The Amazon in Literature and Film (Same as Comparative
Literature 014, English 034 and Environmental Studies 022)
Lost Eden? Green Hell? Imperiled eco-system? Cultural discourse on the Amazon jungle ranges from
one extreme to the other, but it is almost always impassioned and imaginative. This course will ex-
amine modern mythologies of the Amazon in literature and film from Latin America, Europe and the
US. We will explore representations of the Amazon in three major categories--tales of colonial ad-
venture, the Spanish American "romance of the jungle" and contemporary environmental dis-
course--considering their differences and often surprising similarities. Guided by readings from eco-
critics including Lawrence Buell and Candace Slater, we will probe the difficult relationship between
representation and reality: why is it, for instance, that some of the most widely-held beliefs about
Amazonia sharply diverge from the reality of the region? And perhaps more importantly, how do the
words and images we use to describe the Amazon influence policy decisions that directly affect the
people who live there?
Readings may include the work of Joseph Conrad, Horacio Quiroga, Alejo Carpentier, Mario Vargas
Llosa, and Clarice Lispector. Films will include: The Naked Jungle, Aguirre, the Wrath of God; At
Play in the Fields of the Lord, and The Golden Serpent. Conducted in English.
Requirements: active class participation and attendance, and a 10-page paper.

Mexico during the last two decades, by prominent contemporary Mexican women film-makers such
as María Novaro, Maryse Sistach, Alejandra Moya, Sabina Berman, Busi Cortes, Dana Rotberg, Gui-
ta Schyfer, Ma. Del Carmen Lara and others. This class will focus on how these women directors re-
conceptualize women's roles in Mexican society, propose multidimensional feminine characters, and
articulate a new female/national identity. The widely varying accepted gender roles between cultures
will be explored, and differences uncovered as to why this difference in expectations exists across the
border between Mexico and the United States.
This class will be taught in Spanish. The theoretical and background reading will be provided both in
English and Spanish, however most of the films to be screened are in Spanish. Students must prove

THEATRE
THEA 010 Giant Puppet Fauvel
In this course we will create a giant puppet play based on a medieval source, the Roman de Fauvel.
Derived from a 1310 manuscript by Gerard de Bus, the Roman de Fauvel was one of history's first
"multimedia" productions, combining colorful artwork, poetry and abstract musical works into one
carefully produced book. Fauvel is a strongly satirical work, and one of the artistic monuments of the
late Middle Ages. The goal of this course is to transpose some of the varied and fascinating elements
of the Fauvel illuminated manuscript into an original multimedia work involving music, spoken
words, and large scale puppets, which we will present at the end of Winter Study Period.
Students may be involved in any or all aspects of the production: making puppets, masks, costumes,
and props, painting backdrops, transposing and performing music, acting, lighting, and advertising.
Evaluation will be based on class participation and attendance.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20. Adventurous musicians, actors, and artists are especially en-
couraged to enroll.
Meeting time: afternoons; Mondays and Wednesdays--but more frequently as the performance ap-
proaches.

SPECIALS
SPEC 010 Quest for College: Early Awareness in Berkshire County Schools
Today's extremely competitive higher education market places significant pressure on students na-
tionwide to start planning for college at an increasingly early age while simultaneously demanding
ever-higher standards of excellence for admission to top schools. "Early Awareness" initiatives aim to
educate middle school students as to what lies ahead on the college horizon, empowering them to
make sound academic and extracurricular choices that will keep open a maximum of options. The first
week of this course will be spent in the classroom, exploring and discussing problems and issues ger-
mane to the national trends towards greater (and earlier) college-related pressures. Students will re-
spond to a series of readings dealing with such issues as tracking, paid test preparation and untimed
testing, early decision, parental and peer pressures, special interests, misrepresentation of informa-
tion, independent counseling, and others. Class time will also be devoted to familiarizing students
with both the nuances of the college admission process and the administration of the early awareness
game, Quest for College. Students will spend the next two weeks visiting 10-12 Berkshire County
middle schools, administering the game and inviting students to the culminating College Day. All 8
students will then work together to plan and run College Day activities for students and their parents.
This day will include a) campus tours, b) general higher education info sessions, and c) financial aid/
scholarship info for the parents. If student and community interest is sufficient, the course may culmi-
nate in a public presentation and open forum early second semester.
Evaluation will be based on completion of field work (school visits), organization and execution of
project to bring local middle school students to the Williams Campus for a day of early-awareness
related activities and a final paper (approximately 10 pages) reflecting on a course-related issue of the
student's choosing.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 8. Preference given to a) students with prior education/admission
experience, b) students with access to transportation c) juniors and seniors. Interested students must
consult with instructors prior to registration.Students will be selected according to the following crite-
ria: a) experience in teaching or admission, b) access to transportation, and c) seniority. Provision
will be stated that interested students must consult the instructors before registration, that instructors
may determine depth of experience and focus of interest.

SPEC 013 The Second Amendment: Liberty and Gun Control (Same as Legal Studies 013)
To some, the Second Amendment is an embarrassing anachronism that stands in the way of common
sense gun regulation. To others, it is our most fundamental right, the backbone of American constitu-
tional liberties. Yet despite the importance of these issues it is difficult to find any civil liberties issue
on which people are more poorly informed. The first part of this course will be an examination of the
history, meaning, intent, and judicial interpretation of the Second Amendment. Does the Second
Amendment mean that gun ownership by individual citizens cannot be restricted? Or does it mean
that only agents of the state, such as National Guards, have a right to bear arms? To address these
questions we will read and discuss original documents pertaining to the framing of the Constitution,
US Supreme Court rulings, and historical analyses of these texts. In the second part of the course we
will focus on current gun control issues. Does gun ownership increase violence, decrease crime, or
both? What sorts of gun regulations are effective, and which, if any, overstep the bounds of the Second
Amendment? Rather than approach these questions from uninformed intuition, as is typically done,
we will focus on trying to understand the implications of the historical texts and the empirical data
bearing on these issues.
Requirements: class attendance and participation, and a 10-page position paper.

Images help us to imagine the past and preserve our collective history. A significant amount of the
cultural history of Williamstown and Williams College lies hidden, and often deteriorating in shoe
boxes and closets of members of our community. As a culmination of the 250th year anniversary of
the Town of Williamstown, residents will be given an opportunity to bring in pre-1975 images to be
scanned for incorporation into a digital database. The owner of the image will provide data along with
an audio caption for inclusion in the database. Once complete, the image database will reside in the
Williamstown House of Local History and the Williams College Archives.Students participating in
the course will learn how to use Photoshop software to digitally restore the images. At the end of the
course we will print many of the images and install a community-wide exhibition. We will also pro-
duce a catalog for the exhibit. The exhibition will cover historical topics such as schools, churches,
farms, mills, commerce, families, and neighborhoods, and will take place at a variety of venues on
campus and around Williamstown.
Evaluation will be based on participation in the collection, restoration, interpretation of the images,
and production of the catalog. Exhibition of coursework is mandatory.

A student is assigned to a local physician, dentist, or veterinarian to observe closely his or her practice in the
office and/or at the North Adams Regional Hospital, Berkshire Medical Center (Pittsfield, MA), or South-
western Vermont Medical Center (Bennington, VT). It is expected that a student will spend the better part
of the day, five days a week, with the physician or a period mutually agreed upon by the student and the
physician as being educationally significant. The program has proven to be extremely successful in giving
interested students a clear picture of the practice of medicine in a non-urban area. An effort is made to ex-
pose the student to a range of medical specialties.
A 10-page report written on some aspect of the month's experience is required.
Prerequisites: interested students must attend a mandatory information meeting in early October, prior to
applying for this course. Enrollment limit: 44. Preference is given to juniors, and then sophomores, whose
course work has been suggestive of a firm commitment to preparation for medical school.
Cost to student: none, except for local transportation and vaccinations.

SPEC 024 Eye Care and Culture in Caribbean Nicaragua
Following up on the very successful Winter Study trip to the South Atlantic coast of Nicaragua in January
2003, where approximately 2000 people were fitted with distance and reading glasses, the trip this January
will visit the North Atlantic coast to again deliver eye care to the indigenous population of the region.
The community of Puerto Cabezas is in the principal population area of the indigenous Misquito people.
The communities around Puerto Cabezas have a population of over 50,000.
After a background study of health care policy and "hands-on" training in eye care by Dr. Bruce Moore,
Professor of the New England College of Optometry (NECO), the group will travel to Puerto Cabezas and
surrounding communities.
Students will assist in the conducting of eye care clinics under the guidance of NECO optometrists and the
international organization Volunteer Optometric Services to Humanity (VOSH).
The schedule will include an introduction to health care policy by Dr. Melvin Krant. An introduction to the
culture and realities of the Northern Caribbean Coast will be led by Dr. Robert Peck and Lynn Hood, co-

SPEC 035 Making Pottery on the Potter's Wheel
Each class will begin with a lecture-demonstration, followed by practice on the potter's wheel. Each
student will have the use of a potter's wheel for each class. We will work on mugs, bowls, pitchers,
plates, jars, lids, vases, and bottles, and will finish these shapes as required by trimming and adding
handles, lugs, lids, spouts, and knobs. We will also work on several different handbuilding projects.
After the tenth class session, all class work will be biscuit-fired. The eleventh class will be devoted to
glazing the biscuited pieces. Glazing techniques will include pouring, dipping, layering, brushing,
and stamping, and using wax resist and other masking techniques to develop pattern and design. The
completed work will then be glaze-fired. The last meeting will be devoted to a "final exam" gallery
show of your best work. Woven into lecture-demonstrations will be presentations on various topics
relating to the science and history of pottery making.
Requirements: attendance at all class sessions and enthusiasm for learning the craft of pottery making.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 9.

SPEC 037 To Face Suffering
I have been increasingly gnawing on an uncomfortable feeling. It began a decade ago with my work to
train medical students to recognize the therapeutic elements of the patient-physician relationship, contin-
ued in the painful months following the 9/11 attacks and has persisted through all the build-up and conduct
of the war in Iraq. The feeling? We don't know how to suffer. We know how to avoid suffering. And, many
Winter Study Program
­ 390 ­
people have learned to survive suffering. But I would suggest that if you don't know how to suffer, your
ability to help those who are suffering is limited. For those whose job is to face suffering day after day - the
physician, the activist, the war journalist, the minister, the social worker, the daughter of a dying parent - the
most common responses include forms of detachment, distortion, or immediate efforts to problem-solve,
few of them effective. How can we change this?My experience as a Zen priest is that the capacity to face
suffering is a physical ability. It can be built through hard physical training that focuses on the breath and
posture, and that takes long years of effort. In a month we can only begin that work but we can also begin
looking at other traditions of training as well.
The format for this course is two-fold: one part built on physical training and the other part is based on
reading, story-telling and reflection. Daily practice of at least 3 hours of physical training is required and it
can be satisfied in a number of ways. Those interested are invited to join morning practice in Zen medita-
tion and training in the Jikishin-kage ryu of swordsmanship. But students may be already involved in other
strenuous physical training such as dance or swimming and those can be proposed as alternative means to
satisfy this element of the course. The discussion element of the course will be conducted 3 afternoons each
week, meeting 2 hours each time. Readings will be drawn from a variety of sources, including literature,
medical case studies, personal accounts, and non-fiction accounts of people facing suffering.
Evaluation will be based on active participation in the seminars and will culminate in a 10-12 page paper
analyzing one of our readings for the lessons it offers on how to train people to face suffering.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 12. Preference given based a one-page statement that describes your
reasons to take this course and proposes the physical training you would like to pursue for the month.
Cost to student: $80 for required texts--for those training in Zen and sword, equipment will cost approxi-
mately $280.

SPEC 038 Giving It Away: How We Help Others
Old-fashioned charity used to provide support for "the less fortunate among us." Today, sharing our
good fortune with others is a far more complicated matter. There are mixed motives, from guilt to
taxes to prestige. There are new organizations, with some 800,000 501(c) 3 organizations seeking
funds for health and human services, education, and the arts. There are new standards of accountabil-
ity, measuring outcomes and change rather than the mere volume of money or clients. So-called ven-
ture philanthropy focuses resources on specific results, with active direction from those who are foot-
ing the bill. Foundations have moved from long-term support to short-term projects, and traditional
charities look more and more to government support, with consequences for all concerned, even as
they continue mass appeals for public support. From the moment a Williams graduate begins to get a
paycheck, an overwhelming number of interests will be asking for part of it, and for time and service
as well. This course will consider the economics, history, philosophy and sociology of how we give it
away, with guest speakers from today's changing and challenged non-profit world.
Evaluation on class participation and ten-page paper. Enrollment limited to 20. Preference given to se-
niors and descending.
Meeting time: four mornings per week.
Cost to students: approximately $50 for texts.

SPEC 039 "Composing A Life:" Finding Success and Balance in Life After Williams
To be at Williams you have learned to be a successful student, but how do you learn to be successful in
life? How will you define success in both your career and in your personal life? How will you resolve
the inevitable tradeoffs and achieve balance between the two? In short, what will constitute the "good
life" for you? We borrow the concept of "composing a life," from a book by Mary Catherine Bateson,
as a very apt metaphor for the ongoing process of defining success and balance in life. This course is
designed: (1)To offer college students, on the threshold of entering adulthood, an opportunity to ex-
amine and define their beliefs, values, and assumptions about their future personal and professional
lives, and to consider how they might achieve a successful balance; (2) To encourage students to gain
a better understanding of how culture, ideology, and opportunity affect their life choices; 3) To pro-
vide an opportunity for students to consider different models of success and balance through an em-
phasis on case studies and "living cases" (in the form of guests from various professions who have
made different life choices); and (4) To aid students in contemplating their career options through in-
dividual advising and introducing various career and life planning resources. Through the use of se-
lected readings, cases, guest speakers and field interviews, we will explore both the public context of
Winter Study Program
­ 391 ­
the workplace as well as the private context of individuals and their personal relationships in deter-
mining life choices.
Evaluation will be based on regular attendance, class participation, field interview, and a 10-page final
paper
No prerequisites. Questions about the course: please contact Michele Moeller Chandler at 458-8106.
Enrollment limit: 15.
Meeting time: mornings.
