HISTORY OF THE COLLEGE
The chartering of Williams College in 1793 was an act of faith and certainly an act surpassing the
modest intentions of Colonel Ephraim Williams, for whom the college is named.
Colonel Williams had not intended to found a college. Enroute with his regiment of Massachu-
setts militia to join the battle with the French and Indians at Lake George, the Colonel had tarried
long enough in Albany to write his last will and testament on July 22, 1755. In it he bequeathed his
residuary estate for the founding and support of a free school in West Township, where for some
years he had commanded a detachment of militia at Fort Massachusetts, farthest outpost of the
province. The will stipulated that West Township, then in dispute between Massachusetts and New
York, must fall within Massachusetts and that the name of the township must be changed to Wil-
liamstown, if the free school was to be established at all.
On September 8, 1755, Colonel Williams was killed at the Battle of Lake George. On October 26,
1791, after many delays, fifteen scholars were admitted to the free school in Williamstown. Within a
year the trustees, not content with the original modest design of the founder, were captivated by the
idea of creating a college where, as they put it, "young gentlemen from every part of the Union" might
resort for instruction " in all the branches of useful and polite literature." The proposal was extremely
ambitious, to be sure, but ambition was a common American ailment. England did not develop a third
university until the nineteenth century; Williams was the twenty-first institution of higher learning to
flower in onetime British colonies, the second in Massachusetts, the sixth in New England. On June
22, 1793, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts granted a charter to Williams College.
I
The bold decision to plant a college in the wilderness betrayed the intentions of Colonel Wil-
liams; yet the new vision had been fed by the same sort of dreams that had led Ephraim Williams to
see a school and a comfortable community where only a military outpost had stood. The early trust-
ees and the legislature of the Commonwealth were to be remembered for their foresight, but in the
decades after 1793 they had reason to acknowledge that the soil they had chosen was stubbornly
uncongenial--so uncongenial, in fact, that for many years the trustees of Williams spent more time
and energy in trying to close the College than in trying to keep it open.
In 1819 they petitioned to move the college to Northhampton, and in 1821, having been spurned by
the legislature, President Zephaniah Swift Moore took matters into his own hands. Convinced that
almost everything about Williams was impossible--its location, its funds, its enrollment--he led a
group of students over the mountains into the Connecticut Valley. There he became their president
once again, at the struggling new college known as Amherst. As for Williams, one member of the
senior class wrote home to his father: "It remains for us to say whether it shall die suddenly, or whether
it shall linger along for two or three years."
In the past the public had come to the support of the institution. A lottery furnished funds essen-
tial to the opening of the free school. A public subscription was the answer of Berkshire County to
the threat of removal in 1819. What saved the College in 1821 was the willingness of the Reverend
Edward Dorr Griffin to take the job of president and the determination with which he drew upon the
College's reputation for religious conservatism to collect much-needed funds. By 1828, the Rever-
end Griffin could be seen standing in the middle of Main Street, supervising the construction of a
handsome new building, housing a chapel, a library, and classrooms, a testament to his confidence
and his skill. The building is now known as Griffin Hall.
The College which had been taking shape under Griffin and his predecessors was not unlike
many other New England colleges where the classical curriculum and a moral atmosphere served as
the basis for training young men for professional life. The college turned out its share of clergymen,
doctors, lawyers, and teachers, serving the needs of Western Massachusetts and surrounding com-
munities in New York and Vermont. But Williams was not yet a place to which "young gentlemen
from every part of the Union" resorted. In fact, Nathaniel Hawthorne, attending the commencement
exercises in 1838, jotted in his notebook some observations on the Williams students he saw there:
"Country graduates--rough, brown-featured, schoolmaster-looking...A rough hewn, heavy set of
fellows from the hills and woods in this neighborhood; unpolished bumpkins, who had grown up as
farmer-boys."
History of the College
­ 4 ­
Williams seldom knew financial security until the end of the nineteenth century. But it did have
assets that enabled it to develop into a prototype of the small New England liberal arts college. Scen-
ery, a reputation for moral soundness, a loyal body of alumni, and a devoted faculty went a long way
toward compensating for inadequate funds.
Of the scenery, Thoreau remarked, after a visit in 1844, "It would be no small advantage if every
college were thus located at the base of a mountain." For Thoreau the location of Williams was "as
good at least as one well-endowed professorship."
In the early years the religious reputation of the College depended on the essential orthodoxy of
its presidents and faculty. It gathered strength from the famous episode of the "haystack meeting" in
the summer of 1806. Five Williams undergraduates, seeking to continue their prayers and conversa-
tions in spite of a sudden thunderstorm, retired from a grove of trees to the shelter of a nearby hay-
stack, where they were inspired to launch the great adventure of American foreign missions. The
extremely informal ties with the Congregationalists saved it from the sometimes stifling strangle-
hold of an organic denominational connection.
During a crisis in the affairs of the College in 1821, a group of alumni met in Williamstown and
organized the Society of Alumni, dedicated to the future welfare of the College. Their action gave
Williams the distinction of organizing the first college alumni society in history. Alumni loyalty was
rewarded when, in 1868, the College provided for official alumni representation on the board of trust-
ees, an act of recognition in which only Harvard, among American colleges, anticipated Williams.
II
But essentially the College has built its reputation around teachers and teaching. Mark Hopkins,
who was a Williams professor from 1830 to 1887 and president of the College from 1836 to 1872, has
become a symbol of this emphasis. In American education Hopkins pioneered in making the student
the center of the educational experience, and he did it so well that one of his former students, U.S.
President James A. Garfield, immortalized his achievement in an aphorism which has passed into the
lore of American education: "The ideal college is Mark Hopkins on one end of a log and a student on
the other." The Hopkins tradition has become one of the College's great assets. It has been perpetuated
in the lives of generations of teachers.
Scenery, a reputation for building sound character, loyal but not especially affluent alumni, and
devoted teachers could keep the College open, but like most other colleges Williams did not experi-
ence growth and prosperity until the closing decades of the nineteenth century. The scenery, of
course, remained constant, but it developed into an even greater asset as the United States became
more urbanized and industrialized. Williams was still a country college; a Massachusetts court de-
cision of 1888 declared that cows owned by the college were tax exempt. The discovery that busi-
nessmen could profit from liberal education sent college enrollments upward as the century drew to
a close; now more Williams alumni were men of affairs, fewer were clergymen. By 1906, of all the
colleges in New England, Williams drew the largest percentage of students from outside New Eng-
land.
From 1793 through 1870 the Commonwealth of Massachusetts appropriated for Williams College
over $150,000, a sum of such importance that Mark Hopkins himself observed that he did "not see
how the College could have got on" without state aid. A new and more dependable source of financial
support was developed as the century drew to a close. In the 1890's Frederick Ferris Thompson of the
Class of 1856 became the first of many individuals to supersede the Commonwealth as the largest
benefactor of the College. Ephraim Williams' original bequest of $9,297 has since grown by addition-
al gifts and bequests to an endowment valued at approximately $1.3 billion.
III
Williams moved into the twentieth century firm in its intentions to remain a college, at a time when
aspirations toward university status were unsettling many of the old colleges. It adhered to a curricu-
lum that was designed for undergraduates; it made room for the elective principle, but it subjected
course election to safeguards and controls. The idea of a liberally educated man was not jettisoned in
favor of the widely accepted idea of almost complete student freedom in course election. A survey of
the college curriculum in 1925 showed that Williams had combined the principles of prescription and
election, the goals of concentration and distribution, in such a way as to be the only major American
college without any absolutely required courses and without any uncontrolled wide-option electives.
History of the College
­ 5 ­
The Williams curriculum has continued to evolve, but it has not undergone such a series of major
overhauls as characterize curriculums inspired by the popular educational fancy of the moment. Not
having abandoned itself to the elective principle in the nineteenth century, Williams did not need to
rescue itself with the general education principle of the twentieth century.
During its long history much of the life and tone of the college was shaped by students. While the
same influence continues, the competitive pressure for admission since World War II has allowed
for a new and significant degree of selectivity on the part of the College. Among the consequences
of this change have been a quickening of the intellectual life of the College and a reconsideration of
traditions and emphases no longer considered appropriate for an institution of liberal learning.
Among the first traditions to go was compulsory religious exercises, abandoned in 1962 after a
hundred years of gradual but steady erosion. Voluntary worship in the form of ecumenical chapel
services and the activities of student religious organizations carry on another long tradition. In re-
sponse to the concern of undergraduate leaders and the faculty and in recognition of the failure of
Greek Letter Fraternities to fulfill adequately objectives consistent with college purpose, the Trust-
ees in 1962 took the first of a series of actions that replaced fraternities with a residential house sys-
tem. Williams became, as a result, a much more open community. The decision to become coeduca-
tional and the admission of women to Williams as degree candidates in 1970 have reinforced the
spirit of equality and freedom conducive to a climate of learning.
In this atmosphere of change and heightened purpose the curriculum underwent appropriate
transformations, as a careful comparative study of the yearly catalogues readily shows, leading to
the present 4-1-4 curriculum and a more flexible and wide-ranging schedule and program both on
and beyond the campus. Changes in the curriculum included the addition of majors and the
introduction of interdisciplinary programs, along with the expansion of language offerings to in-
clude full, four-year cycles in Chinese and Japanese. Continuing the tradition of putting the student
at the center of the educational experience, Williams in the Fall of 1988 introduced in each depart-
ment at least one course taught as a tutorial, in which, typically, pairs of students meet weekly with
the professor to discuss a paper, problem set, or work of art produced by one of the students. By
1992 some 40 percent of the graduating class had experienced at least one tutorial course either in
Williamstown or in the Williams-Oxford program, run in association with Exeter College, Oxford,
which provides each year for some 30 Williams juniors a year-long immersion in the life of Oxford
University.
This curricular expansion reflected, and in part resulted from, the fact that the makeup of the col-
lege community was changing to mirror more closely the growing racial, ethnic, and religious di-
versity of American society. The percentage of Williams students who identified themselves as
members of one or more American minority group rose to 25 percent; of faculty almost 13 percent.
At the beginning of this decade, President Morton Owen Schapiro inaugurated a strategic plan-
ning process, through which the College community identified priorities for change in the curricu-
lum and in residential life. The size of the faculty is being expanded to provide more curricular op-
portunities for students in tutorials and experiential learning. Requirements have been added in in-
tensive writing instruction and in quantitative and formal reasoning. New programming and struc-
tures are being added to student residential life and major projects have been undertaken to greatly
enhance the College's student center, its facilities for theatre and dance, and its office and teaching
spaces for faculty.

MISSION AND PURPOSES
Williams seeks to provide the finest possible liberal arts education by nurturing in students the aca-
demic and civic virtues, and their related traits of character. Academic virtues include the capacities to
explore widely and deeply, think critically, reason empirically, express clearly, and connect ideas cre-
atively. Civic virtues include commitment to engage both the broad public realm and community life,
and the skills to do so effectively. These virtues, in turn, have associated traits of character. For exam-
ple, free inquiry requires open-mindedness, and commitment to community draws on concern for
others.
We are committed to our central endeavor of academic excellence in a community of learning that
comprises students, faculty, and staff, and draws on the engagement of alumni and parents. We recruit
students from among the most able in the country and abroad and select them for the academic and
personal attributes they can contribute to the educational enterprise, inside and outside the classroom.
Our faculty is a highly talented group of teachers, scholars, and artists committed deeply to the educa-
tion of our students and to involving them in their efforts to expand human knowledge and under-
standing through original research, thought, and artistic expression. Dedicated staff enable this teach-
ing and learning to take place at the highest possible level, as does the involvement and support of our
extraordinarily loyal parents and alumni.
No one can pretend to more than guess at what students now entering college will be called upon to
comprehend in the decades ahead. No training in fixed techniques, no finite knowledge now at hand,
no rigid formula can solve problems whose shape we cannot yet define. The most versatile, the most
durable, in an ultimate sense, the most practical knowledge and intellectual resources that we can offer
students are the openness, creativity, flexibility, and power of education in the liberal arts.
Toward that end we extend a curriculum that offers wide opportunities for learning, ensures close
attention of faculty to students but also encourages students to learn independently, and reflects the
complexity and diversity of the world. We seek to do this in an atmosphere that nurtures the simple joy
of learning as a lifelong habit and commitment.
We place great emphasis on the learning that takes place in the creation of a functioning communi-
ty: life in the residence halls, expression through the arts, debates on political issues, leadership in
campus governance, exploration of personal identity, pursuit of spiritual and religious impulses, the
challenge of athletics, and direct engagement with human needs, nearby and far away.
To serve well our students and the world, Williams embraces core values such as welcoming and
supporting in the College community people from all segments of our increasingly diverse society
and ensuring that College operations are environmentally sustainable.
From this holistic immersion students learn more than they will ever know. Such is the testimony of
countless graduates--that their Williams experience has equipped them to live fuller, more effective
lives. Ultimately, the College's greatest mark on the world consists of this: the contributions our
alumni make in their professions, their communities, and their personal lives.
Therefore, we ask all our students to understand that an education at Williams should not be re-
garded as a privilege destined to create further privilege, but as a privilege that creates opportunities to
serve society at large, and imposes the responsibility to do so.
At the same time, being itself privileged by its history and circumstances, Williams understands
its own responsibility to contribute by thought and example to the world of higher education.
The above description arises on its surface from public statements made by Williams presidents and
others associated with the College, from which it borrows, and at a deeper level from the felt experi-
ence of students, faculty, staff, alumni, and parents over many decades. It was approved by vote of
the Board of Trustees on April 14, 2007.

THE CURRICULUM
Williams College offers a course of study leading to the degree of Bachelor of Arts. The course
requirements prescribe both the number of courses to be completed and the minimum grade level to
be achieved; the curriculum also requires that each student explore several fields of knowledge and
concentrate in one. The full requirements for the degree include meeting the minimum academic stan-
dards stated below, residing at the College, fulfilling the distribution requirement, completing a major,
and completing the physical education requirement.
The academic year is divided into two regular semesters and a Winter Study Program. The student takes
four courses in each semester and during January pursues a single program of study on a pass-fail basis.
The Winter Study Program, which began in 1967, is intended to provide students and faculty with a
dramatically different educational experience in the January term. The differences are in the nature of
the courses, the nature of the learning experience, and the change of educational pace and format from
the fall and spring semesters. These differences apply to the faculty and students in several ways: fac-
ulty can try out courses with new subjects and techniques that might, if successful, be used later in the
regular terms; they can explore subjects not amenable to inclusion in regular courses; and they can
investigate fields outside their usual areas of expertise. In their academic work, which is graded Hon-
ors, Pass, Perfunctory Pass, or Fail, students can explore new fields at low risk, concentrate on one
subject that requires a great deal of time, develop individual research projects, or work in a different
milieu (as interns, for example, or on trips outside Williamstown). In addition, Winter Study offers
studentsanopportunityformoreindependenceandinitiativeinalessformalsetting, more opportunity
to participate in cultural events, and an occasion to get to know one another better.
REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR OF ARTS DEGREE
Academic Requirement
To be eligible for the Bachelor of Arts degree a student must pass 32 regularly graded semester courses
and receive grades of C minus or higher in at least 19 of those semester courses, pass four Winter Study
Projects, fulfill the four-part distribution requirement, complete all requirements for the major including
an average of C minus or higher, and complete the physical education requirement. A student may not
repeat a course for which degree credit has been awarded.
Distribution Requirement
The distribution requirement falls into four parts. Please note that courses used to fulfill these requirements
must be regularly graded.
1) DIVISIONAL REQUIREMENT--designed to ensure that in their course of study at Williams, stu-
dents take an appropriately diverse distribution of courses across the full range of the curriculum.
For the purposes of the requirement, courses are grouped into three divisions: Division I, Languages and
the Arts; Division II, Social Studies; and Division III, Science and Mathematics. A full listing of the
subjects in each division appears below.
Students must complete at least three graded semester courses in each division. Two in each division
must be completed by the end of the sophomore year. No more than two of the courses used to satisfy the
requirement may have the same course prefix. The courses must be taken at Williams or at programs
under the direction of Williams College Faculty.
Courses that fulfill the distribution requirement in Division I are designed to help students become bet-
ter able to respond to the arts sensitively and intelligently by learning the language, whether verbal, visu-
al, or musical, of a significant field of artistic expression. Students learn how to develop the capacity for
critical discussion, to increase awareness of the esthetic and moral issues raised by works of art, and to
grow in self-awareness and creativity.
Courses which fulfill the Division II requirement consider the institutions and social structures that hu-
man beings have created, whether knowingly or unknowingly, and which in turn markedly affect their
lives. These courses are intended to help the students recognize, analyze, and evaluate these human
structures in order that they may better understand themselves and the social world in which they live.
Courses which fulfill the Division III requirement are intended to provide some of the factual and meth-
odological knowledge needed to be an informed citizen in a world deeply influenced by scientific
thought and technological accomplishment, and to cultivate skill in exact and quantitative reasoning.

Please note: Any Environmental Studies course that is also cross-listed with another subject carries dis-
tribution credit of that subject. Other Environmental Studies courses may fulfill distribution requirements
as indicated under individual course listings.
Williams-Exeter Programme at Oxford University tutorial courses (WIOX) may be used toward fulfilling
the divisional distribution requirement; a student may earn a maximum of three distribution requirements,
with no more than one from each division, for the year. Courses at Williams-Mystic Program and Williams
in New York may also be used toward fulfilling the requirement.
2) PEOPLES AND CULTURES REQUIREMENT--intended to help students to begin to understand
the cultural diversity of American society and the world at large, so that, as citizens of an increasingly
interconnected world, they may become better able to respond sensitively and intelligently to peoples of
varied social backgrounds and cultural frameworks. Courses which fulfill this requirement are thus de-
signed to familiarize students with some dimension of American cultural diversity or that of the non-
Western world. Each student must complete one graded semester course primarily concerned with : (a)
the peoples and cultures of North America that trace their origins to Africa, Asia, Latin America, Ocea-
nia, or the Caribbean; Native American peoples and cultures; or (b) the peoples and cultures of Africa,
Asia, Latin America, Oceania, or the Caribbean. Students are urged to complete this course, which may
also be used to fulfill any of the other requirements, by the end of the sophomore year.
An asterisk following a course title indicates that the course may be used to meet the Peoples and Cul-
tures Distribution Requirement. A list of courses offered in 2007-2008 that meet the requirement is on
page 314.
3) QUANTITATIVE/FORMAL REASONING REQUIREMENT--intended to help students become
adept at reasoning mathematically and abstractly. The ability to apply a formal method to reach conclu-
sions, to use numbers comfortably, and to employ the research tools necessary to analyze data lessen
The Curriculum
­ 9 ­
barriers to carrying out professional and economic roles. Prior to their senior year, all students must sat-
isfactorily complete a Quantitative/Formal Reasoning (QFR) course--those marked with a "(Q)." Stu-
dents requiring extra assistance (as assessed during First Days) are normally placed into Mathematics
100/101/102, which is to be taken before fulfilling the QFR requirement.
The hallmarks of a QFR course are the representation of facts in a language of mathematical symbols
and the use of formal rules to obtain a determinate answer. Primary evaluation in these courses is based
on multistep mathematical, statistical, or logical inference (as opposed to descriptive answers). A list of
courses offered in 2007-2008 that meet the requirement is on page 318.
4) WRITING REQUIREMENT--All students are required to take two writing-intensive courses: one by
the end of the sophomore year and one by the end of the junior year. Students will benefit most from
writing-intensive courses by taking them early in their college careers and are therefore strongly encour-
aged to complete the requirement by the end of the sophomore year. Courses designated as "writing
intensive"--those marked with a "(W)"--stress the process of learning to write effectively. Such
courses include a substantial amount of writing (a minimum of 20 pages), usually divided into several
discrete assignments. Instructors pay close attention to matters of style and argumentation. Enrollments
are limited to 19. Alist of courses offered in 2007-2008 that meet the requirement is on page322. One of
the W courses may be an independent study that meets the writing intensive criteria.
All Williams-Exeter Programme at Oxford University tutorial courses (WIOX) meet the Williams College
"Writing Intensive" designation, except for those in the studio arts, mathematics, and the sciences.
Major Requirement
The Major Requirement is designed to assure that all Williams undergraduates will have the experience of
disciplined and cumulative study, carried on over an extended period of time, in some important field of intel-
lectual inquiry. Juniors are required to declare a major and the selection is normally made at the time of registra-
tion in the spring of the sophomore year.
Majors are offered in the following fields:
American Studies History
Anthropology Japanese
Art Literary Studies
Asian Studies Mathematics
Astronomy Music
Astrophysics Philosophy
Biology Physics
Chemistry Political Economy
Chinese Political Science
Classics (Greek, Latin) Psychology
Comparative Literature Religion
Computer Science Russian
Economics Sociology
English Spanish
French Theatre
Geosciences Women's and Gender Studies
German
GENERAL STRUCTURE OF MAJORS
1) A student ordinarily must elect at least nine semester courses in his or her major field. A major may
also require an additional course and/or one Winter Study Project during the junior or senior year.
A student may also fulfill the minimum requirements for a major by taking eight semester courses in the
major field and two semester courses, approved by a major advisor, in associated fields. In interdepartmen-
tal majors, such as Political Economy, a larger number of courses may be required.
2) Aprescribed sequence of courses, supplemented by parallel courses, and including a major seminar, is
required in some major fields. Other majors ask the student to plan asequence of elective courses, including
advanced work building on elementary courses in the field, and ending in a one- or two- semester faculty-
organized course or project in the senior year. All majors provide a system of counseling to help students
plan programs reflecting individual interests as well as disciplined and cumulative patterns of inquiry.
Courses in many major programs require prerequisite courses in related areas. A full description of the
detailed structure of each major is found under the heading of that major.
CONTRACT MAJOR
Students who wish to undertake the coherent study of an interdisciplinary subject not covered by a
regularly offered major may propose to be contract majors. Procedures for arranging a contract major
and for honors work in such a major are described in the section, "Courses of Instruction." Students inter-
ested in this option should begin consulting with the Dean's Office and with potential faculty advisors
early in the sophomore year. A student completing a contract major may not do so in conjunction with a
second major. For further details, see page 130.
TWO MAJORS
A student may complete two majors with the permission of both majors and the Committee on Aca-
demic Standing. Although a student may be granted permission to use a course from one major to fulfill a
particular requirement in the other, the student nevertheless must take the minimum number of courses in
The Curriculum
­ 10 ­
each field without counting any course twice. A student may be a candidate for Honors in either or both
of the majors, but a course for Honors in one major may not be used for an Honors course in the other.
Physical Education Requirement
The Physical Education requirement provides students the opportunity of establishing and maintaining a
general level of fitness and well-being; of developing abilities in carry-over activities; of discovering and
extending their own physical capabilities; and of developing skills in activities with survival implications,
such as swimming.
A swim test is required of all first-year students at the start of the academic year. Students who fail to
complete the test must pass a basic swim course given in the Physical Education program during the first
quarter of the year.
Students must complete four quarters of physical education by the end of the sophomore year. Students
must enroll in at least two different activities in fulfilling the requirement.
Participation in a fall or spring intercollegiate sport is equivalent to two activity units and participation
in a winter sport is equivalent to three units. A maximum of three credits may be attained while partici-
pating in intercollegiate sports with the exception of a two sport athlete who can fulfill the physical
education requirement by totaling four units in two sports. Students may receive a maximum of two ac-
tivity units for participation in a club sport; the remaining two units must come from the physical educa-
tion activity program.
Residence Requirement
Students who begin college at Williams must spend a minimum of six semesters in residence at Wil-
liams. Students transferring to Williams from other institutions must spend a minimum of four semesters in
residence at Williams, and those entering as sophomores are expected to spend six semesters in residence.
Students are considered to be in residence if they are taking a program of study under the direction of the
Williams College Faculty. Students must be in residence for both semesters of the final year.
The degree requirements must be completed within eight semesters, including any semesters for which a stu-
dent receives credit while not in residence at Williams. Thus, semesters spent away on exchange or other ap-
proved programs at other colleges are included in the eight semesters.
ADDITIONAL CURRICULAR OPPORTUNITIES
Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate
At the discretion of the appropriate departments or programs, students presenting satisfactory scores
in Advanced Placement tests or International Baccalaureate higher level examinations may be placed in
advanced courses not regularly open to them and/or may receive course credit toward the major or con-
centration. Therefore, if granted, this credit may be used as a prerequisite or in partial fulfillment of the
major or concentration requirements. AP and IB credit, however, may not be used to reduce the normal
course load of any semester, to make up a deficiency incurred at Williams, or to satisfy the Distribution
Requirement.
Certificate in European Languages
Students may pursue a Certificate in four European languages offered at Williams (French, German,
Russian, and Spanish). The program certifies a particular degree of proficiency, cultural literacy, and expe-
rience with the language in the context of one's college education. In order to gain the proficiency and expe-
rience certified by the program, students must have taken a) at least five semesters of college language (or
the equivalent) and b) a standardized proficiency test administered by the departments. In addition, students
are required to gain familiarity with the culture in question by taking at least one course each in a) the litera-
ture, music, art, or philosophy, and b) the history, economics, or politics of the cultural area. Students must
take seven courses altogether, up to two of which may be taken abroad. Please refer to the respective lan-
guage programs for details on the specific certificates.
Combined Program in Liberal Arts and Engineering
The 3-2 program enables qualified students to combine a liberal arts education at Williams with under-
graduate professional training in engineering. In this program, a student studies at Williams for 3 years,
completing 24 courses and 3 Winter Study Projects. He or she then transfers to a leading engineering school
and studies for a Bachelor of Science degree, usually for 2 more years. Upon successful completion of this
program, the student receives a Bachelor of Arts degree from Williams and a Bachelor of Science degree
from the engineering school.
During their 3 years at Williams, 3-2 students must complete all of the normal requirements for a Williams
degree, including a major and the distribution requirements. For students majoring in physics, chemistry, com-
puter science, or mathematics, the requirements for the senior year courses and major exercise are waived for the
Williams degree. Only students who have taken the prerequisite courses, who have at least a B average in scien-
tific subjects, and who have a good record in other subjects will be recommended by their major department and
approved by the Committee on Academic Standing for this program.
The 3-2 program has an extensive list of prerequisite mathematics and science courses, so it is necessary to
plan course selections at Williams carefully. The booklet "Choosing First Year Courses" includes a list of Wil-
liams courses recommended to prospective engineers.
A popular alternative to the 3-2 program is to complete the Williams B.A. in the usual 4 years, majoring
in one of the sciences, and then go directly to a graduate program in engineering. Please see the section of
The Curriculum
­ 11 ­
this catalog titled "Preparation for Graduate and Professional Study." Also, prospective engineers at Wil-
liams have the opportunity to take undergraduate engineering courses at other institutions through various
exchange programs. For information about these opportunities, please see the section titled "Exchange Pro-
grams."
The pre-engineering advisor, Professor Jefferson Strait, will be happy to assist students interested in
any of the options leading to engineering careers. Many more details about pre-engineering can be found
in the Physics Department section of the College website.
Co-ordinate Programs Offering Concentrations
In addition to majoring in a field, a student may choose to concentrate elective courses on a single topic
or area. Normally, a student declares a concentration at the time of registration in the spring of the sopho-
more year. Concentrations are offered in the following programs:
Africana Studies
Biochemistry and Molecular Biology
Cognitive Science
Environmental Studies
International Studies
Jewish Studies
Latina/o Studies
Leadership Studies
Legal Studies
Maritime Studies
Neuroscience
Science and Technology Studies
Descriptions of these programs appear under the appropriate heading in this publication. If the co-or-
dinate program courses are directly related to the major, a student may be allowed to reduce the number
of courses required to complete the major.
Co-ordinate Programs
A number of programs do not formally offer concentrations, but do provide students with the opportuni-
ty to work in areas that cut across departmental and program lines. These are: Bioinformatics, Genomics,
and Proteomics; History of Science; Materials Science Studies; and Performance Studies. They are listed in
this publication in alphabetical order.
These programs provide guidance only and do not appear on transcripts.
The Critical Reasoning and Analytical Skills (CRAAS) Initiative
To one degree or another, every class at Williams goes beyond its subject--be it mathematics, Machia-
velli, or modernism--to teach intellectual skills that have wide application in other fields as well as outside
of the academy: scientific reckoning, expository writing, rhetorical analysis, oral presentation, and so on.
Courses offered under the CRAAS initiative foreground such analytical skills. While each CRAAS class
covers a different topic, all are aimed particularly at developing the processes necessary for excellence in a
range of fields: techniques for analyzing ideas, data, texts or artworks; approaches to interpreting, synthe-
sizing, and developing arguments; strategies for presenting ideas and results.
CRAAS classes typically emphasize the practices of meta-analysis--self-criticism, editing, and revi-
sion--with the goal of constant improvement. Many classes feature peer tutoring, small group work, and
intensive one-on-one engagement with the professor. Students should leave a CRAAS course with a sub-
stantially heightened ability to approach problems, analyze texts, and craft arguments in whatever disci-
pline they may go on to explore.
A few CRAAS courses are restricted to advanced students, but the majority are open to all, and some are
specifically targeted for first -year students. Most have strictly limited enrollment. Because these classes
cultivate the general strategies of effective scholarship, students are encouraged to consider taking a
CRAAS course early in their academic careers.
A list of CRAAS courses offered in 2007-2008 is on page 312.
Cross-Enrollment Programs
A limited number of students may register at Bennington College or Massachusetts College of Liberal
Arts for courses not offered by Williams. Interested students should contact the Registrar's Office about
arrangements.
Experiential Education at Williams
Experiential education, involving "learning by doing" outside the classroom, has been a relatively un-
derstated but successful part of the Williams curriculum for a number of years. In addition to the use of
traditional laboratory work in the natural sciences and studio work in art, faculty have been challenging
students to become engaged more personally in the Williams curriculum through field work, whether in the
form of research, sustained work on special projects or through placement with community organizations.
Courses which include experiential learning provide students with opportunities to encounter firsthand the
issues that they read and study about, requiring them to apply academic learning to nonacademic settings
and challenging them to use their experiences in those settings to think more critically and deeply about
what they are studying. Courses involving experiential education as defined above range from fully inte-
grated off-campus programs such as the Williams-Mystic Maritime Studies Program (page 333) and Wil-
The Curriculum
­ 12 ­
liams in New York (page 334) to courses involving one small field research project. The amount and nature
of the experiential component(s) varies according to the instructor's judgment. See page 312 for a list of
2007-2008 courses involving experiential education.
A range of non-credit experiential education opportunities is also available to interested students.
Community service, internships, research, and the Museum Associates Program of the College Museum
of Art all provide students the chance to "learn by doing" outside the classroom. Information on each of
these opportunities is provided below.
Community Service:
Opportunities to apply creative energy and initiative abound in community organizations in the Wil-
liams College area. Service ranges from tutoring or building homes with Habitat for Humanity, to work-
ing with developing non-profit organizations such as Northern Berkshire Creative Arts. For more infor-
mation, go to the Lehman Community Service Council homepage on the College website at
<http://wso.williams.edu: 8000/orgs/lehman/> or contact Rick Spalding, College Chaplain and Coordi-
nator of Community Service (Richard.E.Spalding@williams.edu).
Internships and Research Opportunities:
A wide variety of summer internship opportunities are available to interested students through the
Office of Career Counseling (OCC) and the Center for Environmental Studies (CES). Research opportu-
nities are also available through individual departments. Information about OCC's Williams College
Alumni Sponsored Summer Internships can be found at http://www.williams.edu/resources/occ/ or by
contacting Ron Gallagher, Assistant Director of Career Counseling (Ronald.L.Gallagher@williams.e-
du). Information about CES's summer internship and research opportunities can be found at www.wil-
liams.edu/CES/resources/summeropps.htm or by contacting Sarah Gardner, Assistant Director of the
Center for Environmental Studies, Kellogg House (Sarah.S.Gardner@williams.edu). Information about
research opportunities sponsored by individual departments is available from Department Chairs.
Museum Associates:
The Museum Associates Program of the Williams College Museum of Art provides students an opportu-
nity to broaden their knowledge of art and art history, to learn about the field of museum education, and to
develop valuable communication and public speaking skills while working with the public. The only aca-
demic requirement is the completion of ArtH 101-102. Applications are accepted every spring. For more
information, contact Rebecca Hayes, Director of Education at Rebecca.L.Hayes@williams.edu.
For more information about experiential education at Williams College, visit the Experiential Educa-
tion website at www.williams.edu/admin/deanfac/exped/ or contact Paula Consolini, Coordinator of
Experiential Education at 597-4588 (pconsoli@williams.edu)
Honors Program
Williams awards the degree with honors to those students who have demonstrated imagination, initia-
tive, and intellectual independence within the major. The Honors Program requires two or three courses
constituting a clearly interrelated pattern of study, whether in the form of a thesis, specialization within the
major, or interdisciplinary study with courses from other programs or departments. At least one of the
courses must be in addition to the minimum number required for the major; one may be a Winter Study
Project. A student who is completing two majors may be a candidate for honors in either or both of the
majors, but a course for honors in one major may not be used as an honors course in the other. Some pro-
grams also award honors for their concentrations.
Individual departments and programs describe special criteria, procedures, and patterns of study for
honors in the "Courses of Instruction" section. Students should consult with their departments on their
honors options prior to the senior year. Before the student has begun the last of the required course units,
the department or program determines whether the student is admitted to honors candidacy. The degree
is awarded with Honors or Highest Honors at the end of the senior year if, in the judgment of the depart-
ment, its criteria of excellence have been met.
Independent Study
When a particularly able student wishes to study a subject not covered by the normal offerings of the
College, arrangements may be made to undertake courses of independent study under faculty supervi-
sion. Such arrangements are made with the appropriate department at the time of registration.
Study Away from Williams
Students may receive credit for work completed at other institutions or programs. Applications for study
elsewhere require the approval of the chair of the student's major, the Dean's Office, and the Committee on
Academic Standing. Students studying away during the junior year should have already completed at least
two courses in each division toward the divisional distribution requirement, the writing and quantitative/
formal reasoning requirements and the physical education requirement. Courses completed while away
may be used toward the major with permission of the department or program and/or to fulfill the peoples
and cultures requirement. All other degree requirements must be met with courses taken under the supervi-
sion of Williams faculty.
Williams participates in study abroad programs in Spain and France (in cooperation with Hamilton
College); in China (as part of the Associated Colleges in China); in Sweden (in cooperation with twelve
other colleges and the University of Stockholm); in Denmark (with the University of Copenhagen Dan-
ish International Studies); and in Kyoto (the Associated Kyoto Program, run by a group of eleven col-
leges). Williams students may also receive credit for approved programs at a wide variety of other insti-
The Curriculum
­ 13 ­
tutions, or for work done directly in a foreign university, if acceptable evaluation is possible, or accred-
ited four-year American university. Students interested in study away should consult the Dean's Office.
Students must submit a pink petition and essay to the Dean's Office by March of the preceding academic
year for which they wish to study off campus. Students must be in good academic standing with no defi-
ciencies and follow the procedures as set out in the Guide to Study Abroad.
The Williams Tutorial Program
The Tutorial Program offers Williams students a distinctive opportunity to take a heightened form of
responsibility for their own intellectual development. No student is required to take a tutorial course, but
any student with the appropriate qualifications and interests is invited to do so.
Tutorials at the 100/200 level are designed primarily for first-year students and sophomores; they are
usually given enrollment preference for such courses, though interested juniors and seniors are often wel-
come. Tutorials at the 300/400 level are designed primarily for juniors and seniors (and, often, for majors in
the discipline); first-year students and sophomores are welcome to apply, but are urged to consult the
instructor before registering.
Tutorials place much greater weight than do regular courses--or even small seminars--on student parti-
cipation. They aim to teach students how to develop and present arguments; listen carefully, and then refine
their positions in the context of a challenging discussion; and respond quickly and cogently to critiques of
their work. Tutorials place particular emphasis on developing analytical skills, writing abilities, and the
talents of engaging in rigorous conversation and oral debate.
The ways in which particular tutorials are conducted vary across the disciplines, but here is a description
of how most tutorials at Williams are organized. Tutorials are usually limited to ten students. At the start of
term, the instructor divides the students into pairs. Each pair meets weekly with the instructor for roughly
one hour. Many tutorial courses begin and end the term with a group seminar, and in a few departments,
instructors hold weekly group meetings of all tutorial members to provide background information de-
signed to facilitate the students' independent work. But the heart of every tutorial course is the weekly
meeting of the two students with the instructor.
At these weekly meetings, one student delivers a prepared essay or presentation (e.g., an analysis of a
text or work of art, a discussion of a problem set, a report on laboratory exercises, etc.) pertaining to the
assignment for that week, while the other student--and then the instructor--offer a critique. In the follow-
ing week, students switch roles. Typically, students write five or six essays (usually in the range of 4-7
pages) during the term, and offer five or six critiques of their partners' work.
Since the program's inception in 1988, students have ranked tutorials among the most demanding--and
rewarding--courses they have taken at Williams. While not designed to be more difficult than other
courses, tutorials are nonetheless challenging, with frequent writing assignments and the expectation that
students will be well prepared to participate actively and effectively in weekly discussions. At the same
time, students have consistently placed tutorials among the most enriching and consequential courses they
have taken. They have appreciated the close attention to their writing and argumentation skills; the opportu-
nity to be held accountable, in a detailed way, for the extended implications of their ideas; the chance to
develop their oral abilities as they engage in debate; and the close intellectual bonds tutorials build between
teachers and students, and students with each other. Many students have formed important advising and
mentoring relationships with their tutorial teachers.
Registration information: Students register for tutorials as they would for any other course (but should
first check the description for prerequisites and to see if permission of the instructor is required). Because of
limited enrollments and the special arrangements involved in organizing tutorials, students are encouraged
to determine, as early as possible, their interest in and commitment to the course. Students may not drop or
add a tutorial after the first week of class. Tutorials may not be taken on a pass/fail basis.
More information: Please see page 320 of this catalog for a list of tutorials offered in 2007-2008. Stu-
dents may obtain detailed information about particular tutorials from the course descriptions and the
instructors. (All tutorials have a "T" after the course number.) For general information, advice, or
suggestions about the program, please contact Professor Stephen Fix, Tutorial Program Director for
2007-2008, in Stetson.
Williams-Exeter Programme at Oxford University
Williams offers a year-long programme of studies at Oxford University in cooperation with Exeter Col-
lege, Oxford. Based at Ephraim Williams House, Williams' study center at Oxford, the Programme is de-
signed to offer the fullest possible integration of the students into the intellectual and social life of one of the
world's great universities. It makes full use of the Oxford tutorial system and the Oxford three-term calen-
dar is followed.
In addition to extensive opportunities to pursue British and Commonwealth studies, the Programme
also offers instruction in other fields for which Oxford is particularly noted or which are represented only
marginally or infrequently in the Williams curriculum. Interested students should consult the Dean's Of-
fice and the "Courses of Instruction" section of this catalog.
Williams-Mystic Maritime Studies Program
The William-Mystic Seaport Maritime Studies Program offers students a unique opportunity to ex-
plore the ocean, to travel the Atlantic, Pacific and Gulf Coasts, and to undertake original research of their
own design in the humanities and sciences. A term at Williams-Mystic satisfies both a semester's credit
and one winter study requirement, as well as intensive writing course credit. Four Williams courses are
offered as an integrated, multidisciplinary curriculum in the semester-long program at Mystic Seaport, in
The Curriculum
­ 14 ­
Mystic, Connecticut: Maritime History, Literature of the Sea, Marine Policy, and either Marine Ecology
or Oceanography (see the American Maritime Studies section in this catalog). Williams College faculty
members serve as the Director and Marine Scientist. Travel includes an offshore voyage on the open
ocean sailing aboard a tall ship, a seminar along the Pacific Coast, and a seminar on Nantucket Island, all
of which are cross-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary exercises. Students live in historic, cooperative,
coed houses at Mystic Seaport, the world's largest maritime museum, and have full access to world-class
maritime collections, a maritime library, well-equipped laboratory, and diverse coastal habitats (where
field research can be undertaken in a wide variety of environments, ranging from tidepools and salt
marshes to sandy beaches and estuaries). Students also participate in maritime skills under professional
instruction, with choices such as celestial navigation, maritime art, music of the sea, boat building, or
small boat handling and sailing. Williams-Mystic seeks candidates who are willing to try new things and
work in a compelling academic environment. No sailing experience necessary, and all majors welco-
me--a typical semester at Williams-Mystic is represented by 12 to 14 different majors spanning the
sciences and humanities. Sophomores, juniors, and seniors can attend. Interested students should contact
Williams-Mystic at admissions@williamsmystic.org, call (860-572- 5359), visit the website (williams-
mystic.org), or obtain a Williams-Mystic catalog from the Dean's office. Applications are on the web and
at the Dean's office. Financial aid and scholarships are available.
Williams in New York
Williams in New York is a one-semester study away program with a focus on experiential education. It
is distinctive, rigorous, and highly experiential, integrating traditional scholarship with on-going field-
work in related areas. Students attend classes and also spend 15 hours each week in a workplace environ-
ment, gaining hands-on experience that provides them with new insights and ideas which relate to their
coursework. In turn, they bring this new-found knowledge into the workplace and are able to analyze
their experiences against an academic background. The fieldwork placements are arranged in consulta-
tion with a Williams faculty member who serves as program director. Students are placed in city organi-
zations or agencies, where they work closely with non-faculty supervisors throughout the semester.
Classes are taught by the program director and other professors from Williams or New York area colleges
and universities. The program is headquartered at the Williams Club in midtown Manhattan in close
proximity to the New York Public Library, the City University of New York Graduate Center, Grand
Central Station, and other New York landmarks.

ACADEMIC STANDARDS AND REGULATIONS
Attendance
In order to give students a larger share of responsibility for their own education, Williams College does
not administer a general system of required classroom attendance. The College expects students to make
full use of their educational opportunities by regular class attendance and to assume the academic risks
incurred by absences.
Although no formal system of class attendance is maintained by the College, instructors may set such
standards of attendance as they feel are necessary for the satisfactory conduct of their courses. Students
who fail to meet these standards may be warned by the instructor and notice sent to the Dean that continued
absence will result in their being dropped from the course. A failing grade will be assigned to any course
dropped after the regular course change period. Students who do not attend the first class meeting in a
semester course or Winter Study Project may be required to withdraw by the instructor. Attendance is re-
quired at announced tests and final examinations unless the student is specifically excused by the instructor
or the Dean's Office. Satisfactory attendance in four quarters of activities approved by the Department of
Physical Education is required except for students excused by the Dean and the Director of Health.
Registration
Registration for fall and spring semesters and for the Winter Study Program takes place at designated
periods during the academic year. There may be a $5 per day processing fee for any registration changes
accepted after the announced deadlines.
New students register by mail in early summer; soon after arrival at Williams, they meet with their as-
signed Academic Advisors to discuss the curriculum and their course selections. All course changes for
new students are made after these meetings. During the first two years of study, students are limited in the
number of courses they may take in one department or subject each semester. For full details, see page 44.
Course Change Period
Course changes may be made during a designated period at the beginning of each semester. No course
changes may be made after that period except with the approval of the Committee on Academic Standing,
after consultation with the Dean's Office. During Winter Study, a second Winter Study Project may be
added if the instructor approves but the original Project may not be dropped. A processing fee of $5 per day
may be assessed for each course change accepted after the announced deadline.
First-year and first-semester transfer students may be permitted to withdraw from one course (incurring
a deficiency but no grade penalty) as late as the tenth week of the semester. Upperclass students also may
once in subsequent years withdraw from a course under the same conditions. A withdrawal, recorded on
the transcript as a "W," is granted only with the approval of the instructor and a dean and only if there is
complete agreement between the instructor and the dean that, despite conscientious effort to do the work,
continuation in the course would be detrimental to the overall educational interest or health of the student.
The deficiency thereby incurred must be removed in the normal manner. See references to making up defi-
ciencies on page 16.
Course Load
Students are required to take and complete four courses each semester. In exceptional cases, students
may, upon petition to the Committee on Academic Standing and with departmental approval at the time of
registration, elect a pattern of five semester courses in the fall semester and three in the spring or three in the
fall and five in the spring; a pass-fail course cannot be used as the fifth course in this pattern.
If a student with a disability believes that he/she is unable to pursue a full course of study, the student
may petition the Disabilities and Accommodations Advisory Group for permission to pursue a reduced
course load. Such a petition must be accompanied by a professional evaluation which addresses the stu-
dent's inability to maintain a full course of study and discusses the rationale for a reduced course load.
Upon consideration of a student's petition and supporting documentation, the Disabilities and Accom-
modations Advisory Group makes a recommendation to the Committee on Academic Standing which
renders decisions. Such cases are considered on an individual basis and may be initiated at any time during
the student's tenure at Williams.
Fifth Course Pass-Fail Option
Except in the case of the unbalanced course program described above, a student may, at the beginning of
any semester, enroll in a fifth course that must be specified as the pass-fail course. By the sixth week, a
student must decide whether to continue the course, and if so, whether on a pass-fail or regularly graded
Academic Standards and Regulations
­ 16 ­
basis. A form for designating the option chosen will be sent from the Registrar's Office. A processing fee
of $5 per day may be assessed for 5th course grading option designations accepted after the announced
deadline. A course graded "Pass" may not be used as one of the thirty-two semester courses required to
complete the degree, to fulfill distribution or major requirements, or to make up a deficiency. A pass-fail
course converted to a fifth regularly graded course may be used to fulfill distribution or major requirements
or to make up a deficiency incurred in a prior term. The grade received will be included in the calculation
of the student's cumulative grade-point average.
Winter Study Project
Students must take and pass a Winter Study Project in each of their four years. Winter Study Projects are
graded Honors, Pass, Perfunctory Pass, or Fail. All work for Winter Study Projects must be submitted by
the last day of the Winter Study Program; work may be accepted after this date only with the permission of
a dean. Students who fail their Winter Study Projects will be placed on Academic Probation by the Com-
mittee on Academic Standing and will be required to make up the deficiency (see page 16). Students who
fail through gross neglect of work will normally be required to resign. A student who receives a second
Perfunctory Pass grade in Winter Study will be required to pass a fifth course, which may be graded on the
regular A-E or pass/fail basis, in the following spring or fall semester.
Grading System and Records
Williams uses the following system of grades: A, excellent; B, good; C, fair; D, passing; E, failing.
These letters, with plus and minus value, have the following numerical equivalents in calculating grade
averages:
A+ = 4.33 B+ = 3.33 C+ = 2.33 D+ = 1.33
A = 4.00 B = 3.00 C = 2.00 D = 1.00 E = 0
A­ = 3.67 B­ = 2.67 C­ = 1.67 D­ = 0.67
A permanent record of each student's grades is kept and this official record forms the basis for any aca-
demic action by the College.
A transcript of a student's cumulative academic record is available from the Registrar's Office upon
written request. Transcripts will not be issued for students who are in financial arrears.
Provisions relating to student records, access to them, and safeguards on their use are in the Student
Handbook.
First-Year Student Warnings
In the middle of each semester, instructors report to the Registrar those first-year students whose grades
at that time are unsatisfactory. The students and their academic advisors receive notices of warnings as a
matter of routine. The Dean's Office will inform parents of students who receive two or more warnings
unless instructed not to do so by the student within three working days of the receipt of the warnings.
Extensions of Deadlines
Deadlines for course work are set by the instructor with the following limitations:
 for courses with final exams, the latest that written work may be due is 5:00 p.m. on the last
day of reading period.
 for courses without final exams, the latest that written work may be due is 5:00 pm. on the
third-to-last day of the exam period.
If work is due before these deadlines, the instructor may grant an extension up to these deadlines solely
at his or her discretion. Short extensions beyond these deadlines may be granted by a dean but only with the
concurrence of the instructor. No extensions will be granted beyond the examination period except in the
case of serious illness.
Instructors may require students who have missed announced quizzes or hour tests to present satis-
factory explanations to a dean before they are permitted to make up the exercises.
If a student is absent from a final examination, a make-up examination may be given only with the
permission of a dean and at a time determined by the dean.
Deficiencies
A student receives credit for a course by obtaining a grade of at least D minus. A student may not
repeat a course for which degree credit has been awarded. If the student fails a course, he or she must
make up the deficiency.
Academic Standards and Regulations
­ 17 ­
If a failure occurs in the first semester of a full-year course, the student may, with the consent of the
instructor, continue the course and receive credit for the second semester only. If a failure occurs in the
second semester of a full-year course, credit for passing the first semester may be retained only with the
approval of the Committee on Academic Standing.
A senior who incurs a failure in the first semester in a required major course may be dropped from the
College at midyear.
Normally deficiencies can be made up only by courses taken after the deficiencies have been incurred.
A student must make up a deficiency in one of these ways:
1) obtain a grade of at least C minus in a summer school course, approved in advance by the Registrar,
at a regionally accredited four-year college or university; (The grade will not, however, be included
in the calculation of the student's cumulative grade point average.)
2) pass an extra graded course at Williams in the semester following the failure;
3) in the case ofafirst-semester failure ofayear-long language course, obtainagrade of at leastaCminus
in the work of the second semester of that course. The failure for the first semester will, however, re-
main on the student's record and will be included in the cumulative grade point average.
A deficiency must normally be made up before the start of the following academic year, or in the case of
a deficiency incurred in the spring semester, no later than the following fall semester. A student may, in
consultation with the Dean's Office, petition the Committee on Academic Standing with an alternate plan.
Separation for Low Scholarship
It is the policy of Williams College not to permit a student to remain in residence after it has become
evident that he or she is either unable or unwilling to maintain reasonable standards of academic achieve-
ment. At the end of each term, the Committee on Academic Standing reviews all academic records that fail
to meet the following minimum academic requirements:
For first-year students: Three grades of C minus or better and no failures each semester, and
at least Perfunctory Pass on the Winter Study Project
For upperclass students: Four grades of C minus or better each semester, and
at least Perfunctory Pass on the Winter Study Project
Students whose records fail to meet these minimum academic requirements or whose records otherwise
fail to show adequate progress may receive an academic warning, be placed on academic probation, or be
required to resign.
Students who are required to resign from the College for academic reasons are normally not permitted to
return for at least one year from the date of their resignation. A student who has been required to resign
from the College may petition the Committee on Academic Standing through the Dean for reinstatement
on two conditions only: all deficiencies must have been made up and a letter submitted to the Committee
that offers convincing evidence that the student is ready and able to complete work toward a degree at
Williams without further interruption.
When required to resign, students must vacate their rooms promptly. Financial aid students must also
see the Director of Financial Aid before leaving to discuss loan repayment and renewal of aid in the event
of readmission.
A student who fails to meet minimum academic standards in his or her final semester at Williams may
be required by the Committee on Academic Standing to meet them by earning grades of at least C minus
elsewhere before the B.A. will be awarded. If such work is required, it must be completed within three
years unless stipulated otherwise, and the courses must be approved in advance by the Registrar.
Withdrawal from the College in Good Standing
Students may request personal leaves of absence from a dean and, if granted, withdraw from the Col-
lege. Such time away, often as a period of reassessment and self evaluation, can prove to be educationally
beneficial. A withdrawal in good standing may be granted for not less than one semester and not more than
three years. Students who withdraw in good standing are readmitted with the approval of the Dean's Office
and are expected to complete the degree without further interruption.
Students may request permission from a dean to withdraw at any time. If a student is granted a personal
leave of absence after the semester begins, but before the end of the drop/add period, the transcript will list
the date of withdrawal as the day before the term began. If a personal leave is granted after the end of the
Academic Standards and Regulations
­ 18 ­
drop/add period, but before the end of the eighth week of the semester, the transcript will list the date of
withdrawal, but the semester will not count toward the maximum of eight allowed to complete the degree.
If a personal withdrawal is allowed after the eighth week of the semester, the transcript will list the date of
withdrawal and the courses in progress, each with a W; the semester will normally count toward the maxi-
mum of eight allowed to complete the degree and the student will incur deficiencies that must be made up
before returning to the College.
Refunds
Payment refund or credit in the event of withdrawal is described on page 25.
Eligibility for and Completion of Majors
To be eligible for any major, students must have received grades of C minus or better in each course in
the major taken in the first two years of college and Honors or Pass on any Winter Study Project taken in
the major department or program. A senior may enter a major only upon the approval of the department
chair and the Committee on Academic Standing.
All semester courses in the major must be taken on a regularly graded basis. In addition to passing each
major course and, where required, a major Winter Study Project, the student must maintain an average in
the major of 1.67 or higher. Seniors who have an average below 1.67 in the major field normally will not be
allowed to continue. A senior who receives a grade of E in the first semester of a required major course
may be dropped from the College at mid-year. A student who falls below these standards may continue in
the major only with the approval of the Committee on Academic Standing.
A senior major exercise is not required by every department but is by some. All departments requiring
such an exercise specify it as such in the description of their major programs in the "Courses of Instruction"
section, and all students in those departments must complete the exercise satisfactorily.
Eligibility for Extracurricular Activities
A student is eligible to represent the College in any athletic, dramatic, literary, or musical event and be in
the student government, or other organization as a member, substitute, or officer, unless he or she is de-
clared ineligible:
1) by the Dean;
2) by vote of the Discipline Committee; or
3) by vote of the Committee on Academic Standing because of a dangerously low record.
The Student Honor Committee may recommend to the Dean loss of eligibility as a penalty for a viola-
tion of the Honor Code.
Dean's List
All students who attain a semester average of 3.50 or higher in a program of four or more courses are
placed on the Dean's List for that semester.
Phi Beta Kappa Society
Students of the highest academic standing are eligible for election to membership in the Phi Beta Kappa
Society in accordance with the following rules:
1) The requirements for election to membership shall be a grade point average of 3.3 and Honors or
Pass in all required Winter Study Projects. There shall be two elections of new members for each class, at
the end of the junior and senior years.
2) At the end of the junior year, all students in the highest five percent of the class, ranked by cumulative
grade point average, shall be eligible for election provided they have met the requirements and have com-
pleted enough courses to be considered candidates for the B.A. degree in the following year. A student who
leaves Williams at the end of the junior year to attend graduate school may be elected under the above
procedures.
At the end of the senior year, all students not yet elected and in the highest 12.5 per cent of the class,
ranked by cumulative grade point average, shall be eligible for election provided they have met the require-
ments.
3) Students shall be eligible for election only if they have been students at Williams College for at least
two years.
4) Honorary members may be elected from distinguished alumni of at least twenty years' standing. No
more than one such member shall be elected each year.

Dean of the College is not of good moral character is ineligible to election.
Academic Standards and Regulations
­ 19 ­
6) The name of a member elect shall be entered on the roll only after he or she has accepted the election
and has paid to the Treasurer the regular entrance fee.
7) Any undergraduate member who withdraws from the College before graduation or who falls short of
the minimum Phi Beta Kappa scholastic standing may, upon a two-thirds voteof the members present at
the annual meeting, be deprived of membership in the society.
8) Any undergraduate member who is expelled from the College shall be deprived of membership in
the Society.
9) While connected with Williams College as an officer of instruction or administration, any graduate of
Williams College who is a member of another chapter of Phi Beta Kappa shall be considered a regular
member of the Williams chapter.
10) While connected with Williams College as professor, associate professor or assistant professor, or
an officer of administration, any member of another chapter of Phi Beta Kappa shall have all the privileges
of the Williams chapter, including holding office and voting. While connected with Williams College, any
other officer of instruction or administration who is a member of another chapter shall have all the privi-
leges of the Williams chapter, except holding office and voting.
Awarding of Degrees
By vote of the Trustees, the degree of Bachelor of Arts is conferred at Commencement upon students
who have completed the requirements as to courses and grades to the satisfaction of the Faculty. The right
to a degree may, however, be forfeited by misconduct at any time prior to the conferring of the degree. No
degree in absentia will be conferred except by special vote of the Trustees on petition presented to the
Dean. Diplomas will not be authorized for students who have not paid College charges or have not re-
turned all books belonging to the library.
Graduation with Distinction
The Faculty will recommend to the Trustees that the degree of Bachelor of Arts with distinction be con-
ferred upon those members of the graduating class who have passed all Winter Study Projects and obtained
a four year average in the top:
35% of the graduating class -- Bachelor of Arts cum laude or higher
15% of the graduating class -- Bachelor of Arts magna cum laude or higher
2% of the graduating class -- Bachelor of Arts summa cum laude
­ 20 ­
ACADEMIC ADVISING
A variety of academic advice and counsel is offered to students during the course of their undergraduate
education. Instructors, departmental and administrative officers and some special programs are available to
partner with the individual student to help each explore and develop their academic interests and talents
and take advantage of the academic and intellectual opportunities available through the College.
In the first-year each student is assigned an Academic Advisor who is either a member of the regular
teaching faculty or an administrative officer whose responsibilities keep him or her in close contact with
the curriculum of the College. The Deans of the College also advise undergraduates, transfer, exchange,
and international students. The Deans of the College coordinate the first-year advising program, review the
academic progress of individual students, and--when appropriate--call students in to discuss their situa-
tions.
In the sophomore year, students continue their relationship with their first-year advisor and it is recom-
mended that they seek advice from deans, former advisors, and instructors, along with pre-professional and
other special advisors (see page 410). Sophomores are also encouraged to discuss major options and re-
quirements with faculty members from departments and programs in which they have an interest before
declaring a major in the spring semester.
The student-run Peer Mentor and Peer Advisor programs can provide additional advice and information
for students during their first and sophomore years in particular, as well as for any student wishing a peer
perspective about particular courses, departments, programs, majors, or areas of study. New this year, six
peer mentors (2 from each division) who are juniors or seniors, nominated by departments will hold week-
ly evening office hours and be available by appointment in the student organization suite on the second
floor of the Paresky Center. Peer Mentors are nominated by departments and programs from among the
year's senior majors. During the course of the year the Peer Mentors hold several Course and Majors Fairs,
keep informed about any changes in faculty, and curriculum in their departments, and generally make
themselves available for consultation by students.
In the junior and senior years students are advised by faculty from their major departments or programs.
Each department or program determines its own advising system for its majors, although chairs are regu-
larly available for consultation.
ACADEMIC ASSISTANCE
Additional programs of academic assistance are also available through the Academic Resources office.
Any student who desires extra help in a particular course that he or she is registered may request a tutor
who has been recommended by the respective departments to Academic Resources office; costs of this
tutoring are covered by Academic Resources. Students seeking to enhance their writing skills in any course
may take advantage of the Writing Workshop. Trained and supervised by a coordinator, student writing
tutors provide assistance on papers already corrected and with drafts of papers in any stage of the writing
process. The Math and Science Resource Center (MSRC), a drop-in help center staffed by student tutors
who come highly recommended from the respective departments, is also available to students of Biology
101, 102, and 202, Chemistry 151, 153, 155, 156, 251, 255, Mathematics 100, 101, 103, 104, 105, and
106, Physics 131, 132, 141, and 142, and Statistics 101, and 201. The MSRC which is open from 8 p.m. to
12 midnight Sundays through Thursdays throughout both academic semesters works in close cooperation
with the faculty teaching those courses.
All students are encouraged to take full advantage of these academic resources.
EXCHANGE AND STUDY ABROAD
Advising of exchange students and of Williams students wishing to study abroad in the junior year is
coordinated by the Dean's Office. Special orientation and information meetings are held during the fall
semester for new students and for students wishing to study abroad. Orientation and counseling of interna-
tional students is arranged by the International Student Advisor in the Dean's Office.

ACADEMIC HONESTY
All students are expected to be familiar with the Williams College Honor Code and to reaffirm their
commitment to the Statement of Academic Honesty at the beginning of each academic year. The Honor
Code covers all aspects of academic honesty, including the writing of papers and laboratory reports as well
as all quizzes, homework assignments, hour tests, and examinations.
Statement of Academic Honesty
As an institution fundamentally concerned with the free exchange of ideas, Williams College has al-
ways depended on the academic integrity of each of its members. In the spirit of this free exchange, the
students and faculty of Williams recognize the necessity and accept the responsibility for academic hones-
ty.
A student who enrolls at the College thereby agrees to respect and acknowledge the research and ideas
of others in his or her work and to abide by those regulations governing work stipulated by the instructor.
Any student who breaks these regulations, misrepresents his or her own work, or collaborates in the mis-
representation of another's work has committed a serious violation of this agreement.
Students and faculty are to report violations and alleged violations of this agreement. Such reports are to
be submitted to the Student Honor Committee, consisting of eight student members of the joint Faculty-
Student Honor System-Discipline Committee. This committee is responsible for determining the guilt or
innocence of the accused person or persons, and for recommending appropriate punishments to the Dean.
A committee of faculty members to be designated by the Faculty will sit with the Student Honor Commit-
tee in an advisory capacity.
A quorum of three-quarters shall be required for the Committee to meet. A vote of guilty by at least
three-quarters of those present is necessary for conviction. A recommendation for dismissal must be made
by unanimous vote of those present, and shall be carried out only with the assent of the President of the
College.
The Committee is responsible for informing the student body of the meaning and implications of this
statement. The aforementioned faculty committee shall be responsible for informing faculty members of
the meaning and implications of this statement.
Any amendments to this statement must be made through a student referendum in which two-thirds of
the student body votes, and in which two-thirds of those voting vote for the amendment. These alterations
must be ratified by the Faculty.
Adopted 1971
Guidelines
Instructors are encouraged to submit to the Honor Committee a written statement defining how the
Statement of Academic Honesty applies to their courses or laboratories, and to explain such guidelines to
their students. Instructors may set any type of final examination or hour test, ranging from closed-book,
alternate-seating classroom exercises to open-book, "take-home" examinations or papers, and any require-
ments for laboratory exercises. Some instructors encourage cooperation among students but others do not.
If a student is unsure how the Honor Code applies in a particular situation, it is ultimately the student's
responsibility to find out from his or her professor, or from a member of the Honor Committee, how the
Honor Code applies in that situation. An open and highly individualized system can last only as long as
both the students and the faculty work together to create a true academic community.
In written material, students are expected to avoid the possibility of even unintentional plagiarism by
acknowledging the sources of their work. Careful observance of accepted standards of reference and
attribution is required. The basic rules are summarized below. Students are further advised to consult a
recognized style manual to learn how to acknowledge sources correctly. While academic honesty does not
demand a footnote on statements of common fact, it does require that a student provide clear footnotes or
other appropriate documentation and give credit in the bibliography to ideas, interpretations, and facts that
particular sources have contributed to the student's final work.
Academic Honesty
­ 22 ­
The basic rules of attribution require that:
1) A direct quotation (whether a single word or a phrase, sentence, paragraph, or series of paragraphs)
must always be identified by quotation marks, by indenting and single spacing, or by reduced type size of
the quoted material, and a note must be used to state the exact source.
2) A paraphrase of the work of another must be acknowledged as such by a note stating the source.
3) Indebtedness to the specific ideas of others, or the summarizing of several pages, even though ex-
pressed in different words, must be acknowledged by a note stating the source.
4) Every instance of the use of another student's laboratory reports, computer programs, or other mate-
rial must be acknowledged by a note.
5) Even the use of a student's own previous work must be acknowledged; thus, a student must obtain
the prior permission of all instructors concerned before submitting substantially the same paper in more
than one course.
Procedures for Alleged Violations
Students or faculty members who have discovered a violation or a possible violation of the Honor Code
should report it promptly either to the faculty chair or to the student chair of the Honor Committee. As
soon as possible after receiving a report of an alleged Honor Code violation, the Student Honor Committee
will convene to hear the case. The person bringing the charge will present the evidence to the Committee in
the presence of the accused student, who may then speak in his or her own defense both with and without
the accuser present. After the accused student has left the proceedings, the Committee will determine inno-
cence or guilt and, if the latter, will recommend an appropriate penalty to the Dean. Depending on the
circumstances of the violation, penalties then imposed by the Dean may include such possibilities as a
directed grade of E in the course, disciplinary probation, or temporary or permanent separation from the
College.
­ 23 ­
EXPENSES
Within the limits of available funds, Williams endeavors to offer its educational opportunities to all who
qualify for admission. Income from its endowment and annual contributions from its alumni and friends
have enabled Williams to keep its tuition at about half the actual cost per student to the College.
Payment of Term Bills
College bills for one-half of all tuition and fees are mailed to parents twice a year (in mid-July and mid-
December) for payment on August 15 and January 15; a fee of $250 may be charged if payment is re-
ceived after these dates. Term bills must be paid before the semester's classes begin or the student will not
be permitted to enroll in classes or remain in residence at the College. Billing statements for accounts with
outstanding balances or current activity will be issued monthly and are due upon receipt.
All outstanding balances must be paid to the Bursar, and all books and materials must be returned to the
Library, before the student is entitled to a degree or a transcript.
College Bills
College charges for tuition, room, board, and fees for the academic year 2007-2008 are as follows:
Tuition $35,438
Room Fee (including telephone service) 4,810
Full Board 4,660
Student Activities Fee* 182
House Maintenance Fee (upperclass) or First-Year Dues 50
_______
$45,140
Other Expenses
Based on a study of expenses reported by financial aid students, a minimum normal budget for a college
year at Williams includes additional expenses estimated as follows:
Books 800
Clothing, Laundry, Recreation approximately 1200
_______
Estimated year's total, exclusive of travel expenses** $2,000
________________
*A student activities fee for support of non-athletic student organizations is charged to all un-
dergraduates as part of the College term bill. It includes, for example, subscriptions to the col-
lege newspaper, and admission to most drama productions and musical events on campus.
**Travel expenses are not included in figures listed above. The cost of two round-trip tickets is
added into each successful financial aid candidate's award.
Additional Items
A House Maintenance Fee of $50 per year is charged to upperclassmen as a part of the College term bill.
It is used to provide a base for the social and cultural programs of each residential House and to meet any
unusual maintenance expenses for the Houses. First-year class dues of $50 are charged at the rate of $25
each semester. Co-op residents and off-campus residents are charged a $25 neighborhood residential fee
each semester.
The Commonwealth of Massachusetts requires that, effective September 1, 1989, all full- and part-time
students enrolled in institutions of higher education located in Massachusetts must participate in a qualify-
ing student health insurance plan offered by the institution or in another health insurance program affording
comparable coverage.
Expenses
­ 24 ­
The College offers a qualifying student health insurance plan to all students. The College will allow
students to waive participation in this insurance plan if the student will certify in writing, before the begin-
ning of the academic year, that the coverage offered by an alternative program chosen by the student is
comparable to that of the qualifying program available at the College.
Information about the student health insurance program offered by the College, including current details
of its cost, is mailed to all students each year. Additional information about this program or about the Com-
monwealth's requirements is available through the Thompson Health Center at (413) 597-3166.
There may be a $5 per day processing fee for any registration changes accepted after the announced
deadlines. There is a charge of $25 for a lost key.
Payment of College Bills
A non-refundable deposit of $200 to reserve a place in the first-year class is required from all admitted
candidates (except certain financial aid recipients) by the Candidate's Reply Date of May 1. The deposit
appears as a credit on the term bill rendered in July.
College tuition statements for one half of all fees are mailed to the billing name(s) and addresses on
record twice a year--in July, payable by August 15, and in December, payable by January 15. Payment
may be made by check, money order, or wire transfer. Credit cards can not be used to pay tuition and fees.
A fee of $250 may be charged if payment is received after these dates.
Students who receive a scholarship(s) that was not awarded through the Williams Office of Financial
Aid must complete a Scholarship Information Sheet and mail it to the Financial Aid Office by early June.
Provisional credit will be posted to the semester bill for the following; anticipated disbursements of direct
loans for which a promissory note has been signed and returned to the Office of Financial Aid, anticipated
disbursements of outside loans approved by the lender, outside scholarships which have not yet been re-
ceived and applied against the student account and any remaining semester contract amount for the Ten
Month Payment Plan. If actual payment for the above provisional credits are not received by the date antic-
ipated, the provisional credit will expire and be removed from the student's account creating a balance due.
A check returned to the College for any reason such as "account closed" or "insufficient funds" will be
charged to the student's term bill and a "return check charge" of $20.00 will be assessed. The College
reserves the right to require that payment be made in the form of cash, cashier check or money order.
Students with bills still unpaid at the start of the semester who have not made satisfactory arrangements
with the Bursar will not be permitted to enroll in classes or remain in residence at the College. Furthermore,
if arrangements for payment after the start of the semester are approved by the Bursar and these expected
payments are not made on time, students may not be allowed to enroll for the next semester.
If efforts by the Bursar's Office to collect the monies owed are unsuccessful, the account could be
placed with a collection agency, and if the delinquency persists, the College's experience with the account
may be reported to a national credit bureau. It is the policy of the College to pass on to the debtor all reason-
able costs associated with collection of the debt through a collection agency. If at any time the student
believes information concerning payment delinquency is inaccurate, he/she should notify the College c/o
The Bursar's Office, P.O. Box 406, Williamstown, MA 01267.
There are several loan options available to parents through outside sources. These include the MassPlan
Loan through the Massachusetts Educational Financing Authority and the Federal Plus Loan Program.
Information on these loans can be found in the brochure A Guide to Borrowing for College.
Williams also offers an installment plan, administered by Tuition Management Services whereby the
yearly charges are paid in 10 equal installments starting in June, with no interest charges. There are no
income restrictions. Monthly payments will be the total cost (less any scholarships, Stafford or parent
loans) divided by 10. There is an administration fee for this program. Information on this program is sent
each spring to all parents or can be obtained by calling Tuition Management Services at (888) 216-4258.

Financial Aid
Williams has a substantial financial aid program to promote the greatest possible diversity in the social
and economic background of the student population. Students interested in financial aid policies and pro-
cedures should consultWilliams College Prospectus,theStudent Handbook, or the Office of Financial Aid.
Distinctive Undergraduate Scholarships

assistance for up to three years of graduate/professional study.
Alumni Funded Tutorials
Tutorials bring a professor and two students together in weekly sessions that epitomize President James
A. Garfield's (Class of 1856) legendary statement: "The ideal college is Mark Hopkins on one end of the
log and a student on the other." They forge student-professor bonds, teach students about arguments, about
arriving at and defending a position, and about responding on the spot to questions, criticisms, and sugges-
tions. They also promote critical reading, the writing of succinct analyses, and oral defense.
The College recognizes the Classes of 1953, 1954, and 1979 with deepest gratitude for supporting Tuto-
rials with their generous 25th and 50th Reunion gifts. Williams is also pleased to recognize the following
individuals who have created generous endowments to support Tutorials, many in honor of their 25th and
50th Reunions: Hugh Germanetti 1954, David A. Gray 1954, Robert L. Guyett 1958, John D. Mabie
1954, and John H. Simpson 1979.
A member of the Class of 1954 Reunion gift Purpose Committee says, "This is the essence of education
and eminently worthy of the full support of the 50th Reunion Class of 1954. I was always aware of the
benefit we each enjoyed as one student among only fifteen or eighteen in our usual classes--would that we
also could have had the benefit of regular two-on-one sessions with a professor. I don't believe we could
offer those who follow us anything richer than that experience."

PREPARATIONFORGRADUATEAND PROFESSIONALSTUDY
Although the principle function of Williams is to provide a broad and solid liberal education that will be
of lasting value no matter what the vocation a student may pursue, the College recognizes that no funda-
mental conflict exists between a liberal education and preparation for a professional career; on the contrary,
a foundation of liberal studies increases professional competence in any field. A student should plan his or
her program of study so as to provide as much educational breadth and enrichment as circumstances per-
mit. A student should also give serious consideration to post-college plans early in the college career.
Each departmental major provides the foundation for graduate study in the corresponding field. Stu-
dents should consult the departmental programs listed under "Courses of Instruction" for requirements,
and for special advice regarding preparation for graduate study. Students should also consult with the ap-
propriate departmental chairman or the special faculty advisors as early as possible in their college careers
to make certain they have taken all the necessary factors into consideration.
Particular attention is called to the foreign language requirements of graduate study. Candidates for the
degree of doctor of philosophy at almost all graduate schools are required to have a reading knowledge of
both French and German. Under certain circumstances another language may replace French. Many grad-
uate schools require also a knowledge of Latin for students of English and Romantic Languages. Candi-
dates for the master of arts degree are required to have a reading knowledge of either French or German.
Students should consult departmental chairmen or the faculty advisors for the requirements in specific
fields of study.
Visual Arts
Students interested in graduate studies in art or architecture should meet with faculty with whom they
have completed advanced work in the areas they wish to pursue. Their counsel and that of the Department
of Art Academic Advisor, Ed Epping, can help the student narrow the search of programs that would best
match the student's needs. The specific requirements of all art and architecture schools offering Master of
Arts and/or Master of Fine Arts is available from their online resource.
The College Art Association (CAA) has written:
"Admission to (graduate) programs should be based on the nature, extent, and quality of un-
dergraduate preparation, including courses in studio, art history, and other academic subjects.
Quality of studio preparation can best be judged on the basis of careful evaluation of work
done at the undergraduate level; therefore, a portfolio review (usually represented by slides) is
regarded as an absolute necessity in the admission process.
While many institutions consider the BFA to be the standard qualifying degree, the fact that the
applicant has attended a BA- or BS-granting institution does not necessarily rule out accep-
tance in most MFA programs. Whatever the undergraduate degree, most entering graduate
students tend not to be completely prepared in one or more of the areas cited above and will
require remedial make-up work...
Some institutions use the MA degree as a qualifying prerequisite for final acceptance into
MFA candidacy, allowing the student to apply the earned credits toward the higher degree."
Students are advised to take into consideration not only current minimum requirements but also recom-
mended courses.
Business Administration
Williams offers no special course in preparation for a business career for graduate study in business
administration. The qualities which are important to succeed in business, and which graduate business
schools are seeking, are an ability to reason and to express oneself logically and clearly in written and oral
exposition; a good understanding of the physical and social environment in which business operates; a
solid background in quantitative skills; and an appreciation of human motivations and goals. This means
that a broad liberal arts program is preferred over a highly specialized one.
Within this broad prescription it may be desirable to have at least one year of economics and one year of
mathematics (including statistics and calculus). For those interested in production management or opera-
Preparation for Graduate and Professional Study
­ 29 ­
tion research, additional work in any quantitative course and/or a course in computer science would be
helpful.
But there is no particular major at Williams that is designated as preparation for the business profession.
Students interested in futures in business are encouraged to undertake a broad educational program in the
arts, humanities, and sciences. It is important that one gets involved in extra-curricular activities, one holds
a leadership position, and pursuing relevant summer internship is critical.
Students interested in graduate work in business administration should consult with the Pre-MBA Advi-
sor, Robin Meyer, at the Office of Career Counseling.
Engineering
Many Williams graduates enjoy productive careers in engineering, applied science, or technical
management. Successful engineers need to be able to communicate effectively, reason logically, and
understand both the technical and the social dimensions of a problem. A prospective engineer should
major in one of the sciences (usually physics, chemistry, computer science, or mathematics), while
pursuing a broad liberal arts education at Williams. Most often he or she will complete a Williams
B.A. in the usual four years and then go to an engineering school for professional training leading to a
master's degree or doctorate in engineering. While it may be necessary to make up a few undergradu-
ate engineering courses, the opportunities at Williams to participate in scientific research and the
breadth of a liberal arts education prepare Williams graduates to succeed in engineering graduate
study and in their careers.
The booklet "Choosing First Year Courses" contains a list of Williams courses recommended to
prospective engineers. Students interested in engineering also have the opportunity to take under-
graduate engineering courses at other institutions. Williams maintains formal exchange programs
with California Institute of Technology, Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth College, and
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Williams students can arrange to study at one of these leading engi-
neering schools for one or two semesters, typically during the junior year. Please see the "Exchange
Programs" section of this catalog for more information. The 3-2 program offers another opportunity
to study engineering at the undergraduate level. Please see the "Combined Program in Liberal Arts
and Engineering" section for information.
The pre-engineering advisor, Professor Jefferson Strait, will be happy to help plan course selections and
to discuss the possible paths to a career in engineering. Many more details about pre-engineering can be
found in the Physics Department section of the College website.
Law
Williams graduates regularly proceed directly to law schools on the strength of their liberal education.
As a rule, law schools do not require particular pre-law curriculum for undergraduates. Consequently, ap-
plication and admission to law school is open to qualified students from all academic disciplines. This does
not mean, however, that law schools are indifferent to one's undergraduate academic experience. In fact,
law schools will be very conscious of the quality and rigor of one's undergraduate education. A serious
student, considering law school, will heed this advice and undertake a challenging program.
Students intending to study law should consult with the Pre-Law Advisor, Dawn Dellea, at the Office of
Career Counseling. Also, on a regular basis each fall, law schools from around the country will visit Wil-
liams to provide information and to answer questions of potential applicants. Check the OCC calendar for
notice of these visits.
The Health Professions
Many Williams graduates elect to pursue a career in medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine, public
health, or other health-related fields. All are welcome to seek guidance from the Health Professions Office.
Students interested in medicine and related fields should pursue a broad liberal arts education, letting
enthusiasm for subjects be a guide. In most cases, a student should consider volunteer service and field-
specific internship experience in an effort to confirm interest in the chosen field. With careful planning, any
major can be studied.
In order to pursue a career in a health-related field, a student must pay particular attention to the courses
required for graduate school admission. In certain fields, upwards of twelve courses are listed as prerequi-
sites. The general requirements for many programs are outlined in "Choosing First Year Courses," but each
student considering advanced study in the health fields should plan on meeting with the Health Professions
Preparation for Graduate and Professional Study
­ 30 ­
Advisor early in the college career to ensure that planned coursework will meet specific admissions re-
quirements.
Charley Stevenson, the Health Professions Advisor, will be happy to discuss goals and specific steps
which might help a student realize them. Detailed information is available at the Health Professions web-
site (www.williams.edu/resources/careers/prehealth_welcome.php).
Pre-College and College Teaching/Research
A central qualification for careers in teaching at any level is proficiency in a major. Students interested in
college teaching and research should prepare themselves at Williams for graduate work in the subject of
their choice. Those interested in teaching at the elementary or secondary level should plan to attain state
certification and/or earn an MAT or M.Ed at a good graduate school. There are many opportunities to do
teaching internships and study education as an undergraduate while at Williams.
Students interested in college teaching should consult with the chairs of the departments in which they
intend to major. Those interested in teaching at the elementary and secondary level should consult with the
Director of the Program in Teaching. Additional advice for both of these options is also available at the
Office of Career Counseling.
Teaching After Williams
There are many options for teaching after Williams, including independent and public school teaching.
Many states now offer streamlined programs to certify public school teachers, and many states offer wide
range of options for acquiring certification while you teach. Students who are interested in teaching are
encouraged to contact Susan Engel, the Director of the Program in Teaching at Williams, to find out how
they might participate in the program.
The Office of Career Counseling has a very active on-campus educational recruiting program that in-
cludes many private schools as well as Teach for America and similar programs. The program begins in
the fall and continues through the spring. Students interested in teaching at independent elementary- or
secondary-level schools or participating in the Teach for America or similar programs directly after gradu-
ation from Williams (certification is not required) should consult with the Office of Career Counseling.
Religious Study
There is no particular path through the Williams curriculum designed or recommended for students in-
tending to prepare for a career as a religious professional, enroll in a seminary or pursue theological educa-
tion. Most undergraduate liberal arts courses can be useful to the prospective minister, priest, rabbi, imam,
or teacher of religion. Ordination requirements vary widely depending on the particular religious commu-
nity or tradition; in some cases it may be possible to make progress on certain credentials in academic study
or field experience during the undergraduate years. A basic foundation in the study of religion is certainly
helpful--sacred texts, scriptural languages, history, philosophy, phenomenology and comparative studies,
etc. Students contemplating advanced academic work in religious studies in preparation for a career in
teaching or scholarship should give serious consideration to concentrated undergraduate study in the field.
Students with vocational interests that may include ordination or certification as a religious professional
are urged to make themselves known to one of the chaplains (or, where appropriate, one of the local clergy)
as soon as these interests begin to come into focus. Those interested in graduate academic programs in
religious studies should consult with the faculty advisor in that field.

GRADUATE PROGRAMS AT WILLIAMS
Master of Arts in Policy Economics
The Center for Development Economics (CDE), which opened at Williams College in 1960, offers an
intensive one-year program in economic analysis and quantitative techniques leading to the degree of Mas-
ter of Arts in Policy Economics. The program is specifically designed for economists from developing
countries who have already embarked on professional careers in public agencies. The curriculum requires
courses in development economics, macroeconomics, public finance, and econometrics. CDE fellows
choose among other courses on related topics in lecture, seminar, and tutorial formats. Williams undergrad-
uates who satisfy course prerequisites, with the consent of the individual instructor, are encouraged to take
courses at the CDE.
Admission to the master's degree program is highly selective, with several hundred applicants each year
for approximately 25 places. Candidates normally have a B.A. or B.Sc. degree with honors in economics
or a related field, two or more years of relevant work experience, and an effective command of spoken and
written English. CDE fellows are often nominated for the program by public agencies from which they
will be on leave.
All communications relating to the degree of Master of Arts in Policy Economics should be addressed
to the CDE, Assistant Director, 1065 Main Street, Williams College, Williamstown, MA 01267, or e-mail
cde@williams.edu.
Master of Arts in the History of Art
In cooperation with the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute, Williams College offers a two-year
course of study leading to the degree of Master of Arts in the History of Art. The objective of the program
is to offer to a small number of students a thorough professional preparation for careers in teaching and
museums, and to enable them to pursue further research whether independently or at other institutions of-
fering higher degrees. The curriculum consists of seminars in art historical subjects and an intensive study
of foreign languages in the context of the general literature of art. Problems of criticism, connoisseurship,
and conservation arising from the study of original works of art are fundamental to the program, and op-
portunities are provided for practical experience in museum work at The Clark, the Williams College Mu-
seum of Art, and the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art. The study of primary materials is fur-
ther extended by field trips to other collections. The degree is normally awarded after two years of resident
graduate study. To earn the degree, students must take ten courses, of which at least six must be graduate
seminars (including ARTH 504). In connection with the preparation of a paper for the Graduate Sympo-
sium, students will register for an eleventh course (ARTH 509), to be graded pass/fail, in their fourth se-
mester. Ademonstration of proficiency in reading two foreign languages is required. Of these two, German
is required, and French is recommended. In January of the first year, students participate in a European
study trip with selected faculty; in January of the second year, students must complete a Qualifying Paper.
In addition to all course work, students must, at the end of the second year, present a shortened version of
the Qualifying Paper in a graduate symposium to be held on Commencement weekend. To enter the pro-
gram a successful applicant must have been awarded the degree of Bachelor of Arts or its equivalent from
an accredited institution. An undergraduate major in art is not required for acceptance to the program.
For further information, write: The Director, Graduate Program in the History of Art, Box 8, Williams-
town, Massachusetts 01267, telephone (413) 458-9545, or email gradart@williams.edu.

Please check online for the most up-to-date information (www.williams.edu/Registrar/catalog).
COURSE NUMBERING SYSTEM
Courses designated by a single number are semester courses.
Year courses are designated by an odd number and an even number joined by a hyphen; the work of the two
semesters constitutes an integral, indivisible course. Therefore, if a student does not pass the second half of a
year-long course, he or she forfeits credit for the first half and incurs a deficiency as a result of the forfeiture.
Students who register for a year course are required to do both semesters of that course within the same academ-
ic year.
In some departments, course numbers have special meanings that are explained in their listings.
The (F) or (S) following a course's number indicates the semester, fall or spring, in which the course will be
offered.

AFR 400, the senior seminar with special topics or themes emphasized each year. An honors thesis is also an
option for students wishing to conduct advanced research and study. Additional courses may be taken with affili-
ated faculty and visiting professors associated with the program. We encourage students to take at least one
course in a program/department other than Africana Studies and consider an experiential learning winter study
session; however, the majority of your courses should be selected from among those offered by core faculty.

HONORS PROGRAM IN AFRICANA STUDIES
A candidate for honors in Africana Studies must maintain at least a B+ average in the concentration and be
admitted to candidacy by the program faculty. In addition to the five courses normally required for the concentra-
tion, an honors candidate will enroll in either AFR 491 or 492 plus a Winter Study in his or her senior year, in
order to complete a substantial written thesis or an equivalent project in the performing or studio arts. A student
wishing to become a candidate for honors in Africana Studies should secure a faculty sponsor and inform the
program chair in writing before spring registration of her/his junior year.
An honors project should demonstrate creativity, depth, and intellectual rigor. A candidate for honors is en-
couraged to pursue non-traditional projects, such as presentations in the performing arts, visual arts, or creative
writing, as well as more conventional research projects. The advisor will evaluate the honors project, and the
program faculty will then decide whether to confer honors.
STUDY ABROAD
The curricular impact on potential majors of studying abroad in the junior year would be positive if students
chose to study in countries that reflect the Africana diaspora.

AFR 200(F) Introduction to Africana Studies*
This team-taught course serves as an introduction to Africana studies and interrogates this interdisciplinary field
of inquiry. It is required for concentrators but open to all students. We will examine the representation, arts and
culture, political activism, and history of black peoples in the United States, Caribbean, Latin America, and Afri-
ca. In addition to drawing upon key historical, literary and theoretical texts in Africana Studies, the class will
incorporate lectures from core and affiliated faculty to address issues such as the black arts movement and Afri-
cana music; democracy and captivity in the United States; feminism, gender, and sexuality; black radicalism in
the Americas; and identity, class, and race in Latin America and the Caribbean. Accompanying texts will include
documentary and feature films, essays, novels, and critical and theoretical studies.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based upon two 4- to 6-page papers, 2 exams, and a final project.

AFR 222(F) Rhythm and Jazz in America, Brazil and Cuba (Same as Latina/o Studies 221 and
Music 220)*
It is commonly thought that the three primary elements of music are melody, harmony and rhythm. In this course
rhythm is taught as the most significant among these in defining American, Afro-Cuban and Brazilian Jazz. Us-
ing recordings, in-class performance, and historical, theoretical texts on Brazilian Samba, Latin Music, from bos-
sa nova to salsa, and biographies of key artists such as Jelly Roll Morton, Louis Armstrong, Caetano Veloso, this
class examines the rhythmic basis of various genres, the relation of each to their African roots, as well as the
cultural influences and artists that helped to create them. In-class professional demonstrations of the musical
styles being studied will be an important component of this course.
Format: lecture/discussion/performance. Requirements: two 8- to 10-page research papers; basic analysis assign-
ments of musical compositions; attendance at all classes; class participation. Those with appropriate performance
skills have the option of substituting a performance accompanied by a two-page description for one of the two

AFR 285(S) Religion in Black Film and Literature (Same as Comparative Literature 285,
English 285 and Religion 229)*
Debates regarding religious beliefs and practices recur throughout the history of African-American film and lit-
erature. In this course, we will analyze the complicated role of religion, particularly Christianity, in black com-
munities. Our texts were created during or about slavery, the Great Migration, the U.S. Civil Rights Movement,
and the Post Civil Rights Era. We will consider such issues as ways in which religion is shown to empower
and/or oppress black people; ways in which the politics of class, gender, and sexuality inflect black religious
practices; and strategies by which transcendent, spiritual experiences are represented. Films to be analyzed may
include: Spencer Williams'The Blood of Jesus; Stan Lathan'sGo Tell it on the Mountain; Spike Lee'sFour Little
Girls; Julie Dash's Daughters of the Dust; and T.D. Jakes' Woman Thou Art Loosed. We will discuss images of
black church life in the media, and texts by Alice Walker, Melba P. Beals, James Baldwin, Zora Neale Hurston,
and Ernest Gaines.
Format: seminar/discussion. Requirements: active participation in class discussions, brief written responses to
texts, and four 5- to 7-page essays.
No prerequisites, but prior 100- or 200-level Africana Studies and English courses will help.Enrollment limit: 20

memoirs to investigate the different ways in which African-American men's and women's life narratives are
Africana Studies
­ 48 ­
constructed. In particular, we will consider the impact of historical events and processes upon identities, the ways
identities are performed, and the mutually constitutive relationship among race, gender, and sexuality. Films to be
analyzed may include: Steve James' Hoop Dreams; Marlon Riggs' Tongues Untied; June Cross's Secret Daugh-
ter; Cheryl Dunye's Watermelon Woman; and Elia Kazan's Pinky. Some class time will also be spent in the Wil-
liams College Museum of Art to critique visual works in terms of identity construction.
Readings may include selections by Anne Moody, Richard Wright, Rosemary L. Bray, James Weldon Johnson,
and June Jordan.
Format: seminar/discussion. Requirements: Consistent participation in class discussions, brief written responses
to texts, and four 5- to 7-page essays.

AFR 400(S) Race, Gender, Space (Same as Comparative Literature 369, English 365, and
Women's and Gender Studies 400)*
Physical or symbolic manipulation of space is one mode through which power operates, one manner in which
power is exercised and experienced. Historically and currently, space has been divided and resources have been
unevenly distributed along numerous axes. Thus, we are left with a constellation of dubiously constructed but
nonetheless segregated spaces: public vs. private, male vs. female, white vs. black, native vs. immigrant, rich vs.
poor, Christian vs. heathen (even Protestant vs. Catholic), and straight vs. queer sexuality. In this senior seminar,
we will examine the ways in which power is enacted, experienced, and resisted through space. In particular, we
will investigate the role of space in the creation of raced and gendered identities. Also, because the political and
social manipulation of space is not the exclusive prerogative of the empowered, we will consider ways that re-
sisting communities have sought to negotiate, redesign, or redefine space-or even transgress constrictive physical
or social boundaries. Finally, we will inquire into the complex politics involved in attempts to establish alterna-
tive spaces of relative autonomy beyond the rules or the space of dominant culture. Likely texts will likely in-
clude but are not limited to: Henri LeFebvre's The Production of Space, David Harvey's The Condition of Post-
modernity, Doreen Massey's Space, Place, and Gender, Don Mitchell's Cultural Geography: A Critical
Introduction, Toni Morrison's Paradise, Phanswane Mpe's Welcome to Our Hillbrow, Ralph Ellison's Invisible
Man, Wicomb's You Can't Get Lost in Cape Town.
Format: seminar. Evaluations will be based upon: attendance and class discussion, regular short writing assign-
ments, presentations, final projects, and one seminar paper. Enrollment limit: 14 (expected: 14). This seminar is
open to all seniors, but priority will be given to Africana Studies concentrators.

AFR 403(F) Women Writing Africa (Same as Comparative Literature 361, English 364 and
Women's and Gender Studies 364) (W)*
This course will serve as an introductory survey of contemporary African literature writing by women. Predomi-
nantly (but not exclusively) penned in English, this sub-Saharan literature feature various traditions, geographical
terrains, historical moments, social conundrums, and political relationships. Reading these texts together will
help us think through a variety of questions, including: On what basis, if at all, is it possible to conceive of an
international African women's literary tradition? Towards which experiences or themes have some African writ-
ers gravitated in their writing? How have female authors responded to or diverged from their male counterparts?
And how have they embraced or critiqued tradition in the face of colonial patriarchy? What "constructions" of
Africa (or specific African countries) have they helped produce through in and their literatures? What visions of
the colonial past, or of a postcolonial future, do they help us imagine, and why? Texts will likely include novels,
short stories, and poetry by Buchi Emecheta, Ama Ata Aidoo, Miriama Bâ, Tsitsi Dangarembga, Yvette Chris-
tiansë, Zoë Wicomb, Bessie Head, Chimamanda Adichie, Yvonne Vera, and Calixthe Beyala. We will also draw
upon secondary essays in African feminism and gender studies.
Format: seminar. Evaluations will be based upon: attendance and participation, regular short writing assign-
ments, one class presentation, one mid-term, and one final research paper. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19).

AFR 404(S) Imagining Africa: The Politics of Representation (Same as Comparative
Literature 347 and English 348) (W)*
This course will examine cultural representations of Africa in an effort to sharpen critical thinking and interpre-
tive skills. Taking"Africa" as our focal point, we will collectively consider key questions about representations:
Who has the authority to define an "object" (i.e., Africa or Africans), and how is that authority conferred? What
motivates particular images and, more importantly, what are their effects? What role do particular assumptions or
constructions of race play in shaping culture? What is the relationship between a"simple" book or image and "the
real world"? And what, finally, does it mean to make claims about an entire continent? Our primary source mate-
rial may include travel narratives, novels, journalism, and films that variously represent Africa. Along with some
theoretical essays on representation (including some by Stuart Hall, Roland Barthes, and W.J.T. Mitchell), prima-
ry texts may include Conrad's Heart of Darkness, Achebe's Things Fall Apart, Dangarembga's Nervous Condi-
tions, The Gods Must Be Crazy, Out of Africa, Guelwaar, Nightline's report "Heart of Darkness," the documen-
taryAmandla!, andphotographs of Darfur. Class will consist of lively class discussions and revision workshops.
Format: seminar. Assignments will include regular one-page writing assignments, one final project, and two for-
mal essays. Enrollment limit: 16 (expected: 16). Preference given to Africana Studies concentrators. This course

dary source literature on the life and times of Malcolm X; the FBI surveillance and documents related to
the subject's 1965 assassination; and audio taped and video taped interviews with Malcolm X's associ-
ates, friends and enemies; the forensic evidence indication how and why Malcolm was killed, and who
was ultimately responsible for his murder. The students will have available to them hundreds of newspa-
per articles, rare documents and other evidence to construct their own distinct interpretations of the en-
during legacy of Malcolm X in American life and history.
Format: seminar. Evaluations will be based upon class participation and attendance, regular short writ-

GENERAL PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The American Studies Program, an eleven-course major, uses interdisciplinary approaches to develop stu-
dents' understanding of the complexity of the culture(s) usually labeled "American." Examining history, litera-
ture, visual media, performance, and other forms of expression, we explore the processes of cultural definition as
contested by diverse individuals and groups. We ask new questions about aspects of American life long taken for
granted; we also use American culture as a laboratory for testing classic and contemporary theories about how
cultures work.
NON-MAJORS, FIRST-YEAR STUDENTS, AND SOPHOMORES
American Studies 201 is open to non-majors including first-year students. All elective courses are open to
students who meet the requirements of the departments that sponsor those courses. Courses designated as junior
or senior seminars are open to non-majors with permission of the instructor.
RATIONALE FOR COURSE NUMBERING
In addition to an occasional 100-level topical course, the introductory course is offered at the 200 level to
suggest the desirability of some preliminary training in college-level history, literature, sociology, or political sci-
American Studies
­ 50 ­
ence. The intermediate courses, designated as Junior Seminars at the 300 level, are offered primarily for juniors,
although they are open to sophomores who have had 201 and will be away from campus during the spring of
their junior year. 400 level courses designated as Senior Seminars are designed for senior majors.
THE MAJOR
Required major courses:
American Studies 201
300 level courses designated Junior Seminar
400 level courses designated Senior Seminar
Elective courses:
Eight courses: five should be chosen from one of the specializations listed below, the other three chosen
from among any of the electives listed, but students must draw their remaining courses from two of the
other specializations. Students are also required to take at least one course covering pre-1900 American
history or culture.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN AMERICAN STUDIES
Candidates for honors in American Studies will undertake a substantial, year-long independent project during
their Senior year. Applicants should have a consistent record of high achievement in courses taken for the major,
and normally will have done work in the field of study of their proposed thesis. Students who wish to write or
produce an honors project should consult with a prospective faculty advisor in their junior year. Formal applica-
tion to pursue honors should be made by the time of spring registration in the junior year. Students must submit a
1- to 2-page preliminary proposal describing the proposed project to the Chair of the American Studies Program
at this time. Final admission to the honors thesis program will depend on the AMST advisory committee's as-
sessment of the qualifications of the student and the merits and feasibility of the project. If the proposal is ap-
proved, they will be permitted to register for AMST 491, W30, and AMST 492 the following year. The com-
pleted project is due in mid-April. Each student will present a short oral presentation of his or her thesis at the end
of spring semester. Honors Theses count as one of the eleven courses required for the major.
ADVISING
All majors will be assigned a faculty advisor. Majors must meet with their advisor during the first week of
classes during the fall semester and at the time of the spring semester registration period in order to have their
courses and plans for the American Studies major approved. Both majors and non- majors are encouraged to talk
at any time with the program chair or other affiliated faculty about the major.
AMERICAN STUDIES AND OTHER PROGRAMS
Students majoring in American Studies are encouraged to consider pursuing concentrations in Africana Stud-
ies, Environmental Studies, Latina/o Studies, Performance Studies, and Women's and Gender Studies. Many of
the courses counted for those concentrations may also earn credit toward the American Studies major.
STUDY AWAY FROM WILLIAMS
We encourage students to pursue cross-cultural comparative studies. A major in American Studies can be
combined with study away from Williams for a semester or a year if plans are made carefully. Many courses that
will be approved for College credit may also count toward the American Studies major if their subject matter is
American culture.
Students planning to be away in the junior year should have taken American Studies 201 before they leave;
those away for junior-year spring term should take a Junior Seminar in their sophomore year. Students should
consult as early as possible with the chair or their advisor about their plans for fulfilling the requirements of the
major.
AMST 101(F) Artists Respond to Contemporary Events (Same as ArtS 101)
(See under ARTS 101 for full description.)
AMST 201(F,S) Introduction to American Studies
To be an "American" means something more than U.S. citizenship. In this course, we focus on the problems and
possibilities of American identity. Access to Americanness is shaped by factors such as class, race, ethnicity,
gender, sexuality, religion, and region--categories which themselves change in meaning over time. Given the
geographical, racial, and cultural diversity of the United States, the ways in which Americans imagine nation
inevitably vary over time, according to place, and among different individuals and groups. Rather than a survey
of any one aspect or period of American history, literature, or popular culture, this course is an introduction to the
interdisciplinary field of American Studies, a field defined both by the range of texts we read (essays, novels,
autobiographies, photographs, films, music, architecture, historical documents, legal texts), and by the questions
we ask of them: How have different Americans imagined what it means to be an American? What ideas about
national history, patriotism, and moral character shape their visions of Americanness? How do the educational
system, mass media, government policies regarding citizenship and immigration shape American identities?
How are boundaries of inclusion and exclusion in the nation drawn? What uses have been made of the claim to
an American identity, and what is at stake in that claim? How have Americans imagined a national landscape, a
national culture, and to what ends?
Format: discussion. Evaluation will be based on a series of short critical essays and a group project.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 25 per section (expected: 25 per section). Preference given to sophomores
and first-year students with AP 5 in U.S. History. One section in the fall; one section in the spring.

This course examines a sampling of Asian American texts from the late nineteenth century to the present and
contextualizes them historically. Produced by writers from various Asian American groups and in a variety of
styles, these works by such writers as Maxine Hong Kingston, Jose Garcia Villa, Younghill Kang, Hisaye Yama-
moto, and Linh Dinh, provide a sense of heterogeneity of Asian American literature. They also force us to ex-
amine the intersections, material and psychic, of historical events/larger structural forces with individuals and
groups. Our readings will prod us to call into question assumptions we make about what is "Asian American"
but also, crucially, what is "American." Both domestic issues (e.g., American politics, racism, links with other
minority groups) and global considerations (e.g., U.S. immigration and foreign policies, the three wars with
Asian countries in the last century)-and how they have shaped Asian American histories and literatures-will fig-
ure importantly in our discussions.

AMST 302(F) American Utopias (Junior Seminar)
"The world is now too dangerous for anything less than Utopia," wrote Buckminster Fuller in the wake of
WWII. Since the nation's founding Americans have aspired toward a "promised land" or "good life" just beyond
the reach of the real world. This junior seminar will focus on utopian thinking, social practices and expressive
arts. Reading in the fields of religion, literature, art, urban planning, music, education, film and sociology, we will
consider the needs that give rise to utopian visions and the strategies people have used to realize these imagined
worlds. How may we account for the failures and successes of such experiments? Among other topics, we will
look at the nation-long history of millenarianism, culminating in Tim LaHaye's Left Behind novels, best-selling
Christian literature of the rapture and apocalypse. The class will take trips to sites of historical utopian communi-
ties and contemporary intentional communities. Authors include Marx, Ann Lee, Thoreau, Wells-Barnett, Bella-
my, Gilman, Garvey, Fuller, Samuel Delaney, David Harvey and Touré.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based up class participation and written assignments (including two 5-page
papers and one 10- to 12-page final essay).

AMST 305(S) Cities of the Anglophone Chinese Imagination (Same as Asian Studies 305,
Comparative Literature 303 and English 374)*
The recent fascination with all things "diasporic," "global," "transnational," and "cosmopolitan" has shifted the
emphasis away from conceiving of ethnic literatures solely, or primarily, as sub-categories of national literatures.
A focus on "horizontal" rather than "vertical" ties re-frames our thinking about minority literature while also
raising new issues. For example, what exactly is shared by subjects in a given diaspora? Does the term "diaspo-
ra" necessarily invoke the specter of racial essentialism? What happens to the category of race when one moves
away from local politics? Is the idea of a diasporic subject much less vexing than the idea of, say, a racially
minoritized person? How important a role does the shared English language play in these diasporas? In this
course, we will look at the works of a specific diasporic literary group--English-language Chinese writers (in
this case, Chiang Yee, Louis Chu, Chuang Hua , Evelyn Lau, Shirley G. Lim, Pamela Lu, Alvin Lu, Timothy
Mo, Fred Wah, Ouyang Yu)--as a means to think about the nature of the "diasporic" and the "global." We will
focus on two types of sites: 1) geographic--mostly cities and urban areas: San Francisco, NYC, Taipei, Mel-
bourne, Kuala Lumpur, London, Vancouver, etc.--which function as material spaces and places of the imagina-
tion, and 2) linguistic--i.e., the space of the English language.
Format: discussion seminar. Evaluation will be based on one 5- to 7-page paper, one 8- to 10-page paper, short
response papers, participation.

Writing (Same as Comparative Literature 375 and English 375) (Senior Seminar)*
Critics reading minority writing often focus on its thematic--i.e., sociological-content. Such literature is usually
presumed to be inseparable from the "identity"/body of the writer and read as autobiographical, ethnographic,
representational, exotic. At the other end of the spectrum, avant-garde writing is seen to concern itself "purely"
with formal questions, divorced from the socio-historical (and certainly not sullied by the taint of race). In the
critical realm we currently inhabit, in which "race" is opposed to the "avant-garde," an experimental minority
writer can indeed seem an oxymoron. In this class we will closely read recent work by Asian American, African
American, Native American and Latino/a writers which challenges preconceptions about ethnic literature, avant-
American Studies

garde writing, genre categorization, among other things. The writing done by these mostly young, mostly urban,
poets and fiction writers is some of the most exciting being written in the United States today; their texts push the
boundaries of aesthetic form while simultaneously engaging questions of culture, politics, and history. Reading
them forces us to re-think our received notions about literature. Authors to be read include Renee Gladman, John
Keene, Ed Roberson, Amiri Baraka, Linh Dinh, Bhanu Kapil, Charles Yu, Paola Javier, James Thomas Stevens,
and Edwin Torres.

SPECIALIZATION FIELDS
To provide focus for work in the major, each student will choose one of the Specialization Fields listed below
and record this choice when registering for the major. (This commitment can be revised, in consultation with the
chair.) At least five electives will be taken from among those designated to support a specialization field. In ex-
traordinary cases, students who wish to do so may be permitted to design their own specialization field. All such
arrangements must be approved by the American Studies Advisory Committee.
ARTS IN CONTEXT
This specialization is for students interested in American arts, literature and media. Its approaches are interdis-
ciplinary: it trains students to examine cultural artifacts with attention to aesthetic form and to the contexts--his-
torical, social, political--that determine and situate those forms. Broadly, it asks how history has shaped the arts
and media and how the arts and media have shaped how we think and who we are. Students in this specialization
take courses across a range of genres and media: poetry, fiction, music, film and video, pop culture, visual cul-
ture, performance, experimental and activist art.

COMPARATIVE STUDIES IN RACE, ETHNICITY, AND DIASPORA
This interdisciplinary specialization examines the role of race, ethnicity, and diasporic movements in the
construction of American identities. Students explore how experiences and concepts of race and ethnicity are
transformed through the processes of diaspora and immigration. These courses may encompass a broad spec-
trum of fields such as history, literature, religion, politics, anthropology, gender studies, media and the perform-
ing arts, among others. NOTE: Concentrators in this area are required to take a combination of courses that will
allow them to comparatively assess the experiences of at least two ethno-racial groups in the Americas.

CRITICAL AND CULTURAL THEORY
Critical and cultural theory is for students who want their American Studies work to combine philosophy,
aesthetics, and social thought. Its approach is methodological, conceptual, and problem-driven. Students com-
bine courses in feminist theory, anti-imperial and postcolonial theory, literary theory, critical race theory, queer
theory, psychoanalysis, Marxism, and other counter-traditions in political theory and philosophy.

The Department of Anthropology and Sociology at Williams aims to help students achieve an integrated un-
derstanding of biography, history, culture, and social structure in both traditional and modern societies.
Anthropology explores the full range of human experience by introducing students to the study of tribal and
peasant societies, especially those on the periphery of the West, as well as to the cultural complexities of strati-
fied, industrial societies such as our own. Integrated with the study of specific peoples is an examination of the
various analytical schemes anthropologists have developed to understand them. Courses offered in the depart-
ment represent two of Anthropology's major subfields: sociocultural anthropology--that is, the comparative
study of human social life, institutions, and beliefs--and archaeology, the study of the origins and lifeways of
prehistoric peoples.
Sociology studies the social and institutional intricacies of modern industrial societies and the social psycho-
logical dilemmas facing the individual in our epoch. Sociology courses introduce students to classical and con-
temporary social thought about men and women and society, to the systematic analysis of social institutions and
social interaction, and to the social analysis of modern culture. The Sociology major at Williams emphasizes the
humanistic tradition of sociology, stressing qualitative approaches to understanding how social reality is
constructed.
MAJORS
The department offers separate majors in both Anthropology and Sociology, with a broad and diverse array of
courses in both disciplines. The department is committed, however, to the unity of the social sciences. To this
end, Anthropology and Sociology offer joint core courses in methodology and theory, as well as several elective
courses in common. All joint courses are designated "ANSO."
Requirements
For the degree in Anthropology or Sociology, students must complete a minimum of nine courses as outlined
below:
Anthropology and Sociology
­ 57 ­
(1) Core Courses. Majors in both disciplines must take a sequence of four core courses. Three of these are
joint (ANSO) courses. The sequences are:
Anthropology Joint (ANSO) Sociology
ANTH 101 The Scope SOC 101 Invitation to
of Anthropology Sociology
ANSO 205
Ways of Knowing
ANSO 305
Social Theory
ANSO 402
Senior Seminar
(2) Elective Courses. Majors in Anthropology or Sociology must take five elective courses from the course
listings of their respective disciplines or from the joint ANSO listings. Two of the courses chosen are nor-
mally at the 300 level or above. In close consultation with their departmental advisors, students may take
some selected courses from other disciplines to fulfill major requirements in either Anthropology or So-
ciology.
(3) Majors in each wing of the department are allowed to count up to two courses in the other wing towards
fulfillment of their major requirements.
STATISTICS AND DATA ANALYSIS
In addition to the nine total courses required for the major, it is recommended that Anthropology and Sociolo-
gy majors take Statistics 101 or a comparable course in statistics and data analysis.
AREA STUDIES CONCENTRATION
Students who wish to combine a major in Anthropology or Sociology with an Area Studies concentration are
encouraged to do so. Courses taken to satisfy an Area Studies requirement may be counted toward the major
with prior approval of a student's departmental advisor. The only exception to this rule is the Area Studies senior
seminar, which cannot ordinarily be counted toward the Anthropology or Sociology degree.
LANGUAGE STUDY, STUDY ABROAD, AND WINTER STUDY
Departmental advisors will help interested students integrate a major with study abroad, foreign language
study, or field research during the winter study period. The department encourages Williams students to take
advantage of established foreign study programs in Egypt, Japan, India, Hong Kong, and other countries. Be-
cause some foreign study programs do not offer courses that can be counted toward the Anthropology or Sociol-
ogy degrees, however, sophomores planning to study abroad in junior year must consult with the departmental
advisor before declaring a major.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN ANTHROPOLOGY OR SOCIOLOGY
Honors and highest honors are normally awarded for the completion of a year-long research project that has
resulted in an original thesis of high quality. Students wishing to write an honors thesis should engage a member
of the department faculty as a Thesis Advisor as soon as possible and must submit a proposal for the thesis for
department approvalno laterthan preregistration in the spring of the junior year. If the proposal is approved, they
will be permitted to register for Anthropology and Sociology 493-W31-494, during which they will write and
defend a thesis. If their overall work in the major continues to be of high quality and the thesis is deemed of a
similar quality, they may be awarded honors or highest honors in Anthropology or Sociology.
ANTHROPOLOGY / SOCIOLOGY COURSES
JOINT CORE COURSES
ANSO 205(S) Ways of Knowing
An exploration of how one makes sense of the social world through fieldwork. Some of the key questions of the
course are: What are the philosophical and epistemological underpinnings of social inquiry? How does one
frame intellectual problems and go about collecting, sifting, and assessing field materials? What are the uses and
limits of statistical data? What is the importance of history to sociological and anthropological research? How
can one use archival and other documentary materials to enrich ethnographic research? What are the empirical
limits to interpretation? What is the relationship between empirical data and the generation of social theory? How
does the social organization of social research affect one's inquiry? What are the typical ethical dilemmas of
fieldwork and of other kinds of social research? How do researchers' personal biographies and values shape their
work? We will approach these problems concretely rather than abstractly through a series of case studies of how
men and women in the world of affairs, ranging from detectives, prosecutors, epidemiologists, and corporate
lawyers, make sense of their worlds in order to act responsibly. We will also draw upon the field experiences of
departmental faculty in settings as diverse as the jungles of Guatemala and Peru, the mountains of Sumbawa,
Gujarat, the seat of ongoing communal violence in west India, Afghan refugee camps, Russian kitchens, the halls
of Congress, big city police departments and district attorney offices, corporate offices on Madison Avenue and
Wall Street, and criminal drug courts across America and the United Kingdom. There will also be some practical
training in basic field methods, census and survey interpretation, and archival research.
Format: seminar. Requirements: a series of short papers and a final exam.
Prerequisites: Anthropology 101 or Sociology 101 or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 25 (expected:
20).

ANSO 305(F) Social Theory
An introduction to social theory in anthropology and sociology, with strong emphasis on enduring works by
major thinkers--Marx, Weber, Durkheim, and Freud, among others--who have shaped views of society in the
West and beyond. Several key questions inform exploration of these works: What are the historical roots and
principal attributes of modernity? From the perspective of modernity, how do social theorists understand "the
primitive"? Do society and culture have organizing rules? What role does human agency play in the unfolding of
social life? What are the possibilities and limits of scientific approaches to the study of human social experience?
In considering such questions, we will reconstruct the intellectual and social histories of both disciplines, examin-
ing in particular how they abandoned common ground and language, with sociologists gravitating toward para-
digms of scientific predictability and anthropologists toward relativistic frameworks of interpretation. Finally, we
will examine the migration of ideas from anthropology and sociology to other disciplines and back again. The
course emphasizes major differences between interpretive frameworks as well as common elements that contrib-
ute to a deeper understanding of the social world.
Format: seminar. Requirements: three 5- to 7-page essays.
Prerequisites: Anthropology 101 or Sociology 101 and ANSO 205 or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit:
25 (expected: 15).
Hour: 8:30-9:45 TR M. F. BROWN
ANSO 402(S) Senior Seminar (Same as Anthropology 402 and Sociology 402)
This capstone seminar combines intensive discussion and individual research. The first half of the semester will
be dedicated to the discussion of a social issue central to the concerns of both anthropology and sociology. The
class will meet with the instructor in spring 2007 to decide on that topic. Then, in the second half of the semester,
students will pursue independent, original projects and produce a major term paper. Toward the end of the se-
mester, students will present their projects to the seminar. Students who are not senior majors in anthropology or
sociology are admitted to this course only on the instructor's permission.
Format: seminar. Requirements: full participation, major research project and paper, class presentation.
Prerequisites: senior Anthropology and Sociology majors or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 18 (ex-
pected: 15).
Hour: 1:10-2:25 MR JUST
ANTHROPOLOGY COURSES
ANTH 101(F,S) The Scope of Anthropology*
Is there such a thing as "human nature"? Why have human societies developed such a bewildering range of
customs to deal with problems common to people everywhere? This course addresses these questions by
introducing students to the comparative study of human social life and culture. Topics surveyed in the course
include economics, language and thought, kinship and marriage, law and politics, and the wide variations in
human belief systems, including religions. The course also considers the ways that anthropology, a discipline that
was until recently practiced almost exclusively by Westerners, approaches other societies in search of insights on
our own customs and values. Ethnographic descriptions of both "simple" tribal societies and complex modern
ones are a prominent part of the readings.
Format: lecture/discussion of case studies and ethnographic films. Requirements: two short essays, a final ex-
amination and class participation.
Enrollment limit: 30 (expected: 30). Preference given to first-year students and sophomores.
Hour: 11:00-12:15 MWF First Semester: JUST
1:10-2:25 TF Second Semester: M. F. BROWN
ANTH 102(S) Human Evolution: Down From the Trees, Out to the Stars (Same as
Environmental Studies 106)
One important way of understanding what it means to be a human being is to see humankind as an evolving
biological species. This course traces the story of our evolution, in terms of both the fossil evidence of our ana-
tomical evolution and the archaeological, primatological, and conjectural evidence for the evolution of human
behavior. We will trace five million years of human (and near-human) history as our ancestors are transformed
from creatures of the forest canopy to upright scavengers of the African plains, to the fire-using species that burst
out of Africa and spread across the globe, to the cold-adapted Neanderthals, to the anatomically modern humans
whose ability to manipulate symbolic communication has placed footprints on the moon while bringing us to the
verge of self-destruction.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: research paper, two quizzes, two exams, group presentations.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 40 (expected: 30). Preference will be given to first- and second-year students.

ANTH 205(F) Language in Culture and Society (Same as Linguistics 270)
Language is one of the most important, if not the most important, feature of our species Homo sapiens. This
course examines the relationships between language, culture, and society across a variety of different speech
communities. After learning some basic concepts, we will consider how people use language to establish identi-
ties and negotiate social interactions, and how individuals use language to understand the world in culturally
specific ways. We will also learn about some of the methods that linguistic anthropologists use in their research,

ANTH 214(F) The Rise and Fall of Civilizations (Same as Environmental Studies 224)*
Over the centuries, philosophers and historians have asked how societies evolved from simple hunter-gatherer
bands to complex urban civilizations? Human prehistory and history have shown the repeated cycles of the rise,
expansion and collapse of early civilizations in both the Old and New World. What do the similarities and differ-
ences in the development of these first civilizations tell us about the nature of societal change, civilization and the
state, and human society itself? The course will examine these issues through an introductory survey of the earli-
est civilizations in Mesopotamia, Egypt, India, Mesoamerica and South America. Classical and modern theories
on the nature, origin, and development of the state will be reviewed in light of the archaeological evidence.
Format: lecture/film/class discussion. Requirements: midterm, final exam, and paper.

ANTH 225(F) Visible Culture: Documentary and Nonfiction (Same as English 303)*
This course examines the potential of moving images to reveal aspects of culture normally obscured by the writ-
ten word. We will consider both the theory and practice of documentary film from its inception around 1900 to
the present, paying particular attention to the way documentary filmmakers have approached the representation
of social reality in Western and non-Western cultural settings. Questions that we will consider include: What is
the relationship between written text and image, or between image and story? What is the role of film in an-
thropology? What counts as a document?
Team-taught, through a mixture of lectures and discussions. Course requirement: Regular attendance at film
screenings and active class participation. Students will write a 5-page paper on an assigned topic and a 12- to
15-page final paper. There will be a self-scheduled take-home final.
Enrollment limit: 30 (expected: 30). Preference given to Anthropology/Sociology majors, then to sophomores,
and finally to first-year students.

ANTH 233(S) Spiritual Crossroads: Religious Life in Southeast Asia (Same as Asian Studies 233
and Religion 249)*
No region of the world presents a richer tapestry of religious beliefs, practices, and institutions than Southeast
Asia. Buddhism, Hinduism, Christianity and Islam are all to be found and all of them interpenetrate and contend
with each other and with a deep undergirding of animism, shamanism, and mystical folk belief systems. This
course will survey these religious traditions through time and space, looking in particular at the growing tension
between religion and the state as fundamentalism and religious militancy have spread into the region in recent
times. All of Southeast Asia will be covered, but particular attention will be devoted to Indonesia, where religious
blending and the growth of new fundamentalism are both especially marked.
Format: seminar. Requirements: mid-term, short essays, term paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 15). Open to non-majors.
Hour: 11:00-12:15 MWF JUST
ANTH 243T(F) Dilemmas of Humanitarian Intervention (W)
This course will explore the promises, realities, and implications of humanitarian interventions, including relief
operations, national reconstruction projects, and peacekeeping missions. People in the affluent nations of West-
ern Europe and North America contribute billions of dollars each year in response to solicitations promising to
relieve the suffering of victims of natural disaster, political strife, ethnic cleansing, and refugee crises. Western
governments send thousands of troops to war-torn nations in order to "keep the peace." However, all too often
these efforts go awry and contribute in direct and indirect ways to the natural, economic, and political destruction
already visited upon these countries. This course will consider the reasons and ways in which often well-inten-
tioned actions to relieve the suffering of others go wrong, and ways in which current efforts might be improved.
The course will begin with a consideration of the philosophical, ethical, and social underpinnings of humanitari-
anism, and then examine several classic anthropological studies, including Marcel Mauss's The Gift, which pro-
vide the ground for considering humanitarianism in a more socially nuanced manner. The majority of the course
will focus on specific case studies or relief, reconstruction, and peacekeeping operations, including famine relief
in sub-Saharan Africa, peacekeeping in the Balkans, and reconstruction programs in Afghanistan. In addition,
Anthropology and Sociology
­ 60 ­
we will look in depth at the work of one or more aid organizations.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: 5-page essays and response papers due each week. During the final two weeks
of the semester, students will work on 12- to 15-page research papers, submitting rough drafts for in-class review
during the second to last week and final drafts the last week of classes.
Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). The class is open to sophomores, juniors, and seniors.
Tutorial meetings to be arranged. D. EDWARDS
ANTH 252(F) Cultures and Societies of Sub-Saharan Africa (Same as Africana Studies 252)*
This course explores the diversity and vitality of contemporary sub-Saharan African cultures and societies
through the lens of four major themes. We will study the enduring importance and flexibility of African systems
of kinship and marriage; the innovative patterns of economic production and consumption that characterize alter-
native economies; and power, authority, and conflict in African polities. Finally, we will examine how mobility
and migration--forced or voluntary, temporary or permanent--have shaped African identities and communities.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: Quiz, two 5- to 7-page papers, take home final
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 25 (expected: 20). Open to all classes, but preference given to first and sec-
ond years, and Anthropology or Sociology majors.
Hour: 2:35-3:50 MR HAUGH
ANTH 253(S) Popular Culture in Africa (Same as Africana Studies 253)*
This course focuses on forms of popular culture produced and circulated by amateur and professional artists,
musicians, writers, and performers in Africa. We will study these genres as forms of entertainment and artistic
expression, but more importantly as efforts to make sense of the world, offer critical commentaries, construct
social identities, and take political action. In addition to developing a theoretical understanding of popular culture,
we will address themes such as gender, ethnicity and nationality, wealth and power, globalization, protest and
resistance, and war.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: Quiz, midterm, short review paper, 8- to 10-page research paper, pre-
sentation

ANTH 321(F) Visualizing Health and Illness: Medical Ways of Knowing
As patients, practitioners, kinfolk, sufferers and caretakers, we learn to see signs of life, death, illness and healing
in the self and others. Culture, technology, and the social norms through which we ascribe wellness shape how,
when, and where we see and interpret the body as in a state of health or illness. This class explores the visual
culture of medicine and the techniques through which we learn to see and be seen medically. Sight is but one
sense through which health and illness are perceived. Our analysis will consider the relationship of vision to other
perceptual modes: how do we smell, feel, taste, and hear health? Good's Medicine, Rationality and Experience,
Foucault's Birth of the Clinic, and Crary's Techniques of the Observer will serve as theoretical frameworks
through which to understand the role of sight, seeing, and visual technology in anthropological monographs and
film on life, health, and illness. Case studies include but are not limited to the arrangement of the Victorian sick-
room; death and dying among the Yolmo of Nepal; brain scan technology and its relationship to personhood; the
iconography of madness, depression and mania; the establishing of visual regimes that perceive difference across
gender and race; and fetal imaging and its shifting nature over time.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: participation, student presentations, one 7- to 8-page paper, a take-
home essay midterm, 15- to 20-page final research paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 30 (expected: 20). Open to all classes, but preference given to Anthropology
and Sociology Majors.

ANTH 324(S) Empires of Antiquity*
Cycles of rise and collapse of civilizations are common in our human past. Among the most fascinating cases are
those of empires, conquest civilizations, or states that encompass a number of different ethnicities, polities and
peoples. However, their rise and often rapid collapse begs an important question: how stable have empires been
in human prehistory? Are they intrinsically unstable political forms? The course will address these questions by
examining the major empires of the Old and New World in pre-modern history: Persian; Assyrian; Mongol;
Roman; Chinese; Ottoman; Aztec; and Inca empires. Using readings by political scientists, historians, epigraph-
ers, archaeologists and political anthropologists, we will consider the causes of the expansion and collapse of
these empires. We will also explore their sociopolitical and economic structures as mechanisms for their mainte-
nance in order to provide a cross-cultural comparison of the differential success and final decline of all these
empires.
Format: seminar. Requirements: weekly short response papers and a research paper, class presentation and par-

ANTH 365(S) Citizens and Civil Societies
Nationalist ideologies and political movements spread around the world from the eighteenth through the twen-
tieth centuries; in recent decades, the spread of democratic ideals and practices has been a key political develop-
ment. In this course, we will develop a theoretical understanding of citizenship and civil society as they relate to
the nation-state and to democracy. How do citizens and states define the rights and responsibilities of citizenship?
How are political boundaries between citizens and non-citizens negotiated in an era of economic globalization
and growing refugee populations? What kinds of organizations and networks comprise civil societies and public
spheres in different contexts, and how do they relate to the state? We will read ethnographic case studies from
Africa, Asia, and Eastern Europe, enabling us to compare and contrast the construction of citizenship and civil
society in these places with our own experience and understanding of these concepts in the Western American
world.

ANTH 370(S) Gender and Social Change in Modern Africa (Same as Women's and Gender

This course examines processes of change that have shaped the understandings of male and female in modern
Africa. It seeks to provide both the information and the conceptual tools necessary for an informed interpretation
of gender relations in contemporary African societies, drawing on a variety of sources, including popular media.
We will examine 19th- and 20th-century interactions of Africans and Europeans and the nature of colonial con-
quest, economic and social change during the colonial period, and the shaping of contemporary gender relations
within the context of post-colonial political and socioeconomic orders through a small number of in-depth stud-
ies of particular regions.

Environmental activists have been encouraged to "think globally, act locally." From an anthropological perspec-
tive, we also need to consider how people `think locally'--how people from different cultural backgrounds con-
ceptualize and interact with nature. We will focus on movements which mobilize around environmental issues in
the non-Western world, whether they involve the management of natural resources, the protection of human
health, or the preservation of species, ecosystems, or wilderness. We will also examine what happens when
people `act globally'--when people from different cultural backgrounds engage around the same physical envi-
ronment.

ANTH 391(F) Insurgencies: Revolts, Revolutions, Wars of National Liberation, and Jihads
(Same as History 391 and INTR 391)*
We often tend to think of warfare in the classic terms described by Clausewitz: states waging armed conflict
against other states using uniformed armed forces that are distinct from non-combatant civilian populations.
Throughout history, however, we may also encounter many instances of asymmetric conflict within states, colo-
nies, and other political entities, involving combatants who are often indistinguishable from the general popula-
tion and whose objectives are often unlike those of states: Peasant revolts, revolutions, wars of independence or
national liberation, and other forms of resistance and civil insurgency pit the relatively weak against the power of
the state and may succeed because, to use Mao's metaphor, the insurgents move among the people like fish in
water. The close relationship between insurgent fighters and the supporting population makes the social struc-
ture, social values, social institutions-in short, the culture-of the society particularly relevant to understanding the
nature of a given asymmetric conflict. In this course we will use theoretical and analytical concepts from an-
thropology, sociology, history, and political philosophy to examine asymmetric conflicts of the twentieth century
and the present day. The course will be divided into three parts: in the first we will explore some of the theoretical
literature on violence and warfare as well as some of the basic literature on tribal and peasant society, peasant
revolts, wars of national liberation, guerilla warfare, and insurgencies. The second part of the course will be de-
voted to presentations prepared by small groups of students on case studies, e.g., the Hukbalahap insurgency in
the Philippines, the communist revolutions of China, Cuba, and Malaysia, wars of national liberation such as
those in Algeria and Vietnam, and other ongoing civil conflicts such as the Palestinian intifadah and "ethnic
cleansing" in the Balkans. The final portion of the course is devoted to an in-depth study of Iraq following the
American invasion and to a consideration of the evolving nature of asymmetric conflict in a globalizing world.

An introduction to sociological analysis. The course focuses on the relationship of individual men and women to
the social world and introduces students to systematic institutional analysis. Students will explore the intersection
of biography, history, culture, and social structure as seen in the work of classical and contemporary social think-
ers, including Marx, Durkheim, Weber, Veblen, Simmel, and Goffman. Special consideration will be given to the
social and cultural problems of capitalism, rationality and irrationality in modern institutions and organizations,

SOC 202(S) Terrorism and National Security
An analysis of the roots, goals, and social organization of contemporary radical Islamist terrorism and of the state
efforts to defeat it. A focus on: the recruitment, training, and indoctrination of Islamist terrorists; their ideologies
and self-images; and case studies of specific terrorist attacks and the vulnerabilities of modern societies that such
attacks reveal. The course analyzes the exigencies and dilemmas of ensuring public safety in a democratic soci-
ety. Special attention to: the structure and ethos of intelligence work; the investigation of terrorist networks and
their financing; the relationship between organized and semi-organized crime and terrorism; the legal dilemmas
of surveillance, preemptive custody, and "extraordinary rendition" in democratic societies; and the technology
and organization of ascertaining identities in modern society. The course also addresses the crisis facing Euro-
pean societies-particularly the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Germany-with growing
populations of radical Islamist minorities who reject cultural assimilation into Western social or legal frame-
works, a crisis paralleled in the United States, with important differences, by widespread illegal immigration. An
assessment of the ideology of multiculturalism and its intended and unintended consequences in the fight against
terror. The course also examines the threat of terrorists' use of biological, chemical, and nuclear weapons of mass
destruction and the defenses against such threats. Finally, it appraises the structure and content of mass media
coverage of terrorism, as well as official and nonofficial propaganda on all sides of these issues. Experts in differ-
ent fields will give guest lectures throughout the course.

SOC 209(F) Social Stratification in a Changing World
This course is designed to explore, both theoretically and empirically, the theme of change in social structure and
inequalities in contemporary modern societies. One's position in social space determines one's consciousness,
identity, values, attitudes, interest, and behavior. While inequality is ubiquitous, there are cross-cultural variations
in the definition of status and consequent distribution of social conditions and opportunities among individuals.
In modern societies, social space and individual status are closely interconnected with the economic system, and
consecutively with the occupational structure and relations evolving from it. Currently, globalization and techno-
logical developments are rapidly transforming societies and patterns of inequality. In stable societies, changes in
the economic and social sphere are evolutionary in nature. However, these changes come at an accelerated pace
and are typically accompanied with initial chaos and turbulences in societies undergoing major systemic trans-
formation (or even revolution). These societies provide excellent opportunities to study social change and its
impact on social stratification. Therefore this course will also focus on the systemic transition from state social-
ism to market democracies in Central Europe since 1989 to examine the vicissitudes of social stratification in a
constantly changing world.

SOC 216(F) American Communities
There was a time when the human landscape was made up almost entirely of villages, bands, and other contained
communal units. These constitute the main chapter in human history. They are also the main chapter in American
social history. This is changing with the recent growth of cities, but city dwellers here and elsewhere seem to be
trying to find ways to recapture forms of communal life even in the most densely populated of urban centers. We
will consider the nature of community, drawing on the American experience as a case in point but occasionally
turning to other parts of the world.

SOC 218(S) Law and Modern Society
This class is designed to introduce students to the field of law and society. The course begins with an overview of
the various theoretical perspectives on the subject, including Durkheimian, Marxist, Foucauldian, and Weberian
analyses of law and society; as well as the work of those following in the different theoretical schools established
by these scholars. Informed by the theoretical overview, the next part of the course considers empirical research
in selected areas of law, including tort law, criminal trial procedures, abortion and divorce law, "community jus-
tice," and the adjudication of drug offenses. Recognizing that understandings of our own legal practices are en-
lightened through comparisons to other legal systems, the second half of the course is primarily historical/com-
parative in focus. In this section, through an exploration of several case studies, American legal processes and
habits are compared with related legal practices in such places as England, Scotland, Ireland, Australia, Germa-
ny, Norway, and Canada.

With British India representing one of the grandest projects of European colonization, this course will begin ex-
ploring such a complex undertaking by examining accounts of architectural innovation, the politics of antiquities,
town and urban planning, the urban spaces of commodity production, map-making and cartography, controver-
sies on `filth' and public hygiene, the emergence of religious processions, and representations of the city in ad-
vertising, in twentieth century South Asia. We will study and debate these accounts to understand how spaces for
the exercise of imperial forms of power emerged-and continue to do so. Because colonialism hoped to spread its
reach to other parts of the British empire from its seat of power in India, this course will also engage with debates
on world exhibitions and spectacles of `tradition' in Egypt, Indian Ocean communities, the metropolis of vice
and scandal, and linkages with contemporary cosmopolitanisms.

SOC 317(F) Media and Consumer Society
This course explores the complex and evolving interrelationship between media and consumption. First of all, it
will present the essential concepts that attempt to explain the cultural mechanisms through which certain objects
acquire symbolic meaning and desirability. These mechanisms are intrinsic to consumption, and the circulation
of commodity in the market, and are inherent products of the historical and cultural processes of industrial mo-
dernity. Over the past fifty years, media have taken over a dominant role as a consumer inspiration for life style
choices, and have accentuated social differentiation in the process. The increasing reach and impact of media,
especially through advertising, has created a new consumerism based on accelerated and uncritical demands.
This has resulted from unreal comparisons with unrealistic reference groups, and has caused great disruption to
the social order. Paradoxically, the more people submit to conspicuous consumption, the more individual dissat-
isfaction arises. To understand the context of the pervasive impact of the media, it is important to ask questions
such as who designs life styles, whether consumers are free to create their own tastes, or if they are free to refuse
to lead a lifestyle based on status enhancement by following fashion trends. Finally, the course will also look at
how globalization--greatly enhanced by media and technologies--shapes consumer practices in different parts
of the world.

What do terrorism and violence mean and how do we think of its perpetrators? This course will investi-

membered events. Participants will engage with relevant works in order to question and debate what ter-
rorism and violence mean and how these concepts are addressed by various disciplines in the social
sciences and humanities. Further, this course will investigate how representations of terrorism and vio-
lence are connected to the themes of: securing political power, collective resistance, community, and
international power relations. Crucially, the course seeks to enable participants to critically reflect upon
the publicly available perspectives on terrorism and violence. The course will encourage the interpreta-
tion, discussion, and writing on the following themes: `tradition' and religion; militancy and national-
ism; public spaces and resistance; the role of emotions in violent movements; community, gender and
collective recovery; and memory, orchestrating public panic, and war. Our materials combine analytical,
historical, theoretical and literary texts, and films; all of these speak to the themes of this course and its
participants will be encouraged to interpret, critique, and connect the existing arguments made in the
course materials.

The purpose of this seminar is to consider the effects of disasters on human life. We now live in a world where

will examine and discuss a range of such events. Most of them will be acute disasters, such as a dam collapse in
West Virginia, an oil spill in Alaska, and a hurricane known as Katrina. This is the kind of even we have in mind
when we use the term "disaster." But we will also consider the impact of what we might call chronic disasters on
human life: sustained poverty, colonialism, and ethnic conflict, for example.

SOC 336(F) Global Migration
It is essential to analyze the historical, economic, demographic, legal, and sociological aspects of migration in
order to understand the circumstances and consequences of global movements of people. Therefore this course
approaches migration from an interdisciplinary perspective, by discussing the major theories of migration and
their limitations. While most theories of migration typically focus on one or another cause of migration, we will
try to understand the variability of motives in order to explain different strategies adopted by immigrants to settle
down in the host country. The most widespread causes--economic necessity and political sanctuary--will be
discussed at length. The issue of human rights in the context of asylum seekers and war refugees will also be of
special interest. We will look at immigration policies and laws in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere, with a
focus on the individual and social consequences of illegal immigration. In this context, we will look at methodol-
ogies for monitoring illegal immigration and controversies about the legalization or amnesty for these individu-
als. This course is aimed to provide students with a solid general overview of trends and issues related to people's
mobility across national borders.

contemporary grievances, and produce events in the present. We will consider the emergence of modern forms
of historical consciousness and writing and interrogate the modalities by which they are produced. Participants
will read critical works focused on a range of cultural settings, all of which consider the production of the past in
connection with the following topics: "community," nation, and religion; collective memory; disciplinary
knowledge and power; "tradition," race, and gender; genocide and democracy; and constructing objects of inqui-
ry.

Although the structure of the art history route allows for flexible scheduling, the faculty strongly recommends
that students proceed through the major in the recommended sequence. Introductory 100 and 200 level courses
should be taken in the first or second year. So that they are prepared for the research requirements of the seminar
classes that cap the sequence, majors are required to take one of the required Junior major classes, ArtH 301 or

Art History Route: The history of art is different from other historical disciplines in that it is founded on
direct visual confrontation with objects that are both concretely present and yet documents of the past. We
emphasize analysis of images, objects, and built environments as the basis for critical thought and visual
literacy. In addition to formal and iconographic analysis, we use the work of other disciplines to understand
visual images, such as social history, perceptual psychology, engineering, psychoanalysis, cultural studies,
and archaeology. Because of its concentration on visual experience, the Art History major increases one's
ability to observe and to use those observations as analytical tools for understanding history and culture.
ArtH 101-102 introduces students to a series of critical studies of important works selected from the history of
Western art from antiquity to the present. The critical approach of the introductory course is maintained in all
further courses, especially by assigned study of original works in the Williams College Museum of Art, Chapin
Library, the Clark Art Institute, and Mass MoCA.
An introductory studio course, ArtS 100, in which no artistic talent or prior experience are assumed, provides
vital training in what is a visual as well as a verbal discipline. The requirement of a course in non-Western art
expands majors' geographic as well as cultural horizons, and the requirement of two courses in art from periods
prior to 1800 provides a necessary concentration on earlier moments in culture. (As the late contemporary archi-
tect, Philip Johnson, said, "You cannot not know history.") The junior course (ArtH 301) develops awareness of
the theoretical implications, as well as the possibilities and limitations of different art-historical methods. The
requirement of a seminar or graduate course in the senior year enables students to apply that knowledge of meth-
odology to their most specialized work in the Art History route.
Art Studio Route: The studio division of the Art major has been structured to foster the development of a
critical understanding of making art; to support creative interests and to develop students' perceptions and
imaginations as they investigate a variety of visual media. Drawing I, ArtS 100 serves as an introduc-
tion to the basic drawing and design principles which establish the foundation for the development of
visual expression. ArtH 101-102, Aspects of Western Art, provides part of the necessary background in the
critical analysis of art. The 200-level ArtS courses provide opportunities to learn the elements of some of
the principal visual arts media: architecture, painting, photography, printmaking, sculpture, and video.

These courses combine technical foundations in the medium with analysis of the interrelation of visual
form and content. The 300- and 400-level courses place a greater emphasis on the application of appropri-
ate visual skills and strategies to particular thematic concerns, and to the development of the student's indi-
vidual vision. All students taking ArtS418 are required to exhibit in the spring of their senior year at the
Williams College Museum of Art or other appropriate venues. Students who choose to take two 300 level
classes do not exhibit at WCMA in the spring of the senior year.
History and Practice Route: This route allows students to study in depth both the history of art and the
making of it. It offers considerable flexibility: students may propose courses of study that emphasize partic-
ular media, themes or methodological issues. To mention just three examples, students may design se-
quences of courses that focus on architecture, gender or narration in both the history of art and contempo-
rary practice. Students may take more courses in one wing of the department than the other, as long as the
minimum requirements in each wing are satisfied. The History and Practice route is especially well-suited
to students interested in arts-related careers outside of higher education, including work in art galleries, art
museums, and primary or secondary school education.
Unlike the history or studio routes, acceptance into the History and Practice route is not automatic. The
student must first submit a written application in two copies, one for each advisor from the two wings of the
department, as well as a list of proposed courses; this application and list of proposed courses must be
given to the department secretary before registering for the major.
The application must provide a narrative statement of the theme of the major, and why it cannot be accom-
modated in either history or studio. It is not enough to submit a list of courses; the student needs to show the
coherence and integrity of the plan of study, and how it develops the theme of the proposed major.
Some students will be attracted to both wings of the department but will not have a field of study that falls
between the two. In these cases, it is better for the student to choose between history and studio--taking
additional courses from the other wing as desired. In short, the History and Practice route is reserved for
students with a strong record of achievement who cannot be accommodated in the two wings of the depart-
ment.
History and Practice majors do not participate in the senior studio exhibition at the end of the year.
History and Practice Faculty Advisors: Michael Glier, Ann McCallum, and Ben Benedict in studio; E. J.
Johnson, Peter Low and Michael Lewis in history.
COURSE NUMBERS
First Digit
The 100 level courses in both Art History and Studio are introductions to the field and emphasize
visual and critical analysis. These courses do not require previous experience in the subject and they
are often prerequisites for other courses in the department; 200 level courses are introductions to spe-
cific fields; 300 level courses prepare students for independent research; 400 level courses emphasize
independent research, oral presentation, and active participation and are intended for advanced stu-
dents, usually senior majors.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN ART
Students who wish to become candidates for the degree with honors must show prior evidence of superior
performance in the major as well as research capabilities to carry out the proposed project.
Art History:
For students in the graduating class of 2008:
In order for a project to be considered, the candidate (1) must have arranged for an advisor, and (in consulta-
tion with the advisor) a second reader to supervise and evaluate the project (2) should normally have had one
course with the advisor. In addition, the topic must be within the advisor's areas of competence and should nor-
mally be related to course work which the student has done previously. In the case of an interdisciplinary propos-
al, the second reader should normally come from the other discipline.
The student submits a 2-page proposal including a statement about the preparation for the project, a descrip-
tion of the topic and a general bibliography. Following approval by the faculty advisor and second reader, this
proposal is reviewed by the entire Art faculty, who have the option to request revisions and to refuse the proposal.
Students should keep in mind that a thesis in Art History is not necessary for admission to graduate study.
It is the responsibility of the candidate to select one of the following routes and to meet all deadlines. Students
who are not making satisfactory progress on their research and writing will not be allowed to continue with the
thesis. The completion of the requirements, however, will not guarantee a degree with honors. The degree with
honors will be awarded for projects demonstrating a high degree of scholarly achievement and self-motivation.
All proposals must be submitted according to the guidelines set out below. The timetable for submission of work,
including specific dates, is available in the Art Department office.
Students may select one of the following options:
1) Full-Year Thesis: Research and writing will be carried out during both semesters and WSP of the
senior year (students should register for ArtH 493-W31-494). The thesis topic, advisor and second
reader must be determined by April 15 of junior year. Students who are on overseas programs
junior year are advised to make arrangements prior to their departure, but they may submit a final
proposal two weeks before the fall semester of senior year if they have made the necessary ar-
Art
­ 68 ­
rangements. After the thesis is submitted, the candidate for honors shall present an oral defense
before faculty and peers.
2) Half-Year Thesis: Research and writing will be carried out during fall term and winter study or dur-
ing winter study and spring term (Students should register for ArtH 493-W31 or W31-ArtH 494).
For students who choose to complete the mini-thesis in the fall, proposals must be submitted by
April 15 of the junior year. For those planning to complete the mini-thesis in the spring, proposals
must be submitted by November 1.
A student's project is judged by two members of the department, the advisor and second reader; in the case of
an interdisciplinary project, a member of the Art Department and a member of the other relevant department or
program functions as advisor and second reader. In rare cases, a third reader may be appointed by the department
at the request of the advisor or second reader.
All routes require that one course and one WSP, in addition to the ten required courses for the major, be dedi-
cated to the honors project.
For students graduating 2009 and later:
Art History
To graduate with honors in art history, students are to enroll in the Senior Honors Seminar during the Spring
semester of their senior year, where they will develop an original research paper based on prior research. To be
admitted to the seminar, students must have completed ArtH 301 in their Junior year. To enter the class, students
must either be nominated by a faculty member, or apply independently to the Department Honors Committee for
admission. Students who have been nominated, as well as students who wish to apply for admission to the Hon-
ors Seminar, must submit an original research paper that was completed in a prior art history class. The paper
must be properly formatted and include illustrations, a bibliography, and an abstract of not more than 250 words.
These documents are to be turned in to the Department Secretary no later than the end of the exam period of the
Fall semester. The department Honors Committee will invite students (no more than 10) to enroll in the Honors
Seminar based on the quality of the original research, the student's GPA within the major, and the willingness
and availability of appropriate faculty advisors. Notification of admission to the seminar will be sent to students
by early January. Since enrollment is by invitation only, students should pre-register for four classes and, if in-
vited, drop one of them and add the Honors Seminar during drop-add period. The Honors Seminar is to be taken
in addition to the required courses for the major. Once in the seminar, students will revise, refine and expand on
previous research and produce a paper of approximately 25 pages and present a shortened version of the paper to
the faculty and public at the Williams College Museum of Art.
Art Studio:
Studio art concentrators who wish to be candidates for honors are required to add a 200-level course, and to
take the 400-level senior tutorial. An additional 300-level tutorial or 200-level course must be added for a total of
twelve courses.
Honors candidates enrolled in the senior tutorial must "evidence" prior experience in the media chosen for the
honors work. This "evidence" may consist of one or more 200-level courses in the medium, course work at the
300 level and/or a slide portfolio demonstrating the student's proficiency in the media chosen for the honors
project. This work is presented to the senior tutorial instructor at the start of the spring semester.
At the end of the spring semester of the senior year, the honors candidate will orally defend his/her work in the
senior exhibition at WCMA. The entire studio faculty will attend the defense. Based on the work and the oral
defense, the studio faculty (as a whole) will designate honors, high honors or no honors.
History and Practice:
The route to honors is a combination of the Art Studio and Art History honors routes. At the beginning of
senior year, a candidate for honors in History and Practice makes a proposal to two faculty members, one faculty
advisor from each wing of the department. If both advisors agree to supervise the project, the candidate enrolls in
independent study and works through the fall semester and winter study. The progress of the project is assessed
by both advisors at the end of winter study; if the project is not well enough developed, the advisors may end it at
that time. If the project is allowed to move forward, the student enrolls either in ArtS 418T Senior Tutorial, if the
project is primarily a matter of making art, or in an Honors Independent Study, if it is primarily a writing project.
The final project is submitted to the two advisors, who will determine whether or not it will receive honors.
STUDY ABROAD
Although the Art Department encourages students to travel and study abroad, we feel that it is very important
for students to begin their major with a required seminar in their Junior year. The Junior seminars, ArtH 301,
ArtH 448, and ArtS 319, prepare students for independent research and/or independent artistic production which
is the focus of the senior year.
a. Studio Art Majors must take the required Junior Seminar (ArtS 319) in their junior year unless they are
planning to study abroad for a full year; in that case they may take the required class in their senior year.
b. History and Practice students must include their Study Abroad plans in their application to the major and
discuss them with their advisor.
c. Art History students must take one of the required Junior Seminars (ArtH 301 or ArtH 448) in their junior
year unless they are planning to study abroad for a full year; in that case they may take the required class in
their senior year.
ART HISTORY COURSES
ARTH 101(F)-102(S) Aspects of Western Art
A year-long introduction to a history of some European and North American art, this course concentrates on
three-dimensional media in the fall (architecture and sculpture) and two-dimensional media in the spring (paint-
Art
­ 69 ­
ing, drawing, prints and photography). Even though the course focuses on Western art, it also explores inter-
changes among other cultures and the west, particularly in more recent times.
Both semesters cover the same chronological span, from Ancient Greeks to computer geeks. We organize the
course in this unusual way not only to give students the grasp of history but also to heighten their ability to under-
stand visual objects by coming to grips with only one artistic medium at a time. To train students to look carefully
at art, we use the wealth of art resources in Williamstown: the Clark Art Institute, the Williams College Museum
of Art and the Chapin Rare Book Library. Students spend time with, and sometimes even hold, original works of
art. For the study of architecture we have a unique set of "Virtual Buildings," made expressly for this course, that
approximate the experience of being in structures thousands of miles away.
ArtH 101-102 cannot be taken on a pass/fail basis; however, the course may be audited. Students who have
audited ArtH 101-102 lectures on a registered basis may enroll in any Art History course at the 200 or 300 level.
Both semesters of the course must be taken on a graded basis to receive credit for either semester.
Open to first-year students.

ARTH 103(F) Asian Art Survey: From the Land of the Buddha to the World of the Geisha*
This course introduces to students some of the major monuments of Asian art with an emphasis on the art of
India, China, and Japan. Its contextual approach helps students gain insight into the aesthetic, religious, and polit-
ical ideas and cultural meanings conveyed by the works of art. Visual analyses and thematic discussions will bear
upon the interconnectedness among these three cultures, and their respective interactions with the West. This
course also provides students with the vocabulary, techniques, and patterns of thinking needed for advanced art
history courses.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based on six quizzes, class attendance, and three short essays.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 40. Highly recommended for first-year students.
Satisfies the pre-1800 and non-Western requirements.
Hour: 9:55-11:10 TR JANG
ARTH 106(F) Picturing God in the Middle Ages: An Introduction
How did Christians come to depict God? How did they visualize the deity described in the Bible as well as such
theological subtleties as the Incarnation and the Trinity? And what purposes did pictures of God serve, both in
public and private life? Paying particular attention to the function of works of art, this freshman seminar will
examine the evolution, over more than one thousand years, of medieval Christian images of God, and the prob-
lems these images often generated. Among other topics, the course will investigate: the impact of the Roman cult
of the emperor and of images of the dead on the earliest portraits of Christ; the rise of the icon and its conse-
quences; the influence of theological debates about the nature of spiritual versus physical vision on the making
and viewing of images; the relationship of sacred images to relics, the Eucharist, and other aspects of Christian
ritual; and the pictorial exploration of both the torture and sexuality of Christ.
Format: first-year seminar. Requirements: Evaluation will be based on a number of short papers, quizzes, oral
presentations, and class participation.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Preference to first years.
This course satisfies the pre-1400 and pre-1800 requirements. This course does NOT satisfy the seminar require-
ment for the major.
Hour: 1:10-3:50 W LOW
ARTH 110(S) Reading the Renaissance: Interpreting Italian Renaissance Art and History
Many works of Renaissance art, such as Botticelli's Birth of Venus, Leonardo's Mona Lisa, and Michelangelo's
David, are remarkably familiar to us. But even as they live in our cultural consciousness, we may perceive them
as elevated and remote masterpieces of western culture, housed away in museums halfway around the world.
Just what is it that makes these objects so admired and important? And what might we all have to gain, intellectu-
ally, by considering them? We will focus in depth on a series of individual works of art, learning and honing skills
of observation, visual and contextual analysis, and written and oral expression. But we will also step back from
the objects to explore and balance different approaches and points of view and to consider, more broadly, differ-
ent issues that can factor into the very act of interpretation. The goal of the course is that students emerge from it
with a rich understanding of the selected works in question, as well as a mindfulness of the ways in which the
Renaissance period might inform our aesthetic perceptions and our critical understanding of the construction of
the past.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on several short writing assignments as well as group projects, presen-
tations, and debates.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 16 (expected: 16). Preference to freshmen, then sophomores.
Satisfies the pre-1800 requirement. This course does NOT satisfy the seminar requirement for the major.
Hour: 1:10-3:50 M SOLUM
ARTH 200(F) Modern and Contemporary African Art (Same as Africana Studies 201)*
This course maps out the range of work by artists from African countries from the colonial period to the era of
post-independence. It follows developments in modern art from Egypt to Senegal, from Nigeria to South Africa,
from Ethiopia to Morocco, outlining how artists used art as a means of expressing their political ideas, or assert-
ing nationalistic ideologies especially during the era of decolonization. Beyond the era of independence, the
course examines the various ways African artists responded to political and economic crises that engulfed many
African countries in the 1970s and 1980s. At this time also, the work of African artists became increasingly
visible in the art world courtesy of mega-shows in Europe and the United States. The course looks at how this
happened. The final part of the course deals with the work of African artists, some of who have become well
known, even, controversial art world stars; it also considers the difficult terrain of culture and identity in the era of
Art
­ 70 ­
Globalization. The course seeks to familiarize students with modern and contemporary art from Africa by study-
ing forms, ideas, and subject matter that have preoccupied African artists over the past half-century. It is also
interested in the exhibitionary and critical practices that have helped set these artists on the global stage, as well as
theoretical structures that might help our understanding of these phenomena. These inquiries will be set against
the background of political, economic, social and intellectual formations that have directly or indirectly deter-
mined form, concept, and ideology in the work of post-WWII African artists.
Format: lecture. Requirements: two short papers, a final exam, midterm exam.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20 (expected: 17). Preference given to art majors and African Studies con-
centrators.
Hour: 8:30-9:45 TR OKEKE-AGULU
ARTH 201(F) American Landscape History (Same as Environmental Studies 201)
This is a survey course stressing the description and historical geography of regional, vernacular American set-
tings, with the goal of discerning a national style of spatial or landscape organization. Among the human-altered
environments to be studied are: forestlands, rangelands, croplands, outdoor recreational sites, mines and quarries;
small towns, milltowns, central business districts, and suburbs; power and utilities; housing, industry, commerce,
and institutional uses such as the American college campus; water, road, and rail corridors as examples of cir-
culation nets. Primary evidence will be visual.
One afternoon meeting each week provides discussion and field- or site-visit opportunities, and enables class-
members to obtain a first-hand familiarity with a rural-urban gradient of representative land uses and occupants
of the Hoosic-Hudson watershed and Taconic upland region surrounding Williamstown, as well as experience
with interviewing and field study methodologies.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: four term paper installments on the documentation of an evolving
landscape site or behavior, short class presentation on research, as its "landscape" or type comes up for class or
lecture consideration, and an obligatory all-day field trip.
No prerequisites. Open to first-year students.
This course is conceived as an introduction to ArtH/Environmental Studies 252, 305, 306, and 307.

ARTH 205(S) Picturing Race: From Early Modern Europe to Now (Same as Africana Studies
205)*
This historically wide-ranging course surveys visual representations of race in three different periods-early mod-
ern Europe, the 19th-20th centuries, and the contemporary-in order to ask questions about how art establishes
conventions for racial imagery and about how art may challenge and revise these conventions. The course begins
with the black servant motif in Renaissance portraits of white patrons by, for example, Anthony van Dyck, both
to identify standard visual elements in the repertoire of poses for black attendants and, equally, to note departures
from the norm. The second section considers Winslow Homer's Caribbean paintings (with subsequent trans-
formations in the subject by Romare Bearden and Derek Walcott), as well as works by African-American artists
such as Henry O. Tanner and Jacob Lawrence. The course concludes with discussion of Glenn Ligon, Fred Wil-
son, Kara Walker, and other contemporary artists who engage in re-visionary explorations of identity. Through-
out, analysis of race includes "whiteness" as a racial category. Time will be spent at the Williams College Mu-
seum of Art viewing works from the collection.
Format: lecture and discussion. Evaluation based on participation in class discussions; midterm; final; short pa-
per.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20 (expected: 20). Preference given to Art majors and Africana Studies con-
centrators.
Hour: 8:30-9:45 TR ERICKSON
ARTH 206(S) The Ancient Roman City (Same as Classics 215)
This course introduces the topography and monuments of the city of Rome from its Iron Age foundations in the
eighth century B.C.E. through the time of Constantine in the early fourth century C.E. The growth of Rome as a
major urban center in the Mediterranean and ultimately the capital of a vast empire will be explored in relation to
the daily lives of its inhabitants. Other cities in Italy, including Ostia and Pompeii, and in the provinces will also
be investigated as case studies of Roman urbanism. A critical theme of the course is the role of archaeology in
revealing the ancient Roman city and transforming our understanding of its political, social, economic, and
religious identity.
Format: lecture. Requirements: mid-term and final examinations; 10-page research paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20 (expected:15). This course satisfies the pre-1400 and pre-1800 require-
ments.
Hour: 11:00-12:15 MW THOMPSON
ARTH 211(F) Roman Art (Same as Classics 211)
This course focuses on the artistic traditions of the Romans from the Republic to the age of Constantine. Archi-
tecture, sculpted portraits, and reliefs, wall paintings, mosaics, gems, and coins will be examined in their histori-
cal and social contexts. Topics include the relationship between art and politics; patronage; gender; and the devel-
opment of the city of Rome from a humble village on the Palatine Hill to a thriving metropolis and grand imperi-
al capital. The history of archaeology in Italy and its impact on our present-day understanding of the Roman
world will be studied as well.

ARTH 212(F) Distant Encounters: East Meets West in the Art of the European Middle Ages
This lecture course investigates the rich artistic consequences--in architecture, manuscript illumination, mosaic,
sculpture, panel painting, fresco, metalwork, and other minor arts--of European contact with the Eastern Medi-
terranean between approximately 300 and 1450 AD. From the beginnings of Christianity, pilgrims from Europe
made the long journey to sacred sites in the Holy Land (extending across parts of present-day Egypt, Israel, Syr-
ia, and Turkey). When these sites became less accessible with the spread of Islam in the seventh century, Euro-
peans sought to recreate the sites at home. Later, from 1095 onward, Christian Europeans attempted to reclaim
and hold the Holy Land from non-Christians by force, through an ill-fated series of five major and several lesser
"crusades." Over the centuries, before, during, and after the Crusades, exposure to the peoples, ideas, and cul-
tures of the Eastern Mediterranean also came through trade and through the travel and settlement of non-Euro-
peans in Europe itself, particularly in Spain, Sicily, and Venice. The course aims to survey artistic production
within each of these different contexts of East-West encounter.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: two to three short papers, midterm, and final exam.
No prerequisite, but previous coursework in medieval art helpful (ArtH 101-102, 223, or 224). Enrollment limit:

Satisfies the pre-1400 and pre-1800 requirements.
Hour: 2:35-3:50 MR LOW
ARTH 213(S) North-American Dwellings (Same as Environmental Studies 211)
A study of the historical and spatial evolution of North-American housing which concentrates upon those sing-
le-or multi-family dwelling types which exhibit diachronic or geographical pervasiveness, such as the farm-
house, rowhouse, apartment house, tract house and mobile home. These dwelling places are seen in a context of
life and family cycles, of initial builders and successive occupants, of neighborhood and community formation or
change, of building materials and technologies, of architectural and socio-economic styles, as well as of Ameri-
can work patterns and daily-rounds. There will be emphasis throughout the course on the visual impress of this
residential "fabric." The lab section is to be used for occasional site visits.
Requirements: four essay installments on a pervasive element throughout American homes; a class presentation;
participation in classes and weekly afternoon field sessions.
Open to sophomores. Enrollment limit: 15 (expected: 15).
Hour: TBA SATTERTHWAITE
ARTH 214(S) Arts of Africa (Same as Africana Studies 214)*
A comprehensive introduction to the visual and performing arts of sub-Saharan Africa from prehistoric times to
the present. Special emphasis will be placed on rock art, painting, sculpture, architecture, pottery, masking and
body adornment, as well as the various ways in which their forms, styles, functions and meanings have been
shaped by environmental, cultural and historical forces. Because it focuses on art in context, while, at the same
time, acquainting students with different methodological approaches, the course will benefit Art History students
as well as others whose disciplines require them to make informed cross-cultural analyses or comparisons. The
ultimate goal is to equip students with the skills necessary for interpreting visual forms, in general, and for ex-
ploring the cultural ramifications of African art, in particular.
Format: lecture. Requirements: the course is open to all students; no background in African art is needed. Al-
though it is essentially a lecture course, some time will be set aside for questions and answers or class discussions
based on the lectures or assigned readings. Active participation in class discussions is required. Two short tests
and a final exam will be given. In addition, students will submit a short term paper of approximately 10-12 pages
in length on a topic relevant to the course. Graduate students will submit a longer paper of approximately 20-25
pages.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 25 (expected :18). Preference given to first-years and art majors with permis-
sion of instructor. This is an undergraduate course, though interested graduate students can register with permis-
sion of instructor.
Hour: TBA LAWAL
ARTH 215(S) The Aesthetics and Culture of North American Woodlands (Same as
Environmental Studies 216) (W)
Constituting half of the continent's land area, woodlands have contributed distinctive natural settings, cultural
artifacts, and aesthetic influences to wildland habitués commencing with Amerindians: naval stores, whether
masts or turpentine; the White Pine Act of 1722; company towns such as Scotia, California; twig furniture; Oke-
fenokee swamp "hollers;" signature foreground gnarled trees in paintings of the Hudson River School; the Cana-
dian Group of Seven lakescapes from Algonquin Provincial Park; Emily Carr's both exuberant and somber
evocations of British Columbian rainforests. This course will attempt to unravel the history of the man/forest
equation, drawing upon the magisterial scholarship of the Oxford human geographer Michael Williams in
Americans and Their Forests, which claims the forest to be "the most important, and certainly the most visually
dominant, vegetation on the continent." Attention also to be given to the development and types of woodland
literature. This course will attempt to discern the aesthetic differences between regional forest types, whether they
be the pinon-juniper "woodlands" of the Southwest, the Great Lakes pineries, the cypress bayous of Louisiana,
or our own (Williamstown) Middle Atlantic oak-hickory/ Northern hardwoods zonation. Some consideration
will be given to specific tree species and their respective architectures and to the development of knowledge and
appreciation of these species, beginning with George Emerson's 1846 legislative assignment, A Report on the
Trees and Shrubs Growing Naturally in the Forests of Massachusetts. Such legislative ripples as Shade Tree
Commissions and wilderness preservation will also be studied, especially as these facets are seen and understood

ARTH 218(S) The Romantic Revolution: Art in Europe, 1791-1848
Major developments in European art from Neoclassicism in the late-eighteenth century to the ascendancy of
Realism in the mid-nineteenth century. Emphasis on French, British, and German art in its cultural and aesthetic
context, including David, Goya, Delacroix, Turner, Caspar David Friedrich, and Courbet, as well as lesser
known figures associated with Romanticism and its aftermath.

ARTH 220(F) The Mosque*
The mosque (masjid) is the site of communal prayer rituals as well as many other activities in Islamic cultures.
By definition, it must simply be a clean space oriented towards Mecca. In actuality, mosques have taken diverse
architectural forms ranging from simple hypostyle halls of mud-brick to elaborate complexes of reinforced con-
crete and plate glass. This course will address the stylistic and regional differences from the seventh to twentieth
century, including the columned halls of the central Arab lands, the centralized domed structures of the Ottoman
world and the courtyard structures of the Persian tradition. Elements of architectural decoration such as monu-
mental calligraphy, glazed tilework and carved stucco will also be considered. The course will culminate in a
consideration of modern mosque architecture in which tradition and modernism combine to generate new forms
of sacred space.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: paper, midterm, term project and final exam.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 40.
Satisfies the non-western and pre-1800 requirements.
Hour: 1:10-2:25 TF H. EDWARDS
ARTH 224(S) Romanesque and Gothic Art and Architecture: The Medieval Church in Context
The goal of this course is to survey the major works of ecclesiastical architecture, sculpture and stained glass
produced in France between approximately 1050 and 1400. These works were not created in isolation from their
surroundings; thus we will attempt to understand them not only stylistically, but also in their original functional,
social, and sometimes even political settings. The course will emphasize the abbey church and the cathedral, the
two major ecclesiastical buildings of this period, as heterogeneous entities that used architecture, sculpture,
stained glass and other media, in conjunction with church ritual, to render their sacred spaces distinct from, and
elevated above, the world outside. We will furthermore try to appreciate the special centrality of the abbey church
and the cathedral in high medieval society. Sites for contact with God and for the development of advanced
learning, they could also serve as critical determinants of local economic and political life, and as focuses of
pilgrimage, trade, and international cultural exchange.
Requirements: midterm, final, three to four short papers.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 30.

This course on art-historical method is designed to offer art history majors a historiographic overview of the
discipline of art history, with a focus on developments of the present century. The course will survey the most
influential concepts of the discipline, the evolving tasksit has set itself, and the methods it has adopted for execut-
ing them. Works of art will inevitably enter into our discussions, but the main objects of study will be texts about
art, particularly texts about methods for a historical study of art. Topics include: concepts of the discipline; style
and periodication; iconography, semiotics, and deconstructionl; the social functions of images and the social his-
tory of art; gender and sexuality; and art history as representation.

ARTH 302(S) When Art Needs Room to Breath: Public Art Beyond the White Cube
This course will consider the history, controversies, and evolving aesthetic approaches to publicly sited art from
Richard Serra's Tilted Arc, removed from its downtown NYC site by court order, to Christo and Jeanne-Claude's
Gates for Central Park, to Mark Dion's Seattle Vivarium, a 60-foot nurse log housed in a monumental urban
greenhouse created in collaboration with, amongst others, scientists, ecologists, and botanical illustrators, and
Rick Lowe's community-based Project Rowhouse in Houston. Through lectures and guided readings, it will
provide an overview of landmark projects including "plonk" art in corporate plazas, site-specific commissions,
and new-genre public works as the foundation for student discussions and interactions with artists, curators, and
representatives from architecture, government, and non-profit public art commissioning organizations. The
course will also include a practicum in which students work together in teams to research, create/curate, and
problem-solve actual public art projects unfolding in the Berkshires and beyond. The instructor is the Director of
the Williams College Museum of Art. She is chairing a campus committee on public art at Williams, and is the
former artistic lead of the new Olympic Sculpture Park on the Seattle waterfront.

ARTH 330T(F) Michelangelo: Biography, Mythology, and the History of Art (W)
One might argue that Michelangelo's enduring fame, and his preeminence in the western art historical canon, is
as much a product of his artistic persona as his artistic achievement. Indeed, the modern notion of the visual artist
as a brooding, even tortured genius of unstoppable creative force finds its roots in the Italian Renaissance. This is
largely due to the singular figure of Michelangelo, whose life and career are more fully documented than those of
any western artist to precede him. And Michelangelo's mythic individuality, alongside his artistic innovations
and contributions, have made him a fundamental force in the shape of the history of art as we understand and
study it today. Students of this tutorial will become well-acquainted with the life and work of Michelangelo
through the examination of a wide variety of primary and secondary sources: contemporary Renaissance
documents, letters, poetry, and biographies; art historical surveys, monographs, and studies; and documentary
and popular film. They will give their critical attention, however, to the intersection between this artist's
biography and his artistic production. We will focus on a number of important questions arising from this con-
nection. What, for example, is the nature and reliability of the evidence used to reconstruct Michelangelo's life
and personality? What are the grounds for interpreting his work according to his philosophical outlook, religious
beliefs, and even sexuality? To what extent was Michelangelo responsible for shaping his own persona for
posterity? Is the myth of this artist distinguishable from his "reality?" And to what extent have all these issues
shaped our own thinking about artists and the history of art?
Format: tutorial. Requirements: evaluation will be based on the quality and improvement of written work (5
weekly papers and 5 response papers, and a final written exercise addressing major themes of the tutorial), and
oral dialogue.
Prerequisite: one art history course of any level. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Open to sophomores,

or impertinent. This seminar explores architectural criticism, that curious genre between literature and architec-
ture, and looks at its history, nature and function. We will read and discuss classic reviews by historical and con-
temporary critics as John Ruskin, Mariana van Rensselaer, Lewis Mumford, Ada Louise Huxtable and Herbert
Muschamp. Insights gained from these discussions will be applied by students to writing their own reviews,
which will likewise be discussed in class. Early assignments will concentrate on mechanics: how to describe a
building vividly and accurately, how to balance description and interpretation judiciously, how to compare. Sub-
sequent ones will be more synthetic, encouraging students to write bold, lively and critical essays. The ultimate
goal is to develop a distinctive and effective voice, and to gain a better understanding of the nature of criticism in
general.

The artist's body was increasingly used as both the subject and object of art in the twentieth century. By focusing
on visual artists engaged in performance practices, we will examine the connections between time, action, and
space, and the role of documentation in ephemeral forms of art. We will consider how the body became a formal
medium and its impact on the theory and practice of the visual arts from the 1970s to the present. Throughout the
course, we will explore the relationships between form, content, theory, practice, site, and context as well as ana-
lyze the visual, conceptual, and political effects (and possibilities) of the work.

ARTH 422(S) Making the Stones Speak: The Emergence and Development Of the Romanesque
Sculpted Portal
Beginning around the year 1000, European Christendom experienced a great ecclesiastical building boom. Ac-
cording to a contemporary chronicler, "it was as if the whole earth, having cast off the old by shaking itself, were
clothing itself everywhere in the white robe of the church." During the course of the eleventh century, the design-
ers of these structures fashioned a new architectural language that we now label "Romanesque." One of the most
innovative and dramatic aspects of this new language was its assimilation of monumental sculpture, absent in
Europe since the fifth century. The focus of attention in this regard was the portal, which marked the threshold
between the profane realm of the outside world and the sacred space of the church. This seminar will investigate
the antecedents and origins of the Romanesque sculpted portal and examine in detail its greatest manifestations.
Emphasis will be placed on understanding these often complex sculptural schemes within their original function-
al and physical contexts. What role did this imagery play in structuring the medieval visitor's overall experience
of the church? And what did it mean to have this imagery carved into the very fabric of "God's temple"?

ARTH 470(S) American Orientalism, Then and Now*
"Orientalism," according to Edward Said, refers to asymmetrical relationships between "East" and "West" by
which the latter represents and controls the former. This course is about the visual manifestations of those dy-
namics as they exist between the United States and the Islamic world during the period from 1870 to the present;
during this period, America emerged on the world stage, consumer culture coalesced and the mechanical repro-
duction of images became a formative force in American visuality. With reference to painting, photography, film,
advertising and fashion, we will explore the American Orientalism as it changes over time in response to social
and political circumstance.
Students will be working with two exhibitions at WCMA and will be expected to produce a major term project.

ARTS 102(F) Watercolor
Watercolor (wash and gouache) offers the beginning imagist an opportunity to combine the immediacy of draw-
ing with the palette of painting. As a technical medium, its adaptable properties and portability had historically
relegated it (unfortunately!) to the amateur landscape or portrait. It has shed much of that during the past one
hundred years as the process has become associated with the works of Homer, Marin, Hopper, Demuth, and
O'Keefe. In the 1970's it furthered its popularity in contemporary imagery as a material and process that prom-
ised a rich selection from the cartoon, the elaborate layering of expressionism, or the detail of the hyper-real. Our
work in this studio will examine the means by which each individual can experience this range of technical and
experiential qualities.
Format: This studio course will meet each of the two days scheduled and for the complete duration of the class
period. There will be some classes combined with slide lectures, some classes where we might visit collections,
and most classes where we will be working for the entire period on the works in process. Evaluation is based on
evidence of each student's progress in a collection of work made in class and as outside assignments. You will
present your portfolio for evaluation three times during the course. My evaluations will consider each completed
assignment's fulfillment of the problems' objectives, the technical execution of the work (craftsmanship), con-
ceptual and physical investment of time, and participation in critiques and attendance.

This course will investigate the connections between dance and visual art. Students will learn and use techniques
from dance that can apply to the visual representation of action in drawing, painting, photography, video and
other art forms. How is a sculpture or an installation site transformed and informed by movement? We will ex-
amine the older connections such as ritual uses of visual art and dance, the collaboration of choreographer Mar-
tha Graham and visual artist Isamu Noguchi as well as contemporary site-specific dances of performers like Eiko
and Koma and Joanna Haigood. Classes will consist of dance technique workshops, art making, discussions with
faculty and visiting artists. Labs will be used to generate material, view and discuss process, screenings and visits.

ARTS 230(S) Drawing II
This drawing course will continue to investigate the techniques, principles of organization, and ideas which were
introduced in the Drawing I course. Having become more familiar with the drawing process, students will be
encouraged, through selected problems, to expand and challenge the conventions of markmaking. As with any
discipline, familiarity with the rules allows the users to seek alternatives and develop definitions of how the
drawing process can best be suited to their own visual vocabulary. The range of exercises could include tradition-
al materials on paper as well as combinations of materials more commonly associated with non-art disciplines,
i.e., computers, industrial materials, literature, etc.
Evaluation will be based on evidence of each student's progress, as shown in a portfolio of drawings made in
class and as homework. Attendance and participation in class discussions are also considered as part of the
course evaluation. Lab fee.

ARTH 533(F) Michelangelo: Biography, Mythology, and the History of Art
One might argue that Michelangelo's enduring fame, and his preeminence in the western art historical canon, is
as much a product of his artistic persona as his artistic achievement. Indeed, the modern notion of the visual artist
Art
­ 82 ­
as a brooding, even tortured genius of unstoppable creative force finds its roots in the Italian Renaissance. This is
largely due to the singular figure of Michelangelo, whose life and career are more fully documented than those of
any western artist to precede him. And Michelangelo's mythic individuality, alongside his artistic innovations
and contributions, have made him a fundamental force in the shape of the history of art as we understand and
study it today. Students in this course will become well-acquainted with the life and work of Michelangelo
through the examination of primary and secondary sources, giving critical attention to the intersection of the
artist's biography and personality with his artistic production. We will examine the nature and reliability of the
evidence used to reconstruct Michelangelo the person, as well as the grounds for interpreting his work according
to his personal philosophical outlook, religious beliefs, and presumed sexuality. To what extent was Michelange-
lo responsible for shaping his own persona for posterity? Is the myth of this artist distinguishable from his "real-
ity?" And to what extent have these issues shaped our own thinking about artists and the history of art? We will
ask these questions and more.
Format: seminar. Requirements will include an oral presentation, a research paper, short response papers, and
critical commentary on work of peers.
Enrollment limit: 12. Preference will be given first to graduate students and then to senior majors.
Hour: 1:10-3:50 M SOLUM
ARTH 551(F) Winslow Homer
In this seminar we will explore the life and art of Winslow Homer. Paintings, prints, watercolors, and
photographs in the collection of the Clark Art Institute and the Williams College Museum of Art will focus our
discussions and provide the basis for understanding Homer's art-making and his place within the art-culture of
his day. A consideration of his subjects will necessarily intersect with many of the nation's most pressing issues
during his era: the Civil War and Reconstruction; the rise of middleclass leisure; the relation of man to the envi-
ronment.
Format: seminar. Students' responsibilities will include class discussion, two short papers, an oral presentation
(and response to someone else's), and a final research paper.
Enrollment limit: 10. Preference will be given first to graduate students and then to senior majors.
Hour:1:10-3:50 F SIMPSON
ARTH 556(S) Fact, Self, and the Roots of Architectural Modernism
(1) A building should express the facts of its program and materials--directly and without sentimentality. (2) A
building should be a physical manifestation of the personality and ego of its creator. These demands--one of
radical objectivity, and one of radical subjectivity--seem to be mutually exclusive, yet together they form the
basis for modern architecture at the start of the twentieth century. The architectural lineage of Frank Furness,
Louis Sullivan and Frank Lloyd Wright in particular is distinguished by the high degree of tension between the
competing demands of factuality and selfhood. This seminar will explore the theoretical roots of this architecture
and its philosophical sources in transcendentalism, German romanticism, and Unitarianism. Research topics will
include theory and practice, planning and composition, architectural education, decorative arts, architectural au-
tobiography, and so forth.
Format: seminar. Requirements: a 25-page research paper and seminar presentation; regular participation in
seminar discussions.
Enrollment limit: 10. Preference will be given first to graduate students and then to senior majors.

ARTH 559(S) Romanticism: Visual Art and Culture in Europe, 1780-1848
This course examines the development and impact of Romanticism in Europe, c. 1780-1848. With special atten-
tion to the visual arts but considering a wide variety of literary, philosophical and musical material, it will explore
the crucial but much disputed concept and phenomenon of Romanticism. What was it and when was it? How did
it relate to political and social upheavals of the period? How did it transform artistic priorities and cultural identi-
ties in the early nineteenth century? Why does it remain significant to understanding art practice today? The
course will exploit the resources of the Clark's painting and graphic arts collections (Delacroix, Gericault, Goya,
Corot, etc.) as well as material in the Chapin Library (Blake), and trips will be likely to collections further afield
(New York and/or Boston).
Format: seminar. Students will be assessed by a short written assignment and a 30-minute presentation which
will be presented in revised written form at the end of the semester.
Hour: 1:10-3:50 M LEDBURY
ARTH 582(S) Modern and Contemporary African Art
This seminar will trace the evolution of modern and contemporary African art from the late nineteenth century to
the present. It will familiarize students with different theoretical and methodological approaches to the subject.
Emphasis will be placed on the historical, cultural, ideological, economic, aesthetic, and international forces in-
fluencing the production, forms, meanings and reception of contemporary African art during the colonial and
postcolonial periods. The instructor's introductory lectures and the weekly reading assignments will form the
basis of class discussions. Students will be encouraged to explore the significance of art both as creative expres-
sion and as an aspect of social history.
Format: seminar. Students' responsibilities include active participation in class discussions, a short mid-term
essay, and a final research paper (20-25 pages), a summary of which will be presented to the class at the end of
the semester.
Enrollment limit: 12. Preference will be given first to graduate students and then to undergraduates.

ARTH 585(F) Igbo and Yoruba Arts
This seminar focuses on the classical and traditional arts of the Yoruba and Igbo of Southern Nigeria. Although
these two groups may have had historical and cultural connections in the past, they developed distinct politics
Art
­ 83 ­
and social formations, as well as architecture, visual, and performing arts. Ulli Beier (1960) and Simon Ottenberg
(1983) have compared and contrasted the arts and aesthetics of these two Nigerian cultures and have called for
further studies on the arts. This seminar takes off from the arguments outlined by Beier and Ottenberg and en-
courages comparative studies and critical examination of specific visual arts of Yoruba and Igbo in order to see
what aspects of the groups' philosophies, aesthetics, and socio-cultural formations might account for the very
nature of their arts. The seminar will involve readings on Igbo and Yoruba art and aesthetics, including but not
limited to those by Margaret and Henry Drewal, Rowland Abiodun, John Pemberton III, Chike Aniakor, Simon
Ottenberg, Ulli Beier, Babatunde Lawal, Herbert Cole, G. I. Jones, Elizabeth Willis, Sarah Adams, and Moyo
Okediji. Topics to be covered in student presentations and seminar papers will include comparative studies of
forms and aesthetics of mural painting, textiles, ancient and ritual sculpture, masking, architecture, and gender
politics.
Format: seminar. Prerequisite for undergraduates is a prior course in African art and architecture.

ARTH 597(F), 598(S) Undergraduate Courses Taken for Graduate Credit
LANGUAGE COURSES
Reading proficiency in two European languages is required for the M.A. degree in Art History at Williams,
and provision for attainment of this qualification is an integral part of the program of study. Of these two, Ger-
man isrequired, and French is recommended. Elementary and intermediate undergraduate courses offered by the
language departments are open to graduate students, and the graduate program offers advanced, one-semester
courses in French and German art-history readings. A student who begins elementary language study after en-
rollment in the program should expect to take a sequence of courses. Details may be obtained from the Graduate
Program office. Entering students with some previous language background will be asked to take a standard
reading examination for purposes of placement. Students should aim to complete all language work no later than
the end of the third semester.
To satisfy the requirement in each of the two required languages, a student must: (a) score 700 or better on the
SAT II reading examination upon enrollment in the program or, (b) complete punctually and satisfactorily (B- or
better) all assignments and tests in the advanced courses. The same standards and expectations apply to language
courses as to other courses and seminars.
Second-year students who have successfully completed German 511-512 and have independently developed
their German language skills during the summer may, before the commencement of their third semester of study,
arrange to take a two-hour translation examination administered by the Graduate Program. Students who pass
the examination are exempted from German 513.
If appropriate to his or her course of study, a student may petition to substitute another language for French.
Instruction in Italian, Spanish, Russian, Latin, and Greek is regularly offered in the undergraduate curriculum,
whereas independent arrangements must be made for Dutch and other languages.

STUDY ABROAD
Students intending to major in Asian Studies are encouraged to study in Asia during one or both semesters of
their junior year. Williams faculty serve on the boards of several study abroad programs in China and Japan.
Opportunities to study in India, Indonesia, Korea, Taiwan,Thailand, and other Asian countries are also available.
Prospective Asian Studies majors who are planning to study abroad should discuss their plans with their advisor
as far in advance as possible. Up to eight courses taken overseas can count toward graduation, and up to four
courses taken off campus may be counted toward the major.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS
Students interested in writing an honors thesis in Asian Studies, Chinese, or Japanese should submit a propos-
al to the department chair when they register for courses in the spring of their junior year. The proposal should
include a statement of the topic, a general description of the types of materials available for study and how the
study will be carried out, and the name of the faculty member who will serve as advisor. Admission to the honors
thesis program will normally be limited to students who have maintained at least a B+ average in their courses
for the major.
Students admitted to the program should register for ASST 493-W31-494, CHIN 493-W31-494, or JAPN
493-W31-494. They will be expected to turn in the final draft of their thesis shortly after spring break and to
discuss their results formally with their faculty graders. Their final grades in the three courses listed above and the
award of Honors, Highest Honors, or no honors will be determined by the quality of the thesis and the student's
performance in the oral defense.
THE ASIAN STUDIES ENDOWMENT
The Linen summer grants for study abroad, the Linen visiting professorships, and several other programmatic
activities in the department are supported by an endowment for Asian Studies established by family and friends
in memory of James A. Linen III, Class of 1934, Trustee of the College from 1948 to 1953 and from 1963 to
1982.

COURSES IN CHINESE (Div. I)
The department regularly offers four levels of instruction in Modern Standard Chinese (Mandarin), designed
to enable the student to become proficient in aural comprehension, speaking, reading, and writing, as well as
introductory courses in Cantonese, Taiwanese, Classical Chinese, and Chinese linguistics. The course numbering
system for Chinese is sequential. Students move from Chinese 101-102 to 201, 202, 301, 302, 401, and 402.
Independent study (Chinese 497, 498) may be offered depending on student needs and available resources; inter-
ested students must contact the Coordinator of the Chinese Program one semester in advance and present a pro-
posal to the Coordinator or the professor with whom they wish to study by the first day of pre-registration week.
Those students entering with proficiency in Chinese should see the Coordinator concerning placement.
The department also offers courses on Chinese literature and culture in English translation for students who
wish to become acquainted with the major achievements in Chinese literary, intellectual and cultural history. For
the purpose of the distribution requirement, all courses in Chinese are considered Division I unless otherwise
noted.
STUDY ABROAD
Students majoring in Chinese are strongly encouraged to study in mainland China or Taiwan during one or
both semesters of their junior year, during the summer, or over Winter Study. It is important that students inter-
ested in any of these options consult as early as possible with the department and the Dean's Office concerning
acceptable programs.
CHIN 101(F)-W88-102(S) Basic Chinese*
An introduction to Mandarin, the language with the largest number of native speakers in the world, which is the
official language of China and Taiwan, and one of the official languages of Singapore. Course objectives are for
the student to develop simple, practical conversational skills and acquire basic proficiency in reading and writing
in both the traditional and the simplified script at about the 500-character level. The relationship between lan-
guage and culture and the sociolinguistically appropriate use of language will be stressed throughout. Both audio
and video materials will be employed extensively.
Format of spoken classes: dialog performance, drills, communicative exercises. Format of written classes: oral
reading, questions and discussion in Chinese, translation and explanation in English. Evaluation is based on
classroom performance, homework, quizzes, unit tests, and an oral and written final exam.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 12 per section (expected: 10 per section). Preference given to first-years and
sophomores.
Credit granted only if both semesters and the winter study sustaining program are taken.

CHIN 152(F) Basic Taiwanese*
An introduction to Taiwanese, the majority language of Taiwan. Different varieties of this language, which is also
known as Amoy, Southern Min, Hokkien, and Fukienese, are spoken by over 60 million people in Taiwan,
southern Fujian, the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore. Suppressed by the Japanese from
1895-1945 and by the KMT Chinese government from 1945 through the 1970s, Taiwanese--in both its spoken
and written forms--has been experiencing a fascinating revival in recent years. This language, which is the most
divergent of all the major Chinese "dialects," is of special linguistic interest because it has preserved a number of
features of Old Chinese. Our focus will be on developing basic listening and speaking skills, though we will also
study some of the special characters used to write Taiwanese. Since students in the course will ordinarily possess
prior proficiency in Mandarin, a related language, we should be able to cover in one semester about as much as is
covered in the first two semesters of Mandarin.
Evaluation will be based on classroom performance, tests, and a final exam.
Prerequisites: Chinese 202 or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 12 (expected: 8).
Hour: TBA KUBLER
CHIN 201(F), 202(S) Intermediate Chinese*
These two courses are designed to consolidate the foundations built in Basic Chinese and continue developing
students' skills in aural comprehension, speaking, reading, and writing. Upon completion of the courses, students
Asian Studies

should be able to speak Chinese with fluency on everyday topics, reach a literacy level of 1000 characters
(approximately 1200 common words written in both traditional and simplified characters), read materials written
in simple Standard Written Chinese, and produce both orally and in writing short compositions on everyday
topics. Conducted in Mandarin.
Format: drill/discussion/reading. Evaluation will be based on classroom performance, homework, daily quizzes,
weekly written and oral tests, a midterm, and a final exam.
Prerequisites: Chinese 102 or permission of instructor. No enrollment limit (expected: 12 per section).

CHIN 219(S) Popular Culture in Modern China*
This course adopts a generic approach to introducing students to a variety of forms of popular culture in modern
and contemporary China. The forms of popular culture studied include popular readings (fiction, newspapers,
magazines), advertisements, propaganda posters, popular music, television shows, film, and popular religious
movements. We will explore such themes as the definitions of "popular culture," globalization and cultural
trends, the encoding and decoding strategies of a popular "text," as well as the political, ideological and sociolog-
ical messages behind a popular "text." All readings in English.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on in-class participation, oral presentations, two short re-
sponse papers, one midterm, and one final research project.
No prerequisites. No Chinese language required, though students with Chinese language background are en-
couraged to work with Chinese sources if they wish. No enrollment limit: (expected: 15). Open to all.

CHIN 301(F), 302(S) Upper-Intermediate Chinese*
Although the oral skills will continue to receive attention, there is at this level increased emphasis on reading and
writing. A major goal of the course will be developing students' reading proficiency in standard written Chinese,
the grammar and vocabulary of which differ considerably from the colloquial written Chinese which was
introduced during the first two years of instruction. About half of the course will be devoted to newspaper read-
ing, with the remainder consisting of several modules that may include short selections from modern Chinese
fiction, films, or other types of performance literature. Both simplified and traditional character texts will be used.
Conducted in Mandarin.
Requirements: three 50-minute classes plus a conversation session; primarily reading and discussion; students
are required to write a short essay every other week. Evaluation will be based on classroom performance, home-
work, quizzes, tests, and a final exam.

CHIN 412(S) Introduction to Classical Chinese*
Classical or "Literary" Chinese was the standard written language of China from around the seventh century BC
until the 1920s and served for many centuries as an important written language in Japan, Korea, and Vietnam as
well. Moreover, remnants of Classical Chinese are still used frequently in Modern Chinese, in both writing (e.g.,
newspaper, road signs and academic writing) and speech (e.g., proverbs and aphorisms). This course will serve
as an introduction to the basic grammar and vocabulary of Classical Chinese. We will focus on philosophical,
political, and historical anecdotes from works from the Spring and Autumn period (770-481 B.C.) through the
Han Dynasty (202 B.C. -220 A.D.), as they served as the foundation for the language. While the main objective
is to develop reading proficiency in Classical Chinese, the course will also serve to enhance proficiency in Mod-

JAPN 252(F) The Masks of Japanese Literature (Same as Comparative Literature 252)*
From the masks of the noh theater to science fiction fantasies of plastic surgery and cyborg identity, this course
examines the device of the mask in modern Japanese fiction, as well as some of its premodern antecedents. The
fictional masks we will look at range from the traditional to the technological, from the actual to the metaphori-
cal, from the physical to the purely psychological. But all of them are used by the authors to explore the nature of
identity, and the significance of concealing or revealing the self, either in fiction or face to face. Readings will
include modern novels and short stories by Abe Kôbô, Enchi Fumiko, Endô Shûsaku, Kurahashi Yumiko, Mis-
hima Yukio, Tanizaki Jun'ichirô, and Oscar Wilde. Visual texts will include noh and puppet theater, avant-garde
film by Teshigahara Hiroshi, comics by Tezuka Osamu, and animation by Oshii Mamoru. The class and the
readings are in English. No familiarity with Japanese language or culture is required.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: in-class exam, ungraded creative project, and two short papers (5-7

JAPN 255(S) Love and Death in Modern Japanese Literature (Same as Comparative
Literature 255)*
The initial thing that surprises many first-time readers of modern Japanese fiction is its striking similarity to
Western fiction. But equally surprising are the intriguing differences that lie concealed within that sameness. This
course charts these similarities and differences by reading Japanese fiction about love and death-two universal
human experiences that are nevertheless highly inflected by specific cultures. The course begins with tales of
doomed lovers that were popular in the eighteenth century kabuki and puppet theaters, and that still feature
prominently in Japanese popular culture, from comics to TV dramas. From there we move on to novels and films
that examine a range of other relationships between love and death, including parental love and sacrifice, martyr-
dom and love of country, sex and the occult, and romance at an advanced age. We will read novels and short
stories by canonical modern authors like Tanizaki, Kawabata, and Mishima as well as more contemporary fiction
by writers like Murakami Haruki; we will also look at some visual literature, including puppet theater, comics,
animation, and Japanese New Wave film.
The class and the readings are in English. No familiarity with Japanese language or culture is required.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: In-class exam, ungraded creative project, and two short papers (5-7

ASTRONOMY (Div. III)
Chair, Professor KAREN B. KWITTER
Professors: KWITTER, J. PASACHOFF. Observatory Supervisor/Instructor: SOUZA.
How long will the Sun shine? Are there planets like Earth among the many circling other stars? How did the
universe begin and how has it evolved over its 14 billion-year history? Astronomy is the science that asks and
tries to answer questions like these. We have come a long way toward understanding what makes the sky appear
as it does and how the Universe is fashioned. The Astronomy Department offers courses for anyone who is
interested in learning about the Universe, and who would like to be able to follow new astronomical discoveries
as they are made. All courses in Astronomy satisfy the Division III requirement. The Astrophysics major,
administered jointly with the Physics Department, and the Astronomy major, are described below.
The beginning astronomy courses are offered on two levels. Astronomy 101, 102, 104, and 330-range courses
are intended primarily for non-science majors, and have no prerequisite. Astronomy 111 is designed for students
with some exposure to or interest in physics. It has aprerequisite of one year of high school physics or permission
of the instructor, and a corequisite of Mathematics 104 or equivalent background in calculus.
Most of the astronomy courses take advantage of our observational and computational facilities including a
24" computer-controlled telescope with sensitive electronic detectors, and our own computer network for image
processing and data analysis. The Astronomy Department homepage can be found at http://www.williams.edu/
Astronomy.
ASTROPHYSICS MAJOR
The Astrophysics major is designed for students who want a rigorous introduction to the field, and includes
not only those who plan graduate study in astronomy, astrophysics, or a closely related area, but also those inter-
ested in a wide variety of careers. Alumni are not only astronomers but also computer scientists, geologists,
teachers, doctors, lawyers, business school professors, and so on. In recent years, many astrophysics majors have
had asecond major in fields as wide ranging as mathematics, geosciences, economics, and art history. This major
emphasizes the description of the Universe and its constituents in terms of physical processes. Potential Astro-
physics majors should consult early with members of the Astronomy and Physics Departments to determine
their most appropriate route to and through the major. An essential ingredient in such students' undergraduate
training is experience in physics and mathematics. Therefore, the major normally will begin in the first year a
student is at Williams with Physics 131, 141, or 151 and Mathematics 104 or 105 or 106 in the fall. Students with
very good background placing them out of Physics 142 and out of Mathematics 104 may choose to take Physics
201 and Mathematics 105 or 106 instead. Astronomy 111 will often be taken in the fall of the sophomore year;
however, many students take it in the fall of their first year at Williams, along with physics and math. Students
who might place out of physics courses should read the section on placement under Physics. Students who place
out of Physics 131 or 141 into Physics 142 or 151 should particularly consider taking Astronomy 111 in the fall
of their first year.
In addition to the major courses described below, other courses in geosciences, mathematics, and computer
science may also be appropriate.

The total number of courses required for the Astrophysics major, an interdisciplinary major, is eleven. Stu-
dents entering with Advanced Placement in physics and/or mathematics may obtain credit toward the major for
the equivalent of Physics 141 and/or Mathematics 104 and/or 105 or 106 taken elsewhere, but at least 8 courses
in astronomy, physics, and mathematics must be taken at Williams. There are some aspects of astrophysics that
are closely related to chemistry or geosciences. In recognition of this relation, certain advanced courses in those
departments can be accepted for credit toward the Astrophysics major on a two-for-one basis. It is not possible to
double major in Astrophysics and Physics.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN ASTROPHYSICS
The honors degree in Astrophysics will be awarded on the basis of a senior thesis presenting the results
of an original observational, experimental, or theoretical investigation carried out by the student under the
direction of a faculty member in Astronomy or Physics. There are no specific grade requirements (other
than College-wide requirements for remaining in good academic standing) for entry into the thesis research
program; however, a student wishing to do a thesis should have demonstrated both ability and motivation
for independent work in previous courses and in any earlier research involvement. Students doing theses
will normally choose a topic and an advisor early in the second semester of their junior year and usually
begin their thesis work during the summer. During the senior year, those students whose proposals have
been approved will elect two courses and a winter study project in addition to the minimum requirements
for the major. Preparation for the thesis will occupy at least one course (Astrophysics 493) and the winter
study project (Astrophysics 031). At the end of the winter study period, the departments will decide, in
consultation with each student, whether to admit that student to honors candidacy. Both a written thesis and
an oral presentation to faculty and fellow students are required. The degree with honors will be awarded to
those who meet these requirements with distinction. The degree with highest honors will be awarded to
those who fulfill the requirements with unusually high distinction.
The departments will be flexible with regard to the number and timing of courses devoted to thesis re-
search within the general guidelines of two courses and a winter study project over and above the minimum
major requirements and the written and oral presentations, especially in cases of students with advanced
standing and/or summer research experience. Students considering unusual requests are urged to consult
with potential advisors or the department chairs as early as possible.
ASTRONOMY MAJOR
The Astronomy major is designed for students with an interest in learning about many aspects of modern
astronomy, but who do not choose to take the advanced physics courses of the astrophysics major. It is also ap-
propriate as a second major for students concentrating in another field. The Astronomy major emphasizes under-
standing the observed properties of the physical systems that comprise the known Universe, from the Sun and
solar system, to the evolution of stars and star clusters, to the Milky Way Galaxy, to external galaxies and clusters
of galaxies. Because some knowledge of physics and calculus is necessary to understand many astronomical
phenomena, the Astronomy major requires the first two semesters each of the physics and calculus that are also
required of Physics majors and Astrophysics majors.
There are several possible routes through the Astronomy major, depending on preparation and interest. Stu-
dents considering a major in Astronomy should consult with members of the department early and often. A first-
year student, unsure about choosing between Astronomy and Astrophysics, may wish to take not only Astrono-
my 111 but also Physics 131, 141, or 151 and Mathematics 104 (if necessary) in the fall. Students who might
place out of physics courses should read the section on placement under Physics.

ASTRONOMY COURSES
COURSES FOR NON-MAJORS WITH NO PREREQUISITES
ASTR 101(F) Stars: From Suns to Black Holes
What makes a star shine? For how long will the Sun keep shining? What are black holes and how can they form?
Astronomy 101, a non-major, general introduction to the part of contemporary astronomy that includes how stars
form and how they end their existence, will provide answers to these questions and more. The course gives spe-
cial attention to the exciting discoveries of the past few years. Topics include modern astronomical instruments
such as the Hubble Space Telescope, the Spitzer Space Telescope, the Chandra X-ray Observatory, the new gen-
eration of 8- and 10-meter mountaintop telescopes, and results from them; how astronomers interpret the light
received from distant celestial objects; the Sun as a typical star (and how its future will affect ours); and our
modern understanding of how stars work and how they change with time. We will also discuss how pulsars and
black holes result from the evolution of normal, massive stars and how giant black holes are at the center of
galaxies and quasars. We will discuss the discovery of planets around stars other than the Sun. We regularly
discuss the latest news briefs and developments in astronomy and relate them to the topics covered in the course.
This course is independent of and on the same level as Astronomy 102 and 104, and students who have taken
those courses are welcome.
Observing sessions will include use of the 24 telescope and other telescopes for observations of stars, star clus-
ters, planets and their moons, nebulae, and galaxies, as well as daytime observations of the Sun.
Format: lecture (three hours per week), observing sessions (scattered throughout the semester), afternoon labs
(four times per semester), and a planetarium demonstration. Evaluation will be based on two hour tests, a final
exam, an observing portfolio, and laboratory reports.
No prerequisites. No enrollment limit (expected: 40). Non-major course.

ASTR 102(S) The Solar System--Our Planetary Home
What makes Earth different from all the other planets? Did Mars ever have running water? What is Pluto? Will
asteroids or comets collide with the Earth? What is a solar eclipse like? Astronomy 102, a non-major, general
introduction to the part of contemporary astronomy that comprises the study of the solar system, will provide
answers to these questions and more. We will cover the historical development of humanity's understanding of
the solar system, examining contributions by Aristotle, Ptolemy, Copernicus, Galileo, Newton, and others. We
will discuss the discovery of planets around stars other than the Sun. The course gives special attention to
exciting discoveries of the past few years by space probes and by the Hubble Space Telescope and the Spitzer
Space Telescope. We regularly discuss the latest news briefs and developments in astronomy and relate them to
the topics covered in the course. This course is independent of, and on the same level as Astronomy 101 and 104,

ASTR 336(S) Science, Pseudoscience, and the Two Cultures (Same as History of Science 336) (W)
A famous dichotomy between the sciences and the humanities, and public understanding of them, was laid down
by C. P. Snow and has been widely discussed, with ignorance of the second law of thermodynamics compared
with ignorance of Shakespeare. In this seminar, we will consider several aspects of science and scientific culture,
including how scientific thinking challenges the claims of pseudoscience. We will consider C. P. Snow and his
critics as well as the ideas about the Copernican Revolution and other paradigms invented by Thomas Kuhn. We
will discuss the recent "Science Wars" over the validity of scientific ideas. We will consider the fundamental
originators of modern science, including Tycho, Kepler, Galileo, and Newton, viewing their original works in the
Chapin Library of rare books and comparing their interests in science with what we now call pseudoscience, like
alchemy. We will review the history and psychology of astrology and other pseudosciences. Building on the
work of Martin Gardner in "Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science," and using the current journal "The
Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine," we consider from a scientific point of view what is now called com-
plementary or alternative medicine, including both older versions such as chiropractic and newer nonscientific
practices. We consider such topics as GM (genetically modified) foods, the safety and regulation of dietary sup-
plements, and the validity of government and other recommendations relevant to the roles of dietary salt and fat
in health. We consider the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) and reports of UFO's and aliens. We
consider the possible effects that superstitious beliefs have on the general public's cooperation in vaccination
programs and other consequences of superstition. We also consider the recently increased range of dramas that
are based on scientific themes, such as Tom Stoppard's Arcadia and Michael Frayn's Copenhagen.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on biweekly 5-page papers, participation in discussions, and a
15-page final paper.

ASTR 402(S) Between the Stars: The Interstellar Medium (W)
The matter between the stars--the interstellar medium--manifests itself in many interesting and unexpected
ways, and, as the detritus of stars, its properties and behavior hold clues to the history and future evolution of both
stars and the galaxies that contain them. Stars are accompanied by diffuse matter all through their lifetimes, from
their birthplaces in dense molecular clouds, to the stellar winds they eject with varying ferocity as they evolve, to
Astronomy, Astrophysics, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology
­ 94 ­
their final fates as they shed their outer layers, whether as planetary nebulae or dazzling supernovae. As these
processes go on, they enrich the interstellar medium with the products of the stars' nuclear fusion. The existence
of life on Earth is eloquent evidence of this chemical enrichment.
In this course we will study the interstellar medium in its various forms. We will discuss many of the physical
mechanisms that produce the radiation we observe from diffuse matter, including radiative ionization and
recombination, collisional excitation of "forbidden" lines, collisional ionization, and synchrotron radiation. This
course will be both writing- and observing-intensive. Weekly short papers will be assigned; these papers will be
thoroughly edited by the professor and returned so that comments can be absorbed for future submissions. In
class, students will present key ideas from the assigned reading and will solve relevant problems. Throughout the
semester students will also work in small groups to design, carry out, analyze, and critique their own
observations of the interstellar medium using the equipment on our observing deck.
Format: seminar/discussion, plus computer work and observing projects. Evaluation will be based on weekly
papers, class presentations/problem-solving, and observing projects.

Biochemistry and molecular biology are dynamic fields that lie at the forefront of science. Through elucida-
tion of the structure and function of biologically important molecules (such as nucleic acids, lipids, proteins, and
carbohydrates) these disciplines have provided important insights and advances in the fields of molecular engi-
neering (recombinant DNA technology, "intelligent" drug design, "in vitro evolution"), genomics and proteom-
ics, signal transduction, immunology, developmental biology, and evolution.
The Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Program is designed to provide students with an opportunity to
explore living systems in molecular terms. Biochemistry and molecular biology are at the interface between the
chemical and biological methods of looking at nature; therefore, the program draws heavily from these disci-
plines. While chemistry is concerned with the relationship between molecular structure and reactions, and biolo-
gy focuses on cells and organisms, biochemistry and molecular biology probe the details of the structures and
interactions of molecules in living systems in order to provide the foundation for a better understanding of bio-
logical molecules both individually and as members of more complex structures.
PROGRAM
While aspects of biochemistry and molecular biology can be very diverse, a common set of chemical and
biological principles underlie the more advanced topics. With this in mind, the program has been structured to
provide the necessary background in chemistry and biology and the opportunity to study the many facets of the
modern areas of the biochemical sciences. Students interested in the Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Pro-
gram should plan their course selection carefully. Since it is expected that Biochemistry 321 and 322 would be
taken in the junior year, students are advised to take the prerequisites for those courses in both chemistry and
biology during their first two years at Williams. While the program is open to all students, it is expected that it
will appeal primarily to majors in biology and chemistry because of the number of courses required in those
fields. In addition to taking the required courses, students planning to complete the Biochemistry and Molecular
Biology Program are strongly encouraged to elect courses in mathematics and physics.
Biochemistry and Molecular Biology

The following interdepartmental courses serve as the core of the Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Pro-
gram.
BIMO 321 and 322 provide a comprehensive introduction to biochemistry. BIMO 322 is a new requirement
and applies to 2007 graduates and beyond. BIMO 401, the capstone course for the concentration, provides stu-
dents the opportunity to examine the current scientific literature in a wide variety of BIMO-related research
areas.
BIMO 321(F) Biochemistry I--Structure and Function of Biological Molecules (Same as Biology
321 and Chemistry 321) (Q)
This course introduces the basic concepts of biochemistry with an emphasis on the structure and function of
biological macromolecules. Specifically, the structure of proteins and nucleic acids are examined in detail in or-
der to determine how their chemical properties and their biological behavior result from those structures. Other
topics covered include enzyme kinetics, mechanism and catalysis and regulation; the molecular organization of
biomembranes and membrane transport; and the principles of recombinant DNA technologies. In addition, the
principles and applications of the methods used to characterize macromolecules in solution and the interactions
between macromolecules are discussed. The laboratory provides an opportunity to study the structure of macro-
molecules and to learn the fundamental experimental techniques of biochemistry including electrophoresis and
chromatography.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, four hours per week. Evaluation will be based on three hour
exams, a final exam, problem sets and performance in the laboratories including lab reports.
Prerequisites: Biology 101 and Chemistry 251/255 and Chemistry 155/256. No enrollment limit (expected: 25).
Hour: 10:00-10:50 MWF Lab: 1-5 M,W,R KAPLAN
BIMO 322(S) Biochemistry II--Metabolism (Same as Biology 322 and Chemistry 322) (Q)
This lecture course provides an in-depth presentation of the complex metabolic reactions which are central to life.
Emphasis is placed on the biological flow of energy including alternative modes of energy generation (aerobic,
anaerobic, photosynthetic); the regulation and integration of the metabolic pathways including compartmental-
ization and the transport of metabolites; and biochemical reaction mechanisms including the structures and
mechanisms of coenzymes. This comprehensive study also includes the biosynthesis and catabolism of small
molecules (carbohydrates, lipids, amino acids, and nucleotides). Laboratory experiments introduce the principles
and procedures used to study enzymatic reactions, bioenergetics, and metabolic pathways.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, four hours per week. Evaluation will be based on several ex-
ams, an oral presentation, and performance in the laboratories including lab reports that emphasize conceptual
and mathematics analysis of the data generated.
Prerequisites: Biology 101 and Chemistry 251/255. No enrollment limit (expected: 36).

and molecular biology literature. Specific topics vary from year to year but are chosen to illustrate the importance
of a wide range of both biological and chemical approaches to addressing important questions in the biochemical
and molecular biological fields.
Format: seminar, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on class discussions and presentations, several
short papers, and a final paper.
Prerequisites: Biology 202 and BIMO 321. Enrollment limit: 12 (expected: 8). Preference given to those com-
pleting the BIMO program; open to others with permission of instructor.

To complete the concentration in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, a student must complete all of the
required courses listed below, take one elective not within the student's major from the list below, and at-
tend at least eight Biology and/or Chemistry Department colloquia. Since the Chemistry Department
counts two biology courses and the Biology Department counts two chemistry courses toward the majors
(each of which can be completed with only eight other courses), a student majoring in either chemistry or
biology would have to take only two or three additional courses to complete the program.

Bioinformatics, genomics, and proteomics are rapidly advancing fields that integrate the tools and knowledge
from biology, chemistry, computer science, mathematics, physics, and statistics in research at the intersection of
the biological and informational sciences. Inspired by the enormous amount of biological data that are being
generated from the sequencing of genomes, these new fields will help us pose and answer biological questions
that have long been considered too complex to address. Research in genomics, proteomics, and bioinformatics
will also significantly impact society affecting medicine, culture, economics, and politics.
The Bioinformatics, Genomics, and Proteomics curriculum involves faculty from the biology, chemistry,
computer science, mathematics/statistics, and physics departments and was designed to provide students with an
understanding of these revolutionary new areas of investigation. The introductory level courses, Computation
and biology and Statistics for Biologists are accessible to all students interested in gaining familiarity with the
power of genomic analysis. Students interested in graduate work in bioinformatics, genomics, and proteomics
should take the core courses and five of the recommended courses. Interested students are also encouraged to
participate in independent research with members of the advisory faculty as they explore the development of
these new fields.

The Biology curriculum has been designed to provide students with a broad base for understanding principles
governing life processes at all levels, from biochemistry and cell biology to physiology to ecology and behavior.
Courses emphasize fundamentals common to all subdisciplines including the coupling of structure to function,
the transfer of energy in living systems, communication, and the molding of diversity by the evolutionary pro-
cess. In upper-level courses and in independent and honors research, students have the opportunity to investigate
areas at the frontiers of modern biology.
Although the Biology major is specifically designed to provide a balanced curriculum in the broader context
of the liberal arts, it is also excellent preparation for graduate studies in the life sciences and in the health profes-
sions.
MAJOR REQUIREMENTS
In order to make the major accessible to students with diverse interests, required courses are kept to a mini-
mum. The Biology major is satisfied by nine courses, as follows:
Biology 101 The Cell
Biology 102 The Organism
Biology 202 Genetics
Any two 300-level courses, each of which must have a laboratory associated with it.
Any one 400-level course other than 493-494.
Any other three courses or any other two courses and two semesters of Organic Chemistry.
NOTE: Independent study courses and AMS 311 (Same as Biology 231) do not fulfill the 300-level or
400-level course requirements. WIOX 216, Biology: Evolution, in the Williams Oxford Program qualifies
for major credit.
Distribution Requirement
In order to ensure that majors broaden their knowledge of biology, one of the elective courses for the major
must include an upper-level course covering biological processes at levels of organization above the cell. Courses
that satisfy this distribution requirement are indicated in the individual course description.
COURSE SELECTION AND PLACEMENT
It is preferable for students who plan to major in biology, or think they may be interested in doing so, to take
Biology 101, 102 during their first year at Williams. It is also possible to begin the Biology major during the
sophomore year, although students should understand that it may require taking two or more biology courses
during several semesters.
Students interested in biology, whether or not they intend to major in it, are encouraged to take Biology 101,
102. It is also possible, with permission of the instructor, to take Biology 203 Ecology, Biology 204 Animal Be-
havior, Biology 220 Field Botany and Biology 225 Natural History of the Berkshires without prerequisite. Other
100-level biology courses are designed specifically for students who do not intend to take additional upper-level
courses in biology. All of these courses satisfy the Division III distribution requirement; in addition, Biology 134
satisfies the Peoples and Cultures distribution requirement.
Beginning students should normally enroll in Biology 101 and 102. Students with unusually strong back-
grounds in biology, such as those with outstanding performance on the College Board Biology Advanced Place-
ment Test, may be permitted to elect a sophomore-level course in lieu of Biology 101 and/or Biology 102 upon
successful completion of a departmental qualifying exam, administered during First Days.
COURSES RELATED TO THE BIOLOGY MAJOR
Students planning to pursue their interest in biology and related fields after completing their undergraduate
degrees are strongly encouraged to take one year of chemistry, at least one semester of mathematics (a course in
statistics is recommended), and one semester of physics. Students may wish to check the requirements for gradu-
ate admission at relevant universities, and are also encouraged to consult with the Biology Department's graduate
school advisor about prerequisites for admission to graduate programs.
BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
Students interested in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (BIMO) should consult the general statement un-
der Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.
BIOINFORMATICS, GENOMICS AND PROTEOMICS
Students interested in Bioinformatics, Genomics and Proteomics (BiGP) should consult the general statement
under Bioinformatics, Genomics and Proteomics. Biology majors interested in this field are strongly encouraged
to enroll in Integrative Bioinformatics, Genomics, and Proteomics (Biology 319).
NEUROSCIENCE
Students interested in Neuroscience (NSCI) should consult the general statement under Neuroscience.

ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
Students interested in Environmental Studies (ENVI) should consult the general statement under Environ-
mental Studies.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN BIOLOGY
In order to be recommended for the degree with honors, a Biology major is normally expected to have com-
pleted the equivalent of two semesters and a winter study (031) of independent research culminating in a thesis
which demonstrates outstanding achievement of an original and innovative nature. Although the presentation of
a thesis and associated oral presentation in the fall and poster defense in the spring are required for consideration
for a degree with honors, their completion should not be interpreted as a guarantee of a degree with honors. The
principal considerations in admitting a student to the program of independent honors research will be mastery of
fundamental material and skills, ability to pursue independent study successfully, and demonstrated interest and
motivation. Students interested in participating in the honors program should consult with the department early in
the spring semester of the junior year; approval must be received before spring registration in the junior year.
The minimum course requirements for a degree with honors in Biology are Biology 101, Biology 102, Biolo-
gy 202, two 300-level biology courses (each of which must have a laboratory associated with it), one 400-level
biology course, Biology 493, Biology 494, WSP 031, and any other two courses in biology (or any other one
course and two semesters of Organic Chemistry).
In addition to the normal honors route, which includes two semesters (Biology 493-494) and a winter study of
research (WSP 031) during senior year, students have the option,subject to the approval of their thesis advisor, to
begin the honors research during winter study junior year or during the second semester junior year. Students
beginning honors in winter study of junior year would take Biology 494 in the spring of their junior year fol-
lowed by Biology 493 in the fall of their senior year; students beginning honors during the second semester of
junior year would take Biology 494 that semester, followed by Biology 493 in the fall of senior year and winter
study research in the winter of the senior year.
STUDY ABROAD
Students planning on majoring in Biology are strongly advised to take Biology 202 before going abroad, since
Biology 202 is required for the major and a prerequisite for many upper-level courses; a Genetics course taken
while studying away cannot substitute for Biology 202. Biology majors studying abroad may receive credit to-
ward the major for at most two 200-level electives; the departmental distribution requirement can be satisfied
through an appropriate course taken during study abroad. Students should meet with the Department Chair to
discuss study abroad options.
CREDIT FOR COURSES AT OTHER INSTITUTIONS
Students who enroll in study away programs may receive credit for up to two 200-level electives towards the
biology major upon approval of the course syllabi by the Biology Department Chair.
Students wishing to satisfy prerequisites for courses offered by the Biology Department with courses taken at
other institutions should consult, in person, with a member of the Biology Department, prior to registering for the
course that requires a prerequisite. Such consultations will include a review of the course syllabi and the tran-
scripts of the relevant previous college work, and students should bring these materials with them.

BIOL 204(F) Animal Behavior
Making sense of what we see while watching animals closely is both an enthralling pastime and a discipline that
draws on many aspects of biology. Explanations can be found on many levels: evolutionary theory tells us why
certain patterns have come to exist, molecular biology can help us understand how those patterns are
implemented, neuroscience gives insights as to how the world appears to the behaving animal, endocrinology
provides information on how suites of behaviors are regulated. The first part of the course focuses upon how
descriptive studies provide the basis for formulating questions about behavior as well as the statistical methods
used to evaluate the answers to these questions. We then consider the behavior of individuals, both as it is
mediated by biological mechanisms and as it appears from an evolutionary perspective. The second half of the
course is primarily concerned with the behaviors of groups of animals from a wide variety of vertebrate and
invertebrate species, concentrating upon the stimuli, responses, and internal mechanisms that maintain social
systems and on the selection pressures that drive animals toward a particular social system.
Format: lecture/laboratory, six hours per week. Evaluation will be based on examinations, lab reports, and a
research paper.
Prerequisites: Biology 102, or Psychology 101, or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 32 (expected: 32).

BIOL 210T(S) Evo-Devo: The Evolution of Animal Design (W)
What makes a bird a bird and a frog a frog? The key to understanding the mechanisms that generate biological
form and diversity lies in a new and rapidly growing field, termed "evo-devo," that represents a synthesis of
evolution and development. This course, designed specifically for sophomores, aims to explore evo-devo in de-
tail by building on material introduced in Biology 102. Using readings from the primary literature, the course will
consider topics such as how the modification of developmental mechanisms can create novel traits, why some
traits are resistant to change, how the determination of shared ancestral traits differs from those that rise indepen-
dently, and how ecological considerations impact development to modulate evolutionary change.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: after an initial group meeting, students meet weekly with a tutorial partner and
the instructor for an hour each week. Each student will write and present orally a 5-page paper every other week
on the readings assigned for that week. In alternate weeks the students will question and critique the work of their

BIOL 308(F) Integrative Plant Biology: Fundamentals and New Frontiers
Plants are one of the most successful groups of organisms on Earth and have a profound impact on all life. Suc-
cessful use of plants in addressing global problems and understanding their role in natural ecosystems depends
on fundamental knowledge of the molecular mechanisms by which they grow, develop, and respond to their
environment. This course will examine the molecular physiology of plants using an integrative approach that
considers plants as dynamic, functional units in their environment. Major emphasis will be on understanding
fundamental plant processes, such as photosynthesis, growth and development, water transport, hormone physi-
ology, and flowering, from the molecular to the organismal level. Environmental effects on these processes will
be addressed in topics including photomorphogenesis, stress physiology, mineral nutrition, and plant-microbe
interactions. Discussions of original research papers will examine the mechanisms plants use to perform these
processes and explore advances in the genetic engineering of plants for agricultural, environmental, and medical
purposes. Laboratory activities stress modern approaches and techniques used in investigating plant physiologi-
cal processes.
Format: lecture/discussion/laboratory, six hours per week. Evaluation will be based on lab reports, a term paper,

Bioterrorism and the alarming spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria are but two of the reasons for the renewed
emphasis on the biology of microorganisms. This course will examine microbes from the perspectives of cell
structure and function, genetics, and evolution. A major theme will be the adaptation of bacteria as they evolve to
fill specific ecological niches, with an emphasis on microbe: host interactions that lead to pathogenesis. We will
consider communication among bacteria as well as between bacteria and their environment. Topics include: mi-
crobial development, stress response, bioremediation, bacteriophages, subversion of the immune defenses, and
genomics. In the lab, students will examine the regulation of bacterial gene expression, horizontal gene transfer,
the isolation and characterization of bacteria from natural environment, and carry out independent projects.
Readings will be supplemented by articles from the primary literature.

BIOL 319(F) Integrative Bioinformatics, Genomics, and Proteomics Lab (Same as Chemistry 319,
Computer Science 319, Mathematics 319 and Physics 319) (Q)
What can computational biology teach us about cancer? In this capstone experience for the Genomics, Proteom-
ics, and Bioinformatics program, computational analysis and wet-lab investigations will inform each other, as
students majoring in biology, chemistry, computer science, mathematics/statistics, and physics contribute their
own expertise to explore how ever-growing gene and protein data-sets can provide key insights into human dis-
ease. In this course, we will take advantage of one well-studied system, the highly conserved Ras-related family
of proteins, which play a central role in numerous fundamental processes within the cell. The course will inte-
grate bioinformatics and molecular biology, using database searching, alignments and pattern matching, and re-
combinant DNA techniques to reconstruct the evolution of the RAS gene family by focusing on the gene dupli-
cation events and gene rearrangements that have occurred over the course of eukaryotic speciation. By utilizing
high through-put approaches to investigate genes involved in various signal transduction pathways, students will
identify pathways that are aberrantly activated in mammalian cell lines carrying a mutant, constantly active Ras
protein. This functional genomic strategy will be coupled with microscopic examination of tissue sections from a
variety of human colon tumors, using phosphorylation-state specific antisera, to test our hypotheses. Proteomic
analysis will introduce the students to de novo structural prediction and threading algorithms, as well as data-
mining approaches to identify specific amino acids involved in protein-protein contacts. Phage display and mass
spectrometry will be used to study networks of interacting proteins in normal colon and colon tumor tissue. For-
mat: lab, with one-hour of lecture per week. Evaluation will be based on lab participation and several short pa-
pers/lab reports.

BIOL 413(S) Molecular Basis of Biological Clocks
Circadian rhythms have been described in all organisms studied, including humans, a wide range of other euka-
ryotes and several prokaryotes. With periods of about 24 hours, these rhythms regulate biochemical, cellular,
physiological and behavioral activities. Circadian rhythms are generated by cellular clocks--genetically deter-
mined internal pacemakers that maintain their oscillations in the absence of environmental cues but may be reset
by periodicities in the environment, especially the light-dark cycle. Only recently have we begun to understand
how circadian rhythms are generated and controlled at the cellular level. This course will explore the basic
biochemical features of biological clocks with the aim of understanding their crucial role in regulating key bio-
logical parameters, such as enzyme levels, levels of hormones and other regulatory molecules, and activity and
sleep cycles. Class discussions will focus on readings in the original literature.
Format: discussion, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on class participation and several short pa-

genetics to a variety of heritable phenomena that fall under the heading of epigenetics, heritable changes that do
not result from an alteration in DNA sequence. Research reveals that stable changes in cell function can result
from, for example, stable changes in protein conformation, protein modification, DNA methylation, or the loca-
tion of a molecule within the cell. Using readings from the primary literature, we will explore the epigenetic
nature and molecular mechanisms underlying a diverse array of phenomena such as prion propagation, genetic
imprinting, dosage compensation, transvection, centromere formation, synapse function, and programmed ge-
nome rearrangements. The significance of epigenetic processes for development, evolution, and human health
will be discussed.
Format: discussion, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on class participation and several short pa-
pers.
Prerequisites: Biology 202. Enrollment limit: 12 (expected: 12). Open to sophomores, juniors and seniors, with
preference given to senior Biology majors who have not taken a 400-level course, then to juniors.

MAJOR
Through a variety of individual courses and sequential programs, the department provides an opportunity for
students to explore the nature and significance of chemistry, an area of important achievement in our quest for
knowledge about ourselves and the world around us. The student of chemistry is able to become aware of the
special viewpoint of chemists, the general nature of chemical investigation, some of its important results, how
these results are expressed, and something of their significance within the fields of science and in the area of
human endeavor as a whole. The Chemistry major provides excellent preparation for graduate study in chemis-
try, biochemistry, chemical engineering, environmental science, materials science, medicine, and the medical
sciences.
A major in chemistry can be achieved in several ways, preferably beginning in the student's first year at Wil-
liams, but also beginning in the sophomore year. Building on a foundation in general chemistry, organic chemis-
try, and physical chemistry, a student elects additional advanced courses to complete a major that is consistent
with his or her background in other sciences, interests, and goals. A student's program might emphasize bio-
chemistry, organic chemistry, physical chemistry, or inorganic chemistry, with additional courses available in
analytical chemistry, environmental science, and materials science. Students considering a major in chemistry
should consult with a member of the department as early as possible in order to plan a program which best suits
their interests and abilities and which makes full use of their previous preparation.
All students begin their study in the department with either Chemistry 151, 153, or 155. Placement at the
introductory level is based upon performance on the departmental placement test results and consultation with
the chair; results of the College Board Advanced Placement Test or the International Baccalaureate Exam are
also taken into account. The first year is completed with Chemistry 156. In the second year at the introductory
level, students take Chemistry 251 (or 255) and Chemistry 256 (those students who complete 155 are exempted
from 256). Completion of a Chemistry major requires either nine semester chemistry courses or eight semester
chemistry courses plus two approved courses from among the following: Biology 101; Computer Science 134;
Mathematics 103, 104, 105, 106; Physics 131, 141; or any courses in these departments for which the approved
courses are prerequisites. Starting at the 300 level, at least three of the courses taken must have a laboratory com-
ponent, and at least one must be selected from Chemistry 361, 366, 364, or 367. (The specific course elected, in
consultation with the chair or major advisor, will depend on the student's future plans.) In addition, the depart-
ment has a number of "Independent Research Courses" which, while they do not count toward completion of the
major, provide a unique opportunity to pursue an independent research project under the direction of a faculty
member.

For the purpose of assisting students in selecting a program consistent with their interests and possible
continuation of their studies at the graduate level, the following groupings of electives and faculty
advisors are suggested. However, a case can be made for selecting courses from the different groups.
Biochemistry: Chemistry 321, Chemistry 322, Chemistry 324, Chemistry 341, Chemistry 364, Chemistry
367. Students interested in biochemistry should consult with Professors Gehring, Kaplan, or Lovett.
Organic Chemistry: Chemistry 341, Chemistry 342, Chemistry 344, Chemistry 364, Chemistry 361,
Chemistry 366. Students interested in organic chemistry should consult with Professors Goh, Richardson,
or Smith.
Physical and Inorganic Chemistry: Chemistry 332, Chemistry 335, Chemistry 361, Chemistry 364, Chem-
istry 366, Chemistry 368T. Students interested in physical chemistry should consult with Professors Bin-
gemann, Peacock-López, or Thoman. Students interested in inorganic chemistry should consult with Pro-
fessor Park. Students interested in materials science should consult with Professors Goh or Park.
While any accepted route through the major would permit a student to proceed to graduate study in
chemistry, four electives should be considered a minimum, and at least a semester of research is
strongly recommended.
The department is accredited by the American Chemical Society (A.C.S.), a professional body of aca-
demic, industrial, and research chemists. The A.C.S. suggests the following courses for someone con-
sidering graduate study or work in chemistry or a related area: 151 (153 or 155), 156, 251 (255), 256,
335, 361, 364, 366, 493-494; and at least two courses from 321, 322, 342, 344, 368T, BIMO 401.
Students completing these courses are designated Certified A.C.S. Majors.
BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY (BIMO)
Students interested in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology should consult with the general statement under
the Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Program (BIMO) in the Courses of Instruction. Students interested in
completing the BIMO program are also encouraged to complete the biochemistry courses within the chemistry
major by taking 321, 322, 324, and 367 in addition to the first and second year required courses.
BIOINFORMATICS, GENOMICS, AND PROTEOMICS (BiGP)
Students interested in Bioinformatics, Genomics, and Proteomics should consult the general statement under
Bioinformatics, Genomics, and Proteomics in the Courses of Instruction. Students interested in these areas are
also encouraged to complete the biochemistry courses within the chemistry major by taking 319, 321, 322, 324
and 367 in addition to the first and second year required courses.
MATERIALS SCIENCE
Students interested in Materials Science are encouraged to elect courses from the Materials Science program
offered jointly with the Physics Department, and should consult that listing.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN CHEMISTRY
The degree with honors in Chemistry provides students with an opportunity to undertake an independent re-
search project under the supervision of a faculty member, and to report on the nature of the work in two short oral
presentations and in a written thesis.
Chemistry majors who are candidates for the degree with honors take the following in addition to a major
outlined above:
Chemistry 493-W31-494 Senior Research and Thesis
The principal considerations in admitting a student to a program of independent research are mastery of fun-
damental materials and skills, ability to pursue independent study successfully, and demonstrated student interest
and motivation. In addition, to enroll in these courses leading to a degree with honors, a student must have at least
a B- average in all chemistry courses or the permission of the chair. At the end of the first semester of the senior
year, the department reviews the student's progress and determines whether the student is a candidate for a de-
gree with honors. The designation of a degree with honors in Chemistry or a degree with highest honors in
Chemistry is based primarily on a departmental evaluation of the accomplishments in these courses and on the
quality of the thesis. Completion of the research project in a satisfactory manner and preparation of a well-written
thesis usually results in a degree with honors. In cases where a student has demonstrated unusual commitment
and initiative resulting in an outstanding thesis based on original results, combined with a strong record in all of
his or her chemistry courses, the department may elect to award a degree with highest honors in Chemistry.
EXCHANGE AND TRANSFER STUDENTS
Students from other institutions wishing to register for courses in chemistry involving college-level prerequi-
sites should do so in person with a member of the Chemistry Department. Registration should take place by
appointment during the spring semester prior to the academic year in which courses are to be taken. Students are
requested to have with them transcripts of the relevant previous college work.
COURSES FOR NON-MAJORS WITH NO PREREQUISITES
Students with principal interests outside of the sciences may extend a secondary school foundation in chemis-
try by electing a basic two-semester introductory course of a general nature or they may elect semester courses
designed for non-majors. All courses in chemistry satisfy the divisional distribution requirement.
STUDY ABROAD
Students who wish to complete a chemistry major (or chemistry requirements for pre-medical study)
as well as to study abroad during their junior year are encouraged to begin taking chemistry in their first
semester at Williams, and should consult with members of the department as early as possible.

CHEM 115(S) AIDS: The Disease and Search for a Cure
Since the discovery of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) in 1983, modern techniques of molecular
biology have revealed much about its structure and life cycle. The intensity of the scientific investigation directed
at HIV-1 is unprecedented in history. We now know more about this virus than any other known pathogen. How-
ever, the early optimism concerning the prospects for an effective AIDS vaccine has now waned and HIV strains
that are resistant to drug therapies are common. We are now nearly three decades into the AIDS pandemic and
the World Health Organization estimates that there are more than 40 million HIV-infected persons worldwide.
After an introduction to chemical structure, we examine the molecular biology of the HIV virus, the molecular
targets of anti-HIV drugs, and the prospects for a cure. We discuss the origin of HIV-1 and HIV-2, and look at
how HIV-1 interacts with the human immune system. We also discuss both old and new methods of vaccine
development and the prospects for making an effective AIDS vaccine.
This course is designed for the non-science major who does not intend to pursue a career in the natural sciences.
Format: lecture, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on problem sets, a midterm, quizzes, a final
exam, and a paper/discussion.

CHEM 341(S) Toxicology and Cancer (Same as Environmental Studies 341)
What is a poison and what makes it poisonous? Paracelcus commented in 1537: "What is not a poison? All
things are poisons (and nothing is without poison). The dose alone keeps a thing from being a poison." Is the
picture really this bleak; is modern technology-based society truly swimming in a sea of toxic materials? How
are the nature and severity of toxicity established, measured and expressed? Do all toxic materials exert their
effect in the same manner, or can materials be poisonous in a variety of different ways? Are the safety levels set
by regulatory agencies low enough for a range of common toxic materials, such as mercury, lead, and certain
pesticides? How are poisons metabolized and how do they lead to the development of cancer? What is cancer
and what does it take to cause it? What biochemical defense mechanisms exist to counteract the effects of poi-
sons?
This course attempts to answer these questions by surveying the fundamentals of modern chemical toxicology

and the induction and progression of cancer. Topics will range from description and quantitation of the toxic
response, including risk assessment, to the basic mechanisms underlying toxicity, mutagenesis, carcinogenesis,
and DNA repair. A basic understanding of organic chemistry will be required.

the formal and quantitative link between the properties of single molecules and the thermodynamic and kinetic
behavior of macroscopic collections of molecules. Rate laws, molecular dynamics, and transport properties are
discussed. Applications of these principles are chosen from a variety of areas, including polymer chemistry, bio-
chemistry, photochemistry, and solid and liquid state chemistry. Quantitative laboratory experiments and con-
sultation with the scientific literature provide the background necessary for carrying out an independent theoreti-
cal or experimental project.

The course offerings in Classics enable students to explore the ancient Greek, Roman, and Greco-Roman
worlds from various perspectives: art, archaeology, philosophy, religion, and especially literature and history.
Courses are of two types: language (Greek and Latin) and translation (Classical Civilization). The 100-level lan-
guage courses are intensive introductions to Greek and Latin grammar; the 200-level language courses combine
comprehensive grammar review with readings from Greek or Latin texts of pivotal historical periods; the
400-level language courses explore in depth selected authors or topics and the methods of analysis appropriate to
each of them. Courses in which texts are read in translation provide both introductory surveys and opportunities
for more specialized study of the ancient Greco-Roman world from earliest historical times through late antiqui-
ty.
MAJOR
Majors and prospective majors are encouraged to consult with the department's faculty to ensure a well-bal-
anced and comprehensive selection of Classics courses appropriate to their individual interests. A course or
courses in ancient history are strongly recommended. Majors may also benefit from advice on courses offered in
other departments which would complement their particular interests in Classics. A reading knowledge of
French, German, and Italian is useful for any study in Classics and is required in at least two of these modern
languages by graduate programs in classics, ancient history, classical art and archaeology, and medieval studies.
The department offers two routes to the major: Classics and Classical Civilization.
Classics: (1) Six courses in Greek and/or Latin, with at least two 400-level courses in one language; (2)
Three additional courses, elected from the offerings in Greek, Latin, or Classical Civilization or from ap-
proved courses in other departments.
Classical Civilization: (1) Either Classics 101 or 102 and either Classics 222, 223, or 323; (2) Three
additional courses from the offerings in Classical Civilization or from approved courses in other depart-
ments. (3) Three courses in Greek or Latin with at least one at the 400 level, or four courses in Latin at any
level; (4) A senior independent study is normally required to complete the Classical Civilization major.
Several of the courses elected, including the independent study, should relate to each other in such a way as
to reflect a concentration on a particular genre, period, or problem of Greek and Roman civilization, includ-
ing topics in ancient art and archaeology, religion in the Greco-Roman world, and ancient philosophy.
Appropriate courses from other departments or from approved study abroad programs may be elected for the
major, with the approval of the Chair of Classics. Approval may depend on the specific shape of an individual's
major. Examples of such courses at Williams, which may vary from year to year, are ArtH 412 (Monsters and
Narrative: Greek Architectural Sculpture), ArtH 224 (Romanesque and Gothic Art and Architecture), Religion
201 (The Hebrew Bible), Religion 212 (The Development of Christianity), History 225 (The Middle Ages), and
Political Science/Philosophy 231 (Ancient Political Theory).
Senior Colloquium:Senior majors are required to enroll in CLAS 499 in both semesters. The topics and activ-
ities of this colloquium, which meets about every other week, vary according to the interests of the participants.
Junior majors are also encouraged to participate.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN CLASSICS
Students who wish to be considered for the degree with honors will normally present a thesis or pursue ap-
propriate independent study in the fall and winter study of their senior year. The thesis or independent study
offers students the opportunity to work in depth on a topic of their choosing and to apply and develop the tech-
niques and critical methods with which they have become acquainted during their regular course work. It may
Classics
­ 111 ­
also include relevant work with members of other departments. In order to write a thesis, students normally must
have aminimum GPA of 3.3 in their major courses and must submit a thesis proposal before the end of the spring
semester of their junior year that earns departmental approval. To be awarded the degree with honors in Classics,
the student is required to have taken a minimum of ten semester courses in the department (not including the
thesis or independent study) and to have demonstrated original or superior ability in studies in the field both
through course work and through the thesis or equivalent independent study.
COURSE NUMBERING SYSTEM
Language Courses: The numbering of courses through the 300 level reflects the prerequisites involved. The
only prerequisite for any 400-level course is Greek 201 or Latin 302, or equivalent language preparation. The
numbering of the 400-level courses partially reflects the order in which they are offered over a two-year period
for Greek and a three-year period for Latin. It also indicates a good order in which to take the 400-level courses
but not an essential order, and individual students may enter the sequence at any point. While not every student
will take every course, the rotation of 400-level courses is arranged to permit exposure, in a three- to four-year
period, to most of the important periods and genres of classical studies.
Classical Civilization Courses: The numbering of these courses often suggests a recommended but rarely
necessary sequence of study within a given area of classical studies. Most of the translation courses do not as-
sume prior experience in Classics or a cross-listed field.
STUDY ABROAD
We strongly encourage Classics majors to study abroad in their junior year, at programs in Italy (especially the
semester-length program at the Intercollegiate Center for Classical Studies in Rome), at programs in Greece (es-
pecially the College Year in Athens, which students need only attend for one semester), and in the Williams at
Oxford Program. Our majors have also had excellent Classics experiences in other study-abroad programs in
Italy and Greece and at various universities in Europe and the United Kingdom. In addition, we encourage stu-
dents to take advantage of opportunities available in the summer: study abroad programs in Italy and Greece,
archaeological digs, or even carefully planned individual travel to sites in Greece, Italy or other areas of the an-
cient Greco-Roman world. When the college cannot do so, the department may be able to provide some financial
support for summer study abroad. So that students may learn more about all these opportunities, as well as how
best to prepare for them, the department holds open meetings twice each year. The department's faculty are al-
ways available to advise students, the chair has materials to share, and students can visit the department's website
for information and links to helpful internet sites.
CLASSICAL CIVILIZATION
CLAS 101(F) The Trojan War (Same as Comparative Literature 107) (W)
"The Trojan War" may or may not have taken place near the end of the Bronze Age (c1100), but it certainly
provided poets, visual artists, historians, philosophers, and many others in archaic and classical Greece (750-320)
with a rich discourse in which to engage questions about gender, exchange, desire, loss, and remembrance, and
about friendship, marriage, family, army, city-state and religious cult. This discourse of "The Trojan War"
attained a remarkable coherence yet also thrived on substantial variations and changes over the 300-400 years of
Greek literature we will explore, a dynamic of change and continuity that has persisted through the more than
two millenia of subsequent Greek, Roman, Western, and non-Western participation in this discourse. More than
half the course will be devoted to the Homeric Iliad and Odyssey, after which we will read brief selections from
lyric poetry (e.g. Sappho of Lesbos) and then several tragedies (e.g. Aeschylus' Oresteia, Sophocles' Ajax, and
Euripides' Trojan Women). Depending on time and on the particular interests of the class, we may briefly
consider a few short selections from other ancient Greek and Roman authors and/or one or two modern poets.
We will also watch several films, e.g.Troy, Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?, Gods and Monsters, Fight Club, In the
Bedroom, Grand Illusion, Zorba the Greek.
Format: discussion with short lectures. Evaluation will be based on a series of short papers involving close
textual analysis, two 5-page papers, and contributions to class discussion.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference given to first-year students and sophomores,
and to majors in Classics and Comparative Literature. Not open to students who have taken Classics
101/Comparative Literature 107, Greek Literature, or Classics 224/Women's and Gender Studies
224/Comparative Literature 244, Helen, Desire and Language.
Hour: 2:35-3:50 MR HOPPIN
CLAS 102(S) Roman Literature: Foundations and Empire (Same as Comparative Literature 108)
In the first book of Vergil'sAeneid, the god Jupiter prophesies the foundation and the greatness of Rome: "I place
no limits on their fortunes and no time; I grant them empire without end." Yet elsewhere in this epic account of
Rome's origins, this promise of unlimited power for the descendants of Romulus seems to be seriously abridged.
Some readers have seen, not only in the Aeneid but throughout classical Roman literature, a persistent tendency
to inscribe the decay and disintegration of Roman power into the very works that proclaim and celebrate Roman
preeminence. This course explores the ancient Romans' own interpretations of their past, their present, and their
destiny: the humble beginnings of their city, its rise to supreme world power, and premonitions of its decline.
Related topics for our consideration will include Roman constructions of gender, the location and expression of
virtue in public and private spheres, the connections and conflicts between moral probity and political success,
the exercise of individual power versus action on behalf of the commonwealth, the absorption of foreign customs
and peoples into Rome, the management of literal and imaginary frontiers, and other anxieties of empire. We will
read selections and complete works by a wide variety of Roman authors, including Cicero, Catullus, Caesar,
Vergil, Sallust, Horace, Ovid, Seneca, and Tacitus. All readings will be in translation.
Format: discussion/lecture. Evaluation will be based on short written assignments, midterm and final exams with
essays, and contributions to class discussion.

CLAS 103(S) Greek and Roman Drama: Renewal and Transformation (Same as Comparative
Literature 109 and Theatre 311)
The reading list for this course includes many of the major tragedies of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides,
several comedies of Aristophanes, a representative sampling of Greek and Roman New Comedy (Menander,
Plautus, Terence), and a play of Seneca. One focus of the course will be on themes of renewal and transforma-
tion, whether with reference to the plays themselves or to the ongoing process by which drama, whether ancient
or modern, undergoes constant metamorphosis as it is performed and reworked in different times and places. In
keeping with this latter emphasis we shall read several twentieth-century plays based on ancient myth or ancient
models (Anouilh's Antigone, Sartre's The Flies, Fugard's The Island, Kane's Phaedra's Love), and students will
be encouraged to create their own transformations of ancient myth and ancient models in media of their own
choosing.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on contributions to class discussion, submission of weekly
one-page response papers, a 5- to 10-page paper, a creative project, and mid-term and final exams. Students
taking the course as Theater 311 will be expected to undertake an additional project, to be determined in con-
sultation with the instructor.

Reading of selections from Hesiod and from Plato, combined with grammar review. The primary goal of this
course is to develop fluency in reading Greek. We will also read the texts closely to explore important continui-
ties and changes in Greek culture between the archaic and classical periods. The emphasis will vary from year to
year, but possible subjects to be explored include: the education and socialization of the community's children
and young adults; religion and cult practices; the performative aspects of epic (and choral) poetry and of prose
genres like oratory and the philosophical dialogue; traditional oral poetry and storytelling and the growth of liter-
acy; the construction of woman, of man; the development of the classical polis.

CLGR 402(S) Homer: The Odyssey
From the early archaic era through the classical and beyond, Homer's Iliad and Odyssey simultaneously
influenced and reflected Greek conceptions of community, leadership, war, heroism, family, loyalty, the gods,
justice, and much more. Nearly all of subsequent Greek literature, both poetry and prose, developed dialogue
with these early epic texts. In this course we will read extensive selections from the Odyssey in Greek and the
entire epic in translation, focusing on the oral tradition and societal background in which it is rooted and on the
unique structure and character of the poem itself.
Format: recitation/discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, oral reports, a midterm and final
exams, and a final paper.
Prerequisites: Greek 201 or permission of instructor. Greek 402 is offered alternately as a course on the Iliad and

This course will explore the development of Greek lyric poetry from the eighth to the fifth centuries BCE. Begin-
ning with Archilochus, Sappho, and Alcaeus, and proceeding through such poets as Solon, Anacreon, Ibycus,
and Theognis, we will examine the formal, social, and performative contexts of lyric, the influence of epic and
choral poetry on the evolution of the genre, and the difficulties of evaluating a fragmentary corpus. Finally, we
will explore the influence of political and economic changes in the early fifth century on the work of Simonides.
The goal throughout is to investigate the structures, innovations, and problems of poetic self-expression in early
Greek poetry.

CLLA 405(S) Livy and Tacitus: Myth, Scandal, and Morality in Ancient Rome
Mythical stories of Rome's founding, which were formulated by many generations of Roman authors and public
figures, simultaneously served as a framework for these very thinkers to analyze and articulate Roman self-
image in rich and creative ways; one who stands out among these figures is the Augustan historian Livy. The
"second founding" of the Republic by Augustus, and the careers of his successors, in turn gave later Roman
writers like Tacitus fresh inspiration for Roman self-imagining and self-analysis.
We will begin the semester in mythical Rome, reading selections from Book 1 of Livy's history which present
figures like Aeneas, the Trojan refugee whose arrival in Italy was conceptually crucial to Rome's development
and position in Italy and the Mediterranean; Romulus, by whom Rome was founded in an act of fratricide; the
Sabine women, whose nobility prevented a deadly war between their fathers and their Roman kidnappers; and
Lucretia, whose virtue and self-sacrifice led to the liberation of Rome from a decadent and violent monarchy and
to the founding of the Roman Republic. We will examine how Livy deploys the storyteller's art to excite his
readers' pathos, indignation, and sympathy; we will examine as well how Livy often filters his account of mythi-
cal Rome through the lens of his own time, thereby constructing Rome's past through the Augustan present.
Writing more than a century after Livy, Tacitus offers a different view of Augustus, and his account of the rude
and dissolute Tiberius, the unscrupulous Livia, Rome's craven and dispirited senators, and the many scandals
attached to the imperial family, figures a Rome once again suffering under a decadent monarchy. Tacitus's com-
pressed, fastidious, inimitable prose is the vehicle for his stern yet often sardonic psychological insights, which
subtly manage to combine moral judgment with prurient pleasure in the scandals of others.
Format: discussion. Evaluation will be based on class preparation and participation, an oral presentation, one
medium-length 8- to 10-page paper, a midterm, and a final exam.

Through a close reading of selections from his Dialogues, Epistulae Morales, and a tragedy (probably Medea),
this course will consider ethical and literary dimensions of self-fashioning, self-examination, and the conception
of self in the Stoic philosophy of the younger Seneca. The focus of this course lies squarely in the first century
CE, and on the analysis of Seneca's own texts. We will begin, however, with an introduction to the ethics of
Roman Stoicism through the personae theory of Panaetius as recorded in Cicero'sDe Officiis. Moreover, we will
read and discuss selections from some of Seneca's most famous and influential interpreters, including Montaigne
and Foucault, in order to enrich our understanding of contemporary assessments of his work and to gain an ap-
preciation of Seneca's considerable influence on later theorizations of selfhood.

COGNITIVE SCIENCE (Div. II)
Chair, Professor KRIS KIRBY
Advisory Committee: Professors: DANYLUK, KIRBY, H. WILLIAMS***. Associate Professors:
CRUZ*, ZAKI. Visiting Assistant Professor: SUNDERMEIER.
Cognitive science is concerned with how humans, non-human animals, and computers acquire, represent,
manipulate, and use information. As an interdisciplinary field it combines research and theory from computer
science (e.g., artificial intelligence), cognitive psychology, philosophy, linguistics, and neuroscience, and to some
extent evolutionary biology, math, and anthropology. Complex issues of cognition are not easily addressed using
traditional intra-disciplinary tools. Cognitive researchers in any discipline typically employ a collection of analyt-
ic and modeling tools from across traditional disciplinary boundaries. Thus, the methods and research agenda of
cognitive science are broader than those of any of the fields that have traditionally contributed to cognitive sci-
ence. The Cognitive Science Program is designed to provide students with the broad interdisciplinary foundation
needed to approach issues of cognition.
THE CONCENTRATION
The concentration in Cognitive Science consists of six courses, including an introductory course, four elec-
tives, and a senior research project.
Minds, Brains, and Intelligent Behavior (COGS 222) is the entry point into the concentration, and provides
an interdisciplinary perspective on issues of cognition. Ideally, it should be taken before the end of the sophomore
year. Emphasizing the highly interdisciplinary nature of the field, the four electives must be distributed over at
least three course prefixes. In the fall of the senior year, concentrators will conduct interdisciplinary Research in
Cognitive Science (COGS 493), supervised by members of the advisory committee from at least two depart-
ments.
REQUIRED COURSES
Cognitive Science 222 Minds, Brains, and Intelligent Behavior: An Introduction to Cognitive Science

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN COGNITIVE SCIENCE
Formal admission to candidacy for honors will occur at the end of the fall semester of the senior year and will
be based on promising performance in COGS 493. This program will consist of COGS W31-494(S), and will be
supervised by members of the advisory committee from at least two departments. Presentation of a thesis, how-
ever, should not be interpreted as a guarantee of a degree with honors.
STUDY ABROAD
Students who wish to discuss plans for study abroad are invited to meet with any member of the Cognitive
Science advisory committee.
COGS 222(S) Minds, Brains, and Intelligent Behavior: An Introduction to Cognitive Science
(Same as Philosophy 222 and Psychology 222)
This course will emphasize interdisciplinary approaches to the study of intelligent systems, both natural and arti-
ficial. Cognitive science synthesizes research from cognitive psychology, computer science, linguistics, neuro-
science, and contemporary philosophy. Special attention will be given to the philosophical foundations of cogni-
tive science, representation and computation in symbolic and connectionist architectures, concept acquisition,
problem solving, perception, language, semantics, reasoning, and artificial intelligence.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: midterm and final exams, and self-paced weekly computer lab exer-
cises.
Prerequisites: Psychology 101 or Philosophy 102 or Computer Science 134. Background in more than one of
these is recommended.
Enrollment limit: 25 (expected: 25). Preference given to first-and second-year students.
Satisfies one semester of the Division II requirement.
Hour: 9:55-11:10 TR KIRBY
COGS 493(F) Research in Cognitive Science
Independent empirical or theoretical research for one semester, under the guidance of two Cognitive Science
faculty from different departments. Research must be interdisciplinary, but may consist of a scholarly paper, em-
pirical research, computer or mathematical modeling, or any combination of the above. Students will meet bi-
weekly to discuss their projects, and give oral presentations of their projects at the end of the fall semester.
Prerequisite: permission of program chair.
COGS W31-494(S) Senior Thesis
The senior concentrator, having completed the fall research project and with approval from the advisory commit-
tee, may devote winter study and the spring semester to a senior thesis based on the fall research project.

COMPARATIVE LITERATURE (Div. I)
Chair, Professor GAIL M. NEWMAN
Professors: CASSIDAY, DRUXES**, GOLDSTEIN*, B. KIEFFER, KLEINER, LIMON, NEW-
MAN***, ROUHI, SWANN***. Associate Professors: S. FOX, KAGAYA*. Assistant Professors: C.

Students motivated by a desire to study literature in the broadest terms, as well as those interested in particular
examples of literary comparison, will find an intellectual home in the Program in Comparative Literature. The
Program in Comparative Literature gives students the opportunity to develop their critical faculties through the
analysis of literature in its international and multicultural context. By crossing national, linguistic, historical, and
disciplinary boundaries, students of Comparative Literature learn to read texts for the ways they make meaning,
the assumptions that underlie that meaning, and the aesthetic elements evinced in the making. Students of Com-
parative Literature are encouraged to examine the widest possible range of literary communication, including the
metamorphosis of genres, forms, and themes.
Whereas specific literature programs allow the student to trace the development of one literature in a particular
culture over a period of time, Comparative Literature juxtaposes the writings of different cultures and epochs in a
variety of ways. The rubrics of the Program's core courses--Literary Genres, Literary Movements, Literature
and Theory, and Cultural Studies--introduce the student to a variety of critical methods. Because interpretive
methods from other disciplines play a crucial role in investigating literature's larger context, the Program offers
courses intended for students in all divisions of the college and of all interests. These include courses that
introduce students to the comparative study of world literature and courses designed to enhance any foreign lan-
guage major in the Williams curriculum. In addition, the English Department allows students to count one course
with a COMP prefix as an elective within the English major.
The Program supports two distinct majors in Comparative Literature and Literary Studies. The major in
Comparative Literature requires advanced work in at least one language other than English and is strongly rec-
ommended for students contemplating graduate study in the discipline. Both majors provide a strong basis for
any career demanding analytical, interpretive, and evaluative skills and allow the student, within a framework of
general requirements, to create a program of study primarily shaped by the student's own interests.
MAJORS
Comparative Literature
The Comparative Literature major combines the focused study of a single national-language literature with a
wide-ranging exploration of literary forms across national, linguistic, and historical boundaries. Each student de-
Comparative Literature
­ 117 ­
claring the major must select a single foreign language as his or her specialty, although the serious study of litera-
ture in foreign languages other than the student's specialty is strongly encouraged. The languages currently avail-
able are French, German, Ancient Greek, Latin, Russian, and Spanish. Each student will also be paired with a
faculty advisor with whom the student will meet each semester to discuss how best to fulfill the requirements for
the major.
Eleven courses are required for the major:
Comparative Literature 111 The Nature of Narrative
Any three comparative literature core courses. A core course is any course that meets the following
criteria: a) it must treat primarily literature and b) it must be genuinely comparative across cultures
and/or primarily theoretical. The three core courses may be chosen from the offerings of the Program
in Comparative Literature (frequently offered examples include Comparative Literature 232, European
Modernism, and Comparative Literature 340, Literature and Psychoanalysis) or from the offerings of
other departments and programs, including the foreign language programs and English, Religion, Afri-
cana Studies, and Latino/Latina Studies.
Three literature courses in the student's specialty language, in which texts are read in the original. At
least one of the three must be above the 200-level.
Three courses in which most of the course work concerns literature other than that of the student's
specialty language or literary theory. These courses may be selected from Comparative Literature of-
ferings or from other departments and must be approved by the student's major advisor. Only one may
be in English or American literature.
Comparative Literature 402 Senior Seminar (variable topics)
Students who are considering a major in Comparative Literature should aim to acquire intermediate-level pro-
ficiency in their specialty language by the end of the sophomore year. They should also complete core course
requirements by the end of their junior year. Students pursuing the Comparative Literature major are strongly
encouraged to study abroad during their junior year and may receive major credit for up to 4 courses taken during
study abroad. At least three courses towards the major must be at the 300 level or above. Students are expected to
take the version of 402 offered in their senior year, even if they have previously taken 402.
Literary Studies
The Literary Studies major allows for a wide-ranging exploration of literary forms across national, linguistic,
and historical boundaries. Unlike the major in Comparative Literature, the Literary Studies major does not re-
quire the student to choose a specialty language, although the serious study of literature in one or more foreign
languages is strongly encouraged. Each student will be paired with a faculty advisor, with whom the student will
meet each semester to discuss how best to fulfill the requirements for the major.
Eleven courses are required for the major:
Comparative Literature 111 The Nature of Narrative
Any four comparative literature core courses. A core course is any course that meets the following criteria:
a) it must treat primarily literature and b) it must be genuinely comparative across cultures and/or primarily
theoretical. The three core courses may be chosen from the offerings of the Program in Comparative Litera-
ture (frequently offered examples include Comparative Literature 232, European Modernism, and Compara-
tive Literature 340, Literature and Psychoanalysis) or from the offerings of other departments and programs,
including the foreign language programs and English, Religion, Africana Studies, and Latino/Latina Studies.
Five courses devoted to literature or literary theory that cover at least three different national/cultural traditions.
The courses may be selected from Comparative Literature offerings or from other departments and must be ap-
proved by the student's major advisor. Of the courses taken outside of the Program in Comparative Literature, no
more than two may have the same course prefix. Students are strongly encouraged to include courses in a foreign
language among these five.
Comparative Literature 402 Senior Seminar (variable topics)
Students who are considering a major in Literary Studies should aim to complete core course requirements by
the end of their sophomore year. Students who choose to study abroad during their junior year may receive major
credit for up to 4 courses taken during study abroad. At least three courses towards the major must be at the 300
level or above. Students are expected to take the version of 402 offered in their senior year, even if they have
previously taken 402.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN COMPARATIVE LITERATURE OR LITERARY STUDIES
Prerequisites
Honors candidates in Comparative Literature or Literary Studies are required to have maintained a GPA of 3.5
in the major to qualify for submitting a thesis proposal. In addition, candidates must demonstrate a strong interest
in a specific topic for which an appropriate faculty advisor will be available in the senior year.
Timing
Students wishing to pursue a thesis in Comparative Literature or Literary Studies are strongly urged to secure
an advisor by the end of the week after Spring Break in their junior year. By May 15th of their junior year, candi-
dates must submit to the Program Advisory Committee a one- to two-page proposal and a preliminary bibliogra-
phy. The Advisory Committee will inform candidates by June 1 whether they may proceed with the thesis and
Comparative Literature
­ 118 ­
advise them about any changes that should be made in the focus or scope of the project. The summer before the
senior year will be spent compiling a more detailed bibliography and preparing for the process of writing the
thesis.
In their senior year, candidates will devote two semesters and the winter study period to their theses
(493-W31-494). By the end of the Fall semester, students will normally have undertaken substantial research and
produced the draft of at least the first half of the project. Atthis point students should also have a clear sense of the
work remaining for completion of the thesis. In the course of the Fall semester, students will also have chosen
and met with a second reader for the project, who will provide additional guidance and read the final thesis. By
the end of Winter Study, students should have completed a draft of the entire project. At that time, the Compara-
tive Literature Advisory Committee, together with the advisor, will determine whether the project may continue
as an Honors Thesis, or whether its first portions (COMP 493-W) will be graded as Independent Studies.
The second semester of independent thesis work will be spent revising as necessary. The completed thesis in
its final form will be due one week before the last day of classes. At the end of the Spring term, the student will
make a public presentation of the final project, to which members of the Advisory Committee will be specially
invited.
Characteristics of the Thesis, Evaluation, and Major Credit
The topic of the thesis must be comparative and/or theoretical. It is also possible to write a thesis that consists
of an original translation of a significant text or texts; in this case, a theoretical apparatus must accompany the
translation. The complete thesis must be at least 50 and at most 75 pages in length, excluding the bibliography.
The advisor will assign the grades for the thesis courses (COMP 493-W-494); the Advisory Committee will
determine whether a candidate will receive Honors, Highest Honors, or no honors.
For students who pursue an honors thesis, the total number of courses required for the major-including the
thesis course (COMP 493-W-494)-is 12, i.e., one of the thesis courses may substitute for one elective.
STUDY ABROAD
The Program in Comparative Literature strongly urges its students to study abroad. Students who have Com-
parative Literature as a major should seriously consider study abroad in a country where their specialty language
is spoken; they will likely be able to complete some of the specialty language courses required for the major
during study abroad. Literary Studies students can also benefit from study abroad; literature courses from abroad
are often candidates for credit as major electives.

COMP 231T(F) Postmodernism (Same as English 266) (W)
In one definition, postmodernism in art and literature is what you get when you combine modernism's radical
experimentation with pop culture's easy appeal. This term has been used to describe works from Andy Warhol's
paintings of Campbell's soup cans and Jean Baudrillard's critical essays on Disneyland to Thomas Pynchon's
paranoid novel about postal conspiracy, The Crying of Lot 49. Theorists of the postmodern have argued that it
represents not only a radical change in aesthetic sensibilities, but a fundamentally new relationship between art,
language, and society. In this tutorial, we will read some of the most important theoretical essays defining the
postmodern (essays which themselves often embrace this playful and sometimes ironic style), and we will pair
them with artistic texts that are said to illustrate the features of postmodernism. The latter will be mainly novels
and short stories from different national traditions; but one feature of this theory is a flattening of the distinction
between high and low culture as well as between the written and the visual, so we will also examine examples
from film, architecture, visual art, and/or broader pop culture. Texts will include essays by Jean Baudrillard,
Fredric Jameson, Jean-François Lyotard, and others; novels and short stories by writers like Don DeLillo, Jorge
Luis Borges, Italo Calvino, and Murakami Haruki; painting and sculpture associated with Pop Art and Superflat;
the architecture of Williamstown area museums; etc. Writing assignments will focus on reading the theoretical
texts critically and applying their ideas to the artistic texts in creative and interesting ways. Open to sophomores
as well as advanced students.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: After an introductory lecture meeting, students will meet with the instructor in
pairs for approximately an hour each week; they will write a 5-page paper every other week (5 in all), and re-
spond to their partners' papers in alternate weeks. Emphasis will be on understanding and engaging the criticism
that we read, and comparing the critical and fictional texts creatively in a way that sheds light on both.
Prerequisites: a 100-level literature course (Comparative Literature, English, etc.) and sophomore standing or
higher, or permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Priority will be given to students
majoring or considering a major in a related discipline and those with a demonstrated interest in critical theory.

COMP 233(F) Introduction to Classical Arabic Literature (W)*
In this course we will examine the rich, complex and diverse texts of Classical Arabic Literature. The readings
include works that have achieved notoriety outside of the Arab world (such as theQuran and One Thousand and
One Nights) as well as works by authors largely unknown outside of the Arab world but canonical in Arabic-lan-
guage culture such as Imru al-Qays, al-Jahiz, al-Ma'arri, Abu Nuwas, al-Hallaj, al-Ghazali and al-Mutannabi.
Women's literature in this course includes works by al-Khansa', known for her elegies, and by Wallada bint
al-Mustakfi of Cordoba, who contributed to the courtly love poetry of both Europe and the Arab world. Topics
for discussion include theological and philosophical queries, erotica, wine, bibliomania and avarice. Our primary
texts represent such varied regions as the Arabian Peninsula, Egypt, Abbasid Baghdad, North Africa and Islamic
Spain. Chronologically, the texts range from the sixth century CE to the fourteenth century. All readings are in
English.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: consistent and pro-active class participation, two 3- to 5-page papers,
a final 8- to 10-page paper, one short presentation and weekly 1- to 2-page reaction papers.

COMP 242T(F) Reading and Writing the Body (W)
Am I a body, or do I have one? The tradition of favoring thought over physical experience has long informed,
and limited, our sense of self as human beings. While some writers maintain that the creative impulse is a gift of
the muse and that it is rooted entirely in the mind or spirit, there are those for whom the human body, frequently
their own, plays a central role, both in the process of creation and as a subject of artistic inquiry or contemplation.
In their writing, these authors tell a very different tale with regard to the literary process, and it is focused on the
primacy of the physical experience. This course will consider the work of, among others, Maupassant, Kafka,
Tanizaki, Tolstoy, Dinesen, Babel, Mandelstam, and Atwood in order to examine how writers from different
cultural and aesthetic perspectives either present or use the body as a vehicle of expression. We will also consider
other areas of study that are intimately related to the physical experience, such as asceticism, illness, prostitution,
and disability, and occasionally turn our attention to other art forms.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: weekly one-hour sessions with the instructor and a fellow student. Every other
week the student will write and present orally a 5 to 6-page paper on the assigned readings for that week. On
alternate weeks the student will write and present a 2-page critique of the fellow student's paper.

ture.

COMP 262(S) Outlaws and Underworlds: Arabic Literature of the Margins (W)*
The idea of the rogue or the outlaw is a theme that may be traced in Arabic literature from the classical poetry of
the pre-Islamic period through to the present. In considering a range of works from the 6th century onward, this
course will explore the way in which the outlaw has historically been used as a literary motif in Arabic literature
to reflect and critique, not just society, but the official literary establishment as well. How does a writer's lan-
guage-the decision to write in the vernacular, for example-serve as a way of flouting the cultural establishment in
an effort to speak to a more popular audience? In examining characters who live by thievery or begging-who
embrace the ethos of outsiderness-we will return repeatedly to consider the concept of freedom as a driving ques-
tion in these works. Between conformity and deviance, decadence and lack, how do we define what makes a
person truly free? The rich underworlds that these outlaws inhabit are sketched for readers as counter-cultures
whose alternative way of life and set of values continually challenges the conventions and mores of the main-
stream. Readings will include selections from early Arabic (Suluk) poems, Abu Nuwas' wine poetry, the maqa-
mat tradition of rhymed prose, as well as a number of contemporary Arabic novels.
Format: seminar. Requirements: active participation, multiple reading responses, two short papers (5-7 pages)
including revisions, and one longer paper (8-10 pages).
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference given to first-years and sophomores.

Most people in the US understand "American" literature as the work of writers born and raised in the United
States, overlooking both the rich literary traditions of Canada, the Caribbean and Latin America and the centuries
of political and cultural history we share with those peoples. This course will present the methods and issues
involved in studying the literature of the American hemisphere, from the fundamental (what is "America"?) to
more nuanced issues of identity, imperialism and cultural agency, while examining key texts written from 1800
to the present. Our work will be broadly comparative, drawing texts from different linguistic traditions (French,
English and Spanish) into dialogue with one another. We will consider both the interrelations of American
peoples and the many cultural forms that have developed in response to our common colonial heritage. Readings
may include the work of: Melville, Cooper, Sarmiento, Ruiz de Burton, Whitman, Martí, Cather, Guillén, Cés-
aire, Faulkner, Rulfo, Morrison.

COMP 340(F) Literature and Psychoanalysis (W)
This course will explore the literary roots and effects of the explosion of the unconscious into consciousness at
the turn of the twentieth century. Freud's psychoanalytic revolution will reveal itself to be actually a significant
event in an evolutionary process that took place to a large extent in the arena of literature, to which Freud himself
repeatedly acknowledged his debt. We will examine psychologically-minded literary texts that precede and, in
some cases, preview Freud's theories, those theories themselves, and texts (theoretical and literary) that reflect
the immense influence of psychoanalysis in the twentieth century. Authors might include Sophocles,
Shakespeare, Goethe, Hoffmann, Flaubert, Carroll, Kafka, Duras, Garcia Marquez, and Morrison. All readings
in English.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: active class participation, reading journals, two short and one longer
paper.

COMP 341(S) Sublime Confusion: A Survey of Critical Theory (Same as English 345)
What does it mean to have a theory of literature? Can something as vital, as varied, and as vague as art or fiction
ever be reduced to anything like a science? We will investigate these questions with a survey of art and literary
theory that takes up a cross section of texts from classical times to the present. We will focus particular attention
on the aesthetic quality called "the sublime--a category that has often been constituted in opposition to "beauty"
to express the power and the attraction of art that is not beautiful, but whose frightening, confusing, even threat-
ening aspect is somehow thrilling or appealing. This idea interested early critics from the classical rhetorician
pseudo-Longinus to the German Idealists, as a way to make aesthetics more scientific paradoxically by identify-
ing the doorway through which art and literature escaped the realm of reason. More recently the notion of litera-
ture's thrilling confusion has played a key role in modern literary theory from Russian formalism to New Criti-
cism, deconstruction, and postmodernism. (In fact, poststructuralist criticism itself has a thrillingly confusing
quality that we will not ignore.) The class will focus on careful reading of relatively short texts by Plato, pseudo-
Longinus, Burke, Kant, Schiller, Shklovsky, Eichenbaum, I.A. Richards, Barthes, Derrida, Loytard, and others.
We will find and discuss illustrations drawn from literature, visual media, and contemporary culture.
Format: discussion and lecture. Requirements: active class participation, two papers (6-7 pages each), and a final
exam.
Prerequisites: a 100-level literature course (Comparative Literature, English, etc.) and sophomore standing or
higher, or permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 20 (expected: 10). Priority will be given to students
majoring in a related discipline and those with a demonstrated interest in critical theory.

COMP 346(S) Questioning the Cultural Self in Literature (W)*
Cultural encounters entail a questioning of identity, values and worldview. As the familiar gives way to the un-
known, issues of knowledge and power can begin to influence the interaction between different groups. In this
course we will examine texts dealing with differences in language, religion, race, class, gender and citizenship
that lead to the formation of allegiances and rivalries. What constitutes a cultural group? How is difference deter-
mined? What is the nature of the tension characteristic of many a cross-cultural encounter? How do cultural
hybridity and conflicting solidarities influence multi-cultural dialogues? Readings for this course include Jhumpa
Lahiri's The Namesake, Nelida Pinon's The Republic of Dreams, Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, Jamaica
Kincaid's A Small Place, Ghassan Kanafani's Return to Haifa and Victor Martinez's Parrot in the Oven: Mi

drawn from twentieth century texts written during, or in the wake of, the massive destruction and displacements
brought about by the Spanish Civil War and World War II. How is the life lost portrayed? How are the concepts
of home and the past intertwined? What kind of life or literature are possible for the deracinated survivor? We
will discuss the role of writing and remembrance in relation to political history, as well as in the context of indi-
vidual survival. Readings might include works by Nuñez de Reinoso, León, Cernuda, Semprún, Benjamin,
Nancy, and Blanchot.

COMP 353(F) Writing the City: Beirut and Cairo in Contemporary Arabic Literature*
The Lebanese novelist Elias Khoury has written that understanding contemporary Lebanese literature requires us
to understand "how literature both creates myth and then seeks to destroy it." This class will consider this state-
ment in relation to the development of the Arabic novel emerging out of Beirut and Cairo in the latter part of the
twentieth century. We will consider the ways in which Lebanese and Egyptian novelists use the motif of the city
as a way to take up the prevailing social and political issues of the day. In so doing we will discuss how some
works actively mythologize and celebrate the city as an extension of national identity, while others portray it as
the root cause of the country's social ills. We will also consider how the history of each of these cities was inter-
twined with the rise and fall of certain ideological movements in the Arab world whereby the novel, as a relative-
ly new form in the region, served as an alternative medium for theorizing and considering the efficacy of such
movements. In taking up these questions, we will discuss the extent to which the trajectory of the Arabic novel
may be understood as a reflection of the changes affecting these urban milieus and reciprocally the way these two
cities are, and continue to be, produced by these fictions. Throughout the semester we will read a range of works
by Lebanese and Egyptian novelists as well as a selection of critical material that theorizes the city in relation to
literature.
Format: lecture/discussion; Course Requirements: active participation, presentation, two short papers (5-6
pages), and one longer paper (8-10 pages).

FREUND, HEERINGA, MCGUIRE.
Computers and computation are pervasive in our society. They play enormously important roles in areas as
diverse as education, science, business, and the arts. Understanding the nature of computation and exploring the
great potential of computers are the goals of the discipline of computer science. A sample of the areas of research
investigated by the Williams Department of Computer Science alone illustrates the vast range of topics that are of
interest to computer scientists and computing professionals today. This includes: the use of computer-generated
graphic images in the arts and as a tool for visualization in the sciences and other areas; the protocols that make
transmission of information over the internet possible and even fair; the design of revolutionary new computer
Computer Science
­ 125 ­
languages that simplify the process of constructing complex programs for computers; the development of ma-
chine learning algorithms that can extract useful and even novel information from data that is too complex or
simply too big for humans to analyze; algorithms that can solve problems that were previously too hard to solve
in a reasonable amount of time, just by giving up a little bit of optimality in the solution; the investigation of
machine architectures and specific hardware aimed at making computing fast.
The department recognizes that students' interests in computer science will vary widely. The department at-
tempts to meet these varying interests through: (1) the major; (2) a selection of courses intended for those who are
interested primarily in an introduction to computer science; (3) recommended course sequences for the non-ma-
jor who wants a more extensive introduction to computer science in general or who seeks to develop some spe-
cific expertise in computing for application in some other discipline.
MAJOR
The goal of the major is to provide an understanding of algorithmic problem solving as well as the conceptual
organization of computers and complex programs running on them. Emphasis is placed on the fundamental prin-
ciples of computer science, building upon the mathematical and theoretical ideas underlying these principles.
The introductory and core courses build a broad and solid base for understanding computer science. The more
advanced courses allow students to sample a variety of specialized areas including graphics, artificial intelli-
gence, computer architecture, networks, compiler design, and operating systems. Independent study and honors
work provide opportunities for students to study and conduct research on topics of special interest.
The major in Computer Science equips students to pursue a wide variety of career opportunities. It can be
used as preparation for a career in computing, for graduate school, or to provide important background and tech-
niques for the student whose future career will extend outside of computer science.
MAJOR REQUIREMENTS
Required Courses in Computer Science
A minimum of 8 courses is required in Computer Science, including the following:
Introductory Courses
Computer Science 134 Introduction to Computer Science
Computer Science 136 Data Structures and Advanced Programming
Core Courses
Computer Science 237 Computer Organization
Computer Science 256 Algorithm Design and Analysis
Computer Science 334 Principles of Programming Languages
Computer Science 361 Theory of Computation
Electives
Two or more electives (bringing the total number of Computer Science courses to at least 8) chosen from 300-
or 400-level courses in Computer Science. At least one of these must be a course designated as a PROJECT
COURSE. Computer Science courses with 9 as the middle digit (reading, research, and thesis courses) will
normally not be used to satisfy the elective requirements. Students may petition the department to waive this
restriction with good reason.
Required Courses in Mathematics
Mathematics 251 Discrete Mathematics
and any other Mathematics course at the 200-level or higher
Students considering pursuing a major in Computer Science are urged to take Computer Science 134 and to
begin satisfying their mathematics requirements early. Note in particular that Discrete Mathematics covers mate-
rial complementing that in the introductory courses (Computer Science 134 and 136) and is a prerequisite for
many advanced courses.
Students who take Computer Science 106, 107, 108 or 109 may use that course as one of the two electives
required for the major in Computer Science. Those who count Computer Science 109 toward the major must
select an elective different from Computer Science 371 (Computer Graphics) for their project course. Similarly,
students who count Computer Science 108 as an elective cannot select Computer Science 373 as their second
elective. Computer Science 315 may not be used as a second elective in conjunction with Computer Science 106.
Computer Science 106, 107, 108, 109, and 134 are not open to students who have taken a Computer Science
course numbered 136 or higher.
To be eligible for admission to the major, a student must normally have completed Computer Science 136 as
well as Discrete Mathematics by the end of the sophomore year. A second Mathematics course at the 200-level
or higher must be completed by the end of the junior year. Students are urged to have completed two of the four
core courses (Computer Science 237, 256, 334, and 361) by the end of the sophomore year and must normally
have completed at least three out of the four core courses by the end of the junior year.
Satisfactory participation is required in the Computer Science Colloquium by all senior majors. With the ad-
vance permission of the department, two appropriate mathematics courses numbered 240 or above may be sub-
stituted for one Computer Science elective. Other variations in the required courses, adapting the requirements to
the special needs and interests of the individual student, may be arranged in consultation with the department.
Potential majors are strongly encouraged to look at the latest copy of theInformal Guide to Computer Science,
which can be obtained on the World Wide Web at http://www.cs.williams.edu. This document contains much
more information on the major, including suggested patterns of course selection and advice on courses relevant
to different student goals.

LABORATORY FACILITIES
The Computer Science Department maintains two departmental computer laboratories for students taking
Computer Science courses, as well as a lab that can be configured for teaching specialized topics such as robotics.
The workstations in these laboratories also support student and faculty research in computer science.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE
The degree with honors in Computer Science is awarded to a student who has demonstrated outstanding intel-
lectual achievement in a program of study which extends beyond the requirements of the regular major. The
principal considerations in recommending a student for the degree with honors will be: mastery of core material,
ability to pursue independent study of computer science, originality in methods of investigation, and creativity in
research. Honors study is highly recommended for those students with strong academic records in computer
science who wish to attend graduate school, pursue high-level industrial positions in computing, or who would
simply like to experience research in computer science.
Prospective honors students are urged to consult with their departmental advisor at the time of registration in
the spring of the sophomore or at the beginning of the junior year to arrange a program of study that could lead to
the degree with honors. Such a program normally consists of Computer Science 493 and 494 and a WSP of
independent research under the guidance of a Computer Science faculty member, culminating in a thesis which
is judged acceptable by the department. The program produces a significant piece of written work and often
includes a major computer program. All honors candidates are required to give an oral presentation of their re-
search in the Computer Science Colloquium in early spring semester.
Students considering honors work should obtain permission from the department before registering in the fall
of the senior year. Formal admission to candidacy occurs at the beginning of the spring semester of the senior
year and is based on promising performance in the fall semester and winter study units of honors work. Recom-
mendations for the degree with honors will be made for outstanding performance in the three honors courses.
Highest honors will be recommended for students who have displayed exceptional ability, achievement, or origi-
nality.
INTRODUCTORY COURSES
The department offers a choice of five introductory courses--Computer Science 106: Life as an Algorithm,
107: Strategy, Interaction, and Design in Board and Video Games, 108: Artificial Intelligence: Image and Real-
ity, 109: The Art and Science of Computer Graphics, and Computer Science 134: Introduction to Computer Sci-
ence.
Computer Science 134 provides an introduction to computer science with a focus on developing computer
programming skills. These skills are essential to most upper-level courses in the department. As a result, Com-
puter Science 134 together with Computer Science 136 are required as a prerequisite to most advanced courses
in the department. Those students intending to take several Computer Science courses are urged to take 134
early.
Those students interested in learning more about exciting new ideas in computer science, but not necessarily
interested in developing extensive programming skills, should consider Computer Science 106: Life as an Algo-
rithm, 107: Strategy, Interaction, and Design in Board and Video Games, 108: Artificial Intelligence: Image and
Reality, or 109: The Art and Science of Computer Graphics.
Students with significant programming experience should consider electing Computer Science 136 (see "Ad-
vanced Placement" below). Students are always welcome to contact a member of the department for guidance in
selecting a first course.
STUDY ABROAD
Study abroad can be a wonderful experience. Students who hope to take computer science courses while
abroad should discuss their plans in advance with the chair of the department. Students who plan to study away
but do not expect to take courses toward the major should work with the department to create a plan to ensure
that they will be able to complete the major. While study abroad is generally not an impediment to completing the
major, students should be aware that certain computer science courses must be taken in a particular sequence and
that not all courses are offered every semester (or every year). Students who wish to discuss their plans are in-
vited to meet with any of the faculty in Computer Science.
ADVANCED PLACEMENT
Students with an extensive background in computer science are urged to take the Advanced Placement Ex-
amination in Computer Science. A score of 4 or better on the exam is normally required for advanced placement
in Computer Science 136.
Students who wish to be placed in Computer Science 136 but who have not taken the Advanced Placement
Examination should consult with the department. Such students should have had a good course in computer
science using a structured language such as Java.
PLANS OF STUDY FOR NON-MAJORS
The faculty in Computer Science believes that students can substantially enrich their academic experience by
completing acoherent plan of study in one or more disciplines outside of their majors. With this in mind, we have
attempted to provide students majoring in other departments with options in our department's curriculum rang-
ing from two-course sequences to collections of courses equivalent to what would constitute a minor at institu-
tions that recognize such a concentration. Students interested in designing such a plan of study are invited to
discuss their plans in detail with a member of thefaculty.Toassiststudents making such plans, we include some
suggestions below.
Students seeking to develop an extensive knowledge of computer science without majoring in the department
are encouraged to use the major requirements as a guide. In particular, the four core courses required of majors
are intended to provide a broad knowledge of topics underlying all of computer science. Students seeking a con-
Computer Science
­ 127 ­
centration in Computer Science are urged to complete at least two of these courses followed by one of our upper-
level electives. Such a program would typically require the completion of a total of five Computer Science
courses and one course in discrete mathematics.
There are several sequences of courses appropriate for those primarily interested in developing skills in pro-
gramming for use in other areas. For general programming, Computer Science 134 followed by 136 and 237 will
provide students with a strong background in algorithm and data structure design together with an understanding
of issues of correctness and efficiency. Students of the Bioinformatics program are encouraged to take Computer
Science 106 and 134 at a minimum, and should consider Computer Science 136 and 256. The sequence of
courses Computer Science 109 and 134 would provide sufficient competence in computer graphics for many
students interested in applying such knowledge either in the arts or sciences. For students requiring more exper-
tise in the techniques of computer graphics, Computer Science 136 and 371 could be added to form a four-course
sequence.

GENERAL REMARKS
Divisional Requirements
All Computer Science courses may be used to satisfy the Division III distribution requirement.
Alternate Year Courses
Computer Science 106, 107, 108, 109, 315, 336T, 337T, 338T, 339, 371, 373, 374T, 432, and 434T are each
normally offered every other year. All other Computer Science courses are normally offered every year.
Course Numbering
The increase from 100, through 200 and 300, to 400 indicates in most instances an increasing level of maturity
in the subject that is expected of students. Within a series, numeric order does not indicate the relative level of
difficulty of courses. Rather, the middle digit of the course number (particularly in upper-level courses) generally
indicates the area of computer science covered by the course.
Course Descriptions
Brief descriptions of the courses in Computer Science can be found below. More detailed information on the
offerings in the department is available in the Informal Guide to Computer Science.
Courses Open on a Pass-Fail Basis
Students taking a Computer Science course on a pass-fail basis must meet all the requirements set for students
taking the course on a graded basis.
With the permission of the department, any course offered by the department may be taken pass-fail, though
courses graded with the pass-fail option may not be used to satisfy any of the major or honors requirements.
However, with the permission of the department, courses taken in the department beyond those requirements
may be taken on a pass-fail basis.

CSCI 107(F) Strategy, Interaction, and Design in Board and Video Games (Same as ArtS 107)
A game is an aperture on strategic thought and interaction. The ideas behind board games, puzzles, and video
games find applications in economics, business, biology, psychology, and politics. Games are also art. They liter-
ally contain graphic, sculptural, and industrial design. They are beautiful mathematical constructs. Games are an
interactive medium that communicates that which is inaccessible through passive forms. Underlying disciplines
as diverse as biology and art are deep, shared ideas: of a space containing design, decision, and constraints; of
computation and process; and of the ultimate limits on reason and efficiency. This course reveals a surprising
name for those deep ideas: computer science. This multidisciplinary course explores games and their serious
applications through design exercises and game playing. Evaluation will be based on attendance, participation,
analysis assignments, and a significant final project. For the project, you will work in a group to design a new
game using both traditional art media and software like Photoshop, following the principles discussed in class.
Along the way you will develop an intuitive grasp of computer science concepts including heuristics, minimax,
and emergence.
Format: seminar and studio. Lab fee.
No prerequisites. No programming or game experience is assumed. This course is not open to students who have
completed Computer Science 136 or above. Enrollment limit: 16 (expected: 16) Preference given to first-year
students.
This course is part of the Critical Reasoning and Analytical Skills Initiative.

COURSES INTENDED FOR BOTH NON-MAJORS AND MAJORS
CSCI 134(F,S) Introduction to Computer Science (Q)
This course introduces fundamental ideas in computer science and builds skills in the design, implementation,
and testing of computer programs. Students implement algorithms in the Java programming language with a
strong focus on constructing correct, understandable, and efficient programs. Students explore the material
through specific application areas. Topics covered include object-oriented programming, control structures, ar-
rays, recursion, and event-driven programming. This course is appropriate for all students who want to create
software and have little or no prior computing experience. More details are available on the department website,
http://www.cs.williams.edu.
Format: lecture/laboratory. Evaluation will be based on weekly programming assignments, written problem sets,
a test program, and midterm and final examinations.
No prerequisites, except for the standard prerequisites for a (Q) course. Note that previous programming experi-
ence is not required. Students with prior experience with object-oriented programming should discuss appropri-
ate course placement with members of the department. No enrollment limit (expected: 18 per section).

CSCI 136(F,S) Data Structures and Advanced Programming (Q)
This course builds on the programming skills acquired in Computer Science 134. It couples work on program
design, analysis, and verification with an introduction to the study of data structures. Data structures capture
common ways in which to store and manipulate data, and they are important in the construction of sophisticated
computer programs. Students are introduced to some of the most important and frequently used data structures:
lists, stacks, queues, trees, hash tables, graphs, and files. Students will be expected to write several programs,
ranging from very short programs to more elaborate systems. Emphasis will be placed on the development of
clear, modular programs that are easy to read, debug, verify, analyze, and modify.
Format: lecture/laboratory. Evaluation will be based on programming assignments and examinations.
Prerequisites: Computer Science 134 or equivalent. (Discrete Mathematics is recommended, but not required)
Enrollment limit: 36 (expected: 20).

CSCI 256(S) Algorithm Design and Analysis (Q)
This course investigates methods for designing efficient and reliable algorithms. By carefully analyzing the
structure of a problem within a mathematical framework, it is often possible to dramatically decrease the com-
putational resources needed to find a solution. In addition, analysis provides a method for verifying the correct-
ness of an algorithm and accurately estimating its running time and space requirements. We will study several
algorithm design strategies that build on data structures and programming techniques introduced in Computer
Science 136, including induction, divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, and greedy algorithms. Particular
topics of study include graph theory, computational geometry, string processing, approximation algorithms, and
advanced data structures. In addition, an introduction to complexity theory and the complexity classes P and NP
will be provided.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based on problem sets and programming assignments, and midterm and final
examinations.

CONTRACT MAJOR
Contract Major Advisor: CHARLES R. TOOMAJIAN, Jr.
Students with the talent and energy for working independently and with the strong support of two faculty
advisors may undertake a Contract Major: a coherent study of an interdisciplinary subject not covered by a regu-
larly offered major. Such a major must be in an area suitable to the talents of the faculty in residence and cannot
consist of minor modifications to an existing major. A Contract Major also must conform to the structure and
have the coherence of a departmental or program major--i.e., it must embody a disciplined cumulative study
that moves from an elementary to an advanced level and culminates in a synthesis similar to a senior major
course. Hence a Contract Major usually consists of a program of existing courses, sometimes supplemented by
courses of independent study and the senior course.
The process of constructing a proposal for a Contract Major is both interesting and demanding. As part of that
process, students should consider carefully the advantage of working within existing majors or programs, taking
note of the considerable intellectual pleasures involved in sharing similar educational experiences with other stu-
dents working within the same field. Students might also consider whether their interests could be met by com-
pleting a regular major and coordinate program, or a double major, or simply by working outside a major field in
courses of special interest. Because the Contract Major represents an exceptional opportunity provided for stu-
dents whose interests cannot be met through existing departmental and interdepartmental majors and programs,
it cannot be pursued in conjunction with another major.
Students who wish to explore or propose a Contract Major should consult with the Contract Major advisor
and with potential faculty sponsors as early as possible in the fall semester of the sophomore year, and then--
during the sophomore year--follow these procedures:
Contract Major, Critical Languages
­ 131 ­
1) The student must initiate discussion with at least two members of the faculty from differing departments
who expect to be in residence during the student's senior year and who are willing to endorse the Contract Major
and undertake a central role in supervising its implementation, criticism, evaluation, and ultimate validation.
Since in essence faculty sponsors substitute for the student's major department, they are expected to play an im-
portant role in the Contract Major.
The student must develop, in conjunction with the faculty sponsors, a written proposal (forms and guidelines
are available in the Dean's Office) which should contain:
a) a description of the proposed major area of study and an explanation of the reasons for proposing the
Contract Major. A sound and persuasive rationale for the major is crucial for obtaining approval from
the Committee on Educational Policy (C.E.P.).
b) a list of all courses in the proposed major and an explanation for each course choice. A minimum of
nine semester courses, one of which must be designated the senior major course (and taken during the
senior year), must be completed for a Contract Major. Normal rules governing course grades and
grade point average apply for entry into and continuation in a Contract Major.
c) a list of other courses taken or anticipated to meet College distribution requirements, including grades
received in courses already completed.
2) By mid-January, the student must meet with the Contract Major Advisor to discuss and further develop the
proposal.
3) By the first day of spring semester classes, the student must submit a complete draft of the proposal to the
Contract Major Advisor for feedback.
4) By the end of the fourth week of the spring semester, the student must submit the final proposal to the
Contract Major Advisor. By this date also, the faculty sponsors must submit their endorsement forms to the Con-
tract Major Advisor. If the student is essentially proposing to transform an existing coordinate program (e.g.,
Africana Studies, area studies programs, Environmental Studies), into a Contract Major, the chair of that pro-
gram should also submit to the Contract Major Advisor a statement attesting to the validity of the proposal by the
end of the fourth week of the spring semester.
5) The Contract Major Advisor then conveys the proposal, acopy of the student's most recent academic prog-
ress report, the faculty sponsors' endorsement forms, and recommendations regarding the feasibility and sub-
stance of the proposal, for approval by the Committee on Educational Policy. The C.E.P., after consultation with
departments and programs substantially affected by a proposal, will vote on each proposal individually and will
report the decision to the Contract Major Advisor, who will notify students and sponsors before the spring regis-
tration deadline. If the time needed for C.E.P. review demands it, the Contract Major Advisor may postpone
notification to students and permit them to register late without penalty. In making its decisions, the C.E.P. con-
siders the student's academic record, the coherence and feasibility of the plan of study, and the degree of support
expressed by the faculty sponsors and, if appropriate, program chairs.
Subsequent changes in a Contract Major must be requested in writing by the student and approved by the
faculty sponsors as well as by the Contract Major Advisor. Where there has been substantial alteration of the
original program, the Contract Major Advisor will forward the student's written request to the C.E.P. for recon-
sideration.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN THE CONTRACT MAJOR
The route to the degree with honors in the Contract Major will normally be a senior thesis requiring two se-
mesters and a winter study of work. In special circumstances a student may propose to substitute a one-semester
course or a winter study course for one of his or her thesis courses and write a mini-thesis. The Contract Major
with honors shall comprise a minimum of eleven semester courses or ten semester courses plus one winter study.
One semester of independent study undertaken for the thesis may be allowed to fulfill the requirement for a
senior major course.
The faculty sponsors shall determine by the end of winter study whether the student is to be admitted to hon-
ors candidacy. If not admitted to honors candidacy, the student may elect not to continue further independent
study. If admitted to honors candidacy, the student shall submit a written thesis or minithesis to three faculty
readers, at least one of whom shall be a faculty sponsor and at least one of whom shall not be a faculty sponsor.
The outside reader or readers shall be selected by the Contract Major Advisor in consultation with the faculty
sponsors. There will be a one-hour oral exam by the readers, and they shall make a final decision regarding
honors.

CRITICAL LANGUAGES (Div. I)
Coordinator, JANE CANOVA
The Critical Languages Program enables students to study important foreign languages not taught in regular
courses at Williams. Hebrew, Hindi, Korean, and Swahili can be studied for one year at the elementary level.
Students work independently with standard language textbooks and individual cassette tapes for roughly ten
hours per week and attend two one-hour group review sessions per week with native-speaking tutors. Language
faculty from other institutions conduct the midterm and final exams and determine the final grades.
Critical Languages, Economics
­ 132 ­
To be eligible for a 200-level Critical Languages course, the student must:
z
demonstrate proven capability for independent work and previous success in foreign language study;
z
explain how study of the language will integrate with his or her major or other academic interests;
z
present a letter of recommendation from a Williams faculty member;
z
in some cases take a pretest for placement;
z
have attained sophomore standing or higher;
z
have at least a 3.00 Grade Point Average.
Interested students should obtain an application form for the desired course in early April. Forms are available
at the Center for Foreign Languages, Literatures, and Cultures in Weston Hall. Students must meet with the pro-
gram coordinator and hand in the completed application forms no later than one week before preregistration. The
application must be approved before registering for the course.
Students should note that Critical Languages courses are hyphenated, meaning no credit is given for the first
semester until the second semester is successfully completed. Students must normally begin a course in the fall
semester. It cannot be taken Pass/Fail.
A Critical Languages course will be scheduled only if and when at least two students are accepted into the
course. Students planning to register for the course must attend an organizational meeting the first week of each
semester.
Note: Elementary Arabic and Intermediate Arabic are offered as regular courses.

MAJOR
Students who have not yet taken an economics course should begin their sequence with Economics
110 and should follow the following sequence:
Economics 110 Principles of Microeconomics
(Note that students may not take any economics courses, including Economics 110 and 120, without hav-
ing passed the quantitative studies exam or the equivalent.)
Economics 120 Principles of Macroeconomics (Economics 110 or the equivalent is a prerequisite for 120)
Economics 251 Price and Allocation Theory
Economics 252 Macroeconomics
Economics 253 or 255 Empirical Methods
Students in the class of 2008: you may satisfy your empirical methods major requirement with ei-
ther Economics 253 or 255, or Statistics 201 and 346. (The statistical methods course should be
taken before any course numbered 400 or above.)
Students in the class of 2009 and succeeding classes: you must complete Economics 255 or the
equivalent to satisfy your empirical methods major requirement. Please note that Statistics 101 or
201 is a prerequisite from Economics 255. Students in the class of 2009 or later who are consider-
ing majoring in economics are thus strongly encouraged to take Statistics 101 or 201 early in their
college careers. Students may take the combination of Statistics 201 and 346 instead of Economics
255. Economics 253 can not be substituted for Economics 255.
Note that Economics 251, 252, and the Empirical Methods course can be taken in any order. In
most cases all three of these courses are prerequisites for Economics Senior Seminars, at least one
of which is required for the major. Senior seminars are typically taken during senior year or during
Economics
­ 133 ­
the spring of junior year. Students are thus strongly encouraged to complete these three core courses
by the end of junior year at the latest.
Prospective majors please note that instructors in all sections of Economics 251, 252, 253, and 255 and
courses numbered 350 and above feel free to use elementary calculus in assigned readings, lectures, problem
sets, and examinations; therefore, Economics 110 and 120 and Mathematics 103 or its equivalent are required as
prerequisites for these courses, with the exception of 251 which has only Economics 110 and Mathematics 103
as prerequisites. By elementary calculus is meant differentiation of single variable polynomial functions and con-
ditions for a maximum or minimum; it does not include integration. Students are also reminded that some
courses now have specific mathematics requirements; see course descriptions.
Elective Requirements:
Students must complete four Economics electives, of which at least two must be selected from advanced
electives numbered 350 to 394 (or from the CDE courses offered), and one of which must be selected from
electives numbered 450-475. (Note: With permission of the Chair of the Department of Economics, stu-
dents may substitute an extra 450+ elective for a 350-394 elective. However, in admitting students to these
courses, the department will give preference to students who have not yet taken a course numbered
450-475.)
The primary objectives of the major are to develop an understanding of economic aspects of contemporary
life and to equip the student to analyze economic issues of social policy. The introductory courses stress use of
the basic elements of economic analysis for understanding and resolving such issues. The two required inter-
mediate theory courses then provide a more thorough grounding in economics as a discipline by examining the
strengths and weaknesses of the price system in allocating economics resources and by examining the aggregate
processes which determine employment, inflation, and growth. A course in statistical methods, either Economics
255 or alternatively, Statistics 201 plus Statistics 346 (students graduating prior to 2009 may also use Economics
253 to satisfy the statistical methods requirement) equips the major to understand and apply the basic tools of
quantitative empirical analysis. In elective courses students apply theoretical tools and empirical techniques to
develop a richer understanding of economic phenomena and public policy.
Graduate training in economics requires more mathematical sophistication than does undergraduate econom-
ics. We encourage students who are considering pursuing a Ph.D. in Economics to take Economics 255, Mathe-
matics 105 (or 106), Mathematics 209, Mathematics 211 and Mathematics 301. As graduate schools also look
for evidence of research experience and promise, we strongly encourage interested students to write a senior
honors thesis in Economics.
Should I Major in Economics to Prepare for a Career in Business?
Economics is the study of the allocation of scarce resources among competing ends. As a social science, it is
devoted to developing a better understanding of many kinds of human interaction. It is important to stress that
training in economics is not the same as training in business management. Businesses have specific goals of their
own, including the making of profits, and professional training in business is about learning how to pursue those
goals more effectively. This requires learning quite specialized techniques and skills that are not the proper focus
of an undergraduate liberal arts education. Our undergraduate economics courses do not focus on these special-
ized business skills and techniques; therefore, students who major in economics or take many courses in it solely
because they believe that it is the subject that is "closest to business" are likely to be frustrated and unhappy in
their economics courses. We advise students to acquire a broad exposure to the arts, social sciences and natural
sciences, and to major in the subject that most excites them and engages their interest rather than attempt to ac-
quire extensive pre-professional training while undergraduates.
Credit for Coursework Done Elsewhere
The normal requirement that nine economics courses be taken at Williams will usually be waived only on the
basis of transferred credit deemed acceptable by the department. Credit is granted based on grades consistent
with college policy on various examinations:
z
Students who receive a 5 on the Microeconomics AP or Macroeconomics AP exam, or a 5 on each, may
place out of Economics 110 or 120, or both, respectively, but major credit will be given for only one
course.
z
The Department will grant major credit for both Economics 110 and 120 to a student who receives a 6 or 7
on the higher-level Economics IB examination, and that student can place into any 200-level course or
intermediate-level micro or macro course.
z
For A levels credit, the Department will grant major credit for both Economics 110 and 120 to a student
who receives a grade of A or B.
STUDY ABROAD
Students who are considering study abroad should consult with the Department's Coordinator for Transfers/
Study Abroad Credits early in the process of planning a year or semester abroad. (See the Department website to
determine which professor is the Coordinator for this academic year.) Economics majors or prospective majors
who are considering spending all or part of their junior year abroad are strongly advised to choose sophomore
courses such that they can complete their intermediate theory requirements (Economics 251, 252, and 253 or
255) prior to the start of their senior year. We recommend as well that students complete at least part of the ma-
jor's advanced elective requirement prior to the beginning of the senior year. Students who hope to pursue Hon-

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN ECONOMICS
We encourage all majors who have at least a 3.5 GPA in economics courses to consider honors. To be ad-
mitted to candidacy for honors in economics a student must complete a substantial piece of independent research.
Two routes to honors are open: the Specialization Route and the Thesis Route.
1) Specialization Route, consisting of these three units:
a. Development of a thesis proposal;
b. An honors winter study project (W30) in January of the senior year;
c. Economics 491 or 492 Honors Seminar. Students may pursue the Specialization Route to honors in their
senior year, either in the fall semester plus WSP or WSP plus the spring semester. After selecting an advisor
and discussing the topic with the advisor, the student should submit a thesis proposal to the department for
approval. (A description of what should be included in proposals is listed on the department's website.) Such
proposals frequently build on research papers completed for advanced electives, but this is not a requirement.
Students should submit proposals at the end of the spring semester if they wish to pursue a fall-WSP thesis,
and by one week after the last day of classes in December if they wish to pursue a WSP-spring thesis. The
department provides a memorandum to majors with more details every spring and fall.
2) Thesis Route (Economics 493-W30-494):
A few students each year will be accepted for year-long thesis research on a subject closely related to the
scholarly interests of a faculty member. A student who hopes to do such independent and advanced research
in close association with a faculty member should begin to work out a mutually satisfactory topic early in the
second semester of his or her junior year. Application to the department must be made before the end of the
junior year by submitting a detailed proposal for work under the supervision of the faculty member. The WSP
of the senior year is also spent on the thesis.
The College Bulletin states that students who wish to receive honors must take at least one course in addition
to the minimum number required for the major. Students who pursue a year-long thesis and therefore take
both Economics 493 and 494 may substitute Economics 493 for an upper-level elective (excluding those
numbered 400-490) if they wish to. Students who pursue the Specialization Route to Honors may not substi-
tute Economics 491 or 492 for an upper- (or lower-) level elective requirement.
Because economics honors theses frequently make use of empirical economic methods, students considering
writing an honors thesis in economics are strongly advised to complete Economics 255 or Statistics 346 before
the end of junior year.
AFRICANA STUDIES AND AREA STUDIES
A major in economics who concentrates in African-American or Area Studies may substitute the non-eco-
nomics courses in the concentration for one lower-level elective in the Economics major, but not for an advanced
elective (350-394).
Note on course numbers: Courses between 201 and 299 are lower-level electives and are open to students
who have taken 110 or 120. Courses 350 and above are advanced electives, have intermediate theory pre-
requisites, and are primarily designed for Economics and Political Economy majors. Courses numbered
450-475 are only open to students who have completed Economics 251, Economics 252, and who have
satisfied the statistical methods requirement unless the course prerequisite explicitly indicates otherwise.
ECON 110(F,S) Principles of Microeconomics (Q)
This course is an introduction to the study of the forces of supply and demand that determine prices and the
allocation of resources in markets for goods and services, markets for labor, and markets for natural resources.
The focus is on how and why markets work, why they may fail to work, and the policy implications of both their
successes and failures. The course focuses on developing the basic tools of microeconomic analysis and then
applying those tools to topics of popular or policy interest such as minimum wage legislation, pollution control,
competition policy, international trade policy, discrimination, tax policy, and the role of government in a market
economy. This course is required of Economics majors and highly recommended for those non-majors inter-
ested in Environmental Studies, Women's and Gender Studies and Political Economy. The department recom-
mends that students follow this course with Principles of Macroeconomics or with a lower-level elective that has
Economics 110 as its prerequisite. Students may alternatively proceed directly to Intermediate Microeconomics
after taking this introductory course.

An introduction to the study of the aggregate national economy. Develops the basic theories of macroeconomics
and applies them to topics of current interest. Explores issues such as: the causes of inflation, unemployment,
recessions, and depressions; the role of government fiscal and monetary policy in stabilizing the economy; the
determinants of long-run economic growth; the long- and short-run effects of taxes, budget deficits, and other
government policies on the national economy; and the workings of exchange rates and international finance.

ECON 203(F) Gender and Economics (Same as Women's and Gender Studies 203)
This course uses economic analysis to explore how gender differences can lead to differences in economic out-
comes, in both households and the labor market. Questions to be covered include: How does the family function
as an economic unit? How do individuals allocate time between the labor market and the household? How have
changes in family structure affected women's employment, and vice-versa? What are possible explanations for
gender differences in labor force participation, occupational choice, and earnings? What is the role of govern-
ment in addressing gender issues in the home and the workplace? How successful are government policies that
primarily affect women (e.g., comparable worth policies, AFDC/TANF, subsidization of child care)? The course
will focus on the current experience of women in the United States, but will place these gender differences in a
historical and cross-cultural context.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: short papers, a midterm, and a final.

This course examines the role of the government in a market economy. Three broad issues are considered: when
is government intervention in the economy appropriate? What is the most effective form of intervention? What
effects do government policies have on individual incentives? The course will cover issues in both taxation and
spending. Specific programs will be considered such as Social Security, Medicare, education, and public assis-
tance for the poor. We will also discuss rationales and strategies for reforming the U.S. tax system.

ECON 209(S) Labor Economics
This course covers basic labor markets and the determination of wages in the U.S. The determination of wages
and employment levels through demand and supply of labor in competitive and non-competitive markets is the
basis for analyzing the wide range of outcomes we observe in the U.S. Differences in earnings and employment
are analyzed through a variety of mechanisms such as labor force participation, the role of unions, human capital
accumulation and occupational choices. Topics with important public policy implications such as discrimination
and affirmative action, minimum wages, and immigration will also be presented. Theoretical models will be
presented and critiqued with empirical evidence from U.S. labor markets.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on a combination of exams and short policy papers.

sion-making (how we should make decisions under general conditions), descriptive decision-making (how we
do make decisions under actual conditions), and the contrast between the two. We proceed to a view of prescrip-
tive decision-making, or how we might combine normative and descriptive insights to improve decision-making
and judgment. Topics include decision-analytic methods for improving decision-making rigor (e.g., decision
trees); microeconomic concepts and tools for optimization problems; game theory as appropriate; insights from
cognitive psychology on heuristics (short cuts) that sometimes help, but often distort, decision-making; inte-
grated models of judgment that call for both analysis and intuition; insights from the newly-emerging studies of
judgment and wisdom. Until a few years ago, this topic was given normative treatment in departments of engi-
neering, statistics and economics, and was separately taught as a descriptive science in departments of psycholo-
gy. The apparent value of combining the two into a single, prescriptive analysis of decision-making and judg-
ment has led to a recent wave of interdisciplinary approaches such as the one adopted in this course.

and investment decisions of multinational corporations are analyzed and compared to the predictions of interna-
tional trade theory. Second, competitive strategies of indigenous and foreign rivals in U.S., Pacific rim, and Euro-
pean markets are explored. Third, the efficacy of government policies in promoting the competitiveness of in-
dustries in global markets is discussed. Case studies of firms, industries, and countries will be utilized.

This course first explores the role of the financial system and financial markets, and how they interact with the
economy. What does finance do? How are asset prices determined, and how are these prices related to interest
rates? Are financial markets efficient, and what are the implications of their efficiency or lack thereof? Second, it
analyzes the role of the central bank and the conduct of monetary policy. Special attention will be given to the
organization and the operation of the Federal Reserve System, but other monetary policy regimes will also be
considered. Students will simulate a meeting of the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee, either to decide on
monetary policy or to debate a current policy monetary policy or regulatory issue. Third, it studies the complexi-
ties associated with managing and regulating modern financial instruments. Throughout the impact of incentives
on the shape and evolution of the financial system will be stressed.

This tutorial will examine normative and empirical aspects of economic justice, with a special emphasis on con-
cerns related to income distribution. The course is loosely structured around three questions: a) How ought in-
come be distributed? b) How is income distributed? c) What policies should be considered when a) and b) differ?
The first question moves us into the area of ethics. We will spend several classes discussing the connections
between economic analysis and ethical theory. The second question moves us into the area of facts and theories
surrounding income distribution. The third question moves us to consider policy responses to any perceived pro-
blems. In considering question c) we will focus on issues related to the distribution of income and status in the
United States.
Format: tutorial; will meet weekly for one hour in groups of 2. Evaluation will be based on six 5- to 7-page

democracy. The course covers topics such as the behavior of voters and politicians in elections, the analysis of
legislative policymaking process, the role of the bureaucrats in government, the role of interest groups and
money in politics, etc. After having developed a perspective on the way a government "actually" functions
(rather than the way it "ought to"¯function), we will go on to reevaluate the role of the government in the lives of
its citizens.

ECON 379(F) The Economics of Sustainability (Same as Environmental Studies 379) (Q)
Sustainability is a term used frequently in environmental policy debates,but what does it really mean? At their
core, all definitions of sustainability and sustainable development are about trade-offs between what we as a
society consume today and what we leave for future generations but they often differ substantially in what they
imply for environmental policy. The objective of this course is to consider a number of different notions of sus-
tainability--from economics, the environmental sciences and social philosophy--and use the tools of economic
theory to develop their policy implications. A key element of many of the environmental policy decisions that we
will consider is that they involve complex interactions between human and biophysical systems. Because of this,
the course will also emphasize the analytical tools required to make sense of these interactions and the use of
computer simulation to study the impacts of proposed policy measures.
Format: Seminar/discussion. Requirements: Problem sets and computer lab assignments, a midterm exam, and a
final paper.

lyze the strategic interaction between firms to study their ability to protect and exploit market power. Aspects of
strategic decision-making that we shall study include: price discrimination, product selection, firm reputation,
bundling and collusion. We conclude with a discussion of the role of anti-trust policy. Theoretical models will be

relate to developing countries. Questions to be covered include the following: How do institutions affect patterns
of resource use? What is the relationship between economic growth and demand for environmental quality?
How does trade affect environmental quality and resource exploitation? What are the tradeoffs between efficien-
cy and equity when it comes to environmental protection and natural resource management? What are strategies

ECON 456(F) Income Distribution
This course examines the distribution of income in the U.S., with particular emphasis on how it is affected by
taxes, transfers, and other government programs. Most of the course will focus on the bottom of the income
distribution, where the role for policy is greatest. Questions to be addressed may include the following: What are
the causes and consequences of poverty? How do welfare, the minimum wage, and the EITC affect those in
poverty? How does discrimination affect the incomes of various demographic groups? What are the effects of
affirmative action? How much mobility is there across the income distribution? What explains the recent growth
in income at the top of the distribution, and the resulting increase in inequality?
Format: seminar/discussion. Requirements: short writing assignments, computer lab exercises, oral presenta-
tions, and a final research paper.
Prerequisites: Economics 251 and 253 or 255 or equivalent. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference:

ECON 458T(F) Economics of Risk
Risk and uncertainty are pervasive features of economic decisions and outcomes. Individuals face risk about
health status and future job prospects. For a firm, developing new products is risky; furthermore, once a product
has been developed, the firm faces product liability risk if it turns out to be unsafe. Investment decisions - from
managing a portfolio to starting a business - are also fraught with uncertainty. Some risks are environmental -
both manmade problems and natural disasters; other risks include the possibility of terrorist attack and, more
locally, issues of campus safety. This tutorial explores both the private market responses to risk (e.g., financial
markets, insurance markets, private contracting, and precautionary investments and saving) and government pol-
icies towards risk (e.g., regulation, taxation, and the legal system). From a theoretical standpoint, the course will
build on expected utility theory, diversification, options valuation, principal-agent models, contract theory, and
cost-benefit analysis. We will apply these tools to a wide variety of economic issues such as the ones listed above.
One goal of the course is to discover common themes across the disparate topics. Students will be expected to
read and synthesize a variety of approaches to risk and uncertainty and apply them to various issues.
Format: tutorial.
Requirements: Students will meet with the instructor in pairs in each week. They will write a paper or short
project every other week, and comment on their partner's paper (or project) in the other weeks. The final two
weeks will be reserved for applied projects of the student's choice. One of the papers during the term will be
revised to reflect feedback from the instructor and the student's partner.
Prerequisites: Economics 251, 252, and Economics 253 or 255. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Preference

ECON 459(F) Economics of Institutions
Why are some countries rich and others poor? There are numerous candidate explanations emphasizing factors
ranging from demography to technological innovation to unequal international relations. However, some econo-
mists like Douglass North and Mancur Olson have argued that beneath the profusion of proximate causes the
quality of a country's "institutions" fundamentally determines its economic prospects. The word "institutions" is
used broadly; it can refer to micro-structures like households or macro-structures like the state. The course will
survey the literature on institutions and economic development, discussing both developed and developing coun-
tries. Readings will largely consist of published journal articles and unpublished work of similar quality. Students
should expect to use microeconomic theory and econometrics learned in previous courses. Evaluation will be
based on four short papers of 7-10 pages each.
Format: seminar.
Pre-requisites: Economics 251, Economics 253 or 255 or the equivalent. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19).
Preference will be given to senior Economics majors. Students who have already taken Economics 502 will not
be admitted.

ECON 462(S) The Economics of Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs)
NGOs have played an increasingly important role in the provision of relief and development programs in devel-
oping countries. They have become key partners for the donor community and, as a result, an increasing fraction
of foreign aid has been channelled through international and local NGOs. This seminar will survey recent
theoretical and empirical economic literature on NGOs. Topics will include: should governments contract out
public good provision to NGOs? when are NGOs more desirable public good providers than for-profit firms?
why do most NGOs operate under a not-for-profit status? what is the role of employees' intrinsic motivation?
NGOs and donors; the commercialization of NGOs; NGOs and politics.
Evaluation will be based on: four short papers (4 to 6 pages,), each critically reviewing a paper on the reading list;
one final paper (7 to 10 pages) which will be either an essay reviewing papers around one particular issue, or an
independent research paper (for those interested).
Prerequisites: Economics 251, Economics 253 or 255 or the equivalent. Enrollment limit:19 (expected 19). Pref-
erence to senior majors.

ECON 463(S) Financial History
This course opens with a brief survey of some of the major characteristics, issues, and challenges of financial
systems today, and then examines earlier experience with these phenomena. Topics to be examined include: the
role of finance in economic development historically; the relationship between finance and government, and the
extent to which it has changed over time; the lessons from early stock market, real estate, canal, railroad, and
even tulip bubbles, for modern financial systems; the effect of institutions (laws, norms, and culture) and political
systems in shaping the impact of finance, as illustrated by comparisons between Mexico and the U.S., among
other cases. The course also examines the tools that were developed in earlier epochs to deal with different risks,
evaluate their efficacy, and consider lessons for modern financial regulation. Implications and lessons for current
financial issues will be discussed throughout.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will consist of three short papers, one draft and the final research paper, at least one
oral presentation and contributions to class discussions.

ECON 464(S) (formerly 367) Empirical Methods in Macroeconomics (Same as Economics 514) (Q)
Macroeconomics and related fields in international finance and development have evolved specialized empirical
techniques, known generally as macroeconometrics, which are designed to meet the practical challenges that the
data and the empirical questions pose in these fields. The course will introduce the theory and application of these
techniques, and students will learn how to implement these techniques using real world data to address practical
questions drawn from the fields of macro, international finance and development. Topics to which these tech-
niques will be applied include business cycle analysis and forecasting, sources of exchange rate volatility and
determinants of long run economic growth. Computer work and programming will be an important and integral
part of the course, but no previous training is expected. Economics majors who are considering writing an honors
thesis on related topics are encouraged to enroll in this course during the spring semester of their junior year.
Students studying abroad during their junior year may nonetheless take this course during their senior year.
Format: seminar. Requirements: short empirical projects, midterm, term paper.
Prerequisites: Economics 252, Economics 255 or equivalent, and Economics 360. Enrollment limit: 19 (ex-

ECON 467T(F,S) Development Successes (Same as Economics 518T) (W)
Although living standards in most of the worlds poor countries have increasingly fallen behind those of the rich
industrial countries, a relatively small number of countries that were quite poor in the middle of the last century
have achieved dramatic improvements in their incomes since then. These development successes include coun-
tries such as Japan, the four dragons (Hong Kong, Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan), the MIT economies (Malay-
sia, Indonesia, and Thailand), the Asian giants of China and India, as well as non-Asian economies as diverse as
Botswana, Chile, and Turkey. This tutorial will explore why these countries have apparently succeeded where
many other poor countries have failed. A particular focus of the course will be on extracting insights from the
experiences of these success cases about the broad development strategies that have been advocated over the past
50 years by scholars as well as by the international financial institutions.
Format: tutorial. Methods of evaluation; students will write five papers during the term, and will prepare and
deliver formal comments on five papers written by other students.

ECON 501(F) Development Economics I*
The course examines concepts, tools, and models in contemporary economic theory that have proved relevant to
development problems, and their application in economic policymaking. Topics include growth processes and
structural change; investment and sources of saving; capital, labor, and technological progress; policies for pub-
lic, private, and foreign enterprises; policymaking and negotiation in governments; and policies for reducing
poverty and inequality.

ECON 502(S) Institutions and Governance
Over the last two decades economists have become increasingly aware of the importance of the "social infra-
structure" at various levels of economic activity: capable and honest government officials must be available to
formulate and implement policies, markets must be supported by suitable institutional frameworks, property
rights must be secure, and contracts reliably enforced. Even the structure of the household, the smallest institution
analyzed by economists, has been shown to have an important influence on economic development. This course
will survey the growing literature on institutions and governance. Evaluation will be based on several short pa-
pers. The class will primarily follow a discussion format.
Note: Requires permission of instructor. Students who have previously taken Economics 459 will not be en-
rolled.
Prerequisites: At least one among Economics 253, Economics 255, Economics 510, Economics 511, Statistics

ECON 503(F) Public Economics
Public economics is the branch of economics concerned with government expenditure and taxation, focusing
primarily on microeconomic aspects of these activities. It provides tools for understanding the effects of govern-
ment policies, as well as a useful conceptual framework for analyzing normative questions such as "what is a
good policy?" This seminar will present the basic principles for public economics, and apply them to topics of
particular importance in developing countries. The course will begin by considering the efficiency of market
economies, and rationales for government intervention in the market, such as public goods, externalities, infor-
mation-based market failures, and equity. Applications include education, health care, aid to the poor, and infra-
structure. We then move on to the economics of taxation, considering what kinds of taxes are used in developing
countries and how they are designed, the economic and distributional effects of taxation, questions of administra-
tion and evasion, and options for reform. Time permitting, we will also address topics such as pubic enterprises,
political economy, and decentralization.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: problem sets, one 5- to 7-page paper, a 15-page final paper, midterm,
and a final exam.
Prerequisites: Economics 251. In addition, an empirical methods course (Economics 253, 255, 510 or 511, or
Statistics 346) must be taken before or concurrently with this class. Enrollment limit: 30 (expected: 25-30). Un-

This course focuses on the financial system and its role in economic development. The first part explores the
functions of finance, how it contributes to growth, and reviews different models of financial sector development
and their influence on how governments viewed the sector. It will examine experiences with financial sector
repression and subsequent liberalization, and investigate the causes and impact of financial crises. Then it will
study how to make finance effective and how to prevent or minimize crises, analyzing government's role as
regulator, supervisor, standard setter, contract enforcer, and owner. In this final part, attention will be devoted to
the role of institutions (laws, norms, culture) and incentives in financial sector development.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: two short papers, midterm, and a final exam.

ECON 509(F) Developing Country Macroeconomics
This course focuses on the relationship between macroeconomic policies and economic growth in developing
countries. After examining the links between macroeconomic stability and long-run growth, the rest of the
course is divided into three parts. The first part is devoted to the construction of an analytical model that is suit-
able for analyzing a wide variety of macroeconomic issues in developing countries. This model provides the
general framework for a more specific analysis of fiscal and monetary policies in the two remaining parts. In
analyzing fiscal policy, the course will consider in particular the requirements of fiscal solvency and the contribu-
tion that fiscal policy can make to macroeconomic stability. It will also examine alternative methods for achiev-
ing fiscal credibility, including the design of fiscal institutions. The final part of the course will turn to an analysis
of central banking, focusing on central bank independence, time consistency of monetary policy, and the design
of monetary policy rules in small open economies.

on the International Monetary Fund and to a lesser extent the World Bank, but consideration also may be given to
the regional development banks, Bank for International Settlements, and Paris Club used for official debt rene-
gotiations. Topics and readings will focus on such issues as: the roles and governance reform of the IMF and
World Bank; relations between the two institutions and their relations with other institutions of international fi-
nance and governance; lessons from their performance in the Asian, Argentine, and other international financial
crises; and the recent initiatives of the Fund and Bank in the global adjustment process, financial system stability
(including money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism), public and private sector governance,
lending programs, the management of international reserves, and provision of advice to members.
Tutorial meetings will be on Fridays. Participants will meet in pairs with the faculty member. Each week, one
student will prepare a policy paper and submit the paper to the professor and to the other student in advance of the

COURSES AND COURSE-NUMBERING
The course offerings in English enable students, whether majors or non-majors, to explore literature in a vari-
ety of ways, and to satisfy their interests in particular authors, literary periods, and genres. They emphasize inter-
pretive skills, systematic and critical thinking, and careful attention to the generic, cultural, and historical contexts
of literature written in English.
100-LEVEL COURSES
At the introductory level, the department offers a range of writing-intensive 100-level courses which focus on
interpretive skills as well as skills in writing and argumentation. The department also offers English 150, Exposi-
tory Writing, a course focusing on analytic writing skills. All 100-level courses are designed primarily for first-
year students, although they are open to interested sophomores, juniors, and seniors. A 100-level course other
than 150 is required for admission to most upper-level English courses, except in the case of students who have
placed out of the introductory courses by receiving a score of 5 on the Advanced Placement examination in
English Literature or of 6 or 7 on the International Baccalaureate.
200-LEVEL COURSES
Most 200-level courses are designed primarily for qualified first-year students, sophomores, and junior and
senior non-majors, but they are open to junior and senior majors and count as major courses. Several 200-level
courses have no prerequisites; see individual descriptions for details. 200-level Gateway courses are designed for
first- and second-year students who are considering becoming English Majors, or who are interested in pursuing
upper-level course work in the department. All Gateway courses are writing-intensive. First-year students who
have placed out of the 100-level courses are encouraged to take a Gateway course as their introduction to the
department. Completion of a Gateway course is a requirement for the major.
300-LEVEL COURSES
The majority of English Department courses are at the 300 level. 300-level courses are open to sophomores,
juniors, and seniors. First-year students who wish to enroll in a 300-level course are advised to consult the
instructor.
400-LEVEL COURSES
400-level courses are intensive, discussion-oriented classes that place a premium on independent, student-ini-
tiated work. Such classes can be structured in a variety of ways. Aclass might culminate in a long final paper on a
topic of the student's devising and involve conferences focused on the progress of that project. A course might
alternate tutorial sessions with seminar meetings, or it might take the form of a colloquium, with discussions
organized around individual or group presentations on different aspects of a topic. Limited to 15 students,
400-level courses are open to students who have completed at least one 300-level English course; they should be
attractive to any student interested in a course that emphasizes intensive discussion and independent work. Ma-
jors considering Honors work are urged to take a 400-level course before senior year as a way of preparing for
Honors work.

­ 145 ­
ADVISING
All junior and senior English majors are assigned a departmental faculty member as an advisor. Students'
preferences for advisors are solicited during the preregistration period in April, and assignments are announced at
the start of the school year.
Non-majors who wish to discuss English Department offerings are invited to see any faculty member or the
department chair.
MAJOR
Majors are urged to select a balance of intermediate and advanced courses, and to choose classes from the
American, British and Anglophone traditions. Each student can fashion his or her own sequence of study within
a basic pattern that insures coherence and variety. This pattern comprises at least nine courses.
They are also urged to elect collateral courses in subjects such as art, music, history, comparative literature,
philosophy, religion, theatre, and foreign languages with a view to supporting and broadening their studies in
literature. In particular, the study of classical and modern languages, as well as of foreign literatures, is strongly
recommended.
Requirements
The nine courses required for the major must include the following:
1) Any 100-level English class except English 150. Students exempted by the department from 100-level
courses will substitute an elective course.
2) At least two courses dealing primarily with literature written before 1700 (identified in parentheses at the
end of the course description).
3) At least two courses dealing primarily with literature written between 1700 and 1900 (identified in paren-
theses at the end of the course description).
4) At least one course dealing primarily with literature written after 1900 (identified in parentheses at the end
of the course description).
5) At least one "criticism" course (identified in parentheses at the end of course description). A course fulfil-
ling the criticism requirement entails a sustained and explicit reflection on problems of critical method, whether
by engaging a range of critical approaches and their implications or by exploring a particular method, theorist, or
critic in depth. Please note that when a criticism course also deals with literature satisfying ahistorical distribution
requirement (pre-1700, 1700-1900, etc.), the course may be used to satisfy either the criticism or the chronologi-
cal requirement, but not both.
6) At least one 200-level Gateway course (listed at the end of the 200-level course descriptions). Gateway
courses are designed for first- and second-year students contemplating the major or intending to pursue more
advanced work in the department; these courses focus on analytical writing skills while introducing students to
critical methods and historical approaches that will prove fruitful as they pursue the major. (Note: a Gateway
course can fulfill a Period or Criticism requirement as well as a Gateway requirement.)
The department will now give one elective course credit toward the major for a course taken in litera-
ture of a foreign language, whether the course is taught in the original language or in translation. Such a
course may not be used to satisfy the department's historical distribution, criticism, or gateway require-
ments.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN ENGLISH
The English Department offers three different routes toward honors: a creative writing thesis, a critical thesis,
and a critical specialization. The requirements of each are described below. Candidates for the program should
normally have at least a 3.5 average in courses taken in English, but admission will not depend solely on course
grades. Formal application to pursue honors must be made to the director of honors by April of the junior year.
For the class of 2008, the Director of Honors is Professor Theo Davis.
All routes require honors students to take a minimum of TEN regular-semester courses (rather than the nine
otherwise required for the major), and to devote their senior year winter study course to their honors projects.
All students writing a Critical Thesis or pursuing a Critical Specialization will be required to take the Honors
Colloquium in the Fall Semester. The Honors Colloquium replaces English 497, the Honors Independent Study,
for which students in Critical Honors were required to register in previous years. For more information on the
Honors Colloquium, see the course description. When pre-registering for Fall 2007, students who are applying to
Honors should select a full slate of courses. If accepted into the Honors program, those students will then drop a
course and will be allowed to register for the Colloquium. Students are advised to consider that if accepted into
the program, the Honors Colloquium will meet at 9:55-11:10 TR. More specifically:
Students doing a creative writing thesis must, by graduation, take at least nine regular semester courses, and,
in addition, take English 497 (Honors Independent Study) and English W31 (Honors Thesis, winter study) dur-
ing senior year.
Students writing acritical thesis must, by graduation, take at least eight regular-semester courses, and, in addi-
tion, take English 493 and English 494 (fall Honors colloquium and spring Honors Independent Study) and En-
glish W31 (Senior Thesis, winter study) during senior year.
Students pursuing a critical specialization must, by graduation, take at least eight regular-semester courses,
and in addition, take English 493 and English 494 (fall Honors colloquium and spring Honors Independent
Study) and English W30 (Honors Thesis: Specialization Route, winter study) during senior year.
A student who is highly-qualified to pursue honors, but who, for compelling reasons, is unable to pursue a
year-long project, may petition the department for permission to pursue a critical thesis or critical specialization
over one semester and the winter study term. Since the norm for these projects is a full year, such permission will
be granted only in exceptional circumstances. If granted, the standards for admission and for evaluating the final
project would be identical to those that apply to year-long honors projects.
English

All students who wish to apply to the honors program are required to consult with a prospective faculty advi-
sor, as well as with the director of honors, before April of the junior year. In April, candidates submit a 1-page
preliminary proposal that provides as specific a description as possible of the proposed project. The director of
honors reviews proposals with the faculty advisor, and then makes a recommendation to the whole department.
Students whose proposals are accepted receive provisional admission to the program at this time. Students not
admitted to the honors program are advised, when appropriate, about other possible ways of pursuing their inter-
ests (e.g., independent studies, regular departmental courses).
Admitted students must consult with their advisors before the end of the spring semester of junior year to
discuss reading or work pertinent to writing the formal honors prospectus. This prospectus is a decisive factor in
final admission to the program. The prospectus must be submitted to the Director of Honors and the advisor (two
copies) by July 30 before the fall of senior year. After reviewing the prospectuses and consulting with advisors,
the department's honors committee determines final admission to the program. Applicants are notified during the
first week of the fall term.
While grades for the fall and winter study terms are deferred until both the honors project and review process
are completed, students must do the equivalent of at least B+ work to continue in the program. Should the stu-
dent's work in the fall semester not meet this minimal standard, the course will convert to a standard independent
study (English 397), and the student will register for a regular winter study project. A student engaged in a year-
long project must likewise perform satisfactorily in winter study (English W30 or W31) to enroll in English 494
in the spring semester. When such is not the case, the winter study course will be converted to an independent
study "99."
Students are required to submit to their advisor, on the due dates specified below, three final copies of their
written work. While letter grades for honors courses are assigned by the faculty advisor, the recommendation
about honors is made by two other faculty members, who serve as readers of the student's work. These readers,
after consulting with the faculty advisor, report their recommendation to the whole department, which awards
either Highest Honors, Honors, or no honors. Honors of any kind are contingent upon satisfactory completion of
courses in the major during the spring semester of the senior year. Highest honors are normally awarded only to
students whose performance in both the honors program and regular courses in the major has been exceptional.
All students who are awarded honors participate in a series of informal presentations at the end of the spring term
in senior year.
Creative Writing Thesis
The creative writing thesis involves the completion of a significant body of fiction or poetry during the fall
semester and winter study of the senior year. (With permission of the honors committee, the thesis may be under-
taken during the winter study period and the spring semester of the senior year.) Since a student will most likely
include in the thesis writing done in earlier semesters, a creative writing thesis usually involves only the fall se-
mester and the winter study period, rather than the full year allotted to complete the critical essay.
Requirements for admission include outstanding work in an introductory and an advanced workshop, a rec-
ommendation from one of the creative writing teachers (who will then act as thesis advisor), a brief preliminary
proposal, and the approval of the departmental honors committee. No formal prospectus is necessary. A creative
writing thesis begun in the fall is due on the last day of winter study. The methods of evaluation are identical to
those for critical projects (but their page limits do not apply).
Critical Thesis
The critical thesis involves writing a substantial scholarly and/or critical essay during both semesters as well as
the winter study period of the senior year. The formal prospectus, a 2- to 3-page description of the thesis project,
should present a coherent proposal indicating the range of the thesis, the questions to be investigated, the methods
to be used, and the arguments likely to be considered, along with a brief bibliography.
Significant progress on the thesis, including a substantial amount of writing (to be determined by student and
advisor), is required by the end of the fall semester. A first draft of the thesis must be completed by the end of the
winter study period. The spring semester is to be devoted to revising and refining the work and to shaping its
several chapters into a unified argument. Ideally, the length of the honors essay will be about 15,000 words
(roughly 45 pages). In no case should the thesis be longer than 25,000 words, including notes. The finished thesis
is due on the third Monday following spring break.
Critical Specialization
The critical specialization route is intended to provide students with an opportunity for making a series of
forays into an area of interest that is both broad in scope and related to work undertaken in at least two courses. At
least one of these courses must be in the English Department, and both need to have been taken by the end of fall
term in senior year. The critical specialization must be united by a common area of interest, such as a given
literary form or historical period, a topic that cuts across several periods, an issue in literary theory, a topic that
connects literary and cultural issues, a comparative literature or interdisciplinary topic. Students are encouraged
to propose specialization topics of their own devising. The following examples are meant only to suggest the
kinds of topics appropriate to a critical specialization: lyric traditions, postmodern narrative, magic realism,
Dante and modern literature, Freud and literature, the poet as citizen, new historicist approaches to literature,
feminist film criticism.
In addition to reading primary works, the student is expected to read secondary sources, which describe or
define issues critical to the area of specialization. The formal prospectus, a 2- to 3-page description of the project,
should specify the area and range of the study, the issues likely to be explored, and the methods to be used for
their investigation. This prospectus should also describe the relation between previous course work and the pro-
posed specialization, and include a brief bibliography of secondary works. The pursuit of the specialization route
requires the following: (1) writing a set of three essays, each about 10 pages long (a page being approximately
250 words), which together advance a flexibly-related set of arguments. The first two essays are due by the end
English
­ 147 ­
of the fall semester, and the third by the end of winter study; (2) developing an extended annotated bibliography
(about 4-5 pages long) of selected secondary sources, explaining their importance to the area of specialization
(due mid-February); (3) meeting with the three faculty evaluators (one of whom is the advisor) during the last
two weeks in February to discuss the trio of essays and the annotated bibliography; (4) writing a fourth essay of
10-12 pages, the purpose of which is to consider matters that arose during the faculty-student discussion and to
reflect on the evolution and outcome of the intellectual journey undertaken by the student. This final essay is due
on the third Monday after spring break.
The same three faculty members are involved throughout the assessment process, and the standards and
methods of evaluation are the same as for other kinds of honors projects, with the following exception: For the
specialization route, the evaluation will also include the student's performance in the discussion with the three
faculty readers, and that discussion will include not only the student's writing but also secondary sources.
COURSES
100-LEVEL COURSES (except English 150)
Through small class discussions (limited in size to 19 students per section) and frequent writing
assignments, 100-level English courses ask students to develop their skills as readers and as analyti-
cal writers. These courses are prerequisites for taking most other English courses. Students who
receive a 5 on the AP English Literature exam may take upper-level courses without first taking a
100-level. All 100-level English courses are writing intensive, requiring at least 20 pages of writing
in a series of four or more formal essays.
ENGL 105(S) Poetry and Magic (W)
Ancient Celtic texts--Irish and Welsh--associate the poet (meaning any creator of fiction) with powerful ma-
gic--with shape-shifting, access to the other-world, and visions of transcendent authority and truth. Plato, in his
famous condemnation of poetry in The Republic, also associates poetry with magic, but with magic as a con
game or sleight-of-hand trick. This course will use Plato and Celtic texts to establish a theoretical framework for
reading and interpreting the representation of poetry and magic in a variety of literary works and films from the
Middle Ages to the twentieth century. The goal of the course, in addition to its particular subject matter, is to
develop effective reading and writing strategies for works of different genres and time periods. Reading will
include Chaucer's Friar's Tale (where the poet-figure is an evil magician); David Mamet's filmHouse of Games
(where the master of illusion is a con artist); Marlowe's Doctor Faustus (where the poet-figure sells his soul to
the devil for magical power); Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream and The Tempest (where fairies and
magic represent the positive powers of imagination); the "magical" transformations of gender and identity in As
You Like It and the documentary film Paris Is Burning (about the world of gay male balls in Harlem); and short
poems by Coleridge, Keats, Tennyson, and Yeats.
The class will be run as a discussion. Requirements: weekly writing assignments, both formal and informal,
including use of a class listserver and required electronic journal postings. Students will do about 20 pages of
writing and will be evaluated on writing and class participation.
No prerequisite. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference given to first-year students.
Hour: 11:20-12:35 TR KNOPP
ENGL 111(F,S) Poetry and Politics (W)
"Poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the world" wrote Shelley in his 1821 "Defence of Poetry," counter-
ing the widely held view of poetry's airy irrelevance to the material progress of humanity. His claims are echoed
a century and a half later in Audre Lorde's "Poetry is Not a Luxury," in which she argues that poetry is a vital and
essential part of her own political struggle as a Black lesbian feminist. But when W.B. Yeats--himself a very
politically involved poet--writes in 1917 that "from the quarrel with others comes rhetoric; from the quarrel with
ourselves comes poetry," he implies that poetry would suffer from too much involvement with the "quarrel with
others" that is politics, becoming, perhaps, something more like advertising jingles for political dogma. And
when W. H. Auden writes in 1939 that "poetry makes nothing happen" he appears to locate poetry's value pre-
cisely in its irrelevance to politics as such. This course will focus on the vexed relationship between poetry and
political struggle, reading predominantly poetry and poetics (writings about poetry) of the last two centuries in an
effort to answer the questions: what can poetry do for politics? what does politics do for (or to) poetry? Is poetry
essential to political struggle, or do poetry and politics mix only to the detriment of both, producing, on the one
hand, bad poetry, and on the other, mere distractions from the "real" work of politics? The primary goal of the
course is to make students better readers of poetry, and better readers and writers of argumentative prose. No
prior experience with poetry (or politics!) is expected.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: active class participation and 20 pages of writing in the form of fre-
quent short papers.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference given to first-year students.

(See under COMP 111 for full description.)
ENGL 123(F) Borrowing and Stealing: Originality in Literature and Culture (W)
Someone once said that bad poets borrow and good poets steal, thus suggesting that acts of theft, as well as their
subsequent cover-ups, may lie behind some of the best and seemingly most original works of art in history. And
English
­ 148 ­
it's not just the poets. More recently, an exhibition of artworks that employ copyrighted material, called "Illegal
Art," has directly challenged current U.S. copyright law. Given the ubiquity of visual, electronic, and audio sam-
pling in contemporary art, one might wonder if anyone even bothers to create alibis for today's artistic thefts.
This course will investigate ideas about artistic and intellectual influence, inspiration, borrowing, revision, ap-
propriation, and outright stealing. We will ask a series of questions as we look at a variety of material, mostly
literary, but also visual and musical, that troubles ideas about novel and derivative art. What's so original about
original art? Where does influence stop and plagiarism begin? What must be forgotten, or remembered, about
earlier works of art for a new one to appear to be just that--new? What becomes of our image of the artist as a
lone figure of genius in works that make ample use of others' material? The course will consider these questions
in part by reading various theories of originality and imitation, as well as recent re-workings of older literary
texts, such as a contemporary re-writing of Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray by novelist Will Self (in a
book sub-titled "An Imitation"). We will listen to music that relies heavily on the sampling of other works, as
well as look at collage art in various forms. In addition we will read new considerations of copyright law by legal
scholars to gain some sense of originality's shifting legal status. Throughout, we will refine our sense of the rela-
tions among fiction, art, originality, and imitation by studying some of the best acts of artistic and intellectual theft
of the recent past. Possible authors and works to be studied include Wordsworth and Coleridge, Oscar Wilde,
Sigmund Freud, Vladimir Nabokov, Andy Warhol, Will Self, and essays on copyright law.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: 20 pages of writing in the form of frequent short papers, active class
participation, and the possibility of a final creative project.

ENGL 126(F) Stupidity and Intelligence (W)
Stupidity fascinates authors, and they do not merely despise it--they feel it and make us feel it. Why? Around the
same time that psychologists began measuring and ranking intelligence--and stupidity, under various names, of
course occupied the space below (average) intelligence--literary authors were finding types of stupidity within
intelligence. What is stupidity? Why can't it stay sequestered from intelligence? Is there such a thing as literary
stupidity? (Can one be specifically a bad reader not only of books but of life?) What are the problems of intelli-
gence? We shall be reading stories, novellas, novels, and plays by Melville, Poe, Henry James, Kafka, Borges,
Stoppard, Faulkner, Flaubert, and others.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: active class participation, and five papers totaling 20 pages.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference given to first-year students.

ENGL 133(S) New Poetry (W)
This class is inspired by and organized around the "Young Poets" series sponsored by the English department
during 2007-2008. We will read or otherwise experience a range of poetry being produced right now in the U.S.,
including the work of the young poets who will be coming to campus during the course of the year. A lot of this
poetry doesn't immediately seem to "fit" in the classroom: it's too new, too weird, too raw, too cerebral, too
multi-media, too performance-oriented, somehow "unteachable." The premise of the course is that by engaging
with these diverse voices we will come up with ways of talking about them, and that in the process we will have
to take up some big and interesting questions: What is poetry--can it be defined? How does poetry aim to affect
us? Does one need "expertise" to appreciate it? And: is poetry important? Does it matter--socially, politically,
culturally? The course is aimed at lovers of poetry, those who dislike poetry, those who are intimidated by the
idea of it, and those who can't see why we should bother. Readings will be structured around the work of the
poets coming to Williams next year, and may also include some "old poetry" (for purposes of comparison), criti-
cal articles, and manifestos; we will also watch documentaries or listen to CDs of more performance-oriented
work (e.g., slam, spoken word). The class probably meets too early for the visiting poets to attend; ideally, then,
students would have some lunch hours and/or 4:00 times free to meet and hear them.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: regular attendance (you must be able to cope with an 8:30
class!--coffee provided for the weary); 5 short (from 2-3 to 5-6 pp.) papers, including one research paper on a
poet or poetic movement of your choice; occasional short postings for class discussion.

ENGL 135(S) Vengeance (W)
For almost three thousand years revenge has been a central preoccupation of European literature. Revenge is
inviting to literary and dramatic treatment partly because of its impulse towards structure: it traces a simple arc of
injury and retaliation. A injures B, and B retaliates against A. But retaliation is never easy or equivalent, and there
is always a volatile emotive mixture of loss and grievance that stirs up ethical ambiguities that are seldom resol-
ved. Vengeance also fascinates because it is so paradoxical. The avenger, though isolated and vulnerable, can
nevertheless achieve heroic grandeur by coming to personify nemesis. And yet the hero is always contaminated
by trying to make a right out of two wrongs--and he usually has to die for it. Driven by past events, cut off from
the present, and rapt up in stratagems for future reprisals, the avenger's actions are almost always compromised
English
­ 149 ­
by impotence or excess. At best, revenge is "a kinde of Wilde Iustice"--a justice that kills its heroes as well as its
villains.
We will look at as many stories of vengeance, across as wide a range of cultures and media, as possible.
Evaluation will be based upon class participation; 4 short papers (5 pp.), one of which will be revised into a
longer critical essay (of 10-12 pp.). Preference will be given to first-year students and then to sophomores. No
prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19).

ENGL 139(F) Metafiction (Same as Comparative Literature 139) (W)
This course will examine ways in which diverse works make use of their status as inventions on a page. We will
look at the formal pleasures and interpretive puzzles generated by metafictional techniques including frame nar-
ratives, repetition, and readerly address in texts ranging from Harold and the Purple Crayon to such canonical
works as Don Quixote, Lolita and One Hundred Years of Solitude. Might narrative self-consciousness operate as
a form of error-correcting code within the artificial intelligence of the novel?
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: five papers of increasingly complexity, totaling 24 pages; consistent
attendance and participation; a willingness to reread.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference given to first-year students.

ENGL 143(F) On Beyond Criticism: New Ways to Write about Fiction (W)
Pretty much what you do in English classes is read stories or novels or poems, discuss them, and write essays
about them. But critical essays are only one form of written response to a text, and in this class we will attempt
other forms as well: you could imagine, for example, reading a story, having a thought or two (or three!) about it,
and then using those thoughts to write another story entirely, whose implications form a critical interpretation of
the first. Or you could imagine a piece of biographical/archival research, or an interview with an author, to ex-
pose some mid-way point between his or her intention, his or her actual accomplishment, and what you think. Or
you could imagine writing a parody, the success of which would depend on a complicated piece of analysis that
goes entirely unsaid.
And you can probably see already why we won't be reading Shakespeare or Emily Dickinson for this class.
Instead, we will look at a mixture of horror, science fiction, and fantasy writers-that is, authors whose stories exist
not just as independent entities, but also as self-conscious members of a larger group of stories, conventions, and
traditions. These conventions will be useful not only as a source of analysis, but also as organizing principles for
our own fictional or meta-fictional responses. I have prepared a long list of writers, living and dead: Edgar Allen
Poe, HP Lovecraft, Theodore Sturgeon, Terry Bisson, Philip K. Dick, Samuel R. Delaney, Octavia Butler, Ange-
la Carter, Gene Wolfe, Kelly Link, Lucius Shepard, Connie Willis. In the event, I will probably choose four
names from this list.
Format: discussion/seminar. This is a writing-intensive seminar, and we will be writing intensively: numerous
small sketches, and at least four longer essays, of at least five pages each.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference to first year students.
Hour: 2:35-3:50 MR P. PARK
ENGL 145(S) Reading and Writing Science Fiction (W)
This course will explore some of the themes and techniques of modern science fiction by examining a range of
published stories, while at the same time making some new stories of our own. Writers of fiction and non-fiction
often watch each other with suspicion, as if from opposing sides of an obvious frontier. Though the goals of both
forms of writing--the disciplined articulation of brainy thoughts and mighty feelings--are similar, there is a
tendency in both camps to think their methods different and exclusive. The conceit of this class is to imagine that
constructing a plot and constructing an argument, say, are complementary skills, and that the tricks and tech-
niques of one type of writing can profitably be applied to the other. With this in mind, the class is made of two
strands twisted together--a creative writing workshop and a course in critical analysis. There will be short week-
ly assignments in both types of writing, as well as two larger projects: an original science fiction short story and a
critical essay. Assigned readings will include stories and essays by Terry Bisson, Octavia Butler, Rachel Pollack,
Samuel R. Delaney, Karen Joy Fowler, Carol Emshwiller, and John Crowley.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: active participation in class and a minimum of 20 pages of writing,
both critical and creative.

ENGL 146(F) Literature and Decolonization (W)
Colonialism was, and remains, a conquest of territory as well as of society and culture. In the heyday of European
colonialism, most of the non-European world was under the dominion of Europe's greatest powers. We will read
literature that urges and tells the story of anti-colonial struggle, grapple with narratives that engage the historical
moment of decolonization and its aftermath. In the process, we will ask (among other questions): How do films,
short stories, novels and poems narrate and represent, even urge, decolonization? Do the writers we read repre-
sent decolonization as the moment of colonial departure, the passing of sovereignty to the indigenous, the
triumph of a local culture? What's at stake in these different imaginings? How do you decolonize literature/ cul-
ture/ the mind? How do you tell stories of decolonization when imperialism looms ever larger? How do migrants
to Europe from its former colonies imagine their relation with their new homes? What is the relation of literature
with history? Possible texts by Chinua Achebe, Jean Rhys, Bessie Head, Tsitsi Dangarembga, Nayantara Sahgal,
Fanon, Memmi. Possible Films: Xala, Camp de Thiaroye, My Beautiful Laundrette, The Battle of Algiers, Home
and the World.

film history, including the role of genre and the contrasting narrative and visual conventions prevailing in Holly-
wood and in strikingly different national traditions, such as the silent cinema of the Soviet montage and the
French New Wave cinema of the 1960s. Critical readings will be assigned, and we will examine films by such
directors as Eisenstein, Keaton, Murnau, Renoir, Hawks, Welles, Kurosowa, Hitchcock, Almodovar and Jonze.

ENGL 210(S) American Modernism (Same as American Studies 210)
"Modernism" in literature refers to texts from the second half of the nineteenth through the first half of the twen-
tieth century; our course will center on prose in and around the 1920s. The central issue is their self-referentiality
and their extra-referentiality: books acutely aware of their own status as language nevertheless aspire to describe,
or even save, the world beyond words--modernism posits an aestheticism that can seem redemptive. Thus a
concern of the course will be the relation of modernism and modernity: the new world that needs saving. The
American version of modernism will in addition have the challenge of producing out of the difficulties of self-
conscious fiction a redemption that suits a democracy. Prose writers of the course will include Hemingway, Fitz-

ENGL 259T(F) Film Noir (W)
A study of the features and formal properties of that loose confederation of films called film noir, after the term
coined by the critic Nino Frank. That confederation has some of the properties of genre and at the same time
clearly crosses genre boundaries, helping us to interrogate both. It also, in its visual, iconographic, and thematic
features, continues to be one of the most influential genres or movements across world cinema today, fifty years
after its creation as a category. This course will be a consideration of that history and influence, with an emphasis
on film noir's stylistic innovations and thematic preoccupations. Films to be studies will include Billy Wilder's
Double Indemnity, Michael Curtiz' Mildred Pierce, Jacques Tourneur's Out of the Past, Ridley Scott's Blade
Runner, and Roman Polanski's Chinatown.

GATEWAY COURSES
200-level "Gateway" courses are designed for first- and second-year students contemplating the
major or intending to pursue more advanced work in the department; these courses focus on analyti-
cal writing skills while introducing students to critical and historical approaches that will prove
fruitful in later courses. (Note: a Gateway course can fulfill a Period or Criticism requirement as
well as a Gateway requirement. Students contemplating the English major are strongly urged to
take a Gateway course by the end of Sophomore year.)
ENGL 221(S) Rewriting Slavery (Same as Africana Studies 221) (Gateway) (W)*
Slavery was surely the most divisive and vexing issue confronting the United States before 1865. Whether or not
(and how) to abolish slavery was perhaps the primary issue, but behind this question lay many others whose
answers were equally contested. What was the nature of slavery as an institution? What were its effects on the
enslaved and the enslaver? What did the persistence of slavery say about the American experiment and Ameri-
can character? Though the 13th Amendment abolished slavery in the United States, at least in theory, answers to
these and similar questions continue to be contested as the country has moved from reconciliation to world pow-
er to lone superpower and "defender of freedom" around the world. Reading a variety of texts about slavery from
the antebellum era to the present, we will examine the ways in which slavery has been constructed and remem-
bered in both the popular and scholarly imagination and how particular texts intervene in the ongoing debates
about the place and meanings of slavery, race and racism in and to American life and culture. Likely readings
include Octavia Butler, Charles Chesnutt, Frederick Douglass, Stanley Elkins, Charles Johnson, Harriet Beecher
Stowe, and William Styron, Gone with the Wind and several episodes of the television miniseries Roots.
Format: seminar/discussion. Requirements: consistent participation in class discussion, twenty pages of writing

ENGL 223(S) Sensational Poetry (Gateway) (W)
"If I feel physically as if the top of my head were taken off, I know that is poetry," writes Emily Dickinson. Lyric
poems turn the most evanescent sensory experiences into words, giving them a seductive materiality that we can
hear, see, touch, taste, and smell. Lyric poems are personal and communal, immediate and eternal, conversational
and incantatory. "A poem begins with a lump in the throat," Robert Frost remarks, for "a complete poem is one
where an emotion has found its thought, and the thought has found the words." This course explores shifts in
poetic conventions and material culture from Petrarchan idealization to sexual seduction, from manuscript trans-
mission to print and internet.
We will read reflections on poetry and sensation from Plato and Aristotle to Julia Kristeva and Susan Stewart,
and lots of sensational poetry by Renaissance, modern, and contemporary poets such as Sidney, Shakespeare,
Donne, Jonson, Herbert, Eliot, Frost, Yeats, Wilbur, Strand, Glück, and Collins.

ENGL 230(S) Introduction to Literary Theory (Same as Comparative Literature 240) (Gateway)
(W)
In this course we will engage with the major arguments in the field of literary theory. Yet it is important that this is
not a catch-all survey class; rather, we will be conducting a continuing debate about the nature of literary mean
ing and the relationship of such meaning to political and moral problems. Thus we will ask, What determines the
meaning of a text? How can an interpretation of a literary work be deemed true or false? Is the relationship of
literature to politics foundational or peripheral? What's the point of reading literature? Is criticism a moral prac-
tice? Readings include Paul De Man, Stanley Fish, Terry Eagleton, Michel Foucault, and others.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: several short papers amounting to 20 pages of writing and an in-class

ENGL 233(F) Great Big Books (Same as Comparative Literature 283)(Gateway) (W)
Some of the greatest novels are really, really long--so long that they are too seldom read and taught. This course
takes time to enjoy the special pleasures of novels of epic scope: the opportunity to immerse oneself in a wide
and teeming fictional world; to focus sustained attention on the changeable fortunes of characters and societies
over a long span of time; to appreciate the detailed grounding of lives in their social environment and historical
moment; to experience the leisurely and urgent rhythms, with their elaborate patterning of build-ups and cli-
maxes, that are possible in such works. We will read but two novels, both preoccupied with the disruption and
evolution of lives and loves at moments of historic upheaval: War and Peace (1869), Leo Tolstoy's epic of the
Napoleonic Wars, and Parade's End (1924-28), Ford Madox Ford's modernist masterpiece about World War I
and its traumatic impact on English social life. Set a century apart, the novels are distinguished by vivid and
scrupulous representation of their respective wars, by their shrewd accounts of political and social pressures in-
forming the crises, and by their insight into the struggles of those whose lives are engulfed in global crisis. Tols-
toy's and Ford's approaches to fictional representation, however, provide intriguing contrasts: one favors the lu-
cidity of classic realism, the other the challenges of modernist innovation; one deploys a single multiplot novel,
the other a tetralogy of shorter novels developing a single plot. We will discuss the differing strategies and effects
of these two approaches, as well as the more general difficulties of reading and interpreting long fiction. Format:
discussion/seminar. Requirements: four short essays, as well as a revision and extension of one of these. Prereq-
uisite: a 100-level English course, except 150. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected 19). Preference to first- and sec-

ENGL 235(F) Comedy/Tragedy (Same as Comparative Literature 234) (Gateway) (W)
"Tragedy is when I cut my finger. Comedy is when you fall down an open manhole cover and die." Critics have
long sought to define comedy and tragedy against each other, yet, as Mel Brooks' joke suggests, the relationship
between the two is complicated, even disturbing. In this course we will read tragedies by Sophocles, Marlowe
and Racine, comedies by Aristophanes, Shakespeare and Moliere, and works that do not easily fit either classifi-
cation by Chekhov, Beckett and Stoppard. We will consider how in different periods the distinction between the
two forms has been understood and their antithetical effects accounted for. We will discuss the essential if also
problematic link between suffering and pleasure, and ask why it is that comedy persists while tragedy, at least in
its classical expression, no longer seems possible. Critical readings will include Aristotle's Poetics, Nietzsche's
The Birth of Tragedy, and Bergson's Laughter.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: four or five short essays, including at least one revision. There will
also be periodic film screenings.

ENGL 258(F) Poetry and the City (Gateway) (W)
In this course we will consider poems generated out of the experiences of urban life. The city provides for poets a
vivid mental and imaginative landscape in which to consider the relation of vice and squalor to glamour; the
nature of anonymity and distinction; and the pressure of myriad bodies on individual consciousness. We will
explore ways in which the poet's role in the body politic emerges in representations of the city as a site both of
civilized values and/or struggles for power marked by guile and betrayal. Taking into account the ways in which
cities have been transformed over time by changing social and economic conditions, we will consider such issues
as what the New York of the 1950s has to do with the London of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centu-
ries, and why poetry as a genre might be particularly suited to representing the shifting aspects of urban life. Poets
will include Dante, Pope, Swift, Blake, Wordsworth, Whitman, Baudelaire, Arnold, Yeats, Crane, Moore, Au-
den, Hughes, Bishop, Ginsberg, Baraka, and Ashbery. We will also draw on essays by Simmel, Benjamin, Wil-
liams, Canetti, and Davis; photographs by Hines, Weegee, and Abbott; the blues, as sung by Holliday and Vaug-
han; and films such as Man with a Movie Camera, Vertigo, Breathless, and Collateral.

ENGL 262(F) (formerly 356) Confession and Catharsis in the Poetry of Sylvia Plath and Ted
Hughes (Same as Women's and Gender Studies 262) (Gateway) (W)
Ted Hughes's publication of Birthday Letters in January, 1998, was portrayed in the press and reviews as break-
ing a 35-year silence on his wife Sylvia Plath's suicide in 1963. What made this volume of poems a bestseller
was its confessional and biographical drama. Hughes addresses his dead spouse and returns to all of the major
events in their shared life, simultaneously exposing his feelings and intuitions about what went wrong in their
marriage and why Plath was driven to take her life. Less evident to the general reading public was that Birthday
Letters extends a dialogue between Plath and Hughes on the nature of poetry and poetic identity that began in
their courtship. Plath felt that Hughes initiated her into a strong feminine voice, and she, in turn, was responsible
for introducing Hughes's poems, perceived as infused with violence and virility, to an American audience. The
poems that made Plath famous posthumously, however, were written in response to her separation from Hughes
and to his extramarital affair, and were collected in a volume titled Ariel that was altered by Hughes and pub-
lished after her death. This course will explore the Plath-Hughes marriage, both biographically and poetically.
Topics may include: the conflict between Plath's confessional sensibility and Hughes's sense of her intrusion on
their private life; the role of biography generally in literary interpretation; the vilification of Hughes by feminists
and the impact they had on both his poetry and the way he published Plath's poems, journals, and novel; and the
extent to which some of Hughes's final publications constitute "having the last word" on both personal and poet-
ic disagreements with his dead wife.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: class participation, four or five papers of varying lengths including
one revision, and occasional oral reports.

ENGL 264(S) Epic and Mock-Epic (W) (Gateway)
This gateway course begins with three masterpieces of world literature, Homer's Iliad and Odyssey and Milton's
Paradise Lost. We will examine metamorphoses of the epic genre from classical antiquity to modernity, its char-
acteristic attributes, traditional elements, and radical transformations. A key development is the rise of mock-
epic, such as Pope's The Rape of the Lock, Byron's Don Juan, Joyce's Ulysses, and Eliot's The Waste Land.
Since "epic" usually means long and demanding, some of these texts will be read selectively, stressing attentive
reading rather than exhaustive coverage.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: six analytic papers, roughly every other week, ranging from two to
five pages. Evaluation based on participation and written work.
Prerequisite: a 100-level English course or the equivalent, excluding English 150. Enrollment limit: 19 students

ENGL 265(S) Topics in American Literature: Freedom and Captivity (Gateway) (W)
Topics in American Literature is a course designed to explore the persistence of certain narrative patterns and
preoccupations in very different types of American writing. This semester, our concern will be with relations of
freedom and captivity, in works ranging from William Bradford's Of Plimouth Plantation to the autobiography
of Patty Hearst. Materials studied will include novels (Last of the Mohicans, Invisible Man, True Grit); slave
narratives (by Frederic Douglass and Harriet Jacobs); poetry (Emily Dickinson, Robert Frost); memoirs of In-
dian captivity; nonfiction (Into the Wild); and two or three films (perhaps Lethal Weapon and Turistas). We will
explore the affinity of these themes for certain genres (the western; the gothic slave tale), and consider the politi-
cal significance of those forms. Above all, we will pay attention to how, and why, these narratives often compli-
cate or reverse our ordinary sense of what counts as bondage, and what counts as freedom.

ENGL 301T(F) Four American Poets: Williams, Creeley, Kyger, Snyder (W)
This course offers an in-depth study of four poets, beginning with the modernist William Carlos Williams and
moving through the work of Robert Creeley, Joanne Kyger, and Gary Snyder, who succeeded Williams by
roughly two generations. Inasmuch as the three latter poets take up many of Williams's stylistic innovations and
display a similar absorption in what Williams called the problem of "contact" with the physical world, the course
will consider the questions of influence and inheritance, especially in respect to poetic form. But more central to
the course will be the investigation of each poet's individual techniques and turns of mind. While our primary
focus will be poetry, the course will also consider representative, extra-poetical work of each writer: Williams's
multi-volume prose/poetry collage, Paterson; Creeley's letters and hiss collaborative work with visual artists;
Snyder's essays; and Kyger's travel journals.

ENGL 309(F) Anger, Voice and Violence in Black Women's Stories (Same as Africana Studies 309
and Women's and Gender Studies 309)*
Though women have long been stereotyped as overly emotional (and thus irrational and inferior), real or just
anger has traditionally been seen as the domain of men. Angry women were not just unfeminine, but probably
crazy as well. How, then, to understand the stereotype and ubiquitous images of black women as angry, vocal and
assertive? We will begin this course by briefly examining some of these images and the various, often contradic-
tory, ways anger has been gendered, racialized and classed. Our primary focus, however, will be texts (novels,
essays, poetry, autobiography, music and film) authored by black women, which tend, unsurprisingly, to offer
more nuanced views of black women's anger. Why and at whom have black women been angry? How is that
anger expressed, suppressed, marginalized or denied? Under what circumstances, if any, might it be acknowl-
edged and validated? What are the uses of anger? Is silence ever a more appropriate or effective response than
speech (whether angry or not) to the wrongs and oppressions that produce anger? Is violence? Authors will in-
clude Gwendolyn Brooks, Harriet Jacobs, Gayl Jones, Audre Lorde, Toni Morrison, Ann Petry, Nina Simone
and Ida B. Wells-Barnett.

ENGL 311(S) Shakespeare, Fools, and Folly
One of Shakespeare's most vexed subjects is the nature and effects of folly, ranging from tragic error to humor-
ous clowning. Fools of many sorts figure prominently throughout Shakespeare's plays, especially in comedies
such as As You Like It and Twelfth Night, but also in tragedies such as Othello and King Lear, histories such as
Henry the Fourth, and romances such as The Tempest. Some of Shakespeare's greatest characters, like Hamlet
English

and Falstaff, play the fool. Focusing on the language and forms of folly, our reading will also draw upon history,
tradition, and critical theories to better understand clowns, fools, madness, and play.

two 10-page essays, or three 7-page papers. Evaluation based on class participation and written work.

English drama began as a communal religious event only to be reinvented as a peculiarly lurid-and profitable-

the first commercial theater in London in 1576 and the official closing of the theaters by parliamentary decree in
1642. We will focus on the sensational aspects of these works--their preoccupation with revenge, black magic,
sexual ambiguity and grotesque violence--and also on their technical virtuosity. Authors will include Christo-
pher Marlowe, Thomas Kyd, William Shakespeare, Ben Jonson, John Webster and Cyril Tourneur.

ENGL 316(S) The Art of Courtship (Same as Women's and Gender Studies 316)
During Elizabeth I's reign, love poetry and dramatic comedy acquired a remarkable popularity and brilliance,
unparalleled in English literary history. What is the "art"--the language, form, and rhetoric--of Elizabethan
courtship? What kind of society generated this literary obsession, and conversely, what kind of culture and sexual
relationships did the literature of courtship and seduction produce? This course explores the links between
literary conventions and social conventions, sexual politics and court politics. It studies gems of English
Renaissance literature (Shakespeare's Twelfth Night and Much Ado About Nothing, love poetry by Shakespeare,
Spenser, Sidney, and Donne, Castiglione's The Courtier) along with court rhetoric, political negotiations, the first
poem written and published by an Englishwoman, the first autobiography written by an Englishman, social
debates over poetry, the theater, sexuality, clandestine marriage, women's lawful liberty. There will be short
lectures and lots of discussion.

ENGL 317(F) Narrating Other Minds: Austen, Eliot, Woolf (Same as Women's and Gender
Studies 317)
At roughly fifty-year intervals, Britain produced three brilliant female novelists--Jane Austen, George Eliot, and
Virginia Woolf-- who would each become renowned, in her own way, for her ability to combine minutely de-
tailed social observation with a rich depiction of the inner lives of her characters. This course will examine some
of their major fiction--with an emphasis on Austen and Eliot--in the context of recent critical debate about the
nature and implications of their narrative methods for representing the consciousnesses of characters, and of the
authorial narrative voices that mediate among them. Questions to be considered: how is our understanding of
novelistic characters and consciousness shaped by our real-life experience in interpreting the thoughts and char-
acter of others, and vice versa? Do "omniscient" narrators lay claim to a privileged kind of knowing presumed to
be unavailable either to their character or to readers, or are they modelling humanly available interpretive stances
toward a world of others? Why does "free indirect discourse"--which blurs the distinction between the con-
sciousness of narrator and character--feature so prominently in the work of all three? Possible texts include Aus-
ten's Emma and Persuasion, Eliot's Middlemarch, Daniel Deronda, and "The Lifted Veil," and Woolf's The
Waves. Requirements: three 5- to 8-page essays and several shorter assignments.
Format: discussion/seminar. Evaluation based on class participation and written assignments.

pathy, and-always-closely watched. Eighteenth-century novelists-and their narrators-aggressively educate their
readers, not only teaching us how to interpret the novel itself, but also demanding that we self-consciously ques-
tion the powers of mind and habits of heart we bring to the process of interpreting a book, ourselves, and our
world. In this tutorial course, we will explore the narrative and rhetorical strategies two of the century's greatest
novelists use in creating, shaping, and finally educating their readers. We will focus principally on Henry Field-
ing's Tom Jones (1749) and Laurence Sterne's Tristram Shandy (1760-67)--long, brilliantly intricate novels that
go about their work in very different ways, but that are equally committed to the project of giving their readers a
novel education. We will consider--much more briefly--Fielding's Joseph Andrews, Sterne's A Sentimental
Journey, and Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress. We will also read criticism by such "reader response" theorists as
Stanley Fish and Wolfgang Iser, and--in the individualized setting of a tutorial--students will be asked to devel-
op and articulate their own theories of reading by examining critically the ways in which texts affect and educate
them. Format: tutorial. Requirements: Students will meet with the instructor in pairs for an hour each week; they
will write a 5- to 7-page paper every other week (five in all), and comment on their partners' papers in alternate
weeks. Emphasis will be placed on developing skills not only in reading and interpretation, but also in construct-
ing critical arguments and responding to them in written and oral critiques. Prerequisites: a 100-level English

ENGL 324(F) Topics in Eighteenth-Century Literature
Many fundamental features of the modern western world were invented in the 18th Century, and we will watch
several of them get invented, including the "media," modern ideas of the private self, notions of
gender and gender roles, and many ideas about the modern commercial state, including "equality" and even
"democracy." And also, by the by, "literature." We will read novels, newspapers, magazines, poems, and plays;
and we will look at a lot of paintings. Possible authors to be studied might include Jonathan Swift, Alexander
Pope, Eliza Haywood, Ben Franklin, Samuel Richardson, Fanny Burney, Oliver Goldsmith, Thomas Gray and
Laurence Sterne.

ENGL 333(S) The Nineteenth-Century British Novel
Imagine this: a form of art and entertainment that purports to be able to represent everything--intimate, even
inaccessible human thoughts and feelings, love, class, the city, shopping, sexuality, bureaucracy, social bonds,
industrialization, nationalism, even modernity itself. In this course we will try to understand the scope of the
nineteenth-century British novel's jaw-dropping representational aspirations: its claim to comprehend in its
pages both the dizzying complexity of new social, political, and economic structures, as well as delineate in finest
detail the texture of individual minds and lives. We will pay attention to the fictional modes by which apparently
intractable social problems are resolved, through a sleight of hand act we seem never to tire of, in the realm of
romantic love. And while we might think of the novel as an Empire of the Little, endlessly occupied with giving
significance to the smallest acts of ordinary human life, we will think about the broader historical and social
conditions the novel both represents in its pages, and is a crucial not-so-silent partner in promoting and contes-
ting. We will also interest ourselves in the kind of under-the-counter work the Victorian novel does on behalf of
British empire, as well as empire's own behind-the-scenes work for the novel. Since so many of these stories of
everyday life seem as familiar to us as everyday life, we will work hard to maintain what is strange and specific
about the nineteenth century even as we recognize within these works the birth of so much that is modern in our
own culture. Likely authors include: Austen, C. Brontë, Thackeray, Dickens, Eliot, Collins, Wilde, Hardy, Con-
rad.

ENGL 338(F) Literature of the American Renaissance (Same as American Studies 338)
The 1840s and 50s are known as "the American Renaissance," a watershed in American literary history which
includes Thoreau's Walden and Melville's Moby-Dick, Emerson's essays and Hawthorne's fiction. It also in-
English
­ 158 ­
cludes major abolitionist writings by Frederick Douglass and Harriet Beecher Stowe, Poe's grotesque tales, and
the groundbreaking poetry of Walt Whitman and Emily Dickinson. Thus, to study the American Renaissance is
to have the pleasure of exploring an inordinately rich period of literary history, and the challenge of negotiating
and explaining the links between works that have importantly distinct relationships to the literary culture and
national politics of the time. These writers do, however, share more broadly in a historical shift in the construc-
tion of private life: the nuclear family, the discipline of psychology, and the idea that one's emotions are a form of
essential personal property all emerged into their modern form in the nineteenth century. As part of this historical
shift, literature of the American Renaissance constitutes a complex investigation into the life of the emotions, the
concept of personal experience, and the representation of intimate human relationships. As we move through
fiction by Hawthorne, Melville, Stowe, and Harriet Wilson, the poetry of Whitman and Dickinson, and the essay
and autobiography of Emerson, Thoreau, and Douglass, we will explore throughout how these authors deploy
emotion, how they conceive of emotion's relationship to the individual person and to the culture at large, and
how they variously dramatize the affective leverage of relationships, including heterosexual romantic relation-
ships, relationships of slaves to their owners, and masculine relationships both homosocial and homosexual. We
will explore this essential period of American literature, then, by inquiring into the ways these authors figure
intimacy, emotion, and experience, as a venue to explore more broadly the formations of literary work and its
interventions into the culture of a nation heading toward Civil War.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: class participation, email responses to readings, three short papers

ENGL 342(F) Representing Sexualities: U.S. Traditions (Same as Women's and Gender Studies
342) (W)
In this course we will explore the way literary and other cultural texts produced in the U.S. represent and
construct queer sexualities. We will start with works considered to be some of the "first" definitively and/or
openly queer writings in America, and consider how they set the terms and tropes for representing queer identi-
ties, identifications and desires. From the outset, we will also consider how sexuality and race, as well as gender
and ethnicity, intersect in these texts. We will then move to study two rich cultural spaces: Harlem and Paris of
American expatriates. Baldwin's Giovanni's Room will serve as a bridge to fifties culture. In this section we may
discuss pulp fiction, queer subcultures, and the emergence of openly lesbian and gay writings. Finally the course
will focus on cultural texts from the last twenty years that represent the racial, ethnic, and class diversity of queer
communities, as well as the richness of its literary and cultural forms. Some of the main questions we will con-
sider are: What historical shifts and social conditions enable the formation of gay, lesbian, bisexual and trans-
gendered identities? How is the emergence of these identities tied to shifts in conceptualizing race in the U.S.?
How is desire itself racialized? What role does the literary and/or reading play in the constitution of identity and
community? What are the rewards and limits of established literary genres (such as the novel) when called upon
to represent queer lives? When do such lives need new literary and cultural forms? To what degree do queer
literatures constitute a canon, or multiple canons, with identifiable relations between older and more recent texts?
Readings may include works by authors and theorists such as Whitman, Dickinson, James, Hughes, Nugent,
Grimké, Larsen, Stein, Barnes, Baldwin, Bannon, Isherwood, Highsmith, Rich, Delany, Lourde, Moraga, Troya-
na, Kushner, Fisher, Cuadros, Chee, Zamorra, Sedgwick, Eng, Harper, Somerville, Foucault, Muñoz, and Rupp.

ENGL 343T(S) Whitman and Dickinson in Context (W)
In this tutorial, we will read closely the works of two of the most influential and fascinating poets in the U.S.,
Walt Whitman and Emily Dickinson. In addition to studying in depth their poems and other writings--in Whit-
man's case, his essays; in Dickinson's, her letters-we will delve into some of the major critical debates surround-
ing their work, both individually and when compared to one another. For example, Whitman is often viewed as
perhaps the most public nineteenth-century American poet, whereas Dickinson is regarded as perhaps the most
"private." We will interrogate this assumption, exploring how each poet represents publicity and privacy in his/
her work, as well as their efforts to "perform" and/or reform the American self. We will also examine how each
poet engages questions of gender and sexuality, as well as contemporary debates surrounding such issues as
abolition/slavery, women's suffrage, temperance, and territorial expansion. Finally, we will explore Whitman
and Dickinson's relation to significant literary and philosophical movements of the period, including transcen-
dentalism and the culture of sentiment. Throughout the course, emphasis will be on analyzing and generating
interpretations of Whitman and Dickinson's works, constructing critical arguments, formulating cogent written
critiques, and carrying on an oral debate about a variety of interpretations. Students will meet with the instructor
in pairs for an hour each week. They will alternate between writing 5- to 7-page papers and commentaries on
their partner's papers.
Format: tutorial. Students will be evaluated on their written work, their oral presentations of that work, their anal-

ENGL 344(F) Comedy under Political Pressure (Same as Comparative Literature 345)
It is a widespread misconception that because comedy is funny, it is therefore frivolous: lacking in weight or
force, incapable of serious meaning. This course defies such an assumption by studying comedies that engaged
the political conflicts and historical crises of their day with deeply serious and intelligent purpose even if by de-
ceptively madcap or absurdist means, and that often provoked alarmed or outraged responses as a result. Our
approach will be interdisciplinary: we will study not only these literary texts and films, but also the historical
events they addressed, and we will explore political, cultural and other theory that may help us to see pathways
connecting the realms of art and history. Rather than seeing history merely as a backdrop for literature, or litera-
ture merely as a mouthpiece for historical themes, we will try to think in simultaneously sociopolitical and aes-
thetic ways about both works of art and historical events. We will study comedies that illuminate historical crises
such as: the anarchist threat of the 1890s (Jarry's Ubu Roi), the Irish Revolution (Synge's The Playboy of the
Western World), World War I (Hasek's The Good Soldier Svejk), World War II (Renoir's The Rules of the Game,
Lubitsch's To Be or Not To Be, Heller's Catch-22), South African apartheid (the theatre and fiction of Pieter-Dirk
Uys), and the Cold War (Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove).

ENGL 346(F) The Human Face in the Modern Imagination (Same as ArtH 307, Comparative
Literature 356, and INTR 346) (W)
This is a class about faces: how we think about them, how we represent them in images and words, and how we
respond (or sometimes do not) to the meanings they express. Psychologists have shown that we are born with an
innate preference for face-like visual patterns, and as our minds develop, the cognitive importance of faces only
grows with age and enculturation. Idiomatic phrases such as "face to face," "to lose face," "to show one's face,"
and "two-faced" suggest how deeply intertwined is the human countenance with our everyday grasp of psycho-
logical concepts like mind, identity, and character. As Wittgenstein once remarked: "The face is the soul of the
body." In this seminar, we will explore attempts by artists, scholars, and scientists to describe, comprehend, and
sometimes even capture what makes the human face so special. We will look at images of faces and masks in
modern literature and art (Wilde, Picasso, Pound, Bacon, Arbus, Warhol, Coetzee, Close, Burson, Viola, Sher-
man, Pineda); art historical writings about the face and portraiture (Pater, Gombrich, Brilliant, Koerner); philo-
sophical reflections on the meaning of faces (Wittgenstein, Levinas, Deleuze); close-ups of the face in silent films
(Griffith, Eisenstein, Dreyer); writings on faces and masking practices by anthropologists and sociologists (Sim-
mel, Mauss, Bakhtin, Goffman); and psychological research on face perception and recognition (Ekman, Bruce,
Young, Baron-Cohen, Farah).
Format: discussion/seminar (with occasional lectures). Requirements: active participation in class discussions,
four 2-page response papers, and one 15-page research paper.

ENGL 353(S) Modern Poetry
In this course, we will explore the tangled and controversial means by which poets writing chiefly between the
two World Wars tied the political, social, and intellectual ferment of the era to the fate of poetry. Both dire and
admiring accounts of these poets' work point to a central impulse to aestheticize political and philosophical prob-
lems. Considering issues such as occultism, Irish nationalism and unrequited love in the poetry of W. B. Yeats;
pedantry, religious conversion, and baby-talk in that of T. S. Eliot; and cosmopolitanism, isolationism and insur-
ance in that of Wallace Stevens, we will consider the ways in which these poets' work both plays out and eludes
accusations of self-reflexive lyricizing. We will examine the roles of aristocratic bias, abstruse erudition, and pro-
to-fascism in their work, as well as critics' tendencies to equate these impulses. Although we will focus chiefly
on the work of these three poets, we will also refer to the poetry of William Carlos Williams, Ezra Pound, Robert
English

Frost, Marianne Moore and Langston Hughes, considering whether the populism and comparative stylistic ac-
cessibility of some of these poets is an antidote to, or another means to formulate, the concerns of so-called "high
modernism."

ENGL 360T(F) Joyce's Ulysses (W)
This tutorial explores in depth the demanding and exhilarating work widely regarded as the most important novel
of the twentieth century, James Joyce's Ulysses, which both dismantled the traditional novel and revitalized the
genre by opening up new possibilities for fiction. We will discuss how heroism and betrayal, intimate relation-
ships, the nature of subjectivity, sexuality and the politics of gender, civic engagement and artistic isolation, Brit-
ish imperialism and Irish nationalism are placed in counterpoint with patterns drawn from myth, theology, phi-
losophy, and other literature. A primary focus will be Joycean forms of comedy. In assessing Ulysses as the out-
standing paradigm of modernist fiction, we will be equally attentive to its radical and often funny innovations of
structure, style, and narrative perspective. Supplementary readings include selections from Homer's Odyssey,
Joyce's biography, and critical essays. (Students unfamiliar with Joyce's autobiographical A Portrait of the Artist
as a Young Man should read it.)
The tutorial format highlights the process of argument and the making of meaning: dialogue, discussion, and
debate are primary. In the spirit of Joycean many-mindedness, students will investigate various and competing
critical approaches. Those who have previously read Ulysses could be paired with each other. There are weekly
writing assignments, alternating four-page analyses and two-page responses. Evaluation based on essays and
responses.

ENGL 377(S) Suicides and Survivors
Adrienne Rich and Sylvia Plath were contemporaries, vying in the 1950s for the same poetry prizes and recogni-
tion as "obedient daughters" to a literary tradition that prized craft and impersonality as poetic virtues over con-
fession or politics. Both poets have become feminist heroines for their disobedience, each diverging radically and
in her own way from this tradition in the 1960s. As biographer Janet Malcolm puts it: "Women honor Plath for
her courage to be unpleasant" about being a "good girl" in the 1950s and about a philandering husband in the
1960s. Her suicide in 1963 was immediately followed by analyses of her poems in Ariel that directed critical
interest toward her life as an explanation of her craft. Her survivors have battled strenuously but ineffectually to
preserve the secrets of her life from "the voyeurism and busybodyism" of eager biographers and readers. Rich's
life competes with her poetry for critical interest and approval because of its political shape; its dedication to
feminism. The wife and mother of the 1950s became the political activist of the 1960s; the lesbian feminist of the
1970s. As expressions of a survivor and heroine of these movements for change, her life and art trace the forces,
both political and ideological, that have affected the lives of American women. This course will explore the lives
of each poet and the impact an understanding of their lives has on critical recognition of their art. We will be
reading from the fiction, poetry, journals, biographies, essays and correspondence of Plath and Rich, together
with interviews and reviews that have shaped critical reception of their work.
Requirements: one 4- to 5-page essay, one 6- to 8-page essay, a field trip to the Smith College Plath archive, and a

be helpful. Readings will include poetry, drama, fiction, memoir, reviews, and scientific works, all focused on
two crucial texts written roughly a century apart: Charles Darwin's The Origin of Species and James Watson's
The Double Helix.
Format: one long discussion class/seminar each week. Requirements: active class participation, class presenta-
tions, and weekly writing assignments, including two 5- to 7-page papers (one during each half of the semester)
for class presentation, and, during the weeks you're not presenting a major paper, short written responses to the
reading.

400-LEVEL COURSES
On the aims of these courses, please see description at beginning of the English Department section of the
catalog.
ENGL 404(F) Auteur Cinema and the Very Long Film (Same as Comparative Literature 324)
This course will focus on six master works by six major film directors: Michelangelo Antonioni's L'Avventura;
Bernardo Bertolucci's The Last Emperor; Ingmar Bergman's Fanny and Alexander; Francis Ford Coppola's
Apocalypse Now!; Federico Fellini's 8 1/2; and Akira Kurosawa's The Seven Samurai. These films were not
always well received: the audience to L'Avventura at Cannes yelled "Cut!" in exasperation with Antonioni's
desultory editing; Pauline Kael regarded both Fanny and Alexander and The Last Emperor as far inferior to
Bergman's and Bertolucci's youthful efforts, arguing that both had betrayed their former intellectual rigor with a
new sentimentality; Fellini was roundly criticized for narcissism and egotism in casting the heartthrob Marcello
Mastroianni as himself and devoting such a long film to his personal creative blockage; and Coppola's
Apocalypse Now! was perceived as a disaster in terms of its budget, its prolonged shooting schedule in a jungle
environment, and its devastating impact on the health of its cast and crew. Only The Seven Samurai seems to
have been recognized immediately as a masterpiece. All of these films are self-reflexive works, representing both
the distinctive personalities of their directors and their individual stylistic and thematic concerns--what makes
them examples of auteur cinema. During the first half of the course, we will meet to discuss these films
individually together with selected readings. At the same time students will be assigned one of these directors to
research for a long paper and oral presentation during the second half of the course.
Format: seminar. Requirements: oral presentation and one long (15-20 p.) paper
Prerequisites: one 300-level English class or permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 15 (expected: 15).

ENGL 412(S) Transcendentalism
"Every intellectual man," writes Ralph Waldo Emerson, is capable of "unlocking, at all risks, his human doors,
and suffering the ethereal tides to roll and circulate through him: then he is caught up into the life Universe, his
speech is thunder, his thought is law, and his words are universally intelligible as the plants and animals." How
did a disenchanted minister, living in a small town in Massachusetts, come to make such a stunning pronounce-
ment? And why have both Emerson's and Henry David Thoreau's oracular words resonated so broadly in
American literary and intellectual history? This course will focus on in-depth readings of the writings of Emer-
son and Thoreau. We will be asking how they understood nature, the philosophical claims of literature, individu-
alism, politics and morality. In addition, we'll be looking into what happened in Concord and Boston in the
1830s to produce not only Emerson and Thoreau, but a host of other figures who were equally if not more im-
portant Transcendentalists. We will read the feminist works of Margaret Fuller and study the socialist experi-
ments in communal living led by George Ripley and Bronson Alcott. Together, such works reveal Transcenden-
talism's concern not just with the individual and nature, but with the major political issues of the day, including
the abolition of slavery. Through a series of short projects students will develop a critical essay on a subject of
their own choice, which will use criticism as well as primary texts.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: two 5-page papers and a final 20-page paper.
Prerequisites: one 300-level English class or permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 15 (expected: 10).

ENGL 414(F) Poetry and Prose of John Donne
"Wit!--Wonder--exciting vigour, intenseness and peculiarity of thought," Samuel Coleridge wrote, "this is the
wit of Donne!" There is no greater, more daring or more witty, writer of love poems, divine poems, or religious
prose in the English language. Donne wrote in a wide variety of classical genres: elegy, epigram, satire, love
lyric, epithalamion or marriage song, verse epistle, holy sonnet, hymn, familiar letter, meditation, sermon. Yet he
constantly reinvigorates conventional language with "new-made idiom," turning traditional forms to unpredict-
able ends.
This intensive, discussion-oriented seminar will explore the following questions. What are the characteristic
marks of Donne's style, and how does his writing evolve over the course of his career? Since Donne's poetry was
not printed until after his death, what was the impact of his coterie audience? How does Donne conduct an amo-
rous courtship in and through verse? To what extent are biography and history pertinent and helpful in under-
standing Donne's writing? What are the religious premises and purpose of Donne's religious writing? What
made Donne so appealing to T. S. Eliot and the modernists, and more recently, the post-modernists? What are the
compelling issues in contemporary Donne criticism?

ENGL 420(S) Decadence and Aestheticism
"Fin de Siecle": the end of the world, or at least the end of century, was the cry of many in the last years of the
19th century. Despair over the seeming perilous decline in moral standards, scandalously avant-garde fashions in
art and writing, anxieties brought on by Britain's uneasy rule over its colonies, and the advent of new dissident
sexual and social identities, led some to fear (and others to celebrate) that the ways of Victorian Britain were not
long for this world. This course will consider aestheticism and decadence as late-nineteenth-century literary and
artistic responses, both scandalized and scandalizing, to this terrifying and exhilarating period. We will read writ-
ers such as Oscar Wilde, who reveled in amoral manifestos like "art for art's sake" by elevating artifice and shal-
lowness to the first principles of life, both in his work and through his own outré existence. In addition to reading
Wilde and his fellow aesthetes, we will think about the ways in which nineteenth-century literary forms, such as
the detective novel, work both to contain and diffuse the many anxieties of the fin de siècle. Throughout, we will
seek to understand the relays between the aesthetic and social dimensions of these works. This seminar will in-
volve intense discussion and independent work, will familiarize students with the terrain of current theory and
critical work on Victorian culture, as well as build skills in researching criticism and developing arguments. Au-
thors likely to include: Eliot, Kipling, Stevenson, Stoker, Doyle, Schreiner, Wilde, Wells, Conrad, James.
Format: seminar/discussion. Requirements: productive discussion; written work culminating in a 20-page re-
search paper.
Prerequisites: a 300-level course or permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 15 (expected:10). Preference
given to junior and senior English majors.

Hour: 1:10-3:50 W MCWEENY
ENGL 422(S) Joyce, Woolf, and Proust
This advanced seminar is designed for--but not restricted to--students who have studied one or more of the
following texts in a previous course: Joyce's Ulysses, Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway and To the Lighthouse, and/ or
portions of Proust's Remembrance of Things Past. (Those who have not yet read these texts are welcome, but
may wish to consult the instructor in advance.) By juxtaposing these innovative texts, we will explore the distinc-
tive ways in which they open up some of the crucial preoccupations of high modernism: the threat and the exhil-
aration of cultural loss in face of political and social transformations at the turn of the twentieth century; the turn
to memory, to art and to objects by subjects beset by the fear of loss; the heightening of consciousness to the
verge of disintegration; the perverse fates of desire; and the thickening of the medium of language. During the
course of the semester, students will write a paper of medium length on each of the three writers. These will be
analyzed in part through tutorial or colloquium sessions, and then at the end of the semester will be combined and
revised in a long final paper.
Format: mostly discussion/seminar, with occasional tutorial and/or colloquium sessions. Requirements: active
participation in discussions; three 6- to 7-page papers, combined and revised in one long (20-page) final paper;
occasional short assessments of other students' papers.
Prerequisite: one 300-level English class or permission of the instructor; recommended: prior coursework on one
or more of these authors. Enrollment limit: 15 (expected: 10-12). Preference given to junior and senior English
majors.

Hour: 1:10-2:25 MR TIFFT
ENGL 423(S) History in Theory
Moments of political turmoil expose the contested and highly charged ways in which a culture structures itself
around an imagined past, a process that some of the most influential theorists of the past two hundred years have
helped to illuminate. In this course, we will read their work along with literary and cinematic texts that invoke
such moments of upheaval--the French and Russian Revolutions as well as those of 1848, the rise of fascism
and the Great Depression of the 1930s, the battle for Algerian independence, the AIDS crisis--in order to lay
bare the problems and contradictions that emerge in those fraught narratives of the past. We will consider such
issues as the aesthetics of fascism and of democracy under pressure, the fantasies of decolonization, and the uses
of melancholy in representing historical loss. Readings will be drawn from literary works by Austen, Eliot, Kaf-
ka, Mann, Borges, Stoppard, and Kushner, and theoretical essays by Kant, Burke, Carlyle, Marx, Weber, Benja-
min, Adorno, Foucault, de Certeau, and Lefort. Films will include such works as Eisenstein's October, Reifens-
tahl's The Triumph of the Will, Wellman's Nothing Sacred and Pontecorvo's The Battle of Algiers.
This course is conceived for students who have already taken a criticism course, but those students who have yet
to do so are welcome. Requirements: one 5-page paper and a final fifteen-page paper, with a process of revisions.
Format: seminar, with a week or so of tutorials and a chance for independent work.
Prerequisite: A 300-level course or permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 15 (expected: 10). Preference

What do we mean by "nature"? How do we understand the relationships between "nature" and "culture"? In this
course we will examine how various American writers have attempted to render conceptions of "nature" in liter-
ary form. We will compare treatments of various kinds of natural environments and trace the philosophical and
English
­ 164 ­
stylistic traditions within the nature writing genre. The authors to be considered include Ralph Waldo Emerson,
Henry David Thoreau, William Faulkner, Annie Dillard, Barry Lopez, Ursula LeGuin, and Wendell Berry.

CONCENTRATION IN ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
The Environmental Studies Program, within the liberal arts mission of Williams College, provides students
with an opportunity to explore how humans interact with the environment, including physical, biological, philo-
sophical, and social elements. The program is designed so that students will understand the complexity of issues
and perspectives and to appreciate that most environmental issues lack distinct disciplinary boundaries. Our goal
is to aid students in becoming well-informed, environmentally-literate citizens of the planet who have the capac-
ity to become active participants in the local and global community. To this end, the program is designed to de-
velop abilities to think in interdisciplinary ways and to use synthetic approaches in solving problems while incor-
porating the knowledge and experiences gained from majoring in other departments at the College.
The concentration in Environmental Studies allows students to pursue an interdisciplinary study of the envi-
ronment by taking elective courses in the natural sciences, the social sciences, and the humanities and the arts.
The purpose of the program is to provide the tools and ideas needed to engage constructively with the environ-
mental and social issues brought about by changes in population, economic activity, and values. Environmental
Environmental Studies
­ 166 ­
controversies typically call upon citizens and organizations to grasp complex, uncertain science, contending hu-
man values, and ethical choices--in short, to grapple with matters for which the liberal arts are a necessary but
not sufficient preparation. Environmental Studies accordingly includes courses in natural sciences, social
sciences, humanities, and the arts, in order to equip students with the broad educational background needed to
analyze complex environmental matters and to fashion pragmatic, feasible solutions.
The program is administered by the Center for Environmental Studies (CES), located in Kellogg House.
Founded in 1967, CES was one of the first environmental studies programs at a liberal arts college. In addition to
the academic program, CES is the focus of a varied set of activities in which students lead and participate, often
with other members of the Williams community. The Matt Cole Memorial Library at Kellogg House holds a
substantial collection of books, periodicals, unpublished documents, maps, and electronic media. Kellogg House
also houses a Geographic Information Systems laboratory as well as study and meeting facilities available to
students and student groups. The Center administers the Hopkins Memorial Forest, a 2500-acre natural area
northwest of campus, where field-study sites, a laboratory, and passive-recreation opportunities may be found in
all seasons. CES also operates an environmental analysis laboratory at the Science Center.
The Environmental Studies Program has three overlapping components:
 The concentration in Environmental Studies, which consists of a set of seven courses.
 The Four Places goal. (See below.)
 Honors in Environmental Studies; a senior thesis is encouraged but not required.
Concentration Requirements
Seven courses are required: four are core courses to be taken by all students earning the concentration; three are
distribution courses to be selected from the lists below.
Core courses
101 Humans and the Biosphere
203 Ecology
302 Environmental Planning and Design Workshop
402 Senior Seminar
The core courses are intended to be taken in sequence, although there is some flexibility allowed. Environ-
mental Studies (ENVI) 101 is a broad introduction to the field, emphasizing the humanities and social sciences.
ENVI 203 is a course in ecology (offered in Biology) that provides a unified conceptual approach to the behavior
of living things in the natural world. ENVI 302 puts teams of students to work on planning projects of immediate
importance in the Berkshires. ENVI 402, the senior seminar, is an opportunity for concentrators majoring in a
wide variety of disciplines to draw together their educational experiences and provide a personal accounting of
how they understand the interdisciplinary character of environmental studies and its connections to their future
lives and careers. The core course structure affords students freedom to explore and to specialize in diverse fields
of study, while sustaining a focus on environmental questions throughout their time at Williams.
An interdisciplinary course emphasizing field science, ENVI 102 (Introduction to Environmental Science), is
strongly recommended for all students interested in the concentration.
Distribution Courses
In order to earn the concentration a student must take one course from each of the following three groups.
Courses may be counted both toward the concentration in Environmental Studies and toward a disciplinary ma-
jor.

Variations from the requirements of the concentration must be approved in writing by the director of the pro-
gram. Students are urged to consult with program faculty and the director as soon as they develop an interest in
the concentration or if they intend to participate in study away opportunities.
In addition to courses fulfilling the concentration requirements, the following electives and related electives
are offered:
Environmental Studies 397, 398 Independent Study of Environmental Problems
Environmental Studies 493-W31-494 Senior Research and Thesis
Winter study courses play an important role in the program, offering opportunities to experiment in fields
unfamiliar to the student, and for interdisciplinary topics to be developed by faculty working alone and in teams.
Students are urged to review each year's winter study offerings bearing in mind their interests in the environ-
ment.
Rationale for Course Numbering
The numbering sequence of the four required courses reflects the order in which they should be taken, al-
though Environmental Studies 302 may be taken in the senior or sophomore year if a student is away junior year.
Cross-listed courses are assigned the same number as the departmental number whenever possible.
Four Places--A Goal
The human place in natural landscapes is geographic, and learning about particular places is an essential part
of environmental studies. By the time each student in Environmental Studies graduates, she or he should have
developed intellectual insight into and personal experience of four places: "Home"; "Here"--the Berkshires;
"There"--an alien place; and "The World"--a global perspective. For practical purposes, "There" is a place
where the geography is unusual in the student's experience (e.g., developing country, inner city, arctic), so are the
socioeconomic circumstances (for example, per capita income might be a small fraction of a year's tuition at
Williams), and the language is not standard English. Although this goal is not a requirement for the concentra-
tion, it is a significant aspect of the program, and CES resources are aimed in part at enabling all students to meet
Environmental Studies
­ 168 ­
this goal. For example, students are encouraged to pursue summer internships in their "Home" communities, or
to do semester or winter study courses at locations outside the temperate zones ("There"); field courses in natural
science or history courses emphasizing New England can deepen familiarity with "Here." Students concentrat-
ing in Environmental Studies should plan winter study courses and summer work or study experiences with the
Four Places goal in mind, particularly the experiences "There" and at "Home." Courses not in the list of electives
for the concentration may be considered as substitutes, on a case-by-case basis, if they also meet the Four Places
goal in a way not otherwise available in the program. Students should see the program director for further infor-
mation.
Honors in Environmental Studies
A student earns honors in Environmental Studies by successfully completing a rigorous, original independent
research project under the supervision of two or more members of the faculty, including at least one member of
the CES faculty. The research project should be reported and defended both in a thesis and orally. A student may
undertake an honors thesis and submit it to both his or her major department and Environmental Studies; peti-
tions for a joint honors project should be approved by the department chair and the director of the program no
later than the beginning of the student's senior year. Students who pursue honors in Environmental Studies alone
should enroll in Environmental Studies 493-W31-494, Senior Research and Thesis, in addition to completing the
requirements for the concentration.
Because most research requires sustained field, laboratory, or library work that is difficult to combine with
conventional coursework, students are strongly encouraged to spend the summer before senior year doing hon-
ors research. Funds to support student research are available from restricted endowments of the Center, and an
open competition is held each spring, to allocate the limited resources. Some departments also provide limited
support for summer thesis research. Students and their faculty sponsors should plan the thesis with the possibility
of summer research in mind.
Honors in Environmental Studies will be awarded on the basis of the academic rigor, interdisciplinary synthe-
sis, independence, and originality demonstrated by the student and in the completed thesis.
STUDY ABROAD
The Program in Environmental Studies encourages its concentrators to study abroad if feasible, and there are a
variety of study abroad programs that include courses and experiential learning about the environment. Students
should speak to the chair of the program as early as possible in making their plans in order to confirm what
courses abroad will be eligible for credit as an elective course in the concentration. Students may not use study
abroad classes to fulfill any of the program's core course requirements.
ENVI 101(F) Humans and the Biosphere: An Introduction to Environmental Studies
This course introduces environmental studies in the context of the liberal arts--natural and social science and the
arts and humanities. By the end of the semester, a student should be able to recognize and to investigate the
dynamics of the human community impacting the environment at local, regional, and global scales, and to ana-
lyze the challenges of altering humans' impact on the environment. Understanding these dynamics and chal-
lenges is essential to developing sustainable societies that provide a decent quality of life.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on quizzes, written assignments, a final exam and attentive
participation in class.
No enrollment limit. Required course for student wishing to complete the Environmental Studies concentration.
Satisfies one semester of the Division II requirement.
Hour: 9:55-11:10 TR JORLING
ENVI 102(S) Introduction to Environmental Science
Introduction to Environmental Science introduces students to current scientific methods used to assess environ-
mental quality, rectify impaired systems, and limit future detriment. Through hands-on study of several local
sites, we probe five global themes: alteration of the greenhouse effect and carbon cycle; acid deposition; toxic
metals in the environment; water quality; and prospects in waste treatment and remediation.
Discussions of case studies from other parts of the world illustrate the global analogues of these local studies.
Following these group projects, students design and complete independent projects in subjects of particular inter-
est to them.
Format: two, 75-minute workshop/discussion sessions, and one, 4-hour field/laboratory session each week.
Evaluation will be based on reports of field and laboratory projects, participation in discussion, and an indepen-
dent research project.
Enrollment limit: 36 (expected: 25). Preference given to first-year students. This course is designed for students
who have a strong interest in Environmental Science. Satisfies one semester of the Division III requirement. This
course also satisfies "The Natural World" requirement for the Environmental Studies concentration.

planning and provides students with experience in the planning process through project work in the Berkshire
region. The first part of the course introduces the students to planning literature through analysis and discussion
of case studies. In the second section of the course students apply their skills to the study of an actual planning
problem. Small teams of students, working in conjunction with a client in the community, research and propose
solutions to a local environmental planning problem. The project work draws on students' academic training,
extracurricular activities, and applies interdisciplinary knowledge and methodologies. The course culminates in
public presentations of each team's planning study. This course also includes field trips and computer labs.

We rely on environmental laws to make human communities healthier and protect the natural world, while al-
lowing for sustainable economic growth. Yet, despite 40 years of increasingly varied and complex legislation,
balancing human needs and environmental quality has never been harder than it is today.
Environmental Studies 307 analyzes the transformation of environmental law from fringe enterprise to funda-
mental feature of modern political, economic and social life. ENVI 307 also addresses the role of community
activism in environmental law, from local battles over proposed industrial facilities to national campaigns for
improved corporate citizenship.
By the completion of the semester, students will understand both the successes and failures of modern environ-
mental law and how these laws are being reinvented, through innovations like pollution credit trading and "green
product" certification, to confront globalization, climate change and other emerging threats.
Format: Seminar, with guest lecturers. Student-selected mid-term paper, final exam and several brief papers on

MAJOR
The Geosciences major is designed (1) to provide an understanding of the physical and biological evolution of
our planet and its interacting global systems, (2) to help us learn to live in harmony with our environment, and (3)
to appreciate our place within the vastness of Earth history. Forces within the Earth are responsible for the devel-
opment of mountain ranges and ocean basins. Waves, running water, and glaciers haveshapedthesurfaceofthe
Earth,providingthelandscapesweseetoday. Fossils encased in sedimentaryrockssupplyevidencefortheevolu-
tion of life and help to record the history of the Earth.
Geosciences
­ 173 ­
Students who graduate with a major in Geosciences from Williams can enter several different fields of geosci-
ence or can use their background in other careers. Students who have continued in the geosciences are involved
today, especially after graduate training, in environmental fields ranging from hydrology to earthquake predic-
tion, in the petroleum and mining industries, federal and state geological surveys, geological consulting firms,
and teaching and research in universities, colleges, and secondary schools. Graduates who have entered business
or law have also found many applications for their geoscience background. Other graduates now in fields as
diverse as art and medicine pursue their interest in the out-of-doors with a deeper appreciation for the natural
world around them.
The Geosciences major sequence includes, after any 100-level course, five designated advanced courses, and
three elective courses.
Sequence Courses (required of majors)
201 Geomorphology
202 Mineralogy and Geochemistry
301 Structural Geology
302 Sedimentology
401 Stratigraphy
Elective courses may be clustered to provide concentrations in selected fields. Suggested groupings are listed
below as guidelines for course selections, but other groups are possible according to the interests of the students.
Departmental advisors are given for the different fields of Geosciences.
I Environmental Geoscience. For students interested in surface processes and the application of geology to
environmental problems such as land use planning, resource planning, environmental impact analysis, and envi-
ronmental law. Such students should also consider enrollinginthecoordinate program of the Center for Environ-
mental Studies.
103 Global Warming and Natural Disasters
104 Oceanography
205 Earth's Strategic Resources
206 Renewable Energy and the Sustainable Campus
208 Water and the Environment
214 Remote Sensing and Geographic Information Systems
215 Climate Changes
(Students interested in Environmental Geosciences should consult with Professors Dethier or Stoll.)
II Oceanography, Stratigraphy and Sedimentation. For students interested in the study of modern and an-
cient sedimentary environments and the marine organisms that inhabited them.
101 Biodiversity in Geologic Time
104 Oceanography
206 Renewable Energy and the Sustainable Campus
212 Invertebrate Paleobiology
(Students interested in Oceanography, Stratigraphy, and Sedimentation should consult with Professors M.
Johnson or Cox.)
III The Solid Earth. For students interested in plate tectonics, the processes active within the Earth, the origin
and deformation of rocks and minerals, and mineral exploration.
102 An Unfinished Planet
105 Geology Outdoors
205 Earth's Strategic Resources
303 Igneous and Metamorphic Petrology
(Students interested in The Solid Earth should consult with Professors Wobus or Karabinos.)
With the consent of the department, certain courses at the 200 level or higher in Biology, Chemistry, Mathe-
matics and Statistics, or Physics may be substituted for elective courses in the major. Credit may be granted in the
Geosciences major for American Maritime Studies 211/Geosciences 210 (Oceanographic Processes) or Ameri-
can Maritime Studies 311/Biology 231 (Marine Ecology) taken at Mystic Seaport.
Students considering graduate work in geosciences should also take courses in the allied sciences and mathe-
matics in addition to the requirements of the Geosciences major. The selection of outside courses will depend on
the field in which a student intends to specialize. Most geoscience graduate schools require a year of Chemistry
and Mathematics through 105. For those going into Environmental Geoscience, courses in computer science or
statistics are recommended. For those considering Oceanography, Stratigraphy, and Sedimentation, Biology 102
and Biology 203 are suggested. For students entering Solid-Earth fields, Physics 131 and 132 are recommended.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN GEOSCIENCES
In order to be recommended for the degree with honors, a student is expected to have completed at least two
semesters and a winter study project (031) of independent research culminating in a thesis which demonstrates
outstanding achievement of an original and innovative nature. The principal considerations in admitting a student
to a program of independent research are mastery of fundamental material and skills, ability to pursue indepen-
dent study successfully, and demonstrated student interest and motivation.
Further advice on the major can be obtained from the department chair.
STUDY ABROAD
Students planning on studying abroad should meet as early as possible with the Department Chair to plan
study-abroad courses and to discuss how potential courses might be used in the Geosciences major. In recent
years students have found that courses offered by universities in New Zealand, particularly the University of
Geosciences
­ 174 ­
Otago, provide an excellent complement to courses offered at Williams. Courses offered at Norwegian Technical
Universities and at several universities in the United Kingdom have also been accepted as part of the Geosci-
ences major. Many other study-abroad programs, however, do not usually offer courses that are acceptable sub-
stitutes for courses required by the Williams Geoscience major.
GEOS 101(F) Biodiversity in Geologic Time (Same as Environmental Studies 105)
Is planet Earth now undergoing the most severe mass extinction of species ever to have occurred during its
4.5-billion-year history? By some calculations, the expanding population of a single species is responsible for the
demise of 74 species per day. This provocative question is addressed by way of the rock and fossil record as it
relates to changes in biodiversity through deep geologic time before the appearance of Homo sapiens only
250,000 years ago. Long before human interaction, nature conducted its own experiments on the complex rela-
tionship between evolving life and changes in the physical world. This course examines ways in which wander-
ing continents, shifting ocean basins, the rise and fall of mountains, the wax and wane of ice sheets, fluctuating
sea level, and even crashing asteroids all shaped major changes in global biodiversity. Particular attention is
drawn to the half dozen most extensive mass extinctions and what factors may have triggered them. Equal con-
sideration is given to how the development of new ecosystems forever altered the physical world. How and
when did the earliest microbes oxygenate the atmosphere? Do the earliest multicellular animals from the late
Precambrian portray an architectural experiment doomed to failure? What factors contributed to the explosive
rise in biodiversity at the start of the Cambrian Period? What explanation is there for the sudden appearance of
vertebrates? How and when did plants colonize the land? What caused the demise of the dinosaurs? Is the present
dominance of mammals an accident of nature? The answers to these and other questions are elusive, but our wise
stewardship of the planet and its present biodiversity may depend on our understanding of the past. Concepts of
plate tectonics and island biogeography are applied to many aspects of the puzzle.
Format: lecture; one laboratory per week (some involving field work); plus one all-day field trip to the Helder-
berg Plateau and Catskill Mountains of New York. Evaluation will be based on weekly quizzes and lab work, a
midterm exam, and a final exam.

GEOS 102(S) An Unfinished Planet
The Earth is a work-in-progress, an evolving planet whose vital signs--as expressed by earthquakes, volcanic
eruptions, and shifting plates--are still strong. In a geological time frame, nothing on Earth is permanent: ocean
basins open and close, mountains rise and fall, continental masses accrete and separate. There is a message here
for all who live, for an infinitesimally brief time, on the moving surface of the globe. This course uses the plate
tectonics model--one of the fundamental scientific accomplishments of this century--to interpret the processes
and products of a changing Earth. The emphasis will be on mountain systems (on land and beneath the oceans)
as expressions of plate interactions. Specific topics include the rocks and structures of modern and ancient moun-
tain belts, the patterns of global seismicity and volcanism, the nature of the Earth's interior, the changing configu-
rations of continents and ocean basins through time, and, in some detail, the formation of the Appalachian Moun-
tain system and the geological assembly of New England. Readings will be from a physical geology textbook
and primary source supplement, selected writings of John McPhee, and references about the geology of the
Northeast.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; lab (several involving field work), two hours per week; one required all-
day field trip during the last week of the semester to the Connecticut Valley and the highlands of western Massa-
chusetts. Evaluation will be based on two hour-tests, weekly lab work, and a scheduled final exam.
Enrollment limit: 40 (expected: 35).
Hour: 10:00-10:50 MWF Lab: 1-3 W WOBUS
GEOS 103(F) Global Warming and Natural Disasters (Same as Environmental Studies 103)
The destruction caused by recent hurricanes such as Katrina, devastation of prolonged drought in the African
Sahel, catastrophic flooding and mudslides in Indonesia and sea level encroachment on the Alaska coast are
visible examples of natural disasters that may be modulated by climate change. Reports from the World Bank
conclude that global climate change, together with environmental degradation and urbanization, has the potential
to increase the severity and impact of natural disasters. In this course we globally examine geological and clima-
tological processes that "set up" natural disasters such as hurricanes, floods, landslides, droughts, extreme tem-
peratures, and coastal surges, as well as the processes that condition availability of water resources. We study in
detail the causes and anticipated consequences of human alteration of climate and its impact on the spectrum of
natural hazards and resources. During laboratory sessions we use local field sites and computer models to ana-
lyze recent disasters/hazards and options for mitigating future impacts and study trends in weather and climate.
Format: lectures, 3 hours per week; laboratory, 2 hours per week. Evaluation based on written reports from labo-
ratories, two hour exams and a final exam.

GEOS 105(F) Geology Outdoors (W)
An introduction to geology through student field projects. The mountains, lakes, rivers, and valleys of the Wil-
liamstown area provide unusual opportunities for learning geology in the field. Student projects will include the
study of streams as active agents of erosion and deposition, the effects of glaciation on the New England land-
scape, and the history of mountain building in the Appalachians. Following several group projects introducing
the techniques of field geology, students will pursue independent projects on subjects of particular interest to
them. This course departs from the standard science course format with three lectures and a required lab each
week. Instead, emphasis is placed on learning through active participation in field projects and presentation of
results through high quality writing. The class will meet two afternoons each week from 1:00 to 3:45 p.m. There
will be two all day field trips. This course is designed for students who have a serious interest in geology or other
natural and environmental sciences, the outdoors, and writing.

GEOS 205(F) Earth's Strategic Resources (Same as Environmental Studies 207)
At the dawn of the twenty-first century, there are more people building more houses, more roads, more cars,
more plastic packaging-all with geologic materials. As demand soars in both established and growing econo-
mies, resource reserves dwindle. Conflicts arise over control of their pricing and distribution at the same time that
controversy grows over the damage done to the environment by their extraction and processing. What a mess!
Understanding resource management for now and the future requires insight into the geology that underlies the
location and origin of strategic earth materials.
This class introduces the geologic processes that control formation, distribution, and extent of materials reserves:
stone and gravel, base and precious metal ores, gemstones, petroleum, nuclear energy sources, and specialty ma-
terials for medical, technological, and military uses. We will also discuss some of the economics and environ-
mental impacts of extraction, and international tensions centered on resource distribution and control.
Format: lecture, three hours per week. There will also be four afternoon field trips in the course of the semester,
and a semester project culminating in a poster session. Grading will be based on one hour exam, a final exam,
and the semester project.
Prerequisites: one 100-level Geosciences course or permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 20 (expected:
20. Preference to first- and second-year students, and Geoscience majors.

nearby areas in the twenty-first century? How will campus buildings, old and new, continue to be attractive
spaces while making far more efficient use of heat and light? This course is a practical introduction to renewable
sources of energy, including conservation, and to their application to the campus environment. Topics covered
include: biological sources of energy (biomass, biogas, liquid fuels), wind energy, geothermal and solar energy,
energy efficiency and the environmental impacts of using renewable energy. Lectures, field trips and individual
projects emphasize examples from the campus and nearby area.
Format: seminar, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on an hour exam, class participation that in-
cludes a seminar presentation, and a research project that investigates some aspect of campus energy use and
greenhouse-gas emissions.

GEOS 214(S) Remote Sensing and Geographic Information Systems (Same as Environmental
Studies 214)
Remote sensing involves the collection and processing of data from satellite and airborne sensors to yield envi-
ronmental information about the Earth's surface and lower atmosphere. Remote sensing enhances regional map-
ping of rock types and faults and analysis of vegetation cover and land-use changes over time. A Geographic
Information System (GIS) links satellite-based environmental measurements with spatial data such as topogra-
phy, transportation networks, and political boundaries, allowing display and quantitative analysis at the same
scale using the same geographic reference. This course covers the principles and practice of remote-data capture
and geographic rectification using a Global Positioning System (GPS), as well as the concepts of Remote Sens-
ing, including linear and non-linear image enhancements, convolution filtering, principle components analysis,
and classification. Principles of GIS include display and classification, spatial buffers, and logical overlays.
Weekly labs focus on practical applications of these techniques to data from Hopkins Memorial Forest, the Berk-
shire region, and other areas of North America.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, weekly.

GEOS 301(F) Structural Geology (Q)
The structure of the Earth's crust is constantly changing and the rocks making up the crust must deform to ac-
commodate these changes. Rock deformation occurs over many scales ranging from individual mineral grains to
mountain belts. This course deals with the geometric description of structures, stress and strain analysis, de-
formation mechanisms in rocks, and the large scale forces responsible for crustal deformation. The laboratories
cover geologic maps and cross sections, folds and faults, stereonet analysis, field techniques, strain, and stress.
Format: lecture/discussion, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on
weekly laboratory exercises, problem sets, a midterm exam, and a final exam. Many of the laboratories and
problem sets use geometry, algebra, and several projection techniques to solve common problems in structural
geology.

GEOS 302(S) Sedimentology (W)
The composition and architecture of sediments and sedimentary rocks preserve information about the rocks that
were eroded to form them, the fluids and forces that transported them, the mechanisms by which they were de-
posited, and the processes by which they were lithified. This course will provide an introduction to the principles
of sedimentology, including sedimentary petrology, fluid mechanics, bedform analysis, and facies architecture.
Format: lecture/discussion, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours per week; two half-day and one all-day
field trip. Evaluation will be based on laboratory work, writing assignments, an hour exam, and a final exam. Ten
written critiques (each 350-400 words) of specific assigned papers from the sedimentological literature are de-
signed to teach clear written expression and careful analytical reading. Papers will be thoroughly edited for style,
grammar and syntax. Students will improve their writing by integrating editorial comments into successive pa-
pers. Each student will compile his/her papers as a growing body of work, and each new paper will be read and
edited in the context of the previous submissions.

GEOS 303(F) Igneous and Metamorphic Petrology
The origin of metamorphic, plutonic, and volcanic rocks are examined in the light of field evidence and
experimental work. Rock texture and composition are used to interpret the environment of formation of
individual rock types, and important assemblages are related, where possible, to theories of global tectonics.
Laboratory work emphasizes the study of individual rock units and rock suites in hand specimens and by
petrographic and x-ray techniques.
Format: lecture/discussion, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours per week; several field trips including
one all-day trip to central New Hampshire. Evaluation will be based on lab work, one hour test, and a final exam.

GEOS 304T(S) Paleoecology (W)
Ecology embraces the study of living plant and animal associations and their response to highly varied physical
conditions found in a wide variety of ecosystems. The goal of paleoecology is to trace the evolutionary history of
ancient ecosystems through geologic time. Each discipline offers a fascinating perspective on the other. Topics of
discussion include: the role of biological and physical controls in the structure of communities; interpretation of
fossil assemblages; meaning of biodiversity through a range of local to global scales; ecological succession in
recent and ancient communities; and the role of mass extinctions in long-term community evolution. Ecosystems
considered include marine-shelf benthos, reefs, rocky shores, rain forests, grasslands, and deep-sea hydrothermal
vents. Readings are selected from current and recent journal articles in biology and geology. Following an initial
group meeting, students will meet in pairs for tutorials.In addition, two lab sessions and a final group meeting are
required. Participants in this course are eligible (but not obligated) to take part in a field trip to Baja California
over Spring Break for the study of modern and ancient rocky-shore communities.
Format: tutorial. Evaluation will be based on five written essays, five oral presentations, weekly participation in
discussions, and participation in two scheduled lab sessions.
Prerequisite: any 100-level Geosciences course or consent of instructor. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10).

GEOS 401(F) Stratigraphy
Study of the composition, sequence, and correlation of layered sedimentary rocks is traditionally applied to geo-
logic mapping and the reconstruction of ancient environments. Through the use of various time scales, stratigra-
phy is the unifier of historical geology while also at the heart of conceptual debates over the uniformism or epi-
sodicity of geological processes. During the first half of the course, emphasis will be placed on the various meth-
ods of correlation based on physical means and the use of fossils. The second half of the course will focus on
plate migrations and the relationships between climate and depositional environments as a model for the broad
scale interpretation of sedimentary sequences. This part of the course will be conducted as a seminar, with stu-
dents responsible for topics on the paleogeographic linkage of climate-sensitive facies and natural resources. As a
final project, students working individually or in pairs will present a detailed analysis of North-American strati-
graphic relationships during a specific interval of Cambrian to Cretaceous time. In sequence, these class reports
will provide highlights of the geologic history of the North-American continent through Paleozoic and Mesozoic
time.
Format: lecture, three hours a week; one three-hour lab per week during the first half of the course (including
field problems); independent projects during the second half of the course; one major field trip. Evaluation will
be based on weekly lab assignments during the first half of the semester, seminar participation, and the comple-
tion of a final project during the second half of the semester, as well as a midterm and a final exam.

sistant Professor: DIERS. Teaching Associates: JANTSCHER, KAWAN.
LANGUAGE STUDY
The department provides language instruction to enable the student to acquire all four linguistic skills: under-
standing, speaking, reading, and writing. German 101-W-102 stresses communicative competence and covers
German grammar in full. German 103 combines a review of grammar with extensive practice in reading and
conversation. German 104 aims to develop facility in speaking, writing, and reading. German 111-112 offers an
alternative introduction to German with a focus on reading competence. German 201 emphasizes accuracy and
idiomatic expression in speaking and writing. German 202 combines advanced language study with the ex-
amination of topics in German-speaking cultures. Students who have studied German in secondary school
should take the placement test given during First Days in September to determine which course to take.
STUDY ABROAD
The department strongly encourages students who wish to attain fluency in German to spend a semester or
year studying in Germany or Austria, either independently or in one of several approved foreign study programs.
German 104 or the equivalent is the minimum requirement for junior-year abroad programs sponsored by
American institutions. Students who wish to enroll directly in a German-speaking university should complete at
least 201 or the equivalent. In any case, all students considering study-abroad should discuss their language prep-
aration with a member of the department.
LITERATURE IN TRANSLATION
The department regularly offers courses on German literature in translation for students who have little or no
knowledge of German, but who wish to become acquainted with the major achievements in German literary and
intellectual history.
ADVANCED STUDIES
The department offers a variety of advanced courses for students who wish to investigate German literature,
thought, and culture in the original. German 202 is given each year and is recommended as preparation for up-
per-level courses.
THE CERTIFICATE IN GERMAN
To enhance a student's educational and professional profiles, the department offers the Certificate in German.
It requires seven courses--three fewer than the major--and is especially appropriate for students who begin
study of the language at Williams.
Students who enter Williams with previous training in German may substitute more advanced courses for the
100-level courses; they can also be exempted from up to two of the required courses.
Students must receive a minimum grade of B in each course taken in the sequence. In addition, they must
score of at least 650 (out of a possible 800) on the ETS (Educational Testing Service) Proficiency Test.
Appropriate elective courses can usually be found among the offerings of German, Art History, History, Mu-
sic, Philosophy, Political Science, and Theatre.

THE MAJOR
The German major offers students an interdisciplinary approach to German intellectual and cultural history by
combining courses in German language and literature with courses in History, Philosophy, Music, and other ap-
propriate fields.
For students who start German at Williams, the major requires a minimum of ten courses: German 101-102,
103, 104, 201 and 202; two 300-level German courses; and two electives from either German courses numbered
above 202 or appropriate offerings in other departments.
For students who have acquired intermediate or greater proficiency in the language before coming to Wil-
liams, the minimum requirement is nine courses: German 202; two 300-level German courses; and six other
courses selected from German courses numbered above 102 and appropriate offerings in other departments.
Examples of appropriate courses in other departments are:
ArtH 267 Art in Germany: 1960 to the Present

is particularly appropriate for students majoring in fields in which the ability to read primary and secondary texts
in German can be crucial, such as Art History, Classics, Comparative Literature, History, Music, Philosophy,
Political Science, and Theatre. In the first semester students learn the elements of grammar and acquire a core
vocabulary. In the second semester, while covering advanced grammatical topics, they practice reading in a vari-
ety of textual genres in the humanities and social sciences. They also learn how to work with dictionaries, ency-
clopedias, and other reference works, in both printed and online forms. By the end of the course they will have a
solid foundation for building proficiency in German, whether through self-study or further course work. Credit
granted only on successful completion of 112.

GERM 260(S) Coming to Terms with Past and Present in German Film
Post-WWII German Film has gone through fascinating changes. From an escapist indulgence in kitsch and the
untouched country side in the 1950s (Deppe et al) to the highly political `Neue Deutsche Film' in the 60s and 70s
(Kluge, Fassbinder, Schloendorff et al) and 80s (von Trotta, Wortmann, Doerrie) to today's entertaining films
that just cannot refrain from commenting on society and culture (Tykwer, Schmidt, Dresen et al)--German cine-
ma has always been a reflection of sociopolitical events. We will explore causal relationships between develop-
ments in German cinema and issues of German history and nationhood. Accompanying this, we will read basic
texts on film theory in order to understand fundamental elements of film and film analysis. This will help us to
develop a critical perspective on how film functions as an art form. While students are encouraged to attend the
screenings of each week's film throughout the semester, they can also find a copy of the film on reserve. This
class is taught in English.
Readings in English, available in German on request. All films will be subtitled.

`Vergangenheitsbewältigung', or coming to terms with the past, is the key term defining post-WWII German
culture and literature. We will explore the way that Germans have individually and collectively dealt with the
destruction they not only inflicted on others but also provoked to be unleashed on themselves. Clearly, the ideo-
logical, cultural and economic devastation of the Third Reich had and continues to have a tremendous impact on
the collective German identity. We will look closely at the various forms and changing intensity in which this
experience was reflected upon after the war. Many authors played an important role in those very different de-
cades, and we will look closely at their works. We will find similarities and differences between the 50s
(Schmidt, Borchert, Eich), the 60s (Hochhut, Weiss, Becker), the 70s (Böll, Schneider, Stefan) and the 80s
(Kluge, Wolf). In addition to movies and fictional literature we will also look into other non-fictional and theoret-
ical texts. This class is taught in German. Readings in German and English.
Format: lecture/discussion. Written work: bi-weekly response papers of 500 words, oral presentation, mid term
exam, final exam.
Prerequisites: German 201. No enrollment limit (expected: 8).
Hour: 2:35-3:50 MR DIERS
GERM 305(S) From the "Wende" 'til Today in Literature, Films, and Politics
This course will investigate recent trends and developments in Germany since the fall of the Berlin Wall. Even
though they are now one political entity, East and West are divided by economy, lived experience and mentality.
We will focus on recent memoirs and films that look back at growing up in the different cultures, or, in the works
of Turkish-Germans, living with the contradictions of East and West. Women's issues, immigrant concerns and
social reforms will be foregrounded. Films will include among others: Head-on, Im Juli, Good-bye, Lenin, Herr
Lehmann, Das Leben ist eine Baustelle, Schultze gets the Blues. Conducted in German.
Authors will include: Julia Schoch, Jana Simon, André Kubiczek, Claudia Rusch, Daniel Wiechmann, Jana
Hensel, Barbara Honigmann, Julia Franck, Yadé Kara, Sven Regener, Wladimir Kaminer and Jakob Hein.
Format: seminar. Requirements: active class participation, two oral presentations; two 3- to 5-page papers, one
10-page final paper.
Prerequisites: German 202 or equivalent. No maximum enrollment (expected: 7).

GERM 511(F)-512(S) Reading German for Beginners
German 111-112 is for students whose principal reason for acquiring German is to work with written materials. It
is particularly appropriate for students majoring in fields in which the ability to read primary and secondary texts
in German can be crucial, such as Art History, Comparative Literature, History, Music, Philosophy, Political
Science, and Theatre. In the first semester students learn the elements of grammar and acquire a core vocabulary.
In the second semester, while covering advanced grammatical topics, they practice reading in a variety of textual
genres in the humanities and social sciences. They also learn how to work with dictionaries, encyclopedias, and
other reference works, in both printed and online forms. By the end of the course they will have a solid founda-
tion for building proficiency in German, whether through self-study or further course work. Credit granted only
on successful completion of 112.
Format: lecture and discussion. Principal requirements: written homework, quizzes, tests, active class participa-
tion.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20 (expected: 15). Preference given to art-history graduate students, seniors
and juniors.

GENERAL STATEMENT OF GOALS
The History department seeks to cultivate a critical understanding and awareness of the past and the develop-
ment of our students' intellectual, analytical, and rhetorical abilities. In pursuit of the first objective, through its
curricular offerings the department seeks both to expose students to the richness, diversity, and complexities of
human history over long periods of time and in different geographic regions and to provide students with the
opportunity to explore aspects of the past in depth. At the same time, the department endeavors to develop stu-
dents' ability to think historically and to foster in them an appreciation of the contested nature and the value of
historical knowledge by confronting them with the variety of ways in which historians have approached and
interpreted the past, engaging them in issues that provoke historical debate, and familiarizing them with the na-
ture and uses of historical evidence. By engaging students in the critical study of the past, finally, the department
seeks to develop their ability to formulate historically informed analyses and their analytical and rhetorical skills.
COURSE NUMBERS
The course numbering system used by the History Department reflects the different types and objectives of
courses offered at each level. The different course levels are distinguished less by degree of difficulty than by the
purposes that the courses at each level are intended to serve and the background knowledge they presume.
First-Year Seminars and Tutorials (102-199): These writing-intensive courses give students an opportunity
to explore an exciting historical topic in-depth, learn about the discipline of history, and improve their re-
search and writing skills. Because these courses emphasize the acquisition of skills required for the ad-
vanced study of History, they are ideal for students contemplating a major in History.
Each 100-level seminar is normally limited to nineteen students and focuses both on training in research
skills (such as using the library, navigating on-line resources, formulating a research question and develop-
ing a research agenda, and learning how to use different types of evidence) and on the acquisition of read-
ing skills (such as how to interpret different kinds of historical writing and the arguments historians make).
These seminars especially emphasize the importance of writing and include varied assignments that stress
the mechanics of writing and revision and focus on issues of argumentation, documentation, and style.
Enrollment preference in 100-level seminars is normally given to first-year students and then to sopho-
mores.
Each 100-level tutorial stresses the importance of interpreting historical evidence and evaluating the argu-
ments made by historians and likewise fulfills the writing-intensive requirement. Enrollment in these
courses is limited to ten students, each of whom is expected to write five or six interpretive essays and
present five or six oral critiques of another student's work. First-year students and sophomores will normal-
History
­ 182 ­
ly be given equal enrollment preference in 100-level tutorials, although first-year students will not normal-
ly be permitted to enroll in a tutorial during the first semester.
Introductory Survey Courses (202-299): These courses are open to all students and are intended to provide
a basic understanding of the history of peoples, countries, and geographic regions over relatively long
time-spans. Most of all, they will provide students with the background necessary for more advanced study
in history at the 300 and 400 level. They are offered in either small or large formats, depending on the
individual course.
Junior Seminars (301): Junior seminars explore the nature and practice of history, are required for the de-
gree in History, and are normally restricted to junior History majors. Although these seminars vary in topic
and approach, each focuses on the discipline of history itself--on the debates over how to approach the
past, on questions of the status of different kinds of evidence and how to use it, on the purpose of the study
of history. Focusing on questions of methodology, epistemology, and historiography, these courses ask:
What kind of knowledge do historians claim to produce? What does it mean to study the past? How do
historians approach the project of studying the past? Each year several junior seminars will be offered;
prospective majors must select two junior seminars at the end of their sophomore year and will then be
assigned to one of their two choices. Students who plan to study abroad during their junior year may take
their Junior Seminar in the spring semester of their sophomore year, and those planning to be away for the
whole of their junior year are strongly encouraged to do so.
Advanced Electives (302-399): These advanced, topical courses are more specialized in focus than are the
introductory survey courses (202-299) and are intended to follow such courses. Enrollment is often limit-
ed. Because these courses may presume some background knowledge, the instructor may recommend that
students enroll in an appropriate introductory course before registering for an advanced elective.
Advanced Seminars (402-479): These are advanced courses normally limited in enrollment to fifteen stu-
dents. Each seminar will investigate a topic in depth and will require students to engage in research that
leads to a substantial piece of historical writing. All History majors are required to complete either an ad-
vanced seminar (402-479) or a tutorial (480-492). Instructors may recommend prior coursework in the
area of the seminar. Preference is given to senior History majors, followed by junior History majors.
Advanced Tutorials (480-492): These are advanced reading and writing courses that offer an in-depth analysis of
a topic in tutorial format. Tutorials are limited in enrollment to ten students and preference is given to senior
History majors. All History majors are required to complete either an advanced seminar (402-479) or a tutorial
(480-492). Instructors may recommend prior coursework in the area of the tutorial. The writing of five or six
essays and the oral presentation of five or six critiques of another student's essays are central to tutorials.
Within each of these levels, courses are further divided by geographical area:
Africa and the Middle East 102-111 202-211 302-311 402-411
Asia 112-121 212-221 312-321 412-421
Europe and Russia 122-141 222-241 322-341 422-441
Latin America and the Caribbean 142-151 242-251 342-351 442-451
United States 152-191 252-291 352-391 452-471
Transnational/Comparative 192-199 292-299 392-399 472-479
ADVISING
Both majors and non-majors are encouraged to talk at any time with the department chair, the department
administrative assistant, or any other member of the department about the History major.
All incoming majors will choose a faculty advisor in the spring of their sophomore year. All majors must meet
with their advisor in the beginning of the fall semester, to develop their Concentration (see below), and at the time
of the spring semester registration period in order to have their courses and plans for the History major approved.
Students who are interested in the senior honors program or graduate school should contact the faculty director of
the Honors Program. Prospective study abroad students should contact the department's administrative assistant.
ADVANCED PLACEMENT
Students receiving a score of 5 on any AP history examination will be given preference in the 100-level Histo-
ry seminar of their choice.
THE MAJOR
The major consists of at least nine semester courses as follows:
Required Courses in the Major
One Junior Seminar (History 301)
At least one Advanced Seminar (History 402-479) or Tutorial (History 480-492)
Elective Courses
Seven (or more) additional semester courses in History, at least one to be chosen from among three of the
following groups:
Group A: The History of Africa
Group B: The History of Asia
History
­ 183 ­
Group C: The History of Europe and Russia
Group D: The History of Latin America and the Caribbean
Group E: The History of the Middle East
Group F: The History of the United States and Canada
In addition, students must take at least one course dealing with the premodern period (designated Group G in
the catalog); this may be one of the courses used to fulfill the group requirement (Groups A-F).
A single course can meet the requirement for no more than one of Groups A through F.
Concentration in the Major
All students are required to adopt a concentration within the History major. Students are responsible for de-
signing their own concentration, in consultation with a faculty advisor, in the fall semester of their Junior year.
Each student's concentration will be formally approved by the Department's Curriculum Committee. A con-
centration will consist of at least three courses linked by common themes, geography, or time period;only one of
those courses can be a 100-level seminar while at least one must be a 300- or 400-level course. Courses in the
concentration may be used to fulfill the group requirements. In the Concentration Proposal, the student must list a
minimum total of six courses that could satisfy the requirements of the concentration, from which they can select
three to fulfill the concentration requirement (recognizing that not all courses are offered every year); courses
taken abroad may be included in the concentration with the approval of the chair.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN HISTORY
The History Department offers a thesis route to the degree with honors in History. This involves a ten-course
major as well as an independent WSP. Students wishing to undertake independent research or considering gradu-
ate study are encouraged to participate in the thesis program and honors seminar.
Application to enter the honors program should be made by spring registration in the junior year and should
be based on a solid record of work of honors caliber, normally defined as maintaining at least a B+ average in
courses taken for the major. Students who intend to write an honors thesis must submit a proposal to the History
Department at this time. Students who will be away during the spring semester of their junior year should make
arrangements to apply before leaving. Normally, it is the responsibility of the individual student to procure the
agreement of a member of the department to act as his or her thesis advisor, and the student must therefore con-
sult with a member of the department about a thesis topic and a possible thesis advisor prior to submitting a
proposal to the department. A student who is uncertain of which member of the department might be an ap-
propriate advisor, or who otherwise is unable to find an advisor, should contact the chair of the honors committee.
An honors thesis proposal must be signed by a member of the History Department. Normally, the thesis topic
should be related to course work which the student has previously done. Students should be aware, however, that
while the department will try to accommodate all students who qualify to pursue honors, particular topics may be
deemed unfeasible and students may have to revise their topics accordingly. Final admission to the honors pro-
gram will depend on the department's assessment of the qualifications of the student and the feasibility of the
project.
Once the student has been notified of admission to the honors program, he or she should register for History
493, Senior Honors Thesis Research Seminar, in the fall semester, for History 031 during winter study, and for
History 494, Senior Honors Thesis Writing Seminar, in the spring. In addition to doing the research for and writ-
ing a thesis of approximately 75-100 pages, students will attend special presentations under the History Depart-
ment's Class of 1960 Scholars Program.
During the fall, students should work regularly on their research and consult frequently with their advisors.
Throughout the semester, honors candidates will also present written progress reports for group discussion to the
seminar (History 493). Performance in the seminar will be evaluated on the basis of class participation and com-
pleted written work and will determine if a student will continue in the thesis program. For students proceeding
to History 031 and History 494, performance in the fall semester will figure into the thesis grade calculated at the
end of the year.
Students who are deemed to be making satisfactory progress on their research and writing at this point will be
allowed to continue with the thesis. They will devote the entire winter study period to thesis work. They should
conclude their research during winter study and complete at least one chapter of their thesis for submission to
their advisor before the end of winter study. At the end of winter study, the honors committee will formally con-
sult with advisors and make recommendations to the department concerning which students should be allowed
to proceed with the thesis. During the early weeks of the second semester, students will present a draft chapter of
their thesis to the honors seminar.
Completed theses will be due in mid-April, after which each student will prepare and make a short oral pre-
sentation of his or her thesis for delivery at the departmental Honors Colloquium. Another student who has read
the thesis will then offer a critique of it, after which the two faculty readers of the thesis will offer their own
comments and questions. Finally, there will be a general discussion of the thesis by students and other members
of the department.
LANGUAGE
Study of a foreign language is basic to the understanding of other cultures. Particularly those students who
might wish to do graduate work in History are encouraged to enroll in language courses at Williams.
STUDY ABROAD
The History Department considers immersion in and familiarity with a foreign culture not only to be valuable
in themselves, but also to provide an important way of understanding the past. Students who major in History
therefore are encouraged to study a foreign language and to consider studying abroad during their junior year.
History
­ 184 ­
History courses taken as part of a study abroad program that is recognized by the college normally can be used to
satisfy departmental distribution and general requirements, up to a maximum of three courses (this limit does not
apply to tutorials taken as part of the Williams-Exeter Program; no courses taken abroad, even at Oxford, can be
used to satisfy the junior seminar and advanced seminar/tutorial requirements). Students who plan to study
abroad during their junior year may take their Junior Seminar in the spring semester of their sophomore year, and
those planning to be away the whole of their junior year are strongly encouraged to do so.
Students interested in studying abroad during their junior year should discuss their plans with a member of the
department as well as with the department's administrative assistant. Approval of departmental credit for courses
taken abroad normally must be obtained from the chair or from the study abroad advisor prior to the commence-
ment of the study abroad program.
COURSES
FIRST-YEAR SEMINARS AND TUTORIALS (102-199)
These writing-intensive courses give students an opportunity to explore an exciting historical topic in-
depth, learn about the discipline of history, and improve their research and writing skills. Because these
courses emphasize the acquisition of skills required for the advanced study of History, they are ideal for
students contemplating a major in History.
Each 100-level seminar is normally limited to nineteen students and focuses both on training in research

Each 100-level tutorial stresses the importance of interpreting historical evidence and evaluating the argu-
ments made by historians and likewise fulfills the writing-intensive requirement. Enrollment in these
courses is limited to ten students, each of whom is expected to write five or six interpretive essays and
present five or six oral critiques of another student's work. First-year students and sophomores will normal-
ly be given equal enrollment preference in 100-level tutorials, although first-year students will not normal-
ly be permitted to enroll in a tutorial during the first semester.
Because first-year seminars and tutorials serve as an introduction to the study of history, only one course of
each type may count toward the History major; these courses can also be used to meet the department's
group and concentration requirements.
FIRST-YEAR SEMINARS AND TUTORIALS: Africa and the Middle East (102-111)
HIST 103(F) The City in Africa: Accra, Nairobi, and Johannesburg (W)*
Accra, Nairobi, and Johannesburg are three major African cities with very different origins. In each of these cities
African, Asian, Arabic, and European cultures have converged and intermingled in complicated ways that give
rise to hybrid cultures, economies, and politics. This seminar will trace the development of these cities from the
19th century to the present. The experience of various groups of city dwellers will be our main focus, as well as
the development of the cities' physical infrastructure like transportation, housing, trade, and labor networks.
More importantly, though, we will explore the underworld of these cities and will, with the inquisitiveness of a
voyeur, the zeal of a private investigator, and the sensibility of a historian, examine ways in which class, race
ethnicity, nationality, politics, and gender have influenced the structural growth of these cities and the experiences
of their inhabitants. Students will also get a chance to read about the various artistic movements in these cities
over the last century, focusing especially on music, theater, and street performances. Students should emerge
from this course with a greater awareness of African urban life and with a deepened understanding of colonial
and postcolonial societies in Africa and elsewhere in the so-called Third World.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class attendance and participation, 5 short papers, and a final re-
search paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference will be given to first-year students, and then
sophomores, who have not previously taken a 100-level seminar.

HIST 111(S) Movers and Shakers in the Middle East (Same as Leadership Studies 150) (W)*
This course examines the careers, ideas, and impact of leading politicians, religious leaders, intellectuals, and
artists in the Middle East in the twentieth century. Utilizing biographical studies and the general literature on the
political and cultural history of the period, this course will analyze how these individuals achieved prominence in
Middle Eastern society and how they addressed the pertinent problems of their day, such as war and peace, rela-
tions with Western powers, the role of religion in society, and the status of women. A range of significant individ-
uals will be studied, including Gamal Abd al-Nasser, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, Ayatollah Khomeini, Muhammad
Mussadiq, Umm Khulthum, Sayyid Qutb, Anwar Sadat, Naghuib Mahfouz, and Huda Shaarawi.

FIRST-YEAR SEMINARS AND TUTORIALS: Asia (112-121)
HIST 117T(S) Clash of Empires: China and the West, 1800-1900 (Same as Asian Studies 117T)
(W)*
As ever greater numbers of Western traders sought access to China's products and markets in the early nineteenth
century, their ideas of free trade, hopes for commercial expansion, and expectations for international intercourse
clashed with the policies and practices of the Qing Dynasty's multi-ethnic empire. This conflict reached a climax
in the mid-century Opium Wars, in which China's defeat inaugurated a period of Western domination by several
powers (including Britain, France, the United States, and later, Japan). Despite its weakened position, the Qing
dynasty continued to contest the definition and scope of Western privilege in China through the end of the centu-
ry. Historians have long disagreed over how to interpret this "clash of empires," some seeing Western involve-
ment in China as exploitative imperialism and others seeing it as a positive, modernizing force. In either case,
however, this conflict profoundly affected China's national development in the twentieth century, and continues
to inform contemporary China's view of itself and its international position.
This tutorial course will examine a series of significant points of contention between the Qing Dynasty and ex-
panding Western powers during this period. These will include the opium trade, Christian missionaries, extrater-
ritorial privilege, Western technology, the looting of Chinese artworks and antiquities, and contests over sover-
eignty in Tibet and Manchuria. We will examine both Western and Chinese perspectives on these conflicts, how
the period has been remembered and interpreted, and how it continues to affect Chinese and Western perceptions
of China's place in the world.
Format: tutorial. Students in the tutorial will meet in weekly one-hour sessions with the instructor and a class-
mate. Each week, students will alternate between writing a 5- to 7-page paper on the assigned readings (to be
presented orally in class) and writing and presenting a 2-page critique of his/her classmate's paper. The course
will conclude with a final paper that examines one of the issues raised in class in greater depth.
No prerequisites.Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Preference will be given to sophomores, and then first-year
students, who have not previously taken a 100-level tutorial.

HIST 127(F) The Expansion of Europe (W)
This course investigates the expansion of European power and influence over much of the rest of the world from
the late Middle Ages to the mid-nineteenth century--the early period of European Imperialism. Specific topics
will vary, but include the development and initial expansion of medieval and Renaissance Europe, the discovery
and conquest of the New World, the struggle with Islam for command of the seas, the establishment of European
influence in the East and Far East, the slave trade, the invasion of North America, and the initial steps toward
hegemony in the Middle East and Africa. Students will investigate the ways in which individual personality,
religiosity, greed, critical first contacts, and cultural misunderstandings and prejudices combined with important
aspects of the Military, Scientific, and early Industrial Revolutions to establish European hegemony on a
world-wide scale during this early period of European Imperialism.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on five short written exercises and one research paper.

HIST 135T(F) The Great War, 1914-1918 (Same as Leadership Studies 135T) (W)
During the nineteenth and early twentieth century Europeans and their immediate offspring created the modern
world. European industry, science, trade, weapons, and culture dominated the globe. After a century of general
peace the continual "progress" of Western Civilization seemed assured. Then, in August, 1914, the major Euro-
pean powers went to war with one another. After four years of unprecedented carnage, violence, and destruction,
Europe was left exhausted and bitter, its previous optimism replaced by pessimism, its world position under-
mined, and its future clouded by a deeply flawed peace settlement.
What were the fundamental causes of the Great War? How and why did it break out when it did and who was
responsible? Why was it so long, ferocious, wasteful, and, until the very end, indecisive? Why did the Allies,
rather than the Central Powers, emerge victorious? What did the peace settlement settle? How was Europe
changed? What is the historical significance of the conflict?
Format: tutorial.

FIRST-YEAR SEMINARS AND TUTORIALS: LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN (142-151)
HIST 148(F) The Mexican Revolution: 1910 to NAFTA (W)*
The first great revolution in the twentieth century, the Mexican Revolution was as dramatic and compelling as
later episodes in Russia, China and Cuba. Using a wide variety of sources--from films, murals, and comic books
to classic works of political and social history--this seminar will examine the forces that exploded in over a
decade of violence and produced the peculiar "institutional revolutionary" government that ruled Mexico from
the 1920s to the crises of the late 1990s. Was the Revolution a true social revolution or just a "palace coup"? Did
workers, women, peasants, or indigenous peoples make real gains in social or political power during the after the
Revolution? How democratic or authoritarian is the Mexico that emerged from the brutal decade of the 1910s?
Finally, in light of globalization, the political scandals of the 1990s, and ongoing peasant rebellion in Chiapas, is
the Revolution dead or is its promise only now to be fulfilled?
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class participation, a series of short written assignments, and a
research paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference will be given to first-year students, and then

FIRST-YEAR SEMINARS AND TUTORIALS: UNITED STATES (152-191)
HIST 152(F) The Fourteenth Amendment and the Rights Revolution (W)
For more than a century, the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution has served as the principal touchstone for
legal debates over the meaning of equality and freedom in the United States. This course explores the origins of
the 14th Amendment in the years immediately following the Civil War, and examines the evolution of that
amendment's meaning in the century that followed. Central themes in this course include the contested inter-
pretations of "due process," "privileges and immunities," "equal protection," and "life, liberty or property"; the
rise, fall, and rebirth of substantive due process; and the battles over incorporating the Bill of Rights into the 14th
Amendment. We will pay particular attention to how debates over the 14th Amendment have shaped and been
shaped by the changing meanings of racial and gender equality, and how the 14th Amendment has transformed
the promise and experience of American citizenship.
Format: discussion. Evaluation will be based on class discussion, three short analytical papers, and a final re-
search paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected 10-15). Priority given to first-year students, and then to sopho-

HIST 154T(S) The American Way of War: The First Three Centuries (W)
Is there an historically distinct American way of war? How have Americans experienced warfare? From the
earliest days of European settlement through the final campaigns against American Indians west of the Missis-
sippi, Americans have often been at war. Long before the United States became a world power those conflicts
had determined many of the basic contours of American society, culture, and nationhood. This tutorial will in-
vestigate the nature and development of American wars over the period 1600 to 1900. Though some attention
will be paid to the American Revolution and the Civil War, the tutorial will concentrate primarily on lesser
known but still historically significant wars, including King Philip's War, the Seven Years War, the War of 1812,
Jackson's Indian Wars, the Mexican-American War, the Plains Indians Wars, and the Spanish American War. All
but the last were fought to conclusion in North America itself. How did Americans fight these wars? How did
American militaries establish control over such a huge and varied continent? What role did military institutions
play in the development of a distinctive American society? Did war abet social mobility, or lend itself to social
control? What role did race play in the creation and sustaining of martial goals? What was the relationship be-
tween local military institutions and centralist attempts to create a national and/or professional army? What was
the impact of warfare on American culture, on concepts of masculinity, and national or community images?
Despite the fact that Americans have often conceived of themselves as a peace-loving people, war from the be-
ginning has played a key role in shaping their society and nation. It is exactly the nature, meaning, and paradoxes
of American wars that this tutorial will attempt to unravel.
Format: tutorial. Students will meet with the instructor in pairs for an hour each week. Each student will write
and present orally a 7-page essay every other week on the readings assigned for that week. In alternate weeks,
students will be responsible for offering an oral critique of the work of their partner.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Preference will be given to first-year students, and then
sophomores, who have not previously taken a 100-level tutorial.

INTRODUCTORY SURVEY COURSES (201-299)
These courses are open to all students and are intended to provide a basic understanding of the history of
peoples, countries, and geographic regions over relatively long time-spans. Most of all, they will provide students
with the background necessary for more advanced study in history at the 300 and 400 level. They are offered in
either small or large formats, depending on the individual course.

HIST 203(S) Sub-Saharan Africa Since 1800*
This survey of sub-Saharan African history takes up the continuing saga of African political, social and
economic developments from the aftermath of the trans-Atlantic slave trade to the present. It is divided into three
sections. The first section of the course focuses on the consequences of the slave trade on African societies and
on the Africans' interaction with European merchants, explorers, and missionaries in the decades preceding
colonial conquest. The human consequences of the trade lingered long after the abolition of the slave trade across
the Atlantic ocean. Many African societies were strengthened, often at the expense of their neighbors; other
societies were weakened, thus setting the stage for colonial conquest. During the second half of the nineteenth
century, however, competition among Europeans for control of raw materials for their nascent industries led to
colonization, and in some cases, to white settlement in Africa.
The second section of the course investigates the process of colonial conquest and the dynamics of colonial rule
in Africa. It looks especially at the ways in which colonialism affected various groups of Africans, and at the
ways, both subtle and overt, in which Africans resisted or collaborated with colonial rule in order to achieve their
goals. The colonial period, brief in time, yet profoundly significant in its impact, was ushered out partly by the
rising tide of African nationalism.
The last section of the course, then, examines the rise of new nation-states, their colonial legacies, post-colonial
economies, and systems of justice, education, and governance.

China expanded from scattered Neolithic settlements to become one of the world's most complex and sophisti-
cated civilizations. During this process, it experienced dramatic transformation as well as remarkable institutional
and cultural continuities. This course will examine Chinese history from prehistoric times to the "early modern"
seventeenth century. It will address topics such as the creation and transformation of dynastic authority, the rein-
terpretation of Confucian thought, the transmission of Buddhism, the conquest of China proper by "barbarian"
peoples, the composition of elites, and change in daily life, popular culture and China's place in the East Asian

A modernizing revolution, the construction and collapse of an empire, devastating defeat in a World War, oc-

experience. This course will examine the main themes of modern Japanese history with a focus on how various
"ordinary people" have lived through the extraordinary changes of the past century and a half. Through the per-
spectives of ordinary people, from a young girl working in a cotton textile factory in the 1920s to a salaryman in
the post-World War II period, issues of national identity, democracy, gender, family, work, race and ethnicity, and
consumerism will be addressed. Reading materials will include autobiographies, oral histories, and anthropolog-

INTRODUCTORY SURVEY COURSES: EUROPE AND RUSSIA (222-241)
HIST 222(F) Greek History (Same as Classics 222)
Ancient Greece has been thought to embody the origins of Western civilization in its institutions, values, and
thought; it has been seen as the infancy of modern society, with the attributes of innocence, purity, and the infant's
staggering capacity for exploration and learning; it has been interpreted as an essentially primitive, violent culture
with a thin veneer of rationality; and it has been celebrated as the rational culture par excellence. The study of
ancient Greece indeed requires an interpretive framework, yet Greek culture and history have defied most at-
tempts to articulate one. We will make our attempt in this course by investigating ancient Greece as a set of
cultures surprisingly foreign to us, as it so often was to its own intellectual elite. But we will also come to appreci-
ate the rich and very real connections between ancient Greek and modern Western civilization. The course will
begin with Bronze Age-Greece and the earliest developments in Greek culture, and will conclude with the spread
of Greek influence into Asia through the conquests of Alexander the Great. We will explore topics such as the
aristocratic heritage of the city-state, the effects of pervasive war on Greek society, the competitive spirit in politi-
cal and religious life, the confrontations with the East, the relationship of intellectual culture to Greek culture as a
whole, Greek dependence on slavery, and the diversity of political and social forms in the Greek world. The
readings will concentrate on original sources, including historical writings, philosophy, poetry, and oratory. The
class will meet once a week for a lecture, and will divide into two discussion sections for the second meeting of
the week.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on contributions to class discussions, a midterm, a final
exam, and a medium-length paper.

HIST 224(F) Europe Since 1945
This course explores the major themes of post-World War II European history. First, we will examine the imme-
diate impact of World War II on European societies and politics. Then we will consider the postwar reconstruc-
tion and division of Europe. We will then pay equal attention to the political, social and cultural development of
both west and east Europe from 1949 to the present. Frequent attention will also be paid to the United States,
specifically in relation to its impact on and involvement with Europe. Some of the highlighted topics of this
History
­ 189 ­
course will be the Cold War, the "Americanization" of western Europe, Stalinism in eastern Europe, the "thaw,"
decolonization, the radicalism and rebellions of the 1960's and 1970's, the decline of the Soviet Union, the wel-
fare state, the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of Communism, immigration, and the construction of a united
Europe. We will investigate these themes through readings of both secondary (scholarly) works, and primary
texts. Students will also watch several relevant films during the semester, and write papers discussing the films
and their historical contexts.

HIST 225(F) The Middle Ages (Same as Religion 216)
This course explores the development of European and Mediterranean civilizations during the thousand-year
period known as the "Middle Ages." At the beginning of this period the Romans ruled a massive empire that
stretched from Britain to north Africa and from Spain to Iraq. A millennium later, this classical and pagan world
had broken apart into three successor civilizations: medieval Europe, the Byzantine empire, and the Islamic
world. This course investigates how this momentous transformation occurred. We will examine such topics as
relations between Romans and "barbarians," the spread of Christianity and Islam, the development of kingdoms
and empires, the Vikings and crusades, saints and religious reformers, art and architecture, cities and trade, the
persecution of Jews and heretics, as well as the Black Death and Italian Renaissance.

HIST 227(F) A Century of Revolutions: Europe in the 19th Century
This course introduces students to the era of the European domination of the world, a time of revolutionary
excitement and fervor, of war and travesty, of profound social and economic change, and of great intellectual
ferment. Topics include the French and Russian Revolutions, the Revolutions of 1830 and 1848, the Industrial
Revolution, German and Italian Unification, European imperialist expansion, processes of secularization and
religious revival, and the origins of World War I. With an eye toward exploring the origins of today's complex
attitudes toward race, ethnicity, and gender, the course will also investigate racial thought, anti-semitism, and
feminism in the nineteenth century.

HIST 228(S) Europe in the Twentieth Century
This survey course has two goals: to introduce students to the fundamental issues and experiences of the last
century of European history, from the eve of World War One to the present, and to teach students to be historians.
Toward that end, students will be required, in class and in written assignments, to use primary sources in con-
junction with secondary source readings to pose questions and suggest interpretations about the past. Wars, de-
pression, political changeovers, urbanization, technological advancements all have a profound impact on the
lives of ordinary people; so, too, ordinary people shape those historical developments. We will focus on learning
how to empathize with people from the past and to understand their experiences on their terms. What was it like
to return to civilian life after fighting in the First World War? What were the experiences of Europeans between
the wars? Why did so many Germans support Hitler and what was it like for different segments of European
society to live through World War II? In a divided postwar Europe, what hopes and betrayals did Europeans on
different sides of the Iron Curtain experience in the realms of social, economic, and legal justice? How have
Europeans since the fall of the Berlin Wall attempted to confront their pasts? By the end of this course, students
will be familiar with the central themes of the history of twentieth-century Europe and understand how to ana-
lyze historical documents, which students can replicate in their future research and writing.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, several quizzes, an exam, and two
papers.

HIST 239(S) Germany in the Twentieth Century
Written documents, literature, film, and the writings of historians will be used in surveying the history of Germa-
ny since 1890. Topics to be considered include: Wilhelmian Germany and the role played by domestic and for-
eign policy in the decision of the imperial government to opt for war in 1914; the impact of war and defeat on
German society; the relation of the cultural flowering that occurred in Germany during the 1920s to the political
and social instability of the Weimar Republic; Hitler and the collapse of democratic Germany; the Third Reich;
World War II and the Holocaust; the reconstruction of Germany after 1945; Germany in the context of the Cold
War (the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic); and united-Germany after the
wall. A central theme of the course will be the attempt of Germans during the twentieth century to decide what
Germany is and how it fits into the rest of Europe, and to determine the nature of their state and society.

HIST 240(F) Muscovy and the Russian Empire
Between the fourteenth and the seventeenth centuries the princes and political elite of Muscovy created a vast
multi-national empire in Eastern Europe and Asia. Over the next 150 years their imperial heirs transformed and
extended this empire, to the point that on the eve of the Crimean War (1853-1855) many believed it to be the
most powerful state in Europe. But defeat in the war exposed the weakness of the imperial regime and helped to
provoke a process of state-led reform that failed to avert, and may well have contributed to, the collapse of the
regime in the February Revolution of 1917. Using a combination of primary and secondary sources, this course
will explore the character of the Muscovite and the Russian empires and the forces, processes, and personalities
that shaped their formation, expansion, and, in the latter case, decline.
Format: discussion/lecture. Evaluation will be based on class participation, amap quiz, several short essays based
on class readings, and a final self-scheduled exam.

Less than seventy-five years later, the experiment appeared to end in failure, with the stunning collapse of the
Soviet Union in December 1991. Using a combination of primary and secondary sources, this course will
explore the nature and historical significance of the Soviet experiment, the controversies to which it has given
rise, and the forces, processes, and personalities that shaped the formation, transformation, and ultimate collapse
of the Soviet Union.

HIST 242(F) Latin America From Conquest to Independence*
This course examines the construction of distinctively Latin-American societies from the age of conquest to the
independence movements of the early-nineteenth century. The central theme will be the ways in which social
conflicts between and among Europeans, Amerindians, and Africans shaped colonial Latin America and the
subsequent creation of independent nations in the region. While discussing the interplay of race, class, and
gender in these New World societies, the course will analyze the transformation of political and economic
structures during the period of Spanish and Portuguese rule in the Americas.

section of the course will focus on the turbulent formation of nation-states over the course of the nineteenth
century. In this regard the course will analyze the social and economic changes of the period up to World War I
and the possibilities they offered for both political order and disorder. Key topics addressed will include
caudillismo, the role of the Church in politics, economic dependency and development, and the place of
indigenous and African Latin-American peoples in new nations. The second section will move us to questions in
twentieth-century Latin-American history, including industrialization and urbanization; the emergence of
workers' and women's movements and the rise of mass politics; militarism, democracy, and authoritarian
governments; the influence of the U.S. in the region; and the construction of cultural modernism in these "Third
World" societies. Here and throughout the course we will strive for an understanding of how social conflicts
shaped and were shaped by economic and political forces.

Americans had a profound effect on the historical landscape of this nation. The experience of slavery necessarily
dominates this history and it is the contours and nuances of slavery that give this course its focus. We will explore
the influence of African culture on early America, the role of gender in the American slave labor system, the
development of racial classification in North America, and the cultural and intellectual significance of the aboli-
tionist movement. Our readings will include primary sources and secondary literature. Class meetings will com-

JUNIOR SEMINARS (301)
Junior seminars explore the nature and practice of history, are required for the degree in History, and are nor-
mally restricted to junior History majors. Although these seminars vary in topic and approach, each focuses on
the discipline of history itself--on the debates over how to approach the past, on questions of the status of differ-
ent kinds of evidence and how to use it, on the purpose of the study of history. Focusing on questions of method-
ology, epistemology, and historiography, these courses ask: What kind of knowledge do historians claim to pro-
duce? What does it mean to study the past? How do historians approach the project of studying the past? Each
year several junior seminars will be offered; prospective majors must select two junior seminars at the end of the
sophomore year and will then be assigned to one of their two choices. Students who plan to study abroad during
their junior year may take their Junior Seminar in the spring semester of their sophomore year, and those plan-
ning to be away for the whole of their junior year are strongly encouraged to do so.

HIST 301C(S) Approaching the Past: Practices of Modern History
What is history? What is it that historians do? In this course, students will explore questions of how and why we
historians practice our craft. The first section of the course will examine how historians come to know, think
about, and understand the past. Issues of objectivity and bias, types and uses of sources, and the nature of histori-
cal "truth" will be discussed. Next, we will address the ways in which historians write about the past, considering
historical fiction and film, microhistory, and the influence of postmodernism on historical narratives. Finally, we
will examine the uses of history, including history education and the construction of historical memory. The class
will meet once a week, and each session will focus on some theoretical material as well as readings that concrete-
ly illustrate the methodological issues at stake. These readings will be drawn from a broad range of topics, such
as the Great Depression, the Pacific War, the Holocaust, and the assassination of JFK.

HIST 301E(F) Debating the Dark Ages
The 500 years following the collapse of the Roman empire traditionally have been seen as Europe's "Dark
Ages," an era of warring barbarian chieftains, semi-pagan superstition, economic decline, and cultural stagna-
tion. Yet during the twentieth century historians of the early Middle Ages (roughly 500-1000) have gradually
swept away this view, finding political creativity, cultural dynamism, and economic growth where previous in-
terpreters saw only darkness, decline, and decay. This course investigates how scholars have rewritten the history
of early medieval Europe and explores the approaches, methodologies, assumptions, and types of evidence that
underpin this revisionist scholarship.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class participation, a presentation, and several papers.
Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Restricted to History majors.

HIST 301F(F,S) Approaching the Past: Remembering American History
Much of what we know and understand about American history is rooted in the received narrative of our national
history, a history that is constructed of individual, collective, and a national memory of the past and its meanings.
This course will examine some forms through which American historical memory is presented and (re)present-
ed, such as monuments, museums, novels, film, photographs, and scholarly historical writing, by considering a
number of pivotal events, institutions, or eras in American history: slavery, race, and the Civil War; the Great
Depression; World War II; the Sixties and the war in Viet Nam; and the events and aftermath of September 11,
2001.
Format: seminar. Assignments will include weekly response papers, critical essays, a museum exercise, and a
final project to be completed in consultation with the instructor.

ries), we will examine the religious, marriage, sexual, and childrearing practices associated with the "orthodox"
Confucian family. We will then explore heterodox practices, debates over and critiques of the family system, and
the substantial history of family reform efforts in twentieth century China.

indeed, most peoples around the globe. This course will introduce students to the history of European warfare
from its origins in the classical and medieval periods to its maturation in the early modern period (1450-1815),
and its disastrous culmination in the nationalist struggles of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Has there
been a distinctively "European Way of War" from the beginning? How do we explain failure and success in
European wars? What exactly happened at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels of war? And what caused
changes in the organization and waging of European war from one period to the next?

cal conditions and developments to which they responded. The course will be in two equal parts, each
extending from the early part of the period to the later. The first will consider key texts in the emergence of
political ideologies: liberalism, communism and ideas of nation, race and community, and also critiques of
bureaucracy and democratic politics. The second half of the course will look at cultural critiques of indus-

HIST 333(F) Twentieth-Century Europe from the Margins: Regions, Local Cultures and
Borderlands in Comparative Perspective
Although Europe is commonly considered to be a continent of nations, it would be more historically accurate to
call it a continent of regions and localities. For most of European history, up to the present day, the great majority
of Europeans have oriented their lives locally, toward the village, the city, or the province. This course examines
modern European life and history both at the micro level (localities and regions) and at the margins of nation-
states and empires (borderlands). Through comparative analysis, students will examine how these different per-
spectives challenge and modify our understandings of the course of twentieth century European history. Students
will examine specific case studies in depth. Examples include multicultural/multiethnic cities (Prague, Salonica,
Lvov, Czernowitz), strong regional cultures/traditions (Bavaria, Brittany, Scotland, Catalonia, Galicia), and con-
tested borderlands (Eastern Poland, Bohemia, Eastern Prussia/Germany, Alsace-Lorraine, Basque territories).
Students will consider the major events of the 20th century, including the World Wars, the rise of fascism and
Nazism, the Holocaust, revolutions, communism, and the establishment of the European Union through the spe-
cial perspectives of these case studies

HIST 334(S) The Fin-de-Siècle: Vienna--Paris--St. Petersburg
This course will introduce students to some of the most significant and exciting social, artistic, intellectual, and
political developments in fin-de-siècle Europe (1870 to 1914). "Fin-de-siècle" is a concept that denotes not only
a historical period - the end of a century - but refers to a consciousness of living in a time of accelerated change
and crisis. Intellectuals and artists of the decades we will be examining were preoccupied with "degeneration,"
loss of innocence, meaning, morality, and the inner self. They were simultaneously fascinated and horrified by
technological innovation, emergent political and ideological currents, and the challenges to traditional values and
identities posed by them. After a survey of political upheavals during the European fin-de-siècle, the course will
focus on three metropolises consecutively: Vienna, Paris, and St. Petersburg. Through analyses of historical liter-
ature, novels, music, visual art, and the seminal texts of psychoanalysis we will explore how the self, public life,
gender relations, sexuality, and aesthetics were conceived and re-imagined in each city, and bring to light the
sensibilities and culture they shared.

HIST 336(S) Victorian Psychology: From the Phrenologists to Freud
Although the Victorian era has traditionally been considered a psycho-social model of emotional inhibition and
sexual prudery, recent studies by scholars in various disciplines have demonstrated that this characterization
grossly oversimplifies the attitudes held by Europeans and Americans in the second half of the nineteenth centu-
ry. This course investigates professional and popular ideas about human psychology during this period. We will
attempt to define and understand what people felt and thought about the unconscious, dreams, sexuality, the rela-
tionship between natural impulses and civilized society, child psychology and development, the psychological
differences between men and women, the relationship between the physical and the psychical. The course will
concentrate on the close reading and analysis of primary documents, including: the writings of philosophers;
professional literature in psychiatry; manuals on childrearing, education, sexual practice, and living the whole-
some life; and cultural documents studied in context. Although the course will have a European focus (with a
concentration on Germany), some American sources will be studied as well.
Format: discussion. Evaluation will be based on three essays, class participation, and a final exam.

HIST 337(S) Empires, Nations and Nationalism in East-Central Europe, 1870-1945
At the dawn of the 20th century the political map of central Europe was totally unlike that of today: instead of
"nation-states" there were three empires, Germany, Austria-Hungary and Russia. By the end of World War I,
these empires collapsed and were replaced by new, unstable states that were supposed to more faithfully repre-
sent the peoples that had lived in the empires. But rather than satisfy the demands of nationalists, the new regimes
proved widely unpopular and the interwar years witnessed the radicalization of nationalism on all sides. World
War II helped unleash nationalist violence on an unprecedented scale, and in 1945 the map of the region would
be re-drawn once again. This course explores the origins and development of modern nationalist movements in
central and east-central Europe from 1870 to 1945. It will begin with a discussion and comparison of theories of
nationalism and nation-building. These will then be used to analyze and discuss how various individuals, gov-
ernments and institutions defined and described national identities and histories. Readings will focus principally
on Germans, Hungarians, Poles, Czechs, Slovaks, Ukrainians and Jews, and, to a lesser extent, on Croatians,
Roma, Romanians, Serbs, and Slovenians. Although the principal themes of readings and discussions is nation-
alism, the course will also explore the ways class, gender, religion, region, and economy affected the ways in
which nationalism was formulated and national identities were constructed and expressed.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, an oral presentation, a short paper,

historical topics examining the ways that race, sexuality, and gender have been imagined, policed, legislated,
experienced, and performed in modern U.S. History. Topics to be explored include the development of and chal-

ogy and evolutionary biology in Britain and France. This course considers these and also looks at individu-
al responses to `the crisis of faith' and `a godless world' (e.g. Carlyle, Dostoevsky ). The last part of the
century saw a number of attempts to explain and evaluate religion from the perspectives provided by an-
thropology and sociology (Frazer, Durkheim) and these will also be examined.

ADVANCED SEMINARS: LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN (442-451)
HIST 443(S) Slavery, Race and Ethnicity in Latin America*
At times in this century African Americans have looked to Brazil and other Latin-American countries as a sort of
racial paradise, where people of color did not suffer the same brutal prejudice and violence that they faced in the
U.S. Especially since the 1930s, on the other hand, some Latin Americans of African descent have admired the
force, consciousness, and independence of Black movements in the U.S., wishing they could construct similar
organizations in their own countries. Although they might at first seem contradictory, these attitudes are rather
reflections of the complex and subtle differences in the systems of race relations that have developed historically
in the Americas. Instead of wondering which group of observers was more correct in its analysis of the other's
country, we will in this seminar try to see how each group was both right and wrong in its judgment and how the
history of their home society shaped their attitudes toward other countries. To do this, we will explore the histori-
cal roots of race relations and politics in Latin America from the beginnings of slavery through its abolition; the
changing constructions of indigenous ethnicities; and on to the emergence of new Black Movements and other
race-based political currents in Colombia, Brazil, and throughout the region.
Evaluation will be based on class participation, weekly reading responses, and a final paper.
Enrollment limited.

HIST 452(F) Antebellum American Women's History (Same as Women's and Gender Studies
452)*
Women have always been mothers, wives and daughters; and through much of their history in North America,
their relationship to the state has been mediated through men. However, they have always been valuable produc-
ers. Their labor, be it in the household, as free wage laborers, farm hands, or slaves, was important both to the
development of the American market economy and to theideology and rhetoric of nationhood. This seminar will
explore the significance of the experiences of American women from the colonial era through the Civil War. We
will address the impact of slavery on all American women, the role of women during intense urbanization and
industrialization, and the ways in which literacy and artistic culture shaped the way American women portrayed
their own lives. Throughout the semester we will read primary documents. Our inquiry will encompass women
in New England, the South and the Hispanic Southwest. As we study works of history, we will also read twen-
tieth century feminist and race theory to understand connections between practice and theory, between narrative
and argument.

HIST 466(S) Imagining Urban America, Three Case Studies: Boston, Chicago, and L.A. (Same as
American Studies 364)
This course will explore the social, economic, and cultural lives of three cities, each of which at its zenith seemed
to contemporaries to represent definitive aspects of "American" development. We will begin with Boston--the
country's first "big" city and the nominal capital of Puritan New England--in the colonial and early national
periods. From there we will move to Chicago, the transportation and commercial hub of the emerging national
economy in the nineteenth century. Finally we will turn to Los Angeles, "The City of Dreams" and the center of
the popular entertainment industry in the twentieth century. In each case, drawing on a variety of sources, we will
examine the city's origins, the factors that promoted its growth, and the distinctive society it engendered. Then
we will consider some of the city's cultural expressions--expressions that seem to characterize not only chang-
ing the nature of urban life, but the particular meanings each city gave to the nation's experience at the time. What
made these cities seem simultaneously, as they did, so alluring and so threatening to the fabric of national com-
munity and identity?

HIST 468(S) Grand Strategy in the Second World War (Same as Leadership Studies 468)
The United States fought World War II as part of a coalition, one of the most successful wartime coalitions in
history. This seminar will explore how and why it did so, and why the Allied effort was so successful. Emphasis
will be placed on U.S. strategic planning, its relationship to U.S. foreign policies, the ensuing conflicts between
U.S. strategies and policies and those desired by its British and Soviet allies, and the ways in which these con-
flicts were resolved by Churchill, Roosevelt and Stalin. As such it will also focus on civil-military relations and
Allied diplomacy during the war, as well as how and why the alliance collapsed after victory had been achieved.
Readings will include key primary as well as secondary sources.

to justify contemporary action. Special attention will be paid to the interpretations of key historical moments
(1948, 1967, 1994, and 2000) and on the contrasting views of some of the core issues of the conflict (Jerusalem,
refugees, settlements, terrorism).

HIST 481T(S) The American Revolution, 1763-1798: Meanings and Interpretations (W)*
During the second half of the eighteenth century, the political, social, and demographic landscape of eastern
North America underwent dramatic transformations. If many of the characters and events marking the transition
of the region from a cluster of thirteen colonies to the first republic of the western hemisphere are quite familiar to
most Americans, the movement to independence and the creation of the United States have been the subject of
complex and sometimes contentious historical interpretations. This tutorial will explore the ideological, econom-
ic, political, and cultural causes and consequences of the American Revolution, from the emergence of increas-
ing tensions between Great Britain and its North American colonies to the attempts of the United States govern-
ment to limit political expression and immigration in the new nation. Through the close reading of some of the
most significant scholarship of the period, we will seek to understand how a multitude of historical actors of
varied social, economic, religious, and ethnic backgrounds made and shaped the famous political, military, and
constitutional struggles of the Revolutionary Era. By the end of this tutorial, students will have engaged and
debated some of the most important historiographical assessments of the Revolutionary Era. In their final assign-
ment, students will be equipped to provide an erudite and personal answer to the most important question of all:
How revolutionary was the Revolution?
Format: tutorial. Requirements: once a week for about an hour, student will meet with the instructor in pairs.
During our sessions, students will alternatively present orally or critique a written essay of seven double-spaced
pages on a topic assigned by the instructor. At the end of the semester, students will be asked to write a final paper
assessing the revolutionary nature of the American Revolution.

HIST 482T(S) (formerly 389) Fictions of African-American History (W)*
This course examines the form and function of African-American historical narratives with attention to written
texts pertaining to the enslavement and freedom of African Americans during the nineteenth and early twentieth
century. The lack of documentary material pertaining to this history has made the task of reading and interpreting
African American experience particularly challenging. By crossing generic and disciplinary boundaries, students
will take up the task of reading African-American history while attending to the difficulties such a task raises. To
do so, we will read both historical and fictional narratives that raise explicitly the problems of writing African-
American history.
In the first part of the course, we will discuss selected texts (fiction, narrative, and historiography) from the ante-
bellum era in order to schematize the literature of slavery. In the second half of the course, we will take up the
discourse of freedom that followed the Emancipation Proclamation. Readings will include works by Booker T.
Washington, James Weldon Johnson, Charles Chesnutt, Harriet Wilson, Paul Laurence Dunbar, Sutton Griggs.
In addition, we will read historiography on African American slavery, freedom, and urbanization.

HIST 483T(F) African Political Thought (W)*
This course examines the ideas of major figures in the progressive tradition of African political thought. This
emancipatory tradition emerged in societies shaped by racial, cultural, and economic exploitation, forcing both
African men and women to address questions of identity and political action. Most members of this tradition also
considered the ways in which uneven power relations within African communities shaped the personal and
political landscapes. The Africans we will examine in this course drew on resources as varied as Pan-Africanism,
Nationalism, Classical Liberalism, Social Democracy, Marxism, Black Consciousness, Negritude and Gender
theory, yet each participated, at least implicitly, in a common African intellectual project: the meaning of Africa
and of being African.
Format: tutorial. Evaluation will be based on class participation, weekly papers, and a 20- to 25-page seminar
paper.

HISTORY OF SCIENCE
(Div. II & III, see course descriptions)
Chair, Professor DONALD deB. BEAVER
A major in the History of Science is not offered, but the occasional Contract Major in it or a related interdisci-
plinary field is possible. Courses in the History of Science are designed primarily to complement and strengthen
work in other major fields. Although any of the courses may be taken separately, studying related courses in
other departments will enhance their value, because by nature, History of Science is interdisciplinary.
The following will serve as examples: the 101 course is an introduction to science and technology studies, and
concentrates on key aspects of contemporary science and technology relevant to many issues of living in a tech-
nological society. Scientific Revolutions (HSCI 224) deals with the emergence of modern science in the 1600s
and 1700s, and with subsequent revolutions in scientific thought; as such it complements courses related to mod-
ern European history. History of Science 240 traces the influential role of science and invention in the shaping of
American culture, and complements offerings in American Studies and American History. HSCI 320, an histori-
cal overview of the ideas, practice, and organization of medicine, provides context for related coursework in
History, Philosophy, and the Premed Program.
HSCI 101(F) Science, Technology, and Human Values (Same as Science and Technology Studies
101)
A study of the natures and roles of science and technology in today's society, and of the problems which techni-
cal advances pose for human values. An introduction to science-technology studies. Topics include: scientific
creativity, the Two Cultures, the norms and values of science, the Manhattan Project and Big Science, the ethics
and social responsibility of science, appropriate technology, technology assessment, and various problems which
spring from dependencies engendered by living in a technological society, e.g., computers and privacy, automa-
tion and dehumanization, biomedical engineering.
Format: seminar. Requirements: two or three short exercises, two papers (3-5 pages and 5-7 pages), and two hour

HSCI 240(F) Technology and Science in American Culture (Same as History 295)
Although technologically dependent, the American colonies slowly built a network of native scientists and
inventors whose skills helped shape the United States' response to the Industrial Revolution. The interaction of
science, technology, and society in the nineteenth century did much to form American identity: the machine in
the garden, through the "American System of Manufactures" helped America rise to technological prominence;
the professionalization and specialization of science and engineering led to their becoming vital national
resources. Understanding these developments, as well as the heroic age of American invention (1865-1914),
forms the focus of this course: how science and technology have helped shape modern American life.
Format: seminar. Requirements: class discussion, six short reports (2-3 pages), and two hour exams.

The brain interprets the visual world and generates cognitive and emotional responses to what the eyes see. It is
also responsible for creating visual objects. This course first examines how we see and how our brains organize
and perceive what we see. In that context, we will investigate how visual artists have used or challenged per-
ceptual cues in their work. We then will study Gestalt perceptual laws and illusions, and see how they have been
used in works of art. We will also consider the influence of "disturbed" brain function of artists on their work (for
example, autism, schizophrenia, and epilepsy). In the second unit, we will discuss the history and use of neuroi-
maging (brain scans), and the questions posed by Dumit's ethnography of neuroimagers, "Picturing Person-
hood." How are neuroimages used in public discussions of mental illness, violence, and addiction? And are the
brains of visual artists lateralized or specialized differently from non-artists? In the final unit, we will explore how
visual artists are using brain images in their artwork, and how they have portrayed brain syndromes and mental
states. The course will culminate with the development of an exhibit.

sistant Professor: PIEPRZAK.
In this era of cultural, technological and economic globalization and also of pressing international crises in-
cluding environmental degradation, poverty and underdevelopment, terrorism and pandemics, knowledge of the
world beyond the United States is an essential part of the liberal education that is the goal of the Williams exper-
ience. Both within and outside the classroom the College provides a rich array of opportunities to pursue that
goal. The International Studies Program is designed to increase awareness of those opportunities and to provide a
centralizing mechanism to encourage gaining such knowledge with perspectives that are cross disciplinary and
comparative.
The program administers a number of tracks that provide students with the opportunity to pursue study of one
area of the world or theme as a way of complementing the work they have done in their majors. Students will be
expected to take courses in at least two departments to fulfill the requirements of a track. In addition to complet-
ing International Studies 101, they will be expected to do five courses in a track including an approved senior
exercise. Students may not count a course toward more than one track in the program. They may pursue two
tracks but will need to meet the course requirements for each track with a full complement of courses.
TRACKS
Tracks are of two kinds. The first type focuses either on a particular region of the world or a contact zone
where several cultural traditions encounter each other. The second type is organized thematically and will ex-
plore a cultural, political, economic or technological issue globally. Each track will be administered by faculty
teaching in that track in consultation with the steering committee. Each track may set an additional requirement
of alevel of language competency for its concentrators. Each track may also require one of the elective courses to
be comparative, i.e. course that might not cover material directly dealing with their area, but would enrich the
student's experience with tools for comparative inquiry. At present the program consists of the following tracks:
Area Tracks Thematic Tracks
African Studies Borders, Exile and Diaspora Studies
East Asian Studies Economic Development Studies
Latin American Studies Global Health
Middle Eastern Studies
Russian and Eurasian Studies
South and Southeast Asia Studies
To complete a track, students must take a section of International Studies 101, complete five additional ap-
proved courses within the track, attend the weekly International Studies colloquium and complete a senior exer-
cise. Credit for work done on study abroad will likely provide one or more of the electives for many concentra-
tors.
International Studies 101
All students wishing to pursue the program should take a section of International Studies 101 early in their
careers. These courses will usually be team taught. The topics and regions covered will vary and be selective, but
all will be designed to place cultural, political, economic and technological issues in conversation with one
another to illustrate the necessity of having a broad range of disciplinary tools available to pursue an individual
track. On occasion students may petition to substitute a course equivalent in scope to International Stud-
ies 101 to meet this requirement.
Study Abroad and Internships
Study abroad and/or overseas internships are an essential component of International Studies. The program in
coordination with the Study Abroad Advisor and the Office of Career Counseling will advise students on oppor-
International Studies
­ 204 ­
tunities in these areas. One or more courses completed on an approved study abroad program can be counted
toward the five elective courses requirement.
Colloquium
Concentrators will be expected to attend fifteen sessions of the International Studies colloquia in their senior
year, and are urged to do so throughout their careers at Williams. We hope that it will become a regular event for
all concentrators. The colloquium meets weekly at the Center for Foreign Languages and Cultures and is de-
signed to feature faculty, students, CDE fellows and outside speakers addressing issues of wide interest to those
in International Studies.
Senior Exercise
All concentrators must also complete a senior exercise. This will be a substantial piece of writing (20-25
pages) that would allow a student to draw together both their disciplinary skills and expertise in a particular area.
It might be work done either in the context of a senior capstone course in a relevant department or in the context
of a shared seminar sponsored by the International Studies program. In both cases it would culminate in a public
presentation by each concentrator of his/her work in class or in the context of the International Studies Colloqui-
um.
Honors
A candidate for honors in International Studies must maintain at least a B+ average in the concentration and
be admitted to candidacy by the program faculty. An honors candidate must complete her/his project in a semes-
ter (and Winter Study). An honors candidate will prepare a forty page thesis or its equivalent while enrolled in the
senior thesis course, 491 or 492 (and Winter Study). This course will be in addition to the courses required to
fulfill the concentration.
A student wishing to become a candidate for honors in International Studies should secure a faculty sponsor
and inform the program chair in writing before spring registration of her/his junior year.
INST 101(S) Geopolitics, Religion, and Oil: The Case of Iraq and Iran (Same as INTR 110 and
Political Science 258)*
The United States' continuing and troubled attempt to remake the Persian Gulf region provides an occasion for
critical reflection on the questions asked and tools available from the International Studies perspective for under-
standing other nations and regions. This course will examine aspects of the cultural, political, economic and tech-
nological dimensions of the nations of Iraq and Iran. The course will begin with a consideration of the history,
religions, and societies of these two neighbors as well as the specific features of an oil rentier economy. The
course will then turn to the recent experiences of these two nations in the international arena including strategies
of sanctions, regime change and democratization prosecuted primarily by the United States. We will pay special
attention to the assumptions about the role and character of the state, the character of civil society and the pro-
cesses of economic and cultural globalization that lie behind these strategies.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on two short papers and a final research paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 40 (expected: 40). Preference given to first year students and sophomores.

THE PROGRAM IN JEWISH STUDIES
Jewish Studies is an interdisciplinary field that encompasses the texts, history, languages, philosophy, and cul-
ture of Jews and Judaism as they have changed over three millennia and throughout the world. The program
offers courses in multiple disciplines including but not limited to Religion, Classics, History, Philosophy, An-
thropology, Sociology, and Comparative Literature. Across these disciplines, the program examines topics such
as religious belief and practice, textual interpretation, the development of Zionism, life in the Diaspora, the histo-
ricization and memorialization of the Holocaust, and historical, political and philosophical questions surrounding
Jewish identity. Investigating the foundations and development of these various Jewish topics, as well as their
interaction with and influence on other traditions, provides an opportunity to explore the continuities and diversi-
ty of Jewish life and thought. Students will gain exposure to a common body of knowledge and scholarly ap-
proaches through which to engage in their own rich and varied intellectual explorations of Jewish and related
topics.
CONCENTRATION IN JEWISH STUDIES
The concentration in Jewish Studies requires five courses with at least two different prefixes: one gateway
course, two core courses, one elective, and one capstone course.

have taught courses on the Mishnah (Shaye Cohen), the historical Jesus (John Dominic Crossan), and Ancient
Mediterranean Religions (Ross Kraemer).
Overseas Studies
Studying in Israel is highly recommended for students interested in Jewish Studies. Many students have spent
a semester or year at Hebrew University. With the approval of the Jewish Studies program chair, students may
count a study-abroad program towards on core requirement.
Funding
The Bronfman Fund for Judaic Studies was established in 1980 by Edgar M. Bronfman '50, Samuel Bronf-
man II '75, and Matthew Bronfman '80. The Bronfman Fund provides opportunities for the Williams communi-
ty to learn about Jewish history and culture, both within the College's formal curriculum and through the plan-
ning of major events on Jewish themes.
The Morris Wiener and Stephen R. Wiener '56 Fund for Jewish Studies was established in 1997 through the
estate of Stephen R. Wiener '56. The Wiener gifts have provided an endowment to support a faculty position in
modern Jewish thought, and are used to underwrite an annual lecture, forum or event relevant to contemporary
Jewish life.

LATINA/O STUDIES (Div. II)
Chair, Professor CARMEN WHALEN
Advisory Committee: Professor: WHALEN. Associate Professor: KITTLESON. Assistant Professors:
CEPEDA, CHAVOYA, JOTTAR, RÚA**, VARGAS.
Latina/o Studies is an interdisciplinary and comparative field of study that explores the histories and experi-
ences of Latinas and Latinos in the United States. Latinas and Latinos include peoples who come from or whose
ancestors come from Latin America and the Spanish-speaking Caribbean. The program seeks to cover the widest
range of experiences, encompassing Mexican-Americans, Puerto Ricans, Cubans, and Dominicans, as well as
more recent migrations from a wide variety of Central and South American countries. Courses, most of which
use acomparative approach, seek to provide students with the tools to continue their work in areas of their partic-
ular interest. Focusing on a diverse group with a long history in the United States, which is also one of the fastest
growing populations in the contemporary era, provides an opportunity to explore complex dynamics globally
and within the context of the United States. The program examines topics such as the political and economic
causes of migration, the impact of globalization, economic incorporation, racialization, the formation and refor-
mulations of identities and communities, the uses of urban spaces, inter-ethnic relations, artistic expression, aes-
thetics, and visual and popular culture.
THE CONCENTRATION
The concentration in Latina/o Studies requires five courses. Students are required to take the introductory
course (LATS 105), one 400-level Latina/o Studies seminar, and three electives. Two electives must be core elec-
tives, and one elective can be a related course in Comparative Race and Ethnic Studies or in Countries of Origin
and Transnationalism. The three electives must include two different areas of study, and at least one elective must
be at the 300 or 400 level. Additional courses may be approved by the Chair. Students, especially those consider-
ing graduate work or professional careers in the field, are encouraged to enroll in Spanish language courses at
Williams.

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS
Honors in Latina/o Studies may be granted to concentrators after an approved candidate completes an honors
project, delivers a public presentation of the work, and is awarded an honors grade by her/his advisor and two
other faculty readers. In consultation with the advisor and the chair, faculty readers may be from outside the
Latina/o Studies Program.
Latina/o Studies
­ 211 ­
The honors project will be completed over one semester plus winter study. It may consist of a conventional
research thesis of 40-70 pages or of other forms of presentation (e.g., video, art, theater). It may also combine a
shorter research thesis with another medium.
To be accepted as a candidate for honors in Latina/o Studies, a student must meet these criteria:
1) Submit and earn approval of a project proposal in April of the junior year. The proposal should be no lon-
ger than 5 pages and should lay out the project's aim and methodology, identify the student's advisor for
the work, and include evidence of competence in the necessary media for projects that include non-thesis
forms.
2) Achieve a grade point average of at least 3.33 in LATS courses at the time of application.
Students admitted to the honors program must submit a 5-8 page revised proposal, with an annotated bibliog-
raphy, by the second week of classes in the fall semester of her/his senior year. They should register either for
LATS 493 in the fall semester and LATS 031 in Winter Study, or for LATS 031 in Winter Study and LATS 494
in the spring semester. These courses will be in addition to the 5 courses that make up the regular concentration.
STUDY ABROAD
Study abroad and other off-campus programs offer excellent opportunities for students to build on, and ex-
pand, the intellectual interests they develop as part of the Latina/o Studies concentration. Through their connec-
tions to various institutions in the U.S. and other nations, Latina/o Studies faculty can help place students in U.S.
borderlands programs as well as programs in Mexico, Cuba, and other "countries of origin." Any student seek-
ing to include courses as part of a concentration in Latina/o Studies should feel free to contact the Program chair
or other faculty. A maximum of 1 course taken away from Williams can count (as an elective) toward the
completion of the concentration.
LATS 105(F) Latina/o Identities: Constructions, Contestations, and Expressions*
What, or who, is a Hispanic or Latina/o? At present, individuals living in the United States who are classified as
such number approximately 40 million, constituting the country's largest "minority" group. In this course, we
will study the interdisciplinary field that has emerged in response to this growing population, as we focus on the
complex nature of "identity." Viewing identities as historically and socially constructed, we begin with a brief
assessment of how racial, ethnic, class, and gendered identities take shape in the Hispanic Caribbean and Latin
America. We then examine the impact of (im)migration and the rearticulation of identities in the United States, as
we compare each group's unique history, settlement patterns, and transnational activity. Identity is also a con-
tested terrain. As immigrants and migrants arrive, the United States' policymakers, the media, and others seek to
define the "newcomers" along with long-term Latina/o citizens. At the same time, Latinas/os rearticulate, live,
assert, and express their own sense of identity. In this light, we conclude the course with an exploration of these
diverse expressions as they relate to questions of class, race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, and national
origins.
Format: discussion. Evaluation to be based on student participation and several short (1- to 5-page) papers
throughout the semester.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 25 (expected: 20-25). Preference given to Latina/o Studies concentrators.

tening, reading, writing, and speaking), with particular attention to the unique needs of students who have re-
ceived a majority of their exposure to the Spanish language in an informal/domestic environment. Through the
use of meaningful materials and vocabulary taken from a variety of Spanish-language contexts--but with prima-
ry emphasis on the numerous U.S. Latina/o communities--this course aims to sharpen heritage speakers' socio-
linguistic competency and ability to interpret Spanish-language musical, cinematic, and literary texts in the target
language. Ultimately, students will be prepared for a variety of "real-world," cross-cultural contexts and will be
more knowledgeable regarding Latina/o cultural production.
Format: discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, several short writing assignments (1-to
3-pages each), two oral exams, and an oral presentation.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15 (expected: 15). Open to all heritage speakers of Spanish. Preference given
to Latina/o concentrators.

live, embodied activities as cultural acts and as theoretical paradigms. This course is an introduction to perfor-
mance studies and to its theoretical bases in anthropology, dramatic theory, poststructuralism, psychoanalytic
theory, folklore, cultural studies, philosophy, feminist theory, and queer theory. We will devote particular atten-
tion to performances that reflect the complexity and diversity of race and ethnicity in the United States. In addi-
tion to reading and discussing theory, we will study local live and recorded performances. This course combines
theory and practice in order to understand performance as a critical space. On the practical level, students are
expected to attend three workshops with Professor Omar Sangare to experiment with their body, voice, and the
stage. These workshops will provide the foundation for students' final performance. This course also serves as

This course explores Latina/o theatre and performance from the 1950's to the late 1990's. We will cover a broad
range of theatrical practices, from mainstream Broadway productions to grass roots community actos, from site-
specific interventions in the US/Mexico border region to the use of vernacular aesthetic practices such as choteo,
relajo and rascuachismo. One of the course's goals is to introduce some of the screenplays that have become
canons within Chicana/o, Puerto Rican and Cuban theatre in the United States. The course also introduces the
centrality of Latina feminist and queer thought to theater and performance. We will pay particular attention to the
connections between social movements and popular culture, during an era that illustrates Latinas/os' articulation
of ethnic and cultural self-identification.

(Same as American Studies 240, Comparative Literature 210, and Linguistics 254)*
In this course we will focus on issues of language and identity in the contemporary literary production and lived
experiences of various Latina/o communities. As such, how are cultural values and material conditions ex-
pressed through Latina/o language and literature? How does Latina/o identity challenge traditional notions of the
relationship between language, culture, and nation? In what ways might Latina/o literary and linguistic practices
serve as tools for social change? Departing from an overview of common linguistic phenomena such as code-
switching (popularly known as"Spanglish") and Latina/o English, we will examine bilingual education, recent
linguistic legislation, and the English Only movement. Throughout the course we will survey texts culled from a
variety of literary and performance genres, ranging from the poetry of the Chicano and Puerto Rican Movements
of the 1960s and 1970s to more recent theatrical pieces, novels, poetry, and short stories by writers such as San-
dra Cisneros, Junot Díaz, Martín Espada, Víctor Hernández Cruz, Jaime Manrique, Dolores Prida, Michelle Ser-
ros, and Helena María Viramontes, among others. Both directly and/or indirectly, these texts address Latina/o
language politics, as well as the broader themes of identity, power, community, race/ethnicity, gender, sexuality,
class, and hybridity.

LATS 258(S) Latina/o Installation and Site-Specific Art (Same as ArtH 258)*
This course will explore the various forms of installation and site-specific artworks created by Latina/o artists for
both museums and public space. We will examine the ways in which Latina/o artists have used space as a materi-
al in the production of artworks and how this impacts the works' meanings and the viewer's experience. Within
the context of U.S. Latina/o culture and history, we will connect notions of space with ideas about cultural citi-
zenship, civil rights, and social justice. A variety of art forms will be studied, from traditional to experimental,
including murals, sculpture, performance, video, and several multimedia, interactive, or participatory projects.
While establishing a historical lineage and theoretical frameworks for analyzing this growing genre, we will pay
particular attention to how these works engage urban space and often challenge the institutional assumptions of
museums and curatorial practice. Likewise, we will examine the important debates associated with various pub-
lic art and museum installation controversies.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: two short papers, periodic research reports, final research paper, and
presentation.

LATS 331(F) Sound and Movement in the Diaspora: Afro-Latin Identities (Same as Africana

This course examines various Afro-descendant cultures through music and dance. We focus on Cuba, Brazil,
Puerto Rico and the United States. Through the theoretical and practical study of commercial and grassroots
music and dance production, we unpack how performance may re-articulate and challenge ascribed race and
gender roles. The first part of the semester establishes fundamental methodological and theoretical frameworks,
such as Taylor's epistemology and ontology of performance, Ortiz's transculturation, and Bahktin's carnivales-
que inversion. These theories will help us understand that while music and dance are site specific practices, they
also serve historically as representational terrains that narrate the Nation and its races. Through dance workshops,
New York City fieldtrips, and ethnographic experience, we will explore how music and dance contest such ideo-
logical formulations. The second part of the semester concentrates on the United States and on how these expres-
sive practices function within the diaspora. For instance, how does rumba or salsa simultaneously reinforce and/
or deconstruct U.S. Latina/o identity in relationship to class, race, gender, and a shared history of colonization
and neo-colonialism? Can Hip-Hop serve as a theoretical ground to question the stability of the Nation, gender,
race and sexuality?
Format: discussion. Requirements: two oral presentations, one short essay, one midterm paper, one final paper,

Via the critical analysis of select musical, cinematic, literary, and popular media texts, we will investigate the
primary approaches to the study of popular expression and identity, with particular emphasis on Latina/o popular
cultural production. This course will focus on the following questions: How is Latina/o identity expressed
through the "popular" or the everyday? In which ways does the study of Latina/o popular culture illuminate our
understanding of the Latina/o community's history and culture? What methodologies or theoretical approaches
are best suited to the analysis of the "here and now"? Employing a broad range of current Cultural Studies theo-
ries and methods, students will conduct an original semester-long research project and complete various ethno-
graphic exercises in this analysis of the historical, socio-political, and artistic uses of popular culture among Lati-
nas/os.

This is an inter-disciplinary video production workshop that explores visual strategies to produce and re-produce

theoretical level, we will study performance as a practical, aesthetic and theoretical terrain, and as a historical site
that produces knowledge in its relationship to the politics and power of representation, culture and memory. We
will engage with various practices of documenting performance such as visual anthropology, docu-drama, eth-
nographic surrealism, dance for the camera, and other experimental approaches. In addition to the discussion of
assigned readings, students will attend weekly video/film screenings, produce their own videos, and critique oth-
er students' video projects. For their final projects, students will produce a video and write a final paper analyzing
the production process in relationship to the theoretical readings from the course.

The metaphor of "home" and idea of "belonging" bring insight to theories and investigations centered on com-
munity building and identity formation within and across national borders. These constructions give us an indi-
cation of what people value, what is worth fighting for, as well as what is considered expendable. Our objective
in this course is to interrogate constructions of home and belonging by studying how individuals, communities,
and nations are transformed by experiences of dislocation, migration, and renewed place-making. What are the
ways a sense of belonging shapes these identities and the investments made in these formations? Working with
ethnography, history, memoir, literature, critical essays, and documentary film, we will consider the personal and
political uses and meanings of memory, nostalgia, and imagination in "rooting" migrating subjects in place and
time. Among the many case studies we will examine are the politics of homeland among Cuban-Americans,
Native American and West Indian festive forms, and place-claiming and performativity among African Ameri-
cans.

Policymakers, scholars, the media, and others are increasingly describing the world as "global" and immigrant
groups as "transnational." Yet, this course will ask to what extent these are recent developments or historically
rooted phenomena. Similarly, the increasing popularity of the umbrella terms "Hispanic" and "Latina/o" can
mask widely divergent migration histories. In this course, we will develop the theoretical perspectives needed to
untangle a complicated web of differences and similarities in migration histories. We will then use these
migration histories to develop a comparative analysis of the experiences of different Latina/o groups in the
United States. For example, how do we explain differences in socioeconomic status or political perspectives?
Our discussions will also address the emergence of Latina/o Studies as an interdisciplinary and comparative field
of study, as well as methods used in studying Latino and Latina history, specifically oral histories, government
documents, newspapers, and interdisciplinary approaches.

Leadership Studies focuses on the universal phenomenon of leadership in human groups. Leadership Studies
asks what leadership means within a wide variety of social contexts-whether in a family, a team, a theatre compa-
ny, a philanthropy, a university, a multinational corporation, or a nation state waging war. It seeks to understand
the dynamics of the relationships between leaders and followers. It studies authority, power, and influence. It
seeks to grasp the bases of legitimacy that leaders claim, and followers grant, in all of these relationships.
Through a wide range of courses in the social sciences and the humanities, a number of questions are ad-
dressed through the curriculum. How have men and women defined leadership and what are the bases of lead-
ers' legitimacy in different historical contexts? How do leaders in different contexts emerge? Through tradition,
charisma, or legal sanction? How do different types of leaders exercise and maintain their domination? What are
the distinctive habits of mind of leaders in different historical contexts? What are the moral dilemmas that leaders
in different contexts face? What are the typical challenges to established leadership in different historical con-
texts? How does one analyze the experiences of leaders in widely disparate contexts to generate systematic com-
parative understandings of why history judges some leaders great and others failures. How and why do these
evaluations about the efficacy of leaders shift over time?
To meet the requirements of the concentration, students must complete one of the two sequences outlined
below (6 courses total).

LEAD 125(F,S) Power, Leadership and Legitimacy: An Introduction to Leadership Studies
(Same as Political Science 125)
Leadership has long been a central concept in the study of politics. Philosophers from Plato to Machiavelli have
struggled with the question of what qualities and methods are necessary for effective leadership. Social scientists
throughout the twentieth century have struggled to refine and advance hypotheses about leadership in the areas of
economics, psychology, and sociology. Nevertheless, despite all of this impressive intellectual effort, the study of
leadership remains a contested field of study precisely because universal answers to the major questions in lead-
ership studies have proven to be elusive. This course is designed to introduce students to many of the central
issues and debates in the area of leadership studies.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: a midterm and final exam and 2 short papers.

In the late-eighteenth century, two revolutions burst forth-they were the most striking and consequential events in
modern history, decisive turning-points that transformed society and politics. This course takes an
interdisciplinary approach to the study of the overarching ideas and visions of the sister revolutions. Through
works of literature, correspondence, political essays and speeches, we will seek to understand the fundamental
goals and accomplishments of both revolutions. Who were their leaders and according to what principles did
they govern? Did revolutionaries in France find a model in America for their Revolution? What is the meaning
of the "Terror" in France and what light does it shed on modern revolutionary movements? Why was the
American Revolution followed by decades of stability while the French Revolution bequeathed a turbulent
succession of failed governments? Have America and France continued to conceive of themselves as
revolutionary nations? We will read works by the following historians, novelists, and politicians: Rousseau,
Robespierre, Saint-Just, Michelet,Tocqueville, Victor Hugo, Edmund Burke, Thomas Paine, James Madison,
Alexander Hamilton, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, David B. Davis, and Hannah Arendt.

rating various theories of foreign policy into discussions of critical debates. The course also provides an anatomy
of the modern foreign policy establishment and a flavor of how institutional actors behave. Armed with this
understanding, students will learn how to be thoughtful consumers and critics. Finally, they will step into the
shoes of the advisor and produce policy recommendations for a series of contemporary dilemmas of American
foreign policy leaders.

enduring democratic political institutions while nevertheless failing to grapple with the wrenching issue of
slavery and the rights of women. In this course, we will explore the lives, ideas, and political leadership of these
men, most of whom belonged to the social elite of their day:Washington, Madison, Jefferson, Adams, Franklin,
and Hamilton. We will study in depth their superb writings, such as the correspondence between Madison and
Jefferson and between John Adams and his wife Abigail, and Madison's and Hamilton's Federalist essays. We
will also read recent interpretations of the founding generation by Gordon Wood, Joseph Ellis, Edmund Morgan,
Bernard Bailyn, and others.

LEAD 295(F) Leadership and Management
What are the differences between effective leaders and effective managers of complex organizations, or are they

namics or interdependencies between these elements? Finally, are there important distinctions between the fac-
tors required for success by leaders/managers in different domains, in different cultures, or of different genders?
In this course, we will wrestle with these questions by examining both successful and unsuccessful leadership
and management of complex organizations in a number of domains, potentially including business, non-profit,
higher education, government agencies, and others. Our primary means of doing so will be through case studies,
supplemented by readings from several noted leadership and management thinkers.
Format: seminar. Course requirements will include active class participation, several brief (1 page or less) re-
sponse papers, a short mid-term paper, and a longer final paper, which develops and analyzes a case of the stu-
dent's choice. This latter paper can be done individually or in groups of two.

In this seminar, we will focus on the leadership of some of the greatest American presidents--Washington, Jef-

LEGAL STUDIES (Div. II)
Chair, Professor LAWRENCE KAPLAN
Advisory Committee: Professors: JACKALL, JUST, KAPLAN, KASSIN**, NOLAN**, SHANKS. As-
sistant Professor: SINIAWER**. Visiting Assistant Professor: A. HIRSCH§§.
Legal Studies is an interdisciplinary program designed to give students a background and frameworks for
understanding the law as a means of regulating human behavior and resolving disputes among individuals,
groups, and governments. Emanating from a liberal arts tradition, and not specifically aimed at preparing stu-
dents for law school, this program provides the tools needed to think and argue critically about how laws work,
how they evolved in the course of history and in different parts of the world, how they are enforced, and how
they affect our everyday lives.
Legal Studies
­ 218 ­
The courses in this program address a wide range of subjects, including the philosophical, moral, historical,
social, and political underpinnings of law; the U.S. Constitution; law enforcement and other aspects of criminal
justice; methods of scientific proof; psychological influences on evidence, trials, and decision-making; cultural
perspectives and non-western legal traditions; and the use of law to regulate environmental policy. Courses are
taught by faculty in the Sciences, Social Sciences, and Humanities, whose work centers on legal processes, and
by visiting professors from various law schools.
THE CONCENTRATION
The concentration in legal studies consists of six courses, including an interdisciplinary introductory course,
four electives taken from at least two departments, and a senior seminar on a contemporary topic in the law.
Electives may vary from year to year according to course offerings. In addition, the program offers local, alumni,
and professional contacts for summer and WSP internships in a wide range of government and private law-re-
lated settings.
STUDY ABROAD
Students who choose to study abroad should consult with the Program Chair to insure that they can complete
the requirements. Studying abroad may provide exciting opportunities to learn about legal traditions and systems
other than those of the United States. Students should check with the Chair to be sure that courses taken abroad
will be counted toward completion of the Program.
REQUIRED COURSES
LGST 101(S) Processes of Adjudication
How are disputes resolved within social systems? Focusing on this question, this team-taught interdisciplinary
course presents different perspectives on trials and other methods of adjudicating crimes, settling matters of pub-
lic policy, and resolving civil disputes among individuals, groups, governments, and organizations. Topics to be
addressed include: the historical and Constitutional basis for the operation of the American court system and for
juries and jury trials; methods of gathering and evaluating evidence; the role of forensic science and technology;
alternative means of adjudication as seen in the function of administrative agencies; adjudication of disputes
across international boundaries; adversarial, inquisitorial, and consensus-building approaches to dispute resolu-
tion used in past and non-western cultures.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on two exams, a 10- to 15-page paper, and class participa-
tion.
Enrollment limit: 40.
This is an interdisciplinary course to be team-taught by faculty, from a variety of departments.
Hour: 1:10-3:50 W A. HIRSCH
LGST 401(S) Senior Seminar: The Legal Palette
The great jurist Oliver Wendell Holmes claimed that people trained in law rarely appreciate art: works of genius
would elude lawyers and judges because "their very novelty would make them repulsive." As Holmes implies,
in crucial respects law and art are opposites. Most significantly, the legal system aims at stability and reinforce-
ment of social norms whereas at least some art seeks to destabilize and challenge prevailing norms. What hap-
pens when these worlds collide? This course explores several legal battles involving art that raise profound ques-
tions. Are judges and juries equipped to determine the purpose or value of art? Do artists need the protection of
society or does society need protection from artists? The most crucial question, from the standpoint of this
course, concerns the capacity of our legal system to strike an appropriate balance between preserving the social
fabric and accommodating change. Does the inherent conservatism of the law inevitably impede the kind of free
expression necessary for a thriving democracy?
Format: seminar. Requirements: active class participation, several short papers, and a substantially longer final
paper.
Prerequisites: Legal Studies 101 and at least two Legal Studies electives, or permission of the instructor. Enroll-
ment limit: 25 (expected: 20-25). Preference will be given, in order of seniority, to students for whom this course
completes the Legal Studies concentration.

LINGUISTICS (Div. I)
Coordinator, Assistant Professor: NATHAN SANDERS
Assistant Professor: SANDERS. Mellon Post-Doctoral Fellow: HAUGEN.
Courses in linguistics enable students to explore language from a variety of perspectives: the internal work-
ings of language as a system of communication, the physical means by which speech is produced, the role of
language in society, the history of language groups and specific languages, and the applicability of scientific
knowledge about language to various human endeavors.
Linguistics offers neither a major nor a concentration, but its courses provide a solid grounding in formal
linguistics and complement study in several other disciplines: Anthropology, Philosophy, Computer Science,
Psychology, Cognitive Science, Sociology, English, Comparative Literature, and all the foreign languages.
Some departments and programs also count courses in linguistics towards credit for their majors or concentra-
tions. In particular, Anthropology majors can receive major credit for Linguistics 100, Asian Studies majors may
take linguistics courses to fulfill their three course qualification, German majors may receive major credit for a
linguistics course with the special permission of the department chair, and Cognitive Science concentrators can
take Linguistics 100 and 220 as electives.
Knowledge of foreign languages is helpful but not required for introductory linguistics courses.
LING 100(F) Introduction to Linguistics (Same as Anthropology 107)
This course provides a general introduction to the scientific study of language by means of systematic explora-
tion of the inherent similarities and surprising differences across human languages. Using actual data from real
languages, students will learn the basic methodology, important results, and major theoretical debates from vari-
ous subfields of linguistics, including phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, language change,
and sociolinguistics. Additional topics may include sign languages, language acquisition, the politics of lan-
guage, and animal communication.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: participation in discussions, weekly homework, one or two midterm
exams, and a final exam.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 40 (expected: 40). Preference given to students needing the course to satisfy
prerequisites for future courses or to fulfill requirements for a major or concentration; such students should con-
tact the instructor in advance to guarantee placement in the course.
Hour: 1:10-2:25 MR HAUGEN
LING 210(S) Articulatory and Acoustic Phonetics
In this course, students will learn to recognize, produce, describe, transcribe, and analyze speech sounds from
languages all over the world. We will explore the basic physics behind the way we produce speech sounds, the
acoustic properties of speech as a sound wave, and how these combine to create common patterns across langua-
ges. Throughout the course, students will learn the International Phonetic Alphabet (a standardized system for
phonetic transcription) and mathematical and computer techniques for rigorous phonetic analysis.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: participation in discussions, weekly homework, frequent quizzes, a
midterm exam, and a final project.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 40 (expected: 40). Preference given to students needing the course to satisfy

LING 230(F) Introduction to Logic and Sematics (Same as Philosophy 131) (Q)
This course is an introduction to both formal logic and the study of linguistic meaning. Throughout the course, a
formal system of logic will be developed, and its adequacy for describing linguistic meaning will be tested. Top-
ics to be covered include the meaning of words and sentences, first-order predicate logic, logical deduction, inter-
pretation and understanding, and pragmatics.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: participation in discussions, weekly homework, a midterm exam, and

LING 310(F) Phonology
Phonology is the study of sound patterns within and across languages. This course builds upon prior knowledge
of phonetic description and requires familiarity with the International Phonetic Alphabet. In this course, we will
develop, question, and improve upon formal descriptions for the internal structure of sounds and for the rules
governing their systematic behavior. Specific topics to be covered include distinctive feature theory, phonemes,
allophones, linear rules, rule ordering, opacity, morphology, autosegmental phonology, and current trends in pho-
nological theory.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: participation in discussions, weekly homework, a midterm exam, and
a final exam.
Prerequisites: Linguistics 100 or Linguistics 210. No enrollment limit (expected: 10).
Hour: 1:10-2:25 TF SANDERS
LING 340(S) Historical Linguistics
This course is an introduction to the study of how languages change over time. We will explore the regularity of
sound change and how this can be exploited via the comparative method to build viable hypotheses that recon-
struct the pronunciations of ancient languages. From these reconstructions, we will classify languages into rela-
ted families and uncover the limits of our ability to peer into the linguistic past. Though the primary focus of this
course is on sound change, syntactic and semantic change will also be covered.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: participation in discussions, weekly homework, a midterm exam, and
a final exam.
Prerequisites: Linguistics 100 or Linguistics 210. No enrollment limit (expected: 15).
Hour: 1:10-2:25 TF SANDERS
LING 360(S) Morphology
This course provides an introduction to linguistic morphology, covering the major concepts of, theoretical ap-
proaches to, and current issues in the literature on word-formation in human languages. Issues to be addressed
include the nature of word-hood; inflection and derivation; "piece"-based vs. "process"-based approaches to
morphology; paradigms; productivity; and the locus of morphology with respect to phonology and syntax. In
addition to discussion of the above theoretical issues, we will also be applying the principles of morphological
analysis to actual linguistic data from English as well as various other languages from around the world.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: participation in discussions, occasional homework, one or two mid-
term exams, an oral presentation, and a final project.

MAJOR
The major in Mathematics is designed to meet two goals: to introduce some of the central ideas in a variety of
areas of mathematics and statistics, and to develop problem-solving ability by teaching students to combine cre-
ative thinking with rigorous reasoning.
Students are urged to consult with the department faculty on choosing courses appropriate to an individualized
program of study.
REQUIREMENTS (nine courses plus colloquium)
Calculus (two courses)
Mathematics 104 Calculus II or an equivalent high school course
Mathematics 105 or 106 Multivariable Calculus
Except in unusual circumstances, students planning to major in mathematics should complete the
calculus sequence (Mathematics 103, 104, 105/106) before the end of the sophomore year, at the
latest.

with the prior permission of the department, a student may be allowed to satisfy the Senior Major Course
requirement in the junior year, provided that the student has completed three 300-level mathematics
courses before enrolling in the Senior Major Course (if it is a statistics seminar, one of the 300-level courses
may be replaced by Statistics 231).
Two electives from courses numbered 300 and above or Statistics 231.
Weekly participation as a senior in the Mathematics Colloquium, in which all senior majors present talks
on mathematical or statistical topics of their choice.
NOTES
In some cases, an appropriate course from another department may be substituted for one of the electives,
with prior permission of the Mathematics and Statistics Department. In any case, at least eight courses must be
taken in mathematics and statistics at Williams. These can, with prior permission, include courses taken away.
Students with transfer credit should contact the department about special arrangements.
APPLIED MATHEMATICS OR OTHER SCIENCES
Students interested in applied mathematics or other sciences should consider Mathematics 209, 210, 251, 305,
306, 315, 323, 342, 354, 361, 433, or Statistics 201, 231, 346, 442, and additional appropriate courses from out-
side Mathematics and Statistics, including possibilities such as Chemistry 301, Computer Science 256, Comput-
er Science 361, Economics 255, Physics 201, Physics 202, Physics 210 or more advanced physics courses. Stu-
dents interested in economics should consult the Economics Department.
BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Students interested in careers in business or finance should consider Mathematics 373, as well as courses in
statistics and related areas such as Statistics 101, 201, 231, 331, 344, 346, 442, 443. Since these courses address
different needs, students should consult with the instructors to determine which seem to be most appropriate for
individuals.
Mathematics and Statistics
­ 224 ­
ENGINEERING
Students interested in engineering should consider the courses for applied mathematics immediately above,
with Mathematics 209 and 305 especially recommended. Williams has exchange and joint programs with good
engineering schools. Interested students should consult the section on engineering near the beginning of the Bul-
letin and the Williams pre-engineering advisor for further information.
GRADUATE SCHOOL IN MATHEMATICS
Students interested in continuing their study of mathematics in graduate school should take Mathematics 301
and 312. Mathematics 302 and 324 are strongly recommended. Many of the 400-level courses would be useful,
particularly ones that involve algebra and analysis. Honors theses are encouraged. Reading knowledge of a for-
eign language (French, German, or Russian) is helpful.
STATISTICS AND ACTUARIAL SCIENCE
Students interested in statistics or actuarial science should consider Mathematics 341, Statistics 201, 331, 346,
442 and Economics 255. Additionally, students should consider taking some number of the actuarial exams giv-
en by the Society of Actuaries, which can constitute part of an honors program in actuarial studies (see section on
honors below).
TEACHING
Students interested in teaching mathematics at the elementary or secondary school level should consider
Mathematics 285, 313, 325, 381, Statistics 201 and practice as a tutor or teaching assistant. Winter study courses
that provide a teaching practicum are also highly recommended.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN MATHEMATICS/STATISTICS
The degree with honors in Mathematics/Statistics is awarded to the student who has demonstrated outstand-
ing intellectual achievement in a program of study which extends beyond the requirements of the major. The
principal considerations for recommending a student for the degree with honors will be: Mastery of core material
and skills, breadth and, particularly, depth of knowledge beyond the core material, ability to pursue independent
study of mathematics or statistics, originality in methods of investigation, and, where appropriate, creativity in
research.
An honors program normally consists of two semesters and a WSP (031) of independent research, culminat-
ing in a thesis and a presentation. Under certain circumstances, the honors work can consist of coordinated study
involving a regular course and one semester plus a WSP (030) of independent study, culminating in a "minithe-
sis" and a presentation. At least one semester should be in addition to the major requirements.
An honors program in actuarial studies requires significant achievement on four appropriate examinations of
the Society of Actuaries and giving a second colloquium talk. Written work is a possible component.
Highest honors will be reserved for the rare student who has displayed exceptional ability, achievement or
originality. Such a student usually will have written a thesis, or pursued actuarial honors and written a minithesis.
An outstanding student who writes a minithesis, or pursues actuarial honors and writes a paper, might also be
considered.
Prospective honors students are urged to consult with their departmental advisor at the time of registration in
the spring of the sophomore or at the beginning of the junior year to arrange a program of study that could lead to
the degree with honors. By the time of registration during spring of the junior year, the student must have re-
quested a faculty member to be honors advisor and must have obtained the department's approval of formal
admission to the honors program. Such approval depends on both the record and the promise of the applicant. It
is conditional on continuing progress.
The recommendation for honors is usually announced at theend of the spring term. Participation in the honors
program does not guarantee a recommendation for honors. The decision is based not only on successful comple-
tion of the honors program but also on the merit of the student's overall record in mathematics. If the student
completes the program during the fall or winter study, the decision may be announced at the beginning of the
spring term, conditional on continuing merit.
ADVANCED PLACEMENT
The Mathematics and Statistics Department attempts to place each student who elects a mathematics course in
that course best suited to the student's preparation and goals. The suggested placement in an appropriate calculus
course is determined by the results of the Advanced Placement Examination (AB or BC) if the student took one,
and any additional available information. A student who receives a 3, 4, or 5 on the BC examination is ordinarily
placed in Mathematics 106. A student who receives a 4 or 5 on the AB examination is ordinarily placed in Math-
ematics 105. A student who receives a 1 or 2 on the BC examination or a 2 or 3 on the AB examination is
ordinarily placed in Mathematics 104. Students who have had calculus in high school, whether or not they took
the Advanced Placement Examination, are barred from Mathematics 103 unless they obtain permission from the
instructor. A student who receives a 4 or 5 on the Statistics AP examination should consult the department for
placement. In any event, students registering for mathematics and statistics courses are urged to consult with
members of the department concerning appropriate courses and placement. In general, students are encouraged
to enroll in the most advanced course for which they are qualified: it is much easier to drop back than to jump
forward. The department reserves the right to refuse registration in any course for which the student is deter-
mined to be over-prepared.
GENERAL REMARKS
Divisional Requirements
All courses may be used to satisfy this requirement.
Mathematics and Statistics
­ 225 ­
Alternate Year Courses
Core courses Mathematics 301, 305, 312, and 315 are normally offered every year. Other 300-level courses
may be offered in alternate years. Senior seminars (400-level courses) are normally offered every two to four
years. Students should check with the department before planning far into the future.
Course Admission
Courses are normally open to all students meeting the prerequisites. Students with questions about the level at
which courses are conducted are invited to consult members of the department.
Course Descriptions
Descriptions of the courses in Statistics follow the descriptions of Mathematics courses. More detailed infor-
mation on all of the offerings in the department is available in the Informal Guide to Mathematics Courses at
Williams that can be obtained at the departmental office.
Courses Open on a Pass/Fail Basis
Students taking a mathematics or statistics course on a pass/fail basis must meet all the requirements set for
students taking the course on a graded basis.
With the permission of the department, any course offered by the department may be taken on a pass/fail
basis. Permission will not be given to mathematics majors to meet any of the requirements of the major or honors
degree on this basis. However, with the permission of the department, courses taken in the department beyond
those requirements may be taken on a pass/fail basis.
Study Abroad
Programs like the "Budapest Semester in Mathematics" are recommended for majors who wish to focus on
mathematics away. The department, though, normally accommodates students who select other study away pro-
grams. Majors typically take their core courses (analysis and algebra) at Williams, and sometimes select courses
away which (with prior approval) count as 300-level mathematics or statistics electives. The department offers its
core courses in both the fall and the spring to allow students to spend more easily a semester away.
Graduate School Requirements
An increasing number of graduate and professional schools require mathematics and statistics as a prerequi-
site to admission or to attaining their degree. Students interested in graduate or professional training in business,
medicine, economics, or psychology are advised to find out the requirements in those fields early in their college
careers.
MATHEMATICS COURSES
NOTE: STATISTICS COURSE LISTINGS FOLLOW THE MATHEMATICS COURSE LIST-
INGS.
MATH 101(F) Mathematical Analysis with Descriptive Statistics
This course is intended to develop quantitative skills for non-science majors. We will cover basic algebra from an
applied point of view, including working with formulas and solving for unknowns. We will investigate a variety
of ways to model real-world problems. For example, how many handshakes away are you from the president
and how is that related to a transportation network? We will cover basic finance, including loans and annuities.
Finally, we will also cover descriptive statistics, including data analysis, computing with mean/median/variance,
data display and contingency tables.
Format: lecture and computer lab. Evaluation will be based primarily on homework, quizzes and/or exams, and
computer projects.
Prerequisites: placement by a Quantitative Studies Counselor. Enrollment limit: (expected: 10).
Hour: 9:00-9:50 MWF O. BEAVER
MATH 102(F) Precalculus
This course prepares students for Mathematics 103, first semester calculus. The course begins with a brief review
of algebra followed by a thorough treatment of algebraic, logarithmic, and trigonometric functions from a graph-
ical, analytical and applied point of view.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on homework, quizzes, and/or exams.
Prerequisites: placement by a Quantitative Studies Counselor or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: (ex-
pected: 15).
Hour: 10:00-10:50 MWF S. JOHNSON
MATH 103(F,S) Calculus I (Q)
Calculus permits the computation of velocities and other instantaneous rates of change by a limiting process
called differentiation. The same process also solves "max-min" problems: how to maximize profit or minimize
pollution. A second limiting process, called integration, permits the computation of areas and accumulations of
income or medicines. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus provides a useful and surprising link between the
two processes. Subtopics include trigonometry, exponential growth, and logarithms. This is an introductory
course for students who have not seen calculus before. Students who have previously taken a calculus course
may not enroll in Mathematics 103 without the permission of instructor.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on homework, quizzes, and/or exams.
Prerequisites: Mathematics 102 (or demonstrated proficiency on a diagnostic test; see Mathematics 101). No
enrollment limit (expected: 30).

tion growth or pollution levels. Exponential and logarithmic functions and trigonometric and inverse functions
play an important role. This course is the right starting point for students who have seen derivatives, but not
necessarily integrals, before. Students who have received the equivalent of advanced placement of AB 4 or BC 3
may not enroll in Mathematics 104 without the permission of instructor. Students who have higher advanced
placement must enroll in Mathematics 105 or above.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on homework, quizzes, and/or exams.

MATH 105(F,S) Multivariable Calculus (Q)
Applications of calculus in mathematics, science, economics, psychology, the social sciences, involve several
variables. This course extends calculus to several variables: vectors, partial derivatives, multiple integrals. There
is also a unit on infinite series, sometimes with applications to differential equations. This course is the right
starting point for students who have seen differentiation and integration before. Students with the equivalent of
advanced placement of AB 4, BC 3 or above should enroll in Mathematics 105.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on homework, quizzes, and/or exams.
Prerequisites: Mathematics 104 or equivalent, such as satisfactory performance on an Advanced Placement Ex-
amination. No enrollment limit (expected: 45).

MATH 106(F) Multivariable Calculus (Q)
Applications of calculus in mathematics, science, economics, psychology, the social sciences, involve several
variables. This course extends calculus to several variables: vectors, partial derivatives and multiple integrals.
The goal of the course is Stokes Theorem, a deep and profound generalization of the Fundamental Theorem of
Calculus. The difference between this course and Mathematics 105 is that Mathematics 105 covers infinite series
instead of Stokes Theorem. Students with the equivalent of BC 3 or higher should enroll in Mathematics 106, as
well as students who have taken the equivalent of an integral calculus and who have already been exposed to
infinite series. For further clarification as to whether or not Mathematics 105 or Mathematics 106 is appropriate,
please consult a member of the math/stat department. Mathematics 106 satisfies any Mathematics 105 prerequi-
site. Credit will not be given for both Mathematics 105 and Mathematics 106.

MATH 209(S) Differential Equations and Vector Calculus (Q)
Historically, much beautiful mathematics has arisen from attempts to explain heat flow, chemical reactions, bio-
logical processes, or magnetic fields. A few ingenious techniques solve a surprisingly large fraction of the associ-
ated ordinary and partial differential equations. The mystical Pythagorean fascination with ratios and harmonics
is vindicated and applied in Fourier series and integrals. Integrating vectorfields over surfaces applies equally to
blood flow, gravity, and differential geometry. Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on problem
sets, hour tests, and a final exam.

MATH 211(F,S) Linear Algebra (Q)
Many social, political, economic, biological, and physical phenomena can be described, at least approximately,
by linear relations. In the study of systems of linear equations one may ask: When does a solution exist? When is
it unique? How does one find it? How can one interpret it geometrically? This course develops the theoretical
structure underlying answers to these and other questions and includes the study of matrices, vector spaces, linear
independence and bases, linear transformations, determinants and inner products. Course work is balanced be-
tween theoretical and computational, with attention to improving mathematical style and sophistication.

MATH 251(F,S) Discrete Mathematics (Q)
As a complement to calculus, which is the study of continuous processes, this course focuses on the discrete,
including finite sets and structures, their properties and applications. Topics will include basic set theory, infinity,
graph theory, logic, counting, recursion, and functions. The course serves as an introduction not only to these and
other topics but also to the methods and styles of mathematical proof.

MATH 301(F) Real Analysis (Q)
Real analysis is the theory behind calculus. It is based on a precise understanding of the real numbers, elementary
topology, and limits. Topologically, nice sets are either closed (contain their limit points) or open (complement
closed). You also need limits to define continuity, derivatives, integrals, and to understand sequences of func-
tions.

MATH 305(S) Applied Real Analysis (Q)
Real analysis or the theory of calculus--derivatives, integrals, continuity, convergence--starts with a deeper un-
derstanding of real numbers and limits. Applications in the calculus of variations or "infinite-dimensional calcu-
lus" include geodesics, harmonic functions, minimal surfaces, Hamilton's action and Lagrange's equations, opti-

MATH 312(S) Abstract Algebra (Q)
Algebra gives us the tools to solve equations. Sets such as the integers or real numbers have special properties
which make algebra work or not work according to the circumstances. In this course, we generalize algebraic
processes and the sets upon which they operate in order to better understand, theoretically, when equations can
and cannot be solved. We define and study the abstract algebraic structures called groups, rings and fields, as well
as the concepts of factor group, quotient ring, homomorphism, isomorphism, and various types of field exten-
sions.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on problem sets and exams.

The study of numbers dates back thousands of years, and is fundamental in mathematics. In this course, we will
investigate both classical and modern questions about numbers. In particular, we will explore the integers, and
examine issues involving primes., divisibility, and congruences. We will also look at the ideas of number and
prime in more general settings, and consider fascinating questions that are simple to understand, but can be quite
difficult to answer.
Evaluation will be based primarily on performance on homework, projects, and exams.

MATH 322(F) Differential Geometry (Q)
It is easy to convince oneself that the shortest distance from equatorial Africa to equatorial South America is
along the equator. This illustrates the fact that "straight lines" on a sphere are described by so-called great circles.
It is somewhat more difficult to describe the shortest path between two points on the surface of, for example, a
doughnut, reflecting the fact that a doughnut curves in space in a more complicated way than the sphere. Differ-
ential geometry is the mathematical language describing these curvature properties. We will learn this language
and use it to answer many interesting questions. For example, does it make sense to talk about a sphere with an
"imaginary" radius (it does), and what might the "straight lines" on such an object look like? Along the way, we
will develop all of the tools needed to begin the more advanced study of "Riemannian" geometry, which de-
scribes (among other things) Einstein's Relativity Theory. Topics: Curves in space, the Frenet-Serret Theorem,
(time permitting: the Fary-Milnor Theorem and the Isoperimetric Inequality), the first & second fundamental
forms, geodesics, principal/Gaussian/mean/normal curvatures, the Theorema Egregium, the Gauss-Bonnet for-
mula and Theorem, classification of closed and orientable surfaces, introduction to n-dimensional Riemannian
manifolds/metrics/curvature, applications in hyperbolic 3-space.

MATH 323(S) Applied Topology (Q)
In topology, one studies properties of an object that are preserved under rubber-like deformations, where one is
allowed to twist and pull, but one cannot tear or glue. Hence a sphere is considered the same as a cube, but
distinct from the surface of a doughnut. In recent years, topology has found applications in chemistry (knotted
DNA molecules), economics (stability theory), Geographic Information Systems, cosmology (the shape of the
Universe), medicine (heart failure), robotics and electric circuit design, just to name some of the fields that have
been impacted. In this course, we will learn the basics of topology, including point-set topology, geometric
topology and algebraic topology, but all with the purpose of applying the theory to a broad array of fields.

The historical roots of probability lie in the study of games of chance. Modern probability, however, is a
mathematical discipline that has wide applications in a myriad of other mathematical and physical sciences.
Drawing on classical gaming examples for motivation, this course will present axiomatic and mathematical
aspects of probability. Included will be discussions of random variables (both discrete and continuous),
distribution and expectation, independence, laws of large numbers, and the well-known Central Limit Theorem.
Many interesting and important applications will also be presented, including some from classical Poisson

Groups were first invented to study the patterns in geometric shapes. Most notably were the symmetry
groups of the Platonic solids, such as the cube and the dodecahedron. We extend and generalize these ideas
to higher dimensional polytopes, leading to the beautiful world of reflection groups. By discovering ele-
gant ways of moving between the worlds of (theoretical) algebra and (visual) geometry, problems in one
world can be solved using techniques in another. Concrete geometric examples will continually motivate
our ideas, as well as provide connections to topology, combinatorics, and physics.

MATH 419(S) Algebraic Number Theory (Q)
We all know that integers can be factored into prime numbers and that this factorization is essentially unique. In
more general settings, it often still makes sense to factor numbers into "primes," but the factorization is not neces-
sarily unique! This surprising fact was the downfall of Lamé's attempted proof of Fermat's Last Theorem in
1847. Although a valid proof was not discovered until over 150 years later, this error gave rise to a new branch of
mathematics: algebraic number theory. In this course, we will study factorization and other number-theoretic
notions in more abstract algebraic settings, and we will see a beautiful interplay between groups, rings, and fields.

STATISTICS COURSES
STAT 101(F,S) Elementary Statistics and Data Analysis (Q)
It is nearly impossible to live in the world today without being inundated with data. Even the most popular news-
papers feature statistics to catch the eye of the passerby, and sports broadcasters overwhelm the listener with
arcane statistics. How do we learn to recognize dishonest or even unintentionally distorted representations of
quantitative information? How are we to reconcile two medical studies with seemingly contradictory conclu-
sions? How many observations do we need in order to make a decision? It is the purpose of this course to devel-
op an appreciation for and an understanding of the interpretation of data. We will become familiar with the stan-
dard tools of statistical inference including the t-test, the analysis of variance, and regression, as well as explor-
atory data techniques. Applications will come from the real world that we all live in.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on performances on quizzes and exams.
Prerequisites: Mathematics 100/101/102 (or demonstrated proficiency on a diagnostic test; see Mathematics
100). Students who have had calculus, and potential Mathematics majors should consider taking Statistics 201
instead. Enrollment limit: 50 (expected: 40). Not open for major credit to junior or senior Mathematics majors.
Hour: 9:00-9:50 MWF First Semester: BOTTS
11:00-11:50 MWF Second Semester: BOTTS
STAT 201(F,S) Statistics and Data Analysis (Q)
Statistics can be viewed as the art (science?) of turning data into information. Real world decision-making,
whether in business or science is often based on data and the perceived information it contains. Sherlock Holmes,
when prematurely asked the merits of a case by Dr. Watson, snapped back, "Data, data, data! I can't make bricks
without clay." In this course, we will study the basic methods by which statisticians attempt to extract informa-
tion from data. These will include many of the standard tools of statistical inference such as the t-test, analysis of
variance and linear regression as well as exploratory and graphical data analysis techniques.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on performance on quizzes and exams.
Prerequisites: Mathematics 105 or equivalent. Students without any calculus background should consider Statis-
tics 101 instead. Enrollment limit: 45 (expected: 45).

STAT 341(F) Bayesian Statistics (Q)
The probability of an event can be defined in two ways: (1) the long-run frequency of the event, or (2) the belief
that the event will occur. Classical statistical inference is built on the first definition given above, while Bayesian
statistical inference is built on the second. This course will introduce the student to methods in Bayesian statistics.
Topics covered include: prior distributions, posterior distributions, conjugacy, and Bayesian inference in single-
parameter, multi-parameter, and hierarchical models. The computational issues associated with each of these
topics will also be discussed.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based on homework and exams.
Prerequisite: Statistics 201 and Mathematics 211, or permission of instructor. No enrollment limit (expected: 10).
Hour: 11:00-11:50 MWF BOTTS
STAT 346(S) Regression and Forecasting (Q)
This course focuses on the building of empirical models through data in order to predict, explain, and interpret
scientific phenomena. The main focus will be on multiple regression as a technique for doing this. Through no
fault of its own, regression analysis has perhaps the most used of all data analysis methods. We will study both
the mathematics of regression analysis and its applications, including a discussion of the limits to such analyses.
The applications will range from predicting the quality of a vintage of Bordeaux wine from the weather to fore-
casting stock prices, and will come from a broad range of disciplines.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on performance on the project, homework, and exams.
Prerequisites: Statistics 101 or 201, and Mathematics 105 and 211; or permission of instructor. No enrollment
limit (expected: 15).

STAT 442T(S) Computational Statistics and Data Mining (Q)
In both science and industry today, the ability to collect and store data can outpace our ability to analyze it.
Traditional techniques in statistics are often unable to cope with the size and complexity of today's data bases and
data warehouses. New methodologies in Statistics have recently been developed, designed to address these
inadequacies, emphasizing visualization, exploration and empirical model building at the expense of traditional
hypothesis testing. In this course we will examine these new techniques and apply them to a variety of real data
sets using Silicon Graphics workstations.
Evaluation will be based primarily on homeworks and projects.

It is strongly recommended that prospective majors complete 103, 104, 201, 202 and 207 by the end of the
sophomore year.
Performance and Concert Requirements
Music majors are encouraged to participate in departmental ensembles throughout their careers at Williams;
i.e., for eight semesters. Majors are required to participate in departmental ensembles for at least four semesters.
Under special circumstances the student may petition the music faculty to allow this requirement to be met in an
alternative way.
Foreign Languages
Music majors are strongly urged to take courses in at least one foreign language while at Williams.
Musicianship Skills
Music majors are strongly urged to maintain, refine and improve their musicianship skills, such as sight-sing-
ing, score reading, melodic and harmonic dictation, and keyboard proficiency, throughout their entire Williams
career.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN MUSIC
Three routes toward honors and highest honors are possible in the Music major:
a. Composition: A Composition thesis must include one major work completed during the senior year, a port-
folio of smaller works completed during the junior and senior years, and a 10- to 15-page discussion of the
student's work or analysis of a major 20th Century work.
b. Performance: A Performance thesis must include an honors recital given during the spring of the senior
year and a 15- to 20-page discussion of one or more of the works performed. The student's general perfor-
mance career will also be considered in determining honors.
Music
­ 233 ­
c. History, Theory and Analysis, or Ethnomusicology: A written Historical, Theoretical/Analytical, or Ethno-
musicological thesis between 65 and 80 pages in length and an oral presentation based on the thesis is
required. A written thesis should offer new insights based on original research.
To be admitted to the honors program, a student must have at least a 3.3 GPA in Music courses (this GPA
must be maintained in order to receive honors), and have demonstrated ability and experience through course-
work and performance in the proposed thesis area. A 1- to 2-page application to the honors program, written in
consultation with a faculty member, must be made to the chair of Music before or during spring registration in
the junior year.
Honors candidates must enroll in Music 493(F)-W31-494(S) during their senior year. A student who is highly
qualified for honors work, but who, for compelling reasons, is unable to pursue a year-long project, may petition
the department for permission to pursue a thesis over one semester and the winter study term. If granted, the
standards for evaluating the thesis in such exceptional cases would be identical to those that apply to year-long
honors projects. Final submission of the thesis must be made to the Music Department by April 15 of the senior
year. The department's decision to award honors will be based on the quality of the thesis.
LESSONS
Courses involving individual vocal or instrumental instruction involve extra fees which are subsidized by the
department. (See Music 251-258 and Studies in the Musical Art 325, 326, 427, 428). For further information
check the Music Department webpage and contact the Department of Music.
STUDY ABROAD
Music majors considering study abroad should meet with the department chair well in advance in order to
determine whether it will be possible to complete the requirements for the major. Study abroad courses are not
accepted as substitutes for the specific required major courses. However, they may qualify as electives toward the
major if approved by the department.

MUS 101(F) Listening to Music: An Introduction
Intended for non-major students with little or no formal training.
When you listen to music--on the radio, on a CD, at a concert--how much do you really hear? This course has
two goals: to refine listening skills, thus increasing the student's understanding and enjoyment of music, while at
the same time providing a survey of the major composers and musical styles of the Western classical repertory to
be encountered in concert halls today. Students will be introduced to music from the Baroque, Classical, Roman-
tic, and Modern periods, including works by composers such as Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Brahms, Mahler, and
Stravinsky. Genres to be covered include the symphony, chamber music, opera, song, and choral music. Atten-
dance at selected concerts on campus required.
Evaluation will be based on two quizzes, two tests, two concert reports, and a final exam.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 40 (expected: 30).
Hour: 10:00-10:50 MWF M. HIRSCH
MUS 102(F) Fundamentals of Music (W)
This course seeks to define and describe the fundamental nature of music in Western society. Through a variety
of exercises and projects, students will develop an understanding of basic musical rudiments such as pitch, scales,
triads, rhythm, meter, and notation materials that form the foundation of Western art and popular musics. By the
end of the course, students will have begun the study of basic four-part harmony. In addition, students will
explore various topics such as philosophies of music (including aesthetics), music cognition and perception,
popular musics, and acoustics, and their relationships to defining the "fundamentals" of music. Students will be
expected to complete weekly argumentative papers reacting to the various philosophical readings; as the
semester progresses, these reaction papers will increase in both length and depth, in preparation for a final project
of each student's choice. Students will receive frequent and detailed critiques (either in the form of written
comments or verbal discussions) of each writing assignment.The course has a musicianship component: students
Music

MUS 103(F) Music Theory and Musicianship I
Music 103 and 104 are designed for potential majors and for students with strong instrumental or vocal back-
grounds. Although there is no prerequisite for Music 103, students are expected to have some knowledge of musi-
cal rudiments, reading proficiency in at least one clef, and ideally have some comfort reading both bass and
treble clefs. A short diagnostic exam will be administered at the first class meeting of Music 103 to assess stu-
dents' skills and background, and determine if a student requires any additional remedial work to complement
and fortify course work during the early weeks of the semester. Students with a strong background in music
theory may take a placement exam during First Days to see whether they can pass out of one or both semesters.
Music 103 and 104 are required for the music major.
Music 103 presents the materials, structures and procedures of tonal music, with an emphasis on the harmonic
and contrapuntal practice of the baroque and classical periods (ca. 1650-1825).
Music 103 explores triadic harmony, voice leading, and counterpoint with an emphasis on the chorale style of
J.S. Bach and his predecessors. Keyboard harmony and figured bass exercises, sight singing, dictation, analysis
of repertoire, written exercises and emulation projects will develop both an intellectual and an aural understand-
ing of music of the period. Projects include the harmonization of chorale melodies, the arrangement of classical
period minuets and the composition of a dice game minuet.
Format: lecture two days a week; a conference meeting one day a week; ear training/musicianship skills lab
meeting twice a week. Evaluation will be based on weekly written work, written and keyboard quizzes, and
midyear and final projects. Must be taken as a graded course.
Enrollment limit: 15 lecture (expected: 30-32). Preference to most competent on day-one diagnostic exam.

MUS 104(S) Music Theory and Musicianship I
Music 104 continues the practical musicianship work of Music 103, while expanding the scope of harmonic
topics to include seventh chords and chromatic harmony. Music 104 further explores the transformation of cho-
rale harmony in contrapuntal works of the eighteenth century. Projects include the composition and performance
of preludes, fugues and organ chorale preludes on baroque models.
Format: lecture two days a week; a conference meeting one day a week; ear training/keyboard skills lab meeting
twice a week. Evaluation will be based on weekly written work, written and keyboard quizzes, and midyear and
final projects. Must be taken as a graded course.

MUS 108(S) The Concerto
More than any other instrumental genre in music, the concerto by its nature tells stories. As in opera, the concerto
focuses on a protagonist, usually a single soloist; the interest of the work lies in the dynamic interplay of that
individual with members of the group with whom s/he engages. This course will explore the development of the
concerto starting with its first appearance in 17th century Italy through the 20th century. We will focus on the
musical means by which composers from a wide range of styles--Baroque, Classical, Romantic, and Mod-
ern--created compelling musical narratives. We will also dwell on the cultural context within which concerti are
composed and performed, with particular attention to the persona of the virtuoso as exemplified by such figures
as Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Clara Schumann, Liszt, Paganini, Horowitz, and Marta Argerich. Works to be stud-
ied will include several concerti to be performed on campus by the Berkshire Symphony with professional and
student soloists.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation based on two papers (5-6 pages each), a midterm and a final, and on class
participation.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 25 (expected: 20). Preference given to those with a demonstrated interest in
music.

MUS 113(F) Free Music, Free Speech: Experimental Musics of the 1960s
This course examines the musical developments of the 1960s in relation to dominant social themes concerning
freedom of expression, racial and gender equality, youth counterculture, and social activism. Composers and
musicians of this decade aspired to greater expressive freedom by transgressing conventional genre distinctions
and exploring new sonic, textual, and electronic sources, furthermore presenting these soundscapes theatrically
in venues outside the traditional concert hall. What was the relationship of musical change to social change, and
to what extent did musical artists assume a social responsibility that brought these activities into closer associa-
tion? We will examine how composers and musicians in the United States and Europe talked about their music
and how they transformed their ideas into meaningful sonic practices. Examples are drawn from experimental
music (John Cage, Yoko Ono, Frank Zappa), free improvisation (Ornette Coleman, Scratch Orchestra, Sun Ra),
psychedelia (The Doors, Brian Wilson, Pink Floyd), and minimalism (La Monte Young, Terry Riley).
Format: lecture/discussion, two meetings per week. Evaluation based on two short papers and longer final paper.
No prerequisites or musical experience necessary. Enrollment limit: 12.

MUS 114(F) American Music
This lecture and discussion course focuses on American music in its cultural context. Students will explore a
range of issues concerning music's relation to national and ethnic identity, historical events, societal conflicts, and
philosophical, literary, and artistic movements. The class will study works from a variety of musical traditions:
e.g., Native American, religious, classical, patriotic, blues, jazz, folk, Broadway, rock, and rap.
Evaluation will be based on class participation, two short papers, a midterm exam, and a final exam.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 15). Preference to students with demonstrated interest in Amer-
ican Studies or Music.

MUS 118(S) Bach
Johann Sebastian Bach now enjoys the status of a cultural icon, transcending time and place. But who was Bach,
and why do his musical creations continue to fascinate us? This course offers an introduction to the life and
music of this iconic composer. We will explore aspects of cultural context (such as the social milieu in which
Bach developed his art and the use and perception of his music by his contemporaries), as well develop our
listening skills by exploring matters of purely musical content (the styles and forms of his prodigious oeuvre).
Both instrumental and vocal music will be surveyed, including the Brandenburg Concerti, the Goldberg Varia-
tions, the Magnificat, and the B Minor Mass. The course will conclude with a consideration of Bach's legacy in
the 19th and 20th centuries.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on 2 papers, a midterm, a final exam, and class participation.

MUS 122(S) African-American Music (Same as Africana Studies 122)*
This course will survey the history of African-American music in the United States from its beginnings through
the mid-twentieth century. Focus on the following themes: the survival of Africanisms in African-American mu-
sic, the relationship of African-American music in the U.S. to the music of Africa and the African diaspora, the
process of acculturation, and the sociological study of African-American music in the U.S.
There will be an emphasis on discussing music, listening to it, watching videotaped performances, and attending
concerts of live music for which there will be additional costs. Evaluation: 2 hour exams, final exam, and 3 con-
cert reviews.
No prerequisites, but students without musical backgrounds must learn a vocabulary of terms for describing mu-
sical sound. Enrollment limit: 20. If more than 20 students enroll, priority will be given to Africana Studies ma-
jors, music majors, and seniors.

MUS 124(S) The Singing Voice: Mechanics, History and Meaning
Why does an opera singer sound different from a rock singer? Why can't one convincingly sing in the style of the
other? And why is the former granted a higher status and the latter a wider audience? This course examines the
physiological and acoustical properties of singing and explores the varieties of singing style and function

and representative musical cultures and genres. In each section of the course, aspects of cultural context (includ-
ing music's function in religious life and its relationship to the other arts), will be emphasized. While our focus
will be on the traditional and classical musics of these cultures, we will also briefly consider the current musical
scene. Encounters with this music will include attendance at live performances when possible.

MUS 134(S) Myth in Music (Same as Comparative Literature 134) (W)
Orpheus, Prometheus, Faust, and Don Juan--these figures have captured the imagination of writers, artists, and
composers throughout history. This course explores how prominent myths of western civilization have found
expression in a broad variety of musical works, e.g., operas by Claudio Monteverdi, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart,
Hector Berlioz, Jacques Offenbach, and Carl Orff; songs by Johann Friedrich Reichardt, Franz Schubert, Robert
Schumann, and Hugo Wolf; ballets by Ludwig van Beethoven and Igor Stravinsky; symphonic poems by Franz
Liszt and Richard Strauss; Broadway musicals by Richard Adler (Damn Yankees, 1955), John Maxwell Taylor
(Faustorama, 1993), and Randy Newman (Faust, 1993); and mixed-media projects by Libby Larsen (Franken-
stein, or the Modern Prometheus, 1990), Manfred Stahnke (Orpheus Kristall, 2001), and Rinde Eckert (Orpheus
X, 2006). In studying such works, we will probe an array of questions, including: Why have certain myths prov-
en especially appealing to composers? What accounts for their musical longevity? How have myths been adapt-
ed to different musical genres and styles, and for what purpose(s)? How do the works reflect the historical cul-
tures in which they originated? How have they engaged with different social, political, artistic, and intellectual
concerns?
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, three 7- to 8-page papers (with revi-
sions), and a final presentation.

MUS 246T(F) The Tale of Carmen, 1845-2007 (W)
The story of the gypsy femme fatale Carmen has endured for over 150 years. In Western culture she exemplifies
the seductive, exotic, independent and forbidden female who drives an upstanding man to a life of crime and
finally murder. This course explores a broad array of treatments of this archetypal narrative, starting with Prosper
Mérimée's 1845 novella on which Bizet based his beloved 1875 opera Carmen. We will consider various staged
and film versions of the opera itself, including Francesco Rosi's stunning 1984 movie, and discuss various other
film transformations of the story, from DeMille's 1915 silent film through Hammerstein's 1954 all-black musical
Carmen Jones, to the MTV version A Hip Hopera of 2004. Comic approaches will also be assessed, from Char-
lie Chaplin's Carmen Burlesque of 1915 through Spike Jones' 1952 Carmen Murdered! and The Naked Carmen
of 1970. We will analyze re-castings of Bizet's famous score in instrumental music since 1875, and explore re-
markable dance interpretations ranging from Carlos Saura's 1983 flamenco version through David Bourne's
choreography in his 2001 gay reading called The Car Man. Our ultimate purpose will be to probe the ways in
which this powerful narrative and the music it inspired have lent themselves to multifaceted textual and musical
constructions of individual and group identities, encompassing gender and sexuality, "Otherness," nationality,
ethnicity, and class.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: After initial group meetings to discuss Mérimée's novella and Bizet's music,
students will meet with the instructor in pairs for one hour each week. Each student will write a 5- to 6-page essay
every other week (five in all), and provide peer reviews in alternate weeks. Evaluation will be based on the quali-
ty of written work, discussions, and oral presentation.
No prerequisites; ability to read music useful but not necessary. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Preference

400-LEVEL COURSES
MUS 402(S) Senior Seminar in Music: The Music of Bela Bartok
Béla Bartók's activities-as a composer, a comparative musicologist, a performer, a music editor, an essayist-place
him at the center of many intersecting trends and issues prevalent in the early twentieth century (e.g. the rise of
nationalism, consciousness of tonality's decline, anxiety about musical `progress' and the search for new means
of musical organization). The course will consider Bartók's music in the light of his many activities, and as a lens
through which we can explore both the music that shaped his development (music of Brahms, Strauss, Debussy,
Ravel, Beethoven quartets, seventeenth-century Italian keyboard music) and the musical developments that he
influenced (music of Messiaen, Lutoslawski, his influence on Jazz). We will employ a variety of means to gain
insights into Bartók's work, including the exploration of Hungarian folk repertoire through transcription exer-
cises, examination of manuscript drafts, consideration of Bartók's own writings about music, and so on.
Format: seminar. Evaluation based on papers, projects, presentations, and class participation.
Prerequisites: Music 202, 207, 208, 209 and permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: all senior music majors.

Neuroscience is a rapidly growing interdisciplinary field concerned with understanding the relationship be-
tween brain, mind, and behavior. The interdisciplinary nature of the field is apparent when surveying those who
call themselves neuroscientists. Among these are anatomists, physiologists, chemists, psychologists, philoso-
phers, computer scientists, linguists, and ethologists. The areas that neuroscience addresses are equally diverse
and range from physiological and molecular studies of single neurons, to investigations of how systems of neu-
rons produce phenomena such as vision and movement, to the study of the neural basis of complex cognitive
phenomena such as memory, language, and consciousness. Applications of neuroscience research are rapidly
growing and include the development of drugs to treat neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease
and Parkinson's disease, the development of noninvasive techniques for imaging the human brain such as PET
scans and MRI, and the development of methods for repair of the damaged human brain such as the use of brain
explants. Combining this wide range of disciplines, areas of research, and application for the study of a single
remarkably complex organ--the brain--requires a unique interdisciplinary approach. The Neuroscience Pro-
gram is designed to provide students with the opportunity to explore this approach.
THE PROGRAM
The program in neuroscience consists of five courses including an introductory course, three electives, and a
senior course. In addition, students are required to take two courses, Biology 101 and Psychology 101, as part of
the program.
Neuroscience (Neuroscience 201) is the basic course and provides the background for other neuroscience
courses. Ideally, this will be taken in the sophomore year. Either Biology 101 or Psychology 101 serves as the
prerequisite. Electives are designed to provide in-depth coverage including laboratory experience in specific
areas of neuroscience. At least one elective course is required in Biology (Group A) and one in Psychology
(Group B). The third elective course may also come from Group A or Group B, or may be selected from other
neuroscience related courses upon approval of the advisory committee. Topics in Neuroscience (Neuroscience
401) is designed to provide an integrative culminating experience. Students take this course in the senior year.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN NEUROSCIENCE
The degree with honors in Neuroscience provides students with the opportunity to undertake an original re-
search project under the supervision of one or more of the Neuroscience faculty. In addition to completing the
requirements of the Neuroscience Program, candidates for an honors degree must enroll in Neuroscience
493-W31-494 and write a thesis based on an original research project. Presentation of a thesis, however, should
not be interpreted as a guarantee of a degree with honors. Students interested in pursuing a degree with honors
should contact the Neuroscience Advisory Committee in the spring of their junior year.

NSCI 401(F,S) Topics in Neuroscience
Neuroscientists explore issues inherent in the study of brain and behavior. The overall objective of this seminar is
to create a culminating senior experience in which previous course work in specific areas in the Neuroscience
Program can be brought to bear in a synthetic, interdisciplinary approach to understanding complex problems.
The specific goals for students in this seminar are (1) to evaluate original research and critically examine the
experimental evidence for theoretical issues, and (2) to gain an understanding of this discipline through group
work and oral presentations. Topics and instructional formats will vary somewhat from year to year, but in all
cases the course will emphasize an integrative approach in which students will be asked to consider topics from a
range of perspectives including molecular, cellular, systems, behavioral and clinical neuroscience. Previous top-
ics have included autism, depression, alcoholism, stress, neurogenesis, novel neuromodulators, retrograde mes-
sengers, and synaptic plasticity.
Format: student-led discussions and presentations, three hours a week. Evaluation will be based on presentations,
participation in class discussion, and a term paper.
Prerequisites: open only to seniors in the Neuroscience program. Enrollment limit: 12 (expected: 12).
This course is required of all senior students in the Neuroscience program.

NSCI 493(F)-W31-494(S) Senior Thesis
Independent research for two semesters and a winter study under the guidance of one or more neuroscience
faculty. After reviewing the literature in a specialized field of neuroscience, students design and conduct an origi-
nal research project, the results of which are reported in a thesis. Senior thesis work is supervised by the faculty
participating in the program.
PERFORMANCE STUDIES

The Performance Studies Program provides an opportunity to inhabit an intellectual place where the making
of artistic and cultural meaning intersects with critical reflection on those processes. The program has as its pri-
mary goal the bringing together of those students and faculty engaged in the creative arts, i.e., studio art, creative
writing, dance, film and video, music, and theater with those departments that reflect in part on those activities,
e.g., Anthropology and Sociology, Art History, Classics, Comparative Literature, English, History, Music, Phi-
losophy, Psychology, Religion and Theatre. The central ideas which performance studies confronts-action, body,
frame, representation, race, ethnicity, gender, politics, history and transcultural experience-circulate within and
through the subjects and fields upon which the program draws.
Performance Studies strongly suggests that interested students take the introductory course (LATS 230) and
one of several recommended upper level courses (LATS 330, LATS 375, AFR 400 or ARTH 408).
Currently, the Program's status is as a program without a concentration. However, students interested in par-
ticipating in the Performance Studies Program are encouraged to do five things: 1) take the introductory course,
which in 2007-08 is LATS 230, Approaching Performance Studies; 2) take an advanced course which utilizes
critical theory in relation to performance, such as LATS 331, Sound and Movement in the Diaspora: Afro-Lat-
in Identities; LATS 375, Performance and Its Traces; AFR 400, Race, Gender, Space; or ARTH 408, Contem-
porary Performance Art History: Space, Time, Action; 3) try different artistic media, both in the curriculum and
beyond; 4) move between the doing of art and performance and thinking about that process; and 5) prepare a
portfolio of their work in different media.
Performance Studies, Philosophy

As a senior year project, the Performance Studies Program strongly recommends the assembling of a senior
portfolio. Preparation of the portfolio should normally begin in the second semester of the junior year. It will be
done under the supervision of a member of the advisory faculty and will be submitted in the spring of the senior
year. What we suggest is that portfolios should draw on at least four projects or productions. They should show
critical self-reflection on the creative processes, a comparison of the artistic media employed and also demon-
strate performance criticism on the work of others.

PHILOSOPHY (Div. II)
Chair, Professor JANA SAWICKI
Professors: GERRARD*, SAWICKI, WHITE. Associate Professors: CRUZ*, DUDLEY, MLADENOV-
IC. Assistant Professors: BARRY**, MCPARTLAND. Visiting Assistant Professor: J. PEDRONI,

To engage in philosophy is to ask a variety of questions about the world and our place in it. What can we
know? What should we do? What may we hope? What makes human beings human? These questions, in vari-
ous forms, and others like them are not inventions of philosophers; on the contrary, they occur to most people
simply as they live their lives. Many of us ask them as children, but later either ignore them, or accept answers we
can live with. Philosophers, however, seek to keep such questions open, and to address them through reasoned
discussion and argument, instead of accepting answers to them based on opinion or prejudice.
The program in philosophy is designed to aid students in thinking about these issues, by acquainting them
with influential work in the field, past and present, and by training them to grapple with these issues themselves.
The program emphasizes training in clear, critical thinking and in effective writing. Philosophy courses center
around class discussions and the writing of interpretive and critical essays.
MAJOR
Philosophy is a discipline with a long and intricate history, a history that remains an integral part of the disci-
pline. In this way, it differs dramatically from the natural sciences: for example, although no contemporary physi-
cists or biologists embrace Aristotle's physics or biology, among philosophers there continue to be champions of
Aristotle's metaphysics and of his ethics. Because of the richness and continuing importance of the history of
philosophy, the program is designed to give majors a historical background that will acquaint them with a wide
variety of approaches in philosophical issues, and will provide them with a basis for evaluating and contributing
to contemporary debates.
A total of nine courses is required for the major in Philosophy. Students should begin with Philosophy 101
and 102, in either order; both are required for the major. These courses provide introductions to historical figures
and themes that continue to be influential in many contemporary discussions in the two major areas of philo-
sophical inquiry, i.e., practical inquiry into issues of ethics and politics, and theoretical inquiry into issues of
knowledge, belief, understanding, and reality. The final required course is the Senior Seminar, Philosophy 401.
Each student selects the six electives that complete the major. The exposure to figures and topics in 101 and 102
provides students with some basis for choice, but optimal shaping of an individual curriculum requires in addi-
tion consultation with faculty members and other students.
Generally speaking, as students progress from 100- to 300-level courses, there will be decreasing breadth and
increasing depth. In addition, writing assignments become longer, and students assume increasing responsibility
for identifying and developing the topics of their essays. Finally, students in 300-level courses are often required
to assume responsibility for making oral presentations or guiding significant parts of class discussions.
Students considering graduate study in philosophy are strongly urged to develop reading competence in Ger-
man, French, or Greek before graduation.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN PHILOSOPHY
The degree with honors in Philosophy is awarded to the student who has demonstrated outstanding achieve-
ment in a program of study that extends beyond the requirements of the major. The extension beyond major
requirements may take the form either of independent work culminating in a senior essay or thesis (the indepen-
dent-study route) or of additional course work (the directed-study route). Candidates must have GPAs of 3.6 or
Philosophy
­ 245 ­
higher in their courses in philosophy at the end of the junior and senior years. Juniors interested in pursuing
honors should so inform the Department Chair no later than mid-April.
The independent-study route to honors requires the completion and defense of either a senior essay produced
in the fall semester plus winter study period (maximum 40 pages) or a year-long senior thesis (maximum 75
pages). Plans for either essay or thesis (including a brief proposal and bibliography, worked out in consultation
with an advisor) must be submitted to the department in April of the junior year. A recommendation for gradua-
tion with honors will be made on the basis of the thoroughness, independence, and originality of the student's
work.
The directed-study route to honors required the completion of two courses in philosophy in addition to the
nine required for the major. Candidates taking this route must also submit to the department revised copies of two
term papers (10 pages or longer) written for philosophy courses they have taken; each student will be assigned an
adviser to help guide the process of revision. A recommendation for graduation with honors will be made on the
basis of the scope of the student's course work, the quality of the student's participation in Philosophy 401, and
the thoroughness, independence, and originality reflected in the submitted papers.
PHIL 101(F,S) Introduction to Moral and Political Philosophy (W)
Throughout the history of Western philosophy, there have been debates concerning how human beings should
live: What should we do both with our lives as wholes and in specific problematic situations? The debates have
addressed us both as individuals and as members of political communities. This course aims to aid us in respond-
ing to these debates, and in living our lives, on the basis of reasoned conclusions rather than from unrecognized
presuppositions. The course concentrates on Plato's Republic, the most influential ethical and political text within
Western philosophy, but we assess the Republic in light of elaborations and criticisms that have developed over
the past 2500 years, in works by Aristotle, Kant, and Mill.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: class discussion, frequent short papers (totaling 20-30 pages).
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 per section (expected: 19 per section). Preference given to first-year stu-
dents and sophomores.

PHIL 102(F,S) Introduction to Metaphysics and Epistemology (W)
Metaphysics and epistemology are the two core pursuits of theoretical philosophy (as opposed to practical phi-
losophy, the focus of Philosophy 101). Metaphysics is concerned with the ultimate character of reality. The meta-
physician seeks to develop knowledge (as opposed to mere opinion or belief) of all things natural, human, and
divine. She asks, for example: Are we free, or are our acts determined? Is there a God? If so, what must God be
like? Epistemology is concerned with how we determine the difference between knowledge and mere opinion.
The epistemologist thus asks: What does it mean truly to know something? How can we acquire such genuine
knowledge? Answers to these epistemological questions are essential if we are to have any confidence in the
methods and results of our metaphysical investigations. This course will emphasize the established historical
classics that provide the basis for understanding contemporary work on metaphysics and epistemological issues;
we will consider, among others, the work of Descartes, Hume, and Kant.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: class discussion, frequent short papers (totaling 20-30 pages).

PHIL 221(F) Greek Philosophy (Same as Classics 221) (W)
Alfred North Whitehead famously remarked that "the European philosophical tradition...consists of a series of
footnotes to Plato" (Process and Reality, 1929). To some extent, Whitehead was right. Contemporary discussions
in philosophy owe a great debt not only to Plato, but to the Ancient Greek philosophers in general. Many of the
central issues in Western philosophy have their origins in Ancient Greek philosophy --including issues about
free will and determinism, the status of human knowledge, and the nature of reality. Studying the Ancient Greek
philosophers thus allows us to better understand philosophy as an enterprise and to go deeper into the Western
intellectual tradition. The Ancient Greek philosophers are also fascinating in their own right. Zeno tries to con-
vince us that we cannot touch the wall that is five feet away from us. Anaxagoras proposes the existence of a
material substance that "contains everything". Plato argues that we never really learn, but only remember. Aris-
totle tries to make sense of how we are both material and sentient beings. And the Stoics argue that, even if fated,
our actions can be effective. In this course, we will investigate what the Greeks were doing when they claimed to
practice "philosophia". We will start with the "Pre-Socratics" who were active in the Mediterranean world of 4th
and 5th c. BCE. We will study some of Plato's dialogues, which feature Socrates as philosophical protagonist.
We will grapple with Aristotle's views on reality and on the soul. And we will look at developments in Hellenis-
tic philosophy (e.g. Stoicism, Skepticism, and Epicureanism). Our main focus will be on questions concerning
reality, knowledge and the soul.

PHIL 226(F) Big Games: The Spiritual Significance of Sports (Same as Religion 279)
Sports matter beyond all apparent reason. They are children's games, yet grip adults. They serve as entertain-
ment, yet are taken most seriously. They demand physical excellence, yet drive athletes to injury and spectators
to become obese. The significance of contemporary sports is thus unquestionable, but it is also unexplained.
Diversion and fitness alone cannot begin to account for the extraordinary amounts of time, money, and emotion
invested in the playing, watching, and analysis of sports.
This course will attempt to comprehend the significance of sports by attending to their role as a source of three
distinctive forms of "spiritual" experience: patriotism, beauty, and divinity. We will consider the extent to which
the fundamental elements of contemporary sports (games, athletes, equipment, arenas, fans, and media) can be
interpreted as together comprising a complex phenomenon that provides opportunities for all participants to
share in these experiences. Throughout we will investigate actual examples, taken from particular sports, chosen
for their ability to illuminate different aspects of spiritual experience.
Format: lecture and discussion. Requirements: scheduled discussion groups once per week, quizzes, short writ-
ing assignments and a final exam.

PHIL 227(F) Death and Dying (W)
In this course we will examine traditional philosophical approaches to understanding death and related concepts,
with a special focus on the ethical concerns surrounding death and care for the dying. We will begin with ques-
tions about how to define death, as well as reflections on its meaning and function in human life. We will move
on to examine ethical issues of truth-telling with terminally ill patients and their families, decisions to withhold or
withdraw life-sustaining treatments, the care of seriously ill newborns, physician-assisted suicide, euthanasia,
and research efforts to extend the human life-span. In addition to key concepts of death, dying, and terminal
illness, we will develop and refine notions of medical futility, paternalism and autonomy, particularly within the
context of advance directives and surrogate decision making.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: active participation in class discussions, two mid-length papers (7-10
pages), and weekly short writing assignments (2 pages). Possible experiential learning component.

PHIL 236(S) Contemporary Ethical Theory (W)
Moral life is filled with difficult decisions. For instance, is it ever appropriate to sacrifice the welfare of an indi-
vidual for the sake of the community, or does each individual have an inviolable status that must be respected?
Philosophy
­ 247 ­
Are some actions so morally objectionable that they must never be done, even to promote very good ends? And
how centrally should moral considerations figure in our personal decision-making? Should they always take
priority, even at the expense of our personal projects and intimate relationships, or are there some spheres in
which we should be free to pursue our goals without concern for morality? Finally, should our moral regard
extend only to our fellow rational beings, or should it reach to non-human animals and the environment as well?
We will explore these and related questions by systematically comparing what the two dominant ethical theories
of the twentieth century, consequentialism and deontology, have had to say about them. While both theories find
their roots in earlier thinkers--consequentialism in Bentham and Mill, deontology in Kant--our focus will be on
contemporary developments of these views. After examining these two approaches in depth, we will turn our
attention to recently developed alternatives that attempt to transcend the dichotomies that continue to divide con-
sequentialist and deontological approaches. Readings will include works by the following authors: Bentham,
Mill, Nozick, Railton, Brink, Williams, Wolf, Taurek, Rawls, Smart, Scheffler, Nagel, Kant, Kamm, Quinn, Ka-
gan, Ross, Scanlon. This is a writing intensive course.

PHIL 273T(S) Hume's Treatise of Human Nature (W)
Hume's A Treatise of Human Nature, one of the greatest books in the history of philosophy, still exerts a consid-
erable influence on contemporary epistemology, metaphysics, philosophy of science, philosophy of action, eth-
ics and moral psychology. Unfortunately, the relevance of Hume's ideas and arguments for particular philosophi-
cal disciplines has too often led to a piece-meal reading of his work: the three books of Treatise ("Of the Under-
standing", "Of the Passions" and"Of Morals") are typically considered in isolation from one another. Epistemol-
ogists don't seem to think that Hume's account of human psychology, morality and taste can in any way illumi-
nate his treatment of skepticism and natural belief, while moral philosophers often neglect Hume's conclusions
about the limits of our knowledge in analyzing his conception of motivation, action, obligation and virtue. In
contrast with this interpretive tendency, this tutorial will focus on Hume's"science of human nature"--his overall
philosophical project in Treatise--and cultivate the discussion of different philosophical issues and arguments in
light of this general aim of the work as a whole.
We will start by situating Hume's project within the historical tradition in which he thought and against which
Treatise was directed; we will read Descartes, Locke, Berkeley and Newton, as well as some lesser known figu-
res. For clarification and discussion of the points made in Treatise, we will read parts of Hume's later works,
especially the two Enquiries. Throughout the course, our reading of Hume will be supplemented, on the one
hand, by historical and interpretive essays on his work, and on the other hand, by the works of contemporary
philosophers engaged in the problems and questions raised in Treatise. (For example, we will read some of the
present-day discussions of skepticism, causation, inductive inference, the self, nature of emotions, motivation
and action, virtues and moral obligation.) Throughout the course our focus will be on three broad issues: Hume's
conception of theoretical rationality, his conception of practical rationality, and his views about the role and rele-
vance of non-rational (on some readings, irrational) elements in a good life of a wise person.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: Each student will write a 5-page paper every second week, and comment on the
tutorial partner's paper on alternate weeks. In the last week of classes, all students will write a paper and com-
ment on the tutorial partner's paper.

PHIL 274T(F) Messing with People: The Ethics of Human Experimentation (W)
From the now infamous Tuskegee Syphilis Study and Stanley Milgram's Obedience experiments, to lesser
known but equally important landmarks in research ethics--such as the Willowbrook experiment, in which resi-
dents of a state home for mentally retarded children were intentionally infected with a virus that causes hepatitis,
Philosophy
­ 248 ­
and the Kennedy-Krieger Lead Abatement study, which tested the efficacy of a new, inexpensive lead paint re-
moval procedure by offering to low-income parents of young children reduced-rate housing in lead-abated units
and testing those children for lead exposure--in this sophomore tutorial we will closely examine a series of con-
temporary and historical cases of human experimentation (roughly, one case per week) with an eye toward eluci-
dating the moral norms that ought to govern human subjects research. A number of conceptual themes will
emerge throughout the course of the term, including notions of exploitation and coercion, privacy and confiden-
tiality, and the balance between public interests and individual rights. Specific issues will include the ethics of
placebo research, deception in research, studies of illicit/illegal behavior, genetic research, experimentation with
children, pregnant women and fetuses, and persons with diminished mental capacity, among other topics. Stu-
dents will meet with the professor in pairs for approximately one hour per week, writing and presenting 5- to
7-page essays every other week, and commenting orally on their partners' essays in alternate weeks.
Format: tutorial. Evaluations will be based on written work, on oral presentations of that work, and on oral cri-
tiques.

PHIL 290(S) The Philosophy and Economics of Higher Education (Same as INTR 290) (W)
Students compete ferociously for the opportunity to pay large sums of money for the privilege of attending Wil-
liams College. The value of the educational experience they receive is usually taken to be self-evident. Less ob-
vious, however, are the nature of education, and the factors that determine how much it costs, who has access to
it, and how successful it is.
This interdisciplinary seminar will explore both the philosophy and the economics of higher education. Which
purposes can and should college serve? Which curricular and extra-curricular programs best accomplish those
purposes? How can we measure and evaluate the effects of policies concerning college admission, pricing, and
financial aid? How can we assess and enhance educational productivity?
Students will read and discuss texts in the philosophy of education, while also learning to apply economic theory
and econometric techniques to the analysis of educational issues.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: Evaluation will be based upon the writing and revision of three
8-page papers, as well as the quality of contributions to class discussion.
Prerequisites: Economics 110 and at least one philosophy course.Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19).Preference
given to sophomores intending to or juniors majoring in either philosophy or economics.
Students will get credit for one philosophy course, which fulfills one-semester of the Division II requirement.

PHIL 300(S) Mute Witness: Disability, Gender, and Testimony (Same as Women's and Gender
Studies 300) (W)
Inspired by a 1994 film, Mute Witness, in which the lead character plays a mute makeup artist who witnesses a
murder and is not believed when she reports it, this course is an introduction to the philosophy of disability
through two critical approaches. One is through the concepts of gender and sexuality; the other is through an
epistemology of testimony.
"Philosophy of disability" expresses at least a two-fold concept. One focuses on the meaning of disability: what
does it mean to have a disability or to be disabled? The other focuses on the meaning of philosophy: what new
problems and concepts are raised by the phenomenon of disability? In other words, what does the experience of
disability reveal about traditional questions in philosophy such as What is the meaning of life (to be healthy)?
What is a good life (can disabled people have meaningful lives)? Who can know (can mentally disabled people
know legitimately)? Who can speak (are disabled people authoritative witnesses)?
Through this course you will be able to: 1) explain both the material and social construction of disability by
identifying and locating the myriad forces that have shaped various understandings and experiences of disability;
2) explain and demonstrate the intersectionality of race, gender, sexuality, and disability; 3) understand the rela-
tionship between embodiment and disability; 4) explain the existence of a dominant model of testimony in the
Western affluent world and its impact upon the disabled minority.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class presentations, three short response papers (4-5 pages), final
paper (12-15 pages, with revisions).
Prerequisites: Philosophy 101, Philosophy 102, Women's and Gender Studies 101 or permission of instructor.

PHIL 305(S) Existentialism and Phenomenology (W)
According to Jean-Paul Sartre, the only philosopher to ever refer to himself as an "existentialist," existence pre-
cedes essence. What is essential to human being is not any fixed set of characteristics, but rather what a human
being becomes and how it defines and creates itself under conditions it does not choose. In this course we address
key themes and figures from two of the most influential movements in twentieth century European philosophy,
namely, existentialism and phenomenology, a philosophical approach to which existentialism is indebted. We
will discuss major works (philosophical, literary, visual) by such figures as Edmund Husserl, Martin Heidegger,
Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, Albert Camus, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, and Richard Wright, Ingmar
Bergman and Jean-Luc Godard. We will raise questions concerning the task of philosophy, the structure and
meaning constituting function of consciousness, the relationship between self and other, the mind-body relation-
ship, freedom, authenticity, and absurdity.
Format: seminar. Requirements: short critical response papers, occasional short class presentations based on out-
lines of the text, and three 5- to 6-page papers. Students will be required to re-write one of the three papers in lieu
of a final exam.
Prerequisites: Philosophy 101 or 102 or 240 or 271T or 304T or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 19

PHIL 307T(S) Free Will (W)
According to the twelfth-century Persian poet Jalalu'ddin Rumi,"There is a disputation that will continue till
mankind is raised from the dead, between the necessitarians and the partisans of free will." Rumi's prediction has
not yet been disproved. This seminar will examine the"disputation" as it exists at present, made far more com-
plex than for Rumi by developments within the physical sciences. We will consider the positions of those who
affirm freedom and reject global determinism ("libertarians"), those who affirm determinism and reject freedom
(not surprisingly,"determinists"), and those who attempt to affirm both freedom and determinism ("compatibi-
lists"), but we will also seek alternative ways of framing the issues. The relevance of the free-will issue to ethics
and perhaps to theology will also be considered. Students who took 272T in Fall 2005 require permission of the
instructor to take this course for credit.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: attendance, preparation, participation; regular short writing assignments and/or
class presentations; a term paper (10- to 15-pages).

PHIL 309(S) Kant
This course will provide an intensive study of the philosophy of Immanuel Kant. Kant's transcendental idealism
is profoundly important: it constitutes a challenge to rationalist metaphysics, a response to Hume's empiricist
skepticism, and systematically integrates epistemology, ethics, and aesthetics in a way that has shaped modern
Western thought. It is also profoundly difficult: more than 200 years after its development, there is still vehement
disagreement not only over whether or not Kant was right, but over what Kant actually said. In this course our
goal will be to understand Kant's philosophy as a systematic whole, in terms of the tight-knit relationships that
bind all his ideas into one comprehensive vision. We will attempt to understand what Kant said and why, how it
is important, and the extent to which it is right. We will read significant portions of all three of Kant's most
important works (the Critique of Pure Reason, Critique of Practical Reason, and Critique of Judgment), and
may occasionally make use of secondary literature.
Requirements: several short assignments; final paper of 12-15 pages.
Prerequisites: Philosophy 102. Expected enrollment: 5-15.
Hour: 2:35-3:50 MR DUDLEY
PHIL 311T(F) Body Politics: Power, Pain, and Pleasure (Same as Women's and Gender
Studies 311T) (W)
In this course we will juxtapose Western philosophical treatments of the body (egs., Platonic, Aristotelian, Hob-
besian, Cartesian, Freudian, Foucauldian) with cultural analyses of contemporary issues in body politics. How
do we reconcile the body and its pleasures with the demand for social and political order? What sort of bodily
training is necessary for entry into society? Is the body an inevitable source of resistance and rebellion? Is it
instead avehicle of power and social control? How do different bodies matter differently? If bodies and pleasures
are historically and socially constituted within unequal power relationships, what can or should we do to trans-
form them? Does the body really matter any more? We take up these and other questions with reference to partic-
ular practices concerning body image (dietary and fitness regimes, cosmetic surgery) as well as more general
questions concerning consumerism and gender, sexual, and racial identities.
Format: tutorial. Students will work in pairs. Requirements: each student will write and present orally a five-page
essay every other week. Students not presenting essays will prepare oral critiques of their partners' essays. Evalu-
ation will be based on written work, oral presentations of essays, and oral critiques.
Prerequisites: one course in either Philosophy or Women's and Gender Studies, or permission of instructor. En-
rollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Preference will be given to students who are committed to taking the tutorial.

PHIL 332(S) Aristotle (Same as Classics 332)
Aristotle's status as a central figure in Western philosophy is undisputed. For hundreds of years during the
Middle Ages, Aristotle was simply referred to as "The Philosopher." Aristotle is also credited with the invention
of logic, biology, physics, political science, linguistics, and aesthetics. His writings on metaphysics, epistemolo-
gy, and ethics set the course for much of the subsequent philosophical discussion which continues to the present
day. In this class, we will examine some of Aristotle's central metaphysical, epistemological and ethical views.
There are two main objectives in this course: (1) We will work to sympathetically reconstruct Aristotle's views
from translations of his primary texts; (2) We will investigate the extent to which these views are relevant to
contemporary discussions in philosophy.
Format: lecture and discussion. Requirements: several short writing assignments, final paper, attendance and ac-

time, personal identity, and freedom of the will. While we will be concerned to place our discussions of these
issues in historical context, almost all of the reading for the class will consist in articles written by contemporary
philosophers working in what is sometimes called the "analytic" tradition.

PHIL 389(F) Everything
The history of theoretical inquiry since the seventeenth century is plausibly viewed as a process whereby philos-
ophy, for the Greeks the home of virtually all inquiry, is increasing deprived of subject matters by the develop-
ments of the various natural and social sciences. At an extreme, it can appear--and does appear, to many
philosophers--that philosophy as inquiry is (or ideally would be) left with no proper subject matter except per-
haps those sciences themselves. On a different view, however, this process can appear instead as one that clarifies
a proper subject matter for philosophy; that subject matter is the all-encompassing domain within which are
found all of the restricted domains constituting the subject matters of the natural and social sciences. Comprehen-
sive philosophical treatments of this all-encompassing domain may reasonably be termed"theories of every-
thing." This seminar examines central components of such a theory that is currently under development; this is
the structural-systematic philosophy presented in part in Structure and Being (Lorenz Puntel, translated by and in
collaboration with Alan White) and A Philosophical Theory of Everything (Alan White). Among the topics to be
examined, as systematically interconnected, are language, knowledge, ontology, truth, philosophical methodolo-
gy, mindedness, ethics, aesthetics, being as a whole, and being as such.

PHIL 401(F) Senior Seminar: The Self (W)
This course is required of, and restricted to, senior philosophy majors. It will be conducted in two sections. Since
the interests of the participants will help shape the syllabus in each section, the two sections might differ. The
common theme for both sections will be philosophical issues that involve the idea of the self. The self is a subject
of experiences, something that has thoughts and feelings, motivation and agency; it is thought of as continuous
over time, and as related to, perhaps even constituted by, other selves. Thus, the concept of self plays a significant
role in metaphysics, epistemology, moral and political philosophy, and of course in the philosophy of mind. It has
been analyzed and discussed throughout the history of philosophy, in both "analytic" and "continental" tradi-
tions. Conceptions of self equally underlie scientific research programs (especially in psychology) and literature
(especially plays and novels). Are the conceptions of self developed within different cultures, historical periods,
philosophical traditions and disciplines radically different conceptions of self, or is there a common core to all of
them a philosophical inquiry may hope to isolate? To answer this question, we may try to first answer some of
the following ones: What is the self? How do I know that I am one? What constitutes my knowledge of myself,
and does that knowledge differ in any significant respect from my knowledge of physical objects and other
people? Can one generalize about self-knowledge? The cognitive phenomenology of the self is deeply con-
nected with our affective attitudes towards ourselves. Is that a philosophically desirable connection? Could we,
and should we, influence it in the direction of minimizing the role of emotions in our self-understanding, or on
the contrary, increase the mutual dependence of the two? What is the defensible interpretation and the desirable
role of the ideal of authenticity, frequently expressed by quoting Polonius' "To thine own self be true" out of
context?
Students are encouraged to think in advance about the specific issues they would like to pursue in this seminar,
and to communicate to the instructor any interesting ideas that they may develop.
Format: seminar. Requirements: class participation, weekly short papers, class presentation and 12-15 pages long
final paper.

The instructional Physical Education Program at Williams is an integral part of the student's total educational
experience. As a part of the liberal arts concept, the program develops the mind-body relationship, which is de-
pendent upon the proper integration of physical and intellectual capacities. The main objective of the physical
education program is to develop in each student an appreciation of physical fitness and wellness, and to expose
them to a variety of activities that are suitable for lifetime participation.
Four credits of Physical Education represent one of the requirements for the College degree. There are five
physical education units during the year. In the fall academic semester, there are two six-week physical education
quarters. Winter Study is another unit, and there are two physical education quarters in the spring academic se-
mester. Two different activities must be completed.

What is light? How does a transistor work? What is a black hole? Why are metals shiny? What is wave/par-
ticle duality? There are people for whom questions like these are of more than passing interest; some of them
become Physics or Astrophysics majors. A physics student experiments with the phenomena by which the
physical world is known and explores the mathematical techniques and theories that make sense of it. A Physics
or Astrophysics major serves as preparation for further work in physics, astrophysics, applied physics, other
sciences, engineering, medical research, science teaching and writing, and other careers involving insight into the
fundamental principles of nature.
ASTROPHYSICS MAJOR
The Physics Department, in cooperation with the Astronomy Department, offers a major in astrophysics con-
sisting of (at least): 6 or 7 courses in Physics, 3 or 4 in Astronomy, and 1 in Mathematics. The core sequence of
the Astrophysics major is the same as the Physics major described below (except that Physics 302, although
strongly recommended, is not required). Students intending to pursue graduate study in astrophysics will need to
take upper-level physics electives beyond the basic requirements for the major. Honors work in Astrophysics
may be in either physics or astronomy. Students majoring in Astrophysics are expected to consult early and often
with faculty from both departments in determining their course selections. The detailed description of the Astro-
physics major is given under "Astronomy," along with a description of the Astronomy major also offered by that
department (see page 90).
PHYSICS MAJOR
Introductory courses
Students considering a major in physics should take both physics and mathematics as first-year students. A
student normally begins with either Physics 131 or Physics 141:
1) Physics 131 Particles and Waves. This is designed as a first course in physics. It is suitable for students who
either have not had physics before or have had some physics but are not comfortable solving "word problems"
that require calculus.
2) Physics 141 Particles and Waves--Enriched. Students in this course should have solid backgrounds in
science and calculus, either from high school or college, including at least a year of high school physics.
The Department of Mathematics will place students in the appropriate introductory calculus course. The
physics major sequence courses all make use of calculus at increasingly sophisticated levels. Therefore, students
considering a Physics major should continue their mathematical preparation without interruption through the
introductory calculus sequence (Mathematics 103, 104, and 105 or 106). Students are encouraged to take Physics
210 as early as possible. Physics 210 is cross listed as Mathematics 210 for the benefit of those students who
wish to have the course listed with a MATH prefix.
Advanced Placement
Students with unusually strong backgrounds in calculus and physics may place out of Physics 141 and either:
1) begin with the special seminar course Physics 151 in the fall (typically followed by Physics 210 in the spring),
or 2) begin with Physics 142 in the spring (possibly along with Physics 210). Students may take either 151 or 142
Physics
­ 253 ­
but not both. On rare occasions a student with an exceptional background will be offered the option of enrolling
in Physics 201.
Placement is based on AP scores, consultation with the department, and results of a placement exam adminis-
tered during First Days. The exam can also be taken later in the year by arrangement with the department chair.
The exam covers classical mechanics, basic wave phenomena, and includes some use of calculus techniques.
Requirements for the Major
A total of ten courses in physics and mathematics are required to complete the Physics major. Students who
place out of both Physics 141 and Physics 142 and begin their studies in Physics 201 are required to take a
total of nine courses.

1) Mathematics 104 may be counted if taken at Williams
2) Mathematics 209 may substitute for Physics 210.
3) Astronomy 111 may count in place of Physics 141 if a student places out of 141 (see "advanced place-
ment" above).
4) An additional Astronomy or Astrophysics course above the introductory level that is acceptable for the
astrophysics major may be counted.
5) Two approved Division III courses above the introductory level may be substituted for one Physics course.
Approval is on an individual basis at the discretion of the department chair.
6) Honors work is in addition to completion of the basic major so Physics 493 and 494 do not count towards
the ten courses in the major.
Preparation for Advanced Study
Students who may wish to do graduate work in physics, astrophysics, or engineering should elect courses in
both physics and mathematics beyond the minimum major requirements. The first-year graduate school curricu-
lum in physics usually includes courses in quantum mechanics, electromagnetic theory, and classical mechanics
that presuppose intermediate level study of these subjects as an undergraduate. Therefore, students planning
graduate work in physics should elect all of the following courses:
Physics 402T Applications of Quantum Mechanics
Physics 405T Electromagnetic Theory
Physics 411T Classical Mechanics
Advising
Both majors and non-majors are encouraged to consult with the department chair or course instructors about
course selections or other matters.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN PHYSICS
The degree with honors in Physics will be awarded on the basis of a senior thesis presenting the results of a
substantial experimental or theoretical investigation carried out under the direction of a faculty member in the
department. There is no rigid grade point average required for admission to the program or for the awarding of
the degree with honors, but it is normally expected that honors students will maintain at least a B average in
physics and mathematics. Students will normally apply for admission to the program early in the spring of their
junior year and during senior year these students will normally elect Physics 493, W31, and 494 in addition to the
usual requirements for the major. At the end of winter study, the department will decide whether the student will
be admitted to honors candidacy. Both a written thesis and a colloquium presentation of the results are required.
The degree with honors will be awarded to those who meet these requirements with distinction. The degree with
highest honors will be awarded to those who fulfill them with unusually high distinction.
Honors candidates will also be required to participate in departmental colloquium talks.
STUDY ABROAD
The physics community is international in scope and a career in physics (or related field) can provide many
opportunities for travel and contact with individuals from outside the United States. The physics major at Wil-
liams is a carefully structured four-year program designed to prepare students who are so inclined for graduate
study at leading research institutions. While it is possible to complete the major requirements in three years, such
Physics
­ 254 ­
a major will not usually not lead to further study in the field. With careful early planning on the part of a student,
and close consultation with the department chair, it is possible to complete a strong major and still study abroad
provided the foreign institution can provide courses which reasonably substitute or supplement those in the Wil-
liams major program.
OPTIONS FOR NON-MAJORS
Many students want to take a self-contained and rigorous full-year survey of physics. For such students, the
most appropriate sequence will be either Physics 131 or Physics 141 followed by Physics 132, depending on the
student's background in science and mathematics (see Introductory Courses above). Either of these sequences
satisfies the physics requirement for medical school.
The department also offers one semester courses designed for non-majors. This year there are three such of-
ferings: Physics 107, 108 and Physics 109.
PHYS 107(F) Newton, Einstein, and Beyond (Q)
This course follows a quest to understand the nature of space, time, matter, and energy, one that continues to this
day. We will focus on two scientific theories that revolutionized our understanding of the physical world, Newto-
nian mechanics (developed in the late 17th century) and Einstein's special relativity (developed in the early 20th
century). As we explore these theories, we will pay special attention to the very different stories they tell about
space and time. We will conclude the semester by touching upon recent developments in cosmology, where ob-
servations have led to dramatic surprises about the make-up of our universe, and particle physics, where the
Large Hadron Collider experiment is poised to extend our understanding of nature to higher energies and shorter
distances.
This course is intended for students whose primary interests lie outside of the natural sciences and mathematics.
The mathematics used will be algebra and trigonometry. Every student will have three meetings every week.
Some weeks the three meetings will be lectures (MWF 10-10:50), other weeks there will be two lectures (MF
10-10:50), and one conference section.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; problem-solving conference section, one hour per week. Evaluation will
be based on regular problem sets, very brief essays, occasional quizzes, a midterm, and a final exam, all with a
significant quantitative component (see the description of the QFR requirement).
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 100 (expected: 70). Preference given to students based on seniority.

(www.williams.edu/Registrar/catalog/depts/phys/phys109html) MAJUMDER
PHYS 131(F) Particles and Waves (Q)
We focus first on the Newtonian mechanics of point particles: the relationship between velocity, acceleration, and
position; the puzzle of circular motion; forces; Newton's laws; energy and momentum; and gravitation. The
physics of extended objects and of fluids also will be discussed briefly. We finally turn to the basic properties of
waves, such as interference and polarization, with emphasis on light waves. This course is intended for students
who have not studied physics before or who have had some physics, but are not comfortable solving "word
problems" that require calculus. Students who scored 4 or 5 on the AP Physics B exam or on the AP Physics C
(mechanics) exam, or 6 or 7 on the IB Physics HL exam may not take this course. These students and others with
strong backgrounds in the sciences are encouraged to consider taking Physics 141 instead. Physics 131 can lead
to either Physics 132 (for students wanting a one-year survey of physics) or Physics 142 (for students consider-
ing a physics or astrophysics major).
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours every other week. Evaluation will be based on
weekly problem sets, weekly quizzes, hour tests, labs, and a final exam, all of which have a substantial quantita-
tive component.
Prerequisites: Mathematics 103. No enrollment limit (expected: 60).
Hour: 11:00-11:50 MWF Lab: 1-4 M,T,W STRAIT
PHYS 132(S) Electromagnetism and the Physics of Matter (Q)
This course is intended as the second half of a one-year survey of physics. In the first half of the semester we will
focus on electromagnetic phenomena. We will introduce the concept of electric and magnetic fields, and study in
detail the way in which electrical circuits and circuit elements work. The deep connection between electric and
magnetic phenomena is highlighted in a discussion of Faraday's Law of Induction. In the second half of the
semester, we introduce several of the most central topics in twentieth-century physics. We will discuss Einstein's
theory of special relativity as well as aspects of quantum theory. We will end with a treatment of nuclear physics,
radioactivity, and uses of radiation.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours every other week. Evaluation will be based on
weekly problem sets, labs, hour tests, and a final exam, all of which have a substantial quantitative component.
Prerequisites: Physics 131 or 141 or permission of instructor, and Mathematics 103. No enrollment limit (ex-
pected: 60).
Hour: 11:00-11:50 MWF Lab: 1-4 M,T,W MAJUMDER
PHYS 141(F) Particles and Waves--Enriched (Q)
This course covers the same topics as Physics 131, but with a higher level of mathematical sophistication and
more emphasis on waves. It is intended for students with solid backgrounds in the sciences, either from high
school or college, who feel comfortable solving "word problems" that require calculus. Physics 141 can lead to
Physics
­ 255 ­
either Physics 132 (for students wanting a one-year survey of physics) or Physics 142 (for students considering a
physics or astrophysics major).
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours every other week/conference, one hour every other
week. Evaluation will be based on weekly problem sets, quizzes and hour tests, and labs, all of which have a
substantial quantitative component.
Prerequisites: high school physics and Mathematics 103 (or equivalent placement). No enrollment limit (ex-
pected: 50).
Hour: 11:00-11:50 MWF Lab: 1-4 M,T,W S. BOLTON
PHYS 142(S) Foundations of Modern Physics (Q)
The twentieth century was an extremely productive and exciting time for physics. Special relativity has extended
physics into the realm of high speeds and high energies. Quantum mechanics has successfully described phe-
nomena at small energies and small distance scales. Our understanding of atoms, molecules, and solids has de-
veloped from a few revolutionary ideas into a sophisticated framework which today supports technologies that
were unimagined in 1900. This course will introduce many important developments in physics, including special
relativity, the Bohr model of the atom, Schrodinger's wave mechanics in one dimension, the chemical bond,
energy bands in solids, and nuclear physics.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours every other week/conference, one hour every other
week. Evaluation will be based on weekly quizzes, labs, two hour tests, and a final exam, all of which have a
substantial quantitative component.
Prerequisites: Physics 141 and Mathematics 103, or equivalent; students may not take both Physics 142 and
Physics 151. Physics 131 may substitute for Physics 141 with the permission of instructor. No enrollment limit
(expected:30).
Hour: 11:00-11:50 MWF Lab: 1-4 T,W WOOTTERS
PHYS 151(F) Seminar in Modern Physics (Q)
Why does a hot coal glow red rather than blue or green or some other color? Remarkably, this simple question
could not be answered before the year 1900, because the answer depends on a radical assumption introduced in
that year by Max Planck. His work on thermal radiation marked the beginning of a revolutionary era in the histo-
ry of physics that culminated in a new framework for our understanding of the physical world. Relativity, quan-
tum mechanics, and statistical physics are the pillars of the modern framework, and constitute the core of this
course. As we study this material, we will also be exploring the process of research in physics, partly by doing
some experiments of our own. We will discuss the interaction between experiment and theory, as well as the roles
of simplicity, elegance, and unity in the search for explanations. This is a small seminar designed for first-year
students who have placed out of Physics 141.
Format: lecture/discussion, three hours per week; laboratory, every other week. Evaluation will be based on class
participation, labs, weekly problem sets, an oral presentation, two hour-exams and a final exam, all of which
have a substantial quantitative component.
Prerequisites: placement by the department (see advanced placement above). Students may take either Physics
142 or Physics 151 but not both. Enrollment limit: 18 (expected: 18).
Hour: 11:00-12:15 WF Lab: 1-4 W AALBERTS
PHYS 201(F) Electricity and Magnetism (Q)
In this course, we study electromagnetic phenomena and their mathematical description. Topics include electro-
magnetic induction, alternating circuits, and the electromagnetic properties of matter. We also introduce Max-
well's equations, which express in remarkably succinct form the essence of the theory.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based weekly quizzes,
problem sets, labs, two hour tests, and a final exam, all of which have a substantial quantitative component.
Prerequisites: Physics 142, Mathematics 105 or 106. No enrollment limit (expected:25).
Hour: 10:00-10:50 MWF Lab: 1-4 M,T MAJUMDER
PHYS 202(S) Waves and Optics (Q)
Waves and oscillations characterize many different physical systems, including vibrating strings, springs, water
waves, sound waves, electromagnetic waves, and gravitational waves. Quantum mechanics even describes par-
ticles with wave functions. Despite these diverse settings waves exhibit several common characteristics, so that
the understanding of a few simple systems can provide insight into a wide array of phenomena. In this course we
begin with the study of oscillations of simple systems with only a few degrees of freedom. We then move on to
study transverse and longitudinal waves in continuous media in order to gain a general description of wave beha-
vior. The rest of the course focuses on electromagnetic waves and in particular on optical examples of wave
phenomena. In addition to well known optical effects such as interference and diffraction, we will study a num-
ber of modern applications of optics such as short pulse lasers and optical communications. Throughout the
course mathematical methods useful for higher-level physics will be introduced.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on problem
sets, labs, two one-hour tests, and a final exam, all of which have a substantial quantitative component.
Prerequisite: Physics 201. Co-requisite: Physics/Mathematics 210 or permission of instructor. No enrollment
limit (expected: 20).
Hour: 10:00-10:50 MWF Lab: 1-4 T,W K. JONES
PHYS 210(S) Mathematical Methods for Scientists (Same as Mathematics 210) (Q)
This course covers a variety of mathematical methods used in the sciences, focusing particularly on the solution
of ordinary and partial differential equations. In addition to calling attention to certain special equations that arise
frequently in the study of waves and diffusion, we develop general techniques such as looking for series solutions
and, in the case of nonlinear equations, using phase portraits and linearizing around fixed points. We study some
Physics
­ 256 ­
simple numerical techniques for solving differential equations. A series of optional sessions in Mathematica will
be offered for students who are not already familiar with this computational tool.
Format: lecture, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on weekly problem sets and several in-class
exams, all of which have a substantial quantitative component.
Prerequisites: Mathematics 105 or 106 and familiarity with Newtonian mechanics at the level of Physics 131.No
enrollment limit (expected: 20).
Hour: 9:55-11:10 TR AALBERTS
PHYS 301(F) Quantum Physics (Q)
This course serves as a one-semester introduction to the history, formalism, and phenomenology of quantum
mechanics. We begin with a discussion of the historical origins of the quantum theory, and the Schroedinger
wave equation. The concepts of matter waves and wave-packets are introduced. Solutions to one-dimensional
problems will be treated prior to introducing the system which serves as a hallmark of the success of quantum
theory, the three-dimensional hydrogen atom. In the second half of the course, we will develop the important
connection between the underlying mathematical formalism and the physical predictions of the quantum theory.
We then go on to apply this knowledge to several important problems within the realm of atomic and nuclear
physics.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on weekly
problem sets, labs, a midterm exam, and final exam, all of which have a substantial quantitative component.
Prerequisites: Physics 202 and Physics 210. No enrollment limit (expected:15).
Hour: 9:00-9:50 MWF Lab: 1-4 T,W K. JONES
PHYS 302(S) Statistical Physics (Q)
You understand the interactions among fundamental particles (Newton's and Coulomb's laws, the Schrodinger
equation, etc.) but how do these interactions determine the behavior of macroscopic objects, which are made up
of huge numbers of such particles? This is a rather critical question for understanding the world around us. In this
course we will develop the tools of statistical physics, which will allow us to predict the cooperative phenomena
that emerge in large ensembles of interacting particles. We will apply those tools to a wide variety of physical
questions, including the behavior of gasses, heat engines, magnets, and electrons in solids.
Format: lecture/discussion, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on
weekly problem sets, exams, and labs, all of which have a substantial quantitative component.
Prerequisites: Physics 142, Physics 210, Physics 301. No enrollment limit (expected: 15).
Hour: 11:20-12:35 TR Lab: 1-4 W S. BOLTON
PHYS 315(S) Computational Biology (Same as Computer Science 315 and INTR 315) (Q)
This course will provide an overview of Computational Biology, the application of computational, mathematical,
and physical problem-solving techniques to interpret the rapidly expanding amount of biological data. Topics
covered will include database searching, DNA sequence alignment, phylogeny reconstruction, RNA and protein
structure prediction, microarray analysis, and genome assembly using techniques such as string matching, dy-
namic programming, suffix trees, hidden Markov models, and expectation-maximization.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, 1.5 hours per week. Evaluation will be based on weekly prob-
lem sets, programming assignments, and a few quizzes.
Prerequisites: programming experience (e.g. CSCI 136), mathematics (PHYS 210 or MATH 105), and physical
science (PHYS 142 or 151, or CHEM 151 or 153 or 155), or permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 20

We will review Maxwell's equations and use them to study a range of topics--electric fields and matter, magnet-
ic materials, light, radiation--exploring phenomena and seeking to gain an intuitive understanding. We will also
learn some useful approximation techniques and some beautiful mathematical tools.
The class will meet as a whole once per week for an hour lecture on new material and to discuss questions on the
readings. Each week a second tutorial meeting with the instructor will be scheduled; here, students will take turns
working problems on the chalkboard. Written solutions to problems will be due a few days after the tutorial
meeting.

PHYS 418(S) Gravity (Q)
This course is an introduction to the currently accepted theory of gravity, Einstein's general theory of relativity.
We begin with a review of special relativity, emphasizing geometrical aspects of Minkowski spacetime. Working
from the equivalence principle, we then motivate gravity as spacetime curvature, and study in detail the
Schwarzschild geometry around a spherically symmetric mass, and the Friedmann-Robertson Walker geome-
tries for an expanding universe. After these applications, we use tensors to develop Einstein's equation, which
describes how energy density curves spacetime, and finally, starting from a linearized version of this equation,
we develop the theory of gravitational waves.
Format: lecture, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on weekly problem sets, a midterm exam, and a
final exam, all with a substantial quantitative component.
Prerequisites: Physics 301 or Physics 405 or Physics 411 (students with strong math backgrounds are invited to
consult with the instructor about a possible waiving of the prerequisites.) No enrollment limit (expected: 19).

POLITICAL ECONOMY (Div. II)
Chair, Professor JAMES E. MAHON
Advisory Committee: Professors: BRADBURD***, C. JOHNSON, MAHON. Associate Professors: D.
GOLLIN, PAUL.
The Political Economy major is designed to give students a grasp of the ways in which political and economic
forces interact in the shaping of public policy. The major includes substantial study of the central analytical ap-
proaches in both political science and economics and seeks to surmount the sometimes artificial barriers of spe-
cialization that may characterize either discipline taken by itself. In the junior and senior years a conscious merg-
ing of the approaches in the two fields is undertaken in the three required Political Economy courses. (These
courses are designed by, and usually are taught jointly by, political scientists and economists.) Political Economy
301 examines major writings in political economy and analyzes economic liberalism and critiques of economic
liberalism in the context of current policy issues. Political Economy 401 examines interactions of international
and domestic forces in contemporary issues. Political Economy 402 asks students to research and make propos-
als in policy areas of current importance. Background for these senior courses is acquired through courses in
international economics, public finance, and domestic and international/comparative politics and policy.
Students in Political Economy 402 visit Washington, D.C. Sunday night through Wednesday of the first week
of spring vacation to conduct interviews relating to their Political Economy 402 group projects. This is a course
requirement and thus a requirement for the major.

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN POLITICAL ECONOMY
Due to the special demands of this interdisciplinary major, the only route to honors in Political Economy is the
thesis. Seniors may pursue the honors thesis course (Political Economy 493-W31) during the fall semester and
winter study period. The third course contributing to such an honors program would normally be an elective in
Political Science or Economics taken during the junior year. This course, which may be one of the required elec-
tives, must be closely related, indeed must prepare the ground for the honors thesis.
Juniors in the Political Economy major with at least a 3.5 GPA in the program may apply for the honors thesis
program by means of a written proposal submitted to the chair before spring registration. Written guidelines for
such proposals are available in the chair's office or on the program website. The proposal should have been
discussed with at least two faculty members, and at least one faculty advisor from each discipline should be
solicited by the student prior to submission of the proposal.
Final decisions about admission to the honors program will be made in early summer, when spring grades
become available.
To achieve the degree with honors in Political Economy, the thesis must be completed by the end of winter
study period and be judged of honors quality by a committee consisting of the two advisors and a third reader. A
thesis judged to be of particular distinction will qualify its author for the degree with highest honors.
STUDY ABROAD
Despite the fact that Political Economy requires more courses than the typical major, plenty of Political Eco-
nomy majors go abroad. Since the most popular time to take POEC 301 is the fall of the junior year, if you're
thinking of spending only one semester abroad, Spring is the better choice. But lots of students go away for the
Fall or the whole year. Political Economy majors have often been overrepresented in Williams at Oxford. If you
do go abroad in the fall, you may take POEC 301 in your sophomore or senior years. The former is preferable
(POEC 301 is not too hard for sophs) but the latter is more common, mainly because many people don't decide
to become POEC majors in time. You'll probably want to get some major credits when abroad. The easiest to get
are upper-level electives in political science and economics. Most programs for US students in Europe have a
political science course on the EU, which is a good fit. We recommend against taking econometrics abroad.
COURSE NUMBERING SYSTEM
The numbering system for courses offered and required in Political Economy is identical to the system out-
lined on page 44.
POEC 301(F) Economic Liberalism and Its Critics (Same as Economics 299 and Political Science
333)
Economic liberalism holds that, if left alone by government, people will make mutually beneficial transactions
with one another, leaving society better off. Its critics point to what they believe this position ignores or what it
wrongly assumes, and hence, how it would make bad policy. This course explores the relationship between poli-
tics and economics by surveying influential works of political economy. Its first part examines major thinkers in
relation to the historical development of capitalism in Western Europe and the United States: the classical liberal-
ism of Adam Smith, Karl Marx's revolutionary socialism, and the reformist ideas of John Stuart Mill, R. H.
Tawney, and John Maynard Keynes. The second part considers more recent writings that revise and critique
liberalism from a variety of perspectives. The historical focus of the course permits you to appreciate the ongoing
dialogue between classical and contemporary views of political economy, while classroom discussion involves
frequent reference to current public policy issues.
Format: discussion/lecture. Requirements: eight 2-page papers and a final exam.
Prerequisites: one course in Economics andeither Political Science 201 or 203 or AP credit in American Politics
(or permission of instructor). Enrollment limit: 35 (expected: 32). Preference given to Political Economy majors
and sophomores intending a Political Economy major.

POEC 401(F) Contemporary Problems in Political Economy
This course examines contemporary problems in political economy at and across diverse spatial scales. Using
both Economics and Political Science methods of analysis, we will study the exercise of power and the accu-
mulation of wealth in the world today as well as central public policy debates around those processes. We begin
with an historical and philosophical argument for the centrality of economic growth to liberal democracy. Then
we move through three course sections organized around contemporary problems in US, global and comparative
political economy. Finally, we end by taking issues usually studied at a single scale and explore their innate inter-
connections through an integrated political-economic and public policy analysis of immigration. The goal of this
course is both to build upon theoretical debates encountered in POEC 301 as well as to prepare students for the
public policy analysis they will do in POEC 402.
Format: seminar. Requirements: three 8- to 10-page papers, one 16- to 20-page paper, paper revision..
Prerequisites: Economics 110 and 120; Political Science 202 or 204, or equivalent. Enrollment limit: 20 (ex-

Hour: 11:00-12:15 MWF PAUL
POEC 402(S) Political Economy of Public Policy Issues
The core of this course consists of analyses by student study groups of current issues of public policy. The student
groups investigate the interacting political and economic aspects of an issue, do extensive reading, conduct inter-
views in Washington (during spring recess) with public and private officials, write a major report on their find-
ings and recommendations, and defend it orally in a public session.
Students visit Washington, D.C. Sunday night through Wednesday of the first week of spring vacation to conduct
interviews relating to their group projects. This is a course requirement.
Format: seminar with student presentations.
Prerequisites: Economics 253 or 255; satisfaction of the U.S. Political Economy and Public Policy course re-
quirement (see list of major requirements above).

Politics is most fundamentally about forging and maintaining community, about how we manage to craft a
common destiny guided by shared values. Communities need a way to reconcile conflicts of interest among their
members and to determine their group interest; they need to allocate power and to determine its just uses. Power
may be used wisely or foolishly, rightly or cruelly, but it is always there; it cannot be wished away. Political
science attends to the ways that social power is grasped, maintained, challenged, or justified. The contests over
power and the values that it should be used to further give politics its drama and pathos. The effort to understand
politics aims not only to describe and explain, but also to improve political life.
The Political Science major is structured to allow students either to participate in the established ways of stud-
ying politics or to develop their own foci. To this end, the department offers two routes to completing the major,
each requiring nine courses. We invite students either to organize their major through the subfields that structure
the discipline of political science (American politics, international relations, political theory, and comparative
politics), or to develop individual concentrations reflecting their particular interests, regardless of subfields.
MAJOR
SUBFIELD CONCENTRATION ROUTE: Upon declaring a major, students choose one subfield: American
politics, international relations, political theory, or comparative politics. The subfield concentration draws at least
four (4) of the nine courses from one subfield including the appropriate core course from 201-204, two electives
of the student's choice at the 200 or 300 level and the senior seminar (or an individual project) in the student's
subfield. Students selecting political theory as their subfield concentration must take Political Science 231 or
Political Science 232 as one of their four subfield courses, in addition to taking Political Science 203 and prior to
taking Political Science 430. (A degree with honors in Political Science requires enrollment in the year-long
senior thesis seminar, which does not count toward the nine (9) major requirements.) With permission of the
department chair, students may take a senior seminar in a different subfield, providing they take a third elective in
the subfield of concentration. In addition, students must take courses in two subfields outside the subfield of
concentration to satisfy the breadth requirement (all courses at the 100 level and all methods courses also count
toward the breadth requirement). The faculty advisor and the department chair must approve the student plan.
INDIVIDUAL CONCENTRATION ROUTE: Alternatively, students may devise a concentration of their own.
In this event, the student prepares a curricular plan in consultation with a faculty advisor, explaining the nature of
Political Science
­ 260 ­
the concentration and the courses the student will take. The individual concentration also requires nine (9)
courses, with at least five (5) thematically linked courses constituting the concentration. Of these five courses,
four are electives at the 200 or 300 level, including one from 201-204, and one is a senior seminar or individual
project. In addition, students pursuing an individual concentration must take at least two other courses that illus-
trate breadth in political science. To complete the requirement, the student has his or her choice of any two other
courses within the Political Science Department. The faculty advisor and the department chair must approve the
student plan.
ADVISEMENT
When a student chooses to major in Political Science (usually at the end of the sophomore year), he or she
may register with any Political Science faculty member at the designated time and places. The registering faculty
member will ask for preferences for a permanent faculty advisor and will assist undecided students in finding an
advisor. In all cases, students will be paired by the end of the sophomore year with an advisor who will continue
with them through graduation.
COURSE NUMBERING
The course numbering used by the Political Science Department reflects the format and specialization of a
course The 100-level courses are designed to address political topics from multiple subfield perspectives. The
200-level courses are divided between our core courses and our electives. The core courses, numbered from
201-204, serve as introductions both to the substance of the politics and the subfields organizing the study of
politics. The introductory subfield course must be completed before the senior year. The 200-level elective cour-
ses delve into political processes, problems and philosophies. 100-level and 200-level courses have no prerequi-
sites. 300-level courses are more specialized and require prerequisites. 400-level courses are senior seminars of-
fered for students in the major; senior seminars also are open to juniors and to non-majors if space permits.
WINTER STUDY PROJECT
The department welcomes relevant WSP 99 proposals that can make important contributions to the student's
understanding of public affairs and politics. Majors, seniors, and students without previous WSP 99 experience
have preference.
THE JUNIOR YEAR ABROAD
A major in Political Science can be readily and usefully combined with study in a foreign country. No more
than one course taken per semester abroad in a program approved by the College may be counted toward the
requirements for a degree in Political Science.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE
The Political Science Department grants honors to candidates who, (1) complete the Senior Seminar, (2) re-
ceive at least a grade of 3.50 on a Senior Thesis (493-W31-494), and (3) have a minimum GPA of 3.5 in Political
Science.
To become a candidate for honors the student must (1) apply in the second semester of the junior year, (2)
submit a research proposal acceptable to the department's honors committee and for which an appropriate advi-
sor is available, and (3) have a minimum GPA of 3.5 in Political Science for the first six semesters. (Political
Science 493-W31-494 DO NOT count toward the total of nine required of all majors.)
ADVANCED STUDY IN AMERICAN POLITICS
The Department of Political Science provides the opportunity for an unusually gifted student to engage in an
entire year's advanced research in American politics under singularly favorable conditions. Supported by income
derived from an endowment fund, the student, designated the Sentinels of the Republic Scholar (after the name
of the fund), receives a substantial research stipend to cover costs associated with the proposed project.
This unique research course (Political Science 481-W33-482) is designed to encourage the pursuit of excel-
lence among the most talented Williams students of Political Science. Admission to it is awarded to the most
distinguished candidate on the basis of demonstrated capacity for outstanding work and of the project's promise
for creative contributions to the understanding of American politics, political institutions and thought.

PSCI 102(F) Religion and Capitalism (W)*
While most observers up through the 1960s expected the advance of modern capitalist social relations to usher in
a lasting world-wide era of secularism, over the last forty years much of the world has instead experienced a
dramatic revival of religion to social, economic and political importance. What is the relationship between these
two signature forces of religion and capitalism--one ideal, one material--which have constructed and continue
to define our cultures, economies and polities? This course is an investigation into this question, with its touch-
stone being the famous `Weber thesis'--namely, that Protestant ideas and ethics gave rise to capitalist society.
Using Max Weber as well as his critics as a foundation, the course emphasizes recent historical and contempo-
rary questions, such as: why are welfare states in Catholic countries different from those in Protestant countries?
Does Confucianism make Asian capitalism different from Western forms? Does consumerism function as a
`secular religion'? Why is Pentecostalism increasingly prevalent in third world slums? Is the rise of contempo-
rary religious `fundamentalism' a response to globalization? For reasons of history and analytic focus, the course
Political Science

emphasizes the interaction between capitalism and Christianity, although non-Christian religions--particularly
Confuciansim--will also be discussed.
Format: seminar. Requirements: one medium-length paper, two short papers, one long research paper incorpo-

PSCI 120(S) America and the World After September 11
The terrorist attacks of September 11 and the war in Afghanistan raised fundamental questions about the past and
future course of American foreign policy. While virtually no one defended the terrorist attacks, many academics
argued that the root causes of September 11th were to be found in the flaws of the American approach to the
world. In this view, America is an arrogant, unilateralist country that ignores the views and perspectives of the
rest of the world community, relies far too much on its overwhelming military power, and often acts against its
ideals and values by supporting repressive and unpopular regimes. This course has three primary objectives.
First, we will assess important critiques of contemporary American foreign policy from both the left and right of
the political spectrum. Second, we will examine the historical and intellectual background of both supporters and
critics of American foreign policy in the post Vietnam War era. Third, in the aftermath of September 11 we will
attempt to answer the most important question of all for any analysis of American foreign policy: What is to be
done? While current issues of American foreign policy will be addressed in this class, potential students should
note that its primary focus is not on the technical/military elements of combating terrorism.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: assignments will include weekly response papers, two 5- to 7-page
papers, and a comprehensive in-class final exam. Students will also be required to obtain (free) online subscrip-
tions to the New York Times and other current periodicals.

PSCI 201(F,S) Power, Politics, and Democracy in America
Begun as an experiment over 200 years ago, the United States has grown into a polity that is simultaneously
praised and condemned, critiqued and mythologized, modeled by others and remodeled itself. This course intro-
duces students to the dynamics and tensions that have animated the American political order and that have nur-
tured these conflicting assessments. Topics include the founding of the American system and the primary docu-
ments (the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the Federalist Papers), the primary institutions of
national government then and now (Congress, the Presidency, and the Supreme Court) and the politics of policy-
making in the United States. We study structures, processes, key events, and primary actors that have shaped
American political development. In investigating these topics, we explore questions such as these: How is power
allocated? What produces political change? Is there is a trade-off between democratic accountability and effec-
tive governance? How are tensions between liberty and equality resolved? Do the institutions produce good poli-
cies, and how do we define what is good?
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: two papers, one exam, and class participation.

PSCI 202(F,S) World Politics: An Introduction to International Relations
International politics differs from domestic politics in the absence of centralized, legitimate institutions. Anarchy
characterizes the world of sovereign states-there is no world government, nor agreement that one is desirable or
even possible. This lack of a common authority means that any dispute among countries is up to the countries
themselves to settle, by negotiating, appealing to shared norms, or using force. For this reason, while internation-
al relations involves many of the same topics that consume domestic politics-ethnic antagonisms, spending on
aid, war, national identity, inequality, weapons manufacture, finance, loans, pollution, migration-it shares few of
the same processes for dealing with them. This course covers problems central to international relations. It con-
siders the importance that this radical decentralization has for achieving values we hold, and examines processes
that might undermine or support the anarchical system in which we live.
Format: lecture. Requirements: first semester-two medium length papers, a final exam, and class participation;
second semester-two midterm exams, a final exam, and class participation.
No prerequisites. This is an introductory course, open to all, including first-year students. Enrollment limit: 40

PSCI 203(F,S) Introduction to Political Theory
Is politics war by other means? Is it merely a practical way to meet our needs? Or is it, rather, the activity through
which citizens pursue justice and the good life? And what is justice? How can it be established and secured?
Political Science
­ 262 ­
What are the powers and obligations of citizenship? Who should rule? Who decides? On what basis? Political
theory addresses questions such as these as it investigates the fundamental problems of how we can, do, and
ought to live together. The questions have sparked controversy since the origins of political thinking; the answers
remain controversial now. This course addresses the controversies, focusing on major works of ancient, modern,
and contemporary theory by such authors as Plato, Aristotle, Machiavelli, Hobbes, Rousseau, Hegel, Mill, Marx,
Nietzsche, Arendt, Rawls, and Foucault. Themes may include authority, obligation, power, war, violence, free-
dom, justice, equality, democracy, liberalism, capitalism, community, and pluralism, though the emphasis will
vary from semester to semester.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: two or three papers; some sections also have a final exam.

PSCI 204(S) Introduction to Comparative Politics
To the lay person comparative politics might be described as the study of the centralized, legitimate institutions of
domestic governance in countries around the world. In practice, this sub-discipline is motivated by attempts to
uncover the social, economic, political and cultural forces that in fact produce marked differences in both the
degree and form taken by institutions of domestic governance. For this reason, comparativists tend to ask: What
are states and how did they emerge as the dominant political unit? Why are some states weak while others are
strong? Why do some states become democratic while others remain authoritarian or totalitarian? Why have
some democracies endured yet others have collapsed or seem on the brink of collapse? By addressing each of
these questions, this course covers some of the issues central to the study of the politics of countries around the
world.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: readings/discussion, take-home midterm exam, and final exam.
No prerequisites. This is an introductory course, open to all, including first-year students.

PSCI 211(F) Public Opinion and Political Behavior
The focus of this course is the role of public opinion in democratic regimes. The influence of public opinion on
public affairs and popular governments is a relatively new phenomenon in the history of governments (largely
subsequent to the American and French revolutions). We can see from recent events the impact of public opin-
ion: In the early 1990s the American public quickly became interested in drought and starvation in Somalia
pressing the American government to intervene, if briefly and unsuccessfully. Some have claimed that American
journalists successfully provoked the American public to go to war (the Spanish-American War, creating the
slogan, "Remember the Maine"), and to withdraw from war (Viet Nam). More recently, public support to com-
mence the Iraq war was generated in the United States while at the same time democratic publics in other nations
strongly opposed the war. We see political leaders make use of the"bully pulpit" to rally support for their agen-
das, efforts that sometimes succeed and other times fail. We shall explore public opinion in American politics.
There are many interesting questions awaiting us this semester. How do events and crises influence public opin-
ion? Which psychological, sociological, and political factors impact public opinion formation? When and under
what circumstances do pressure groups influence public opinion? Do mass beliefs alter individual voters'
choices? When and how do political leaders influence public opinion and when does public opinion influence
political leaders?
Format: lecture/discussion. In addition, we will have direct access to the holdings of the Roper Center, using
iPOLL, which enables direct exploration of the thousands of polls on American public opinion from 1937 to
today. Requirements: 8- to 12-page research paper, a midterm and final examination.

PSCI 217(F) Constitutional Law II: Rights
Constitutional Law II explores constraints imposed on governmental power by a system of civil rights. Areas
examined include equal protection, due process, freedom of speech and religion. Within these and other broad
doctrines, countless specific controversies arise. Those we address include abortion, same-sex marriage, affirma-
tive action, flag-burning, and the death penalty. Much of the reading consists of Supreme Court cases, but we will
also pay close attention to the broader context surrounding these cases. A recurring question is the relevance of
the Court's undemocratic nature. Should the Court see itself as a tribune of the powerless, which must restrain the
political branches or, alternatively, should it generally defer to the people's elected representatives? A closely
related question involves the extent to which the Court should confine the rights it protects to those specifically
listed in the Constitution. Finally, to what extent do and should judges consult their moral or even political views,
as opposed to undertaking a more objective, apolitical or distinctly "judicial" analysis, in reaching decisions?

PSCI 222(S) The United States and Latin America*
This course examines the most important political and diplomatic divide in the Western Hemisphere. The first
half is a historical survey of US-Latin American foreign relations from the early Spanish American indepen-
dence movements through the end of the Cold War, with some emphasis on the latter. We consider how this
history confirms or undermines influential views about US foreign relations and about international relations
generally. We also compare historical US foreign policy toward the hemisphere to current policy globally. The
second half covers the most important current issues in hemispheric relations: the embargo on Cuba, economic
integration, the war on drugs, immigration, and border security. At the end we reconsider current US policies, in
view of the economic and political evolution of Latin America, in historical perspective.
Format: lecture/ discussion, with more lecture in the first half, more discussion and several in-class debates in the
second. Requirements: a map quiz; a 6-page midterm paper; one 4-page policy paper; and either a second policy
paper and the regular final exam, or a medium-length (12-page) research paper and an abbreviated final exam.

PSCI 230(S) American Political Thought
What makes political thought "American"? Is there something distinct about the American political imagination
that shapes how we think about liberty, equality, and government? And who exactly is the "we"? This course
examines these questions and others by exploring the evolving relationship between conceptions of "the frontier"
and the idea of representation throughout American history. We shall see that debates over how to represent the
community lead almost inescapably to the question of the proper boundary of the community - of who gets
included or excluded from membership in the polity. We will explore the Founding period in detail, and then
move on to examine several expansions of the public sphere in the 19th and 20th centuries, including those re-
lated to race, gender, class, and nationality. How do these openings in the political realm reflect differing notions
of freedom, justice, and property? In conclusion we will ask how the meaning of "America" may be affected by
recent debates over immigration and "la frontera" to the south.

Among the questions that we will address: What is justice? How can it be known and pursued? How is political
power generated and exercised? What are the social and ethical prerequisites and consequences of democracy?
Must the freedom or fulfillment of some people require the subordination of others? Does freedom require lead-
ing (or avoiding) a political life? What does it mean to be "philosophical" or to think "theoretically" about poli-
tics? Finally, how does our contemporary view of politics look when refracted through the Greek experience of
the political?

and Mill. We will consider a range of topics, from questions about what constitutes modernity, liberalism, de-
mocracy, equality, and freedom to questions about the relation between the modern state and capitalism, the
emergence of the individual, and various challenges to traditional and religious authority. We will examine how
women, non-Europeans, and the poor figure in these texts, even (or, perhaps,especially) when they do not explic-
itly appear. Through our course of study, we will reflect upon what makes these texts powerful and enduring
works in political thought and will thus be considering the nature and function of political theory as an intellectu-

Liberal democracies today face demands for greater recognition and accommodation by ethnic, racial, religious,

where they intersect with liberal and democratic principles and practices. This course explores key justice claims
made by minority groups in liberal democracies, ranging from demands for greater political representation by
particular communities to calls for special group rights and arrangements, and even forms of self-government
and self-determination. We will also assess the justifications typically offered by groups to back up their claims -
justifications that appeal to the value of culture identity and cultural membership, the importance of community
self-preservation, the benefits of diversity, and so forth. Special attention will be paid to areas of tension between
the demands made by cultural minorities and particular liberal-democratic values and institutions. We will also
explore those critical of policies of multiculturalism and special group cultural rights, such as thinkers that appeal
to"cosmopolitanism" and those that call for a politics of redistribution over one of cultural recognition.

Every American president from Franklin Roosevelt to John F. Kennedy did not want to commit American
ground forces to fight in Vietnam. Lyndon Johnson felt the same way, but he nevertheless eventually sent
hundreds of thousands of Americans to fight in Vietnam. Richard Nixon wanted to end America's involvement
in Vietnam when he became president, but our commitment lasted another five years. This course examines the
complex political process that marked America's involvement in Vietnam. Working heavily with declassified
documents, we will examine the factors that lead successive presidential administrations to wage a war that none
of them particularly wanted to fight. In addition, we will also examine the South and North Vietnamese perspec-
tive on the war, as well as the tremendous impact that Vietnam continues to have in American politics and soci-
ety.

PSCI 247(S) Political Power in Contemporary China*
The People's Republic of China presents us with two grand political narratives: socialism and democracy. In the
Maoist era, a distinctive understanding of socialism, which claimed to be a more genuine democracy, brought
hope and, ultimately, tragedy to hundreds of millions of people. In the post-Mao era, Chinese politics has been
driven by the need to redefine socialism in the wake of the world-historic calamities of the Great Leap Forward
and the Cultural Revolution and, more recently, the end of the Cold War. The state cannot simply give up the
socialist myth because without it the rationale for Communist Party hegemony evaporates. But China's rulers
cannot avoid political reform, both ideological and institutional, because to do so heightens the legitimacy crisis
born of Maoist failures. Within this context has emerged the contemporary Chinese democracy movement
which, in all of its complexity, looks to both socialist discourse and Western practice to create a new politics that
checks tyrannical abuses of state power and engenders a civil society. What is Chinese democracy now? What
are its prospects and what is its relationship to the ideas of socialism?

This course deals with what democracy means and how it is achieved. It begins by weighing competing defini-

eties that make decisions in particular kinds of ways, regardless of the substance of decisions. While this view has
deep roots in democratic theory and practice, it has competed historically with more substantive definitions of
democracy, which emphasize outcomes and, particularly, progress towards equality of outcomes. This course
will examine this debate and consider the reasons why procedural definitions currently are ascendant. Then the
course considers what it means to understand democracy to be universally available. What does it mean to ditch
the "preconditions" that formerly were considered to be necessary prior to the making of democratic government
and to conceive of democracy as a global force? Does that mean that democracy is available to all societies or
does that mean that the expansion of capital globally is being called"democracy?" To get at the stakes in this
question, the course will consider in depth the impact of the"third wave" of democratization on Latin America
and Africa. What processes are being designated as "democratic," why do they coincide with high levels of
socio-economic inequality, and what is the impulse behind democratization? Finally, the course will address the
role of identities, especially ethno-cultural ones, in democracies: what weight do identities play in representation
and what impact does representation via identity have on equality in democratic government?

PSCI 256(F) Politics of Africa (Same as Africana Studies 256)*
There is a widespread of image of Africa as lawless, violent, and anarchic; it is an image that pervades western
commentary and media. And it is not entirely unfounded: it has been difficult to instill political order in some
parts of Africa. This course will examine why government is weak in some contemporary African countries and
why it is stronger in others. Why are some African countries prone to political violence while others are not?
What are the forces that have shaped African politics, violent or peaceful? How do race, ethnicity, and civil soci-
ety operate in different societies? Do they produce different political outcomes and, if so, how? And finally, how
are these forces influencing policy choices, ethnic relations, and democracy in contemporary Africa? To address
these questions, we will review Africa's rich political history.

PSCI 264(F) Politics of Global Tourism
A decade ago, tourism passed oil to become the world's most valuable export. This arguably frivolous activity
accounts for more than 10 percent of global GNP, and employs an enormous number of people. Tourism ac-
counts for most of the revenue that the poorest countries receive; meanwhile, presidents and prime ministers of
nuclear-capable countries beg on TV for visitors. Where are the politics in this vast, complicated industry and
why is no one paying attention? This class explores types of tourism, asking what happens in a tourist encounter,
who benefits, who loses, and what changes. We will examine cases-Antigua vs. Auschwitz, Angkor Wat vs.
Alaska-to help us understand the process from the points of view of the tourists, the toured-upon, and the govern-
ments and international organizations that oversee this industry. Our readings range from academic sociology
(MacCannell, Veblen) to magazine accounts (Kincaid, Krakauer).

PSCI 269(F) International Movements and Human Rights
The idea that all humans have rights simply because they are human-independent of anything they might do or
achieve-has transformed local and international politics, probably permanently. This concept's place in interna-
tional politics, its strengths and limitations, depend on how people use it. Beginning with the 18th-century's
transatlantic movement to abolish slavery, we will examine international movements and institutions that have
affected what human rights mean, to whom, and where. Readings draw on philosophy (what are rights), history
(who exactly signed what petition) and international politics (how does one affect politics elsewhere), but as a
political science class we emphasize politics. Who benefits from the idea of human rights? Who loses?

PSCI 310(F) Political Psychology (Same as Psychology 345)
Political psychology studies human nature to better understand the possibilities and limitations of politics. For
example, many political philosophers begin their political programs by asserting some foundational claims about
"human nature." These claims are then used to support their vision of politics. Claims about progress often pre-
sume that human nature will be improved by implementing a liberal political agenda. For example, the enlight-
enment held that rationality would be strengthened by progress, thereby making democracy more viable. Those
who defend authoritarian regimes often do so by proclaiming that the general public is incapable of self-rule and
must accept rule by their betters. Many of these arguments turn on how rational people are and on their capacity
for and willingness to pursue justice for all people. We explore what psychology tells us about people as political
citizens and as leaders. The course pays special attention to the powerful, but surprising, roles that emotions play
in all aspects of politics. Central to politics is the general issue of judgment, and its more important variants,
moral and political judgment. If we are to trust ourselves to rule ourselves, how well will we secure justice and
liberty for one and all among us? Political psychology is one of the very oldest disciplines (it can be dated at least
back to the early classic Greeks, among them Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle). The issue of citizen competence for
self and collective rule, then as now, was at the center of their attention. So, it shall be in this course.

PSCI 314T(S) American Political Development (W)
From the Founding to the present, the American political order has undergone incredible, cataclysmic and thor-
oughgoing transformations, yet has also proven to be remarkably enduring. How can this be? Where and how
has the country's political history been stable? What accounts for the timing of upheavals? Who or what causes
them? What sorts of transformations have been possible? Finally, what are the costs of change (and of continu-
ity)-and who pays them? The goal of this tutorial is to gain an understanding of the country's continuity, along
with the impulses behind its transformative episodes, especially in the state's relation to society and to the econo-
my. When does the state protect property and liberty? When does it prioritize equality? We look at what led to the
civil rights movement, how women won the right to vote, and why rights-denying and discriminatory legislation
and practices persist. We also read about the social and economic decisions of particular leaders, such as Franklin
D. Roosevelt, who, some argue, succeeded in building the modern welfare state at the cost of a vibrant democrat-
ic party politics. Last, we look at arguments that America as a whole, and throughout its history, has been "excep-
tional" and unlike other countries, as well as critiques of these arguments, to help us gain an understanding of
future possibilities for political change.

PSCI 315(S) Parties in American Politics
Political parties have played a central role in extending democracy and organizing power in the United
States, yet their worth is a continuing subject of debate. In one ideal formulation, parties not only link
citizens to their government, they also provide the coherency and unity needed to govern in a political
system in which power is widely dispersed. But there is also an American tradition of antipathy toward
parties. They have been criticized for inflaming divisions among the people and for grid-locking the
government. For others, political parties fail to offer citizens meaningful choices; the Republican and
Democratic parties are likened to a choice between "tweedledee and tweedledum." This course will
investigate this debate over parties by examining their nature and role in American political life, both
past and present. How have the parties changed over time? Throughout the course, we will explore such
questions as: What constitutes a party? For whom do they function? Why a two-party system, and what
role do third parties play? Is partisanship good or bad for democracy? For governance? And, in the age of
technology and mass communications, are parties still relevant?

voting policy originate. This course is an overview of this process and the pivotal convergences between the legal

This course is an exploration of modern (post-1870) imperialism, both formal and informal. Our approach is
historical as well as contemporary with a particular emphasis on the imperial powers themselves. We will trace
the evolution of imperialist policies from the late nineteenth century to the present, the political-economic effects
of such policies, and the evolving efforts of scholars to understand and explain them. We will also spend time
investigating the post-9/11 vogue on both the left and the right of referring to the United States as an`empire'.
Both marxist and non-marxist analyses are offered from a variety of explanatory angles: political economy, ma-
crosociology, psychology, culture. Along the way we will read classic texts from Marx, Lenin, Wallerstein,
Gramsci, Hobson, Schumpeter, Arendt, Kipling and Said, as well as wrestle with contemporary arguments over
American power and influence today.
Animating questions include: Why do states expand? Who benefits from imperialism? Can there be imperialism
without colonies? What are the domestic effects of being an empire? Are empires doomed to collapse? Is there a
positive side to imperialism? Are Iraq and Afghanistan part of an expanding American `empire'?

PSCI 331T(S) Non-Profit Organization and Community Change (W)
Two converging realities create a political and intellectual problem: an evolving recognition of the vitality of
private sector supported community organization work; and the challenge that such organizations may have to
assume a larger role due to reductions in public agency support and declining participation among the poor and
racial minorities. In the United States these agencies-essentially NGOs-play important roles in communities and
movements, often modeling the very programs adopted by the government. Some, like the Highlander Center,
have near-mythical status in our memories about what it means to struggle for social change; others, including
HARYOU, were critical in structuring thought about anti-poverty strategies. In recent years some like Teach for
America have plunged into the thick of the effort to keep public education a viable option. This tutorial examines
the role of non-profits and social justice work in the United States focusing on the non-profit as a type, gover-
nance and staffing, fund-raising and persecution.

In this course, we will explore the contemporary contours of what nineteenth-century thinkers called "the
woman question". We will take up a range of perspectives on the "gendered" nature of political concepts and
categories, on what constitutes women's oppression, and on what would free women from this condition. Some
of the questions we address include: How should we explain differences and inequalities between men and
women, by invoking biological factors or by pointing to social and historical factors? Is there a unified concept
of"woman" which can ground an emancipatory project and secure a common basis for political solidarity? Can
we make general claims about women's and men's lives without negating important differences in terms of race,
nation, class, and sexuality? What are the contemporary uses and abuses of classical theories of women's eman-
cipation? Our readings will be drawn from such authors as John Stuart Mill, Friedrich Engels, Alexandra Kollan-
tai, Emma Goldman, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Simone de Beauvoir, Audre Lorde, Adrienne Rich, Donna Har-
away, Gloria Anzaldua, bell hooks, Luce Irigaray, Catherine MacKinnon, Gail Rubin, Judith Butler, Iris Young,
Nancy Fraser, Gayatri Spivak, Wendy Brown, and Chandra Mohanty. In addition to tracing the development of
different contemporary feminist perspectives--including liberal, Marxist, psychoanalytic, poststructuralist, and
postcolonial views--we will examine these arguments in relation to particular issues in theory and practice, in-
cluding prostitution, pornography, and marriage.

PSCI 337T(S) Nietzsche and the Critique of Modern Life (W)
Friedrich Nietzsche is among the most important and controversial figures in the western philosophical tradition.
Recently, political thinkers have turned to Nietzsche's writings for insight into power, subjectivity, and the limits
of conventional philosophical discourse in capturing the complexity of contemporary political life. However,
Nietzsche's return to contemporary political theory is not without its difficulties, vexations, and controversies.
Can it be that this resolutely anti-democratic thinker speaks to contemporary political life and, if so, how? This
tutorial aims to provide a rigorous introduction to this very challenging thinker through a survey of his major
works. We will undertake a careful consideration of the development of his thought from the late 1860s until his
collapse in 1889. We will examine Nietzsche's critique of modern western civilization, with a specific emphasis
on his notions of tragedy, nihilism, eternal recurrence and amor fati, the death of God, the last man and the over-
man, ressentiment, genealogical critique, and the revaluation of values. We will conclude our study with some

PSCI 346(S) Mexican Politics*
The futures of Mexico and the United States are now bound up more closely than ever. Yet Mexico enters this
future with a very different past, a distinctive political system, and mixed feelings about the US. This course has
four parts that differ both in content and in format. The first is historical and mostly lecture. It considers several
themes, including the slow emergence of a stable national state and the interplay between politics and economic
change. In the second section, enrollment permitting, the class breaks into tutorial groups to consider four general
themes that link historical and cultural themes with contemporary problems: the politics of Mexican national
identity; the impact of migration and the rapid development of the northern border region; urbanization; and
political corruption. In the third section of the course, we have standard lecture-and-discussion classes on con-
temporary economic and political issues. At the end, we turn to a seminar-style discussion of student research
projects.

SENIOR COURSES
PSCI 410(F) Senior Seminar in American Politics: Interpretations of American Politics
Current assessments of the state of American politics vary widely. Though recent polls show that as many as 60
percent of Americans think that the country is headed down the wrong-track, it is not clear what that means.
Critics on the left worry that the United States is on an imperial quest, extorting resources from the global many
for the advantage of an elite few. Critics on the right worry that the U.S. has abandoned the traditions that made it
strong and has entered a period of moral decay. What are we to make of these different assessments? What do left
and right see when they survey the nation, and why is what they see so different? Any diagnosis of contemporary
maladies is premised on a vision of what a healthy functioning republic looks like. Our task in the seminar is to
uncover and interrogate those visions. We will do this by exploring different interpretations of American politics,
each with its own story of narrative tensions and possible resolutions. We will then leverage our investigation of
how different authors, and different traditions, understand the nation, as a whole, to help us assess contemporary
politics and come to our own conclusions about what animates it. Format: seminar. Requirements: brief weekly
writing assignments; two short essays; a 15-page research paper; and oral presentation.

PSCI 420(S) Senior Seminar in International Relations: Power and Inequality
This course is a theoretical investigation of power--state power certainly, but moreso power beyond the formal
boundaries of the state--and an application of that understanding to explanations of contemporary forms of
political-economic inequality. The first half of the course wrestles with the legacies of Karl Marx, Max Weber
and Thorstein V
eblen in their and their followers' studies of political and economic power. The second half of the
course is empirical, studying in turn: inequality at the global scale; inequality within Africa, the world's most
unequal continent; and rising inequality within the United States over the last thirty years.
Along the way we will query some of the foundational premises of our globalizing society. How should we
define and measure inequality? How important is inequality when compared to absolute poverty? Is globaliza-
tion reducing or increasing the gap between rich and poor? To what degree is power exercised through the mar-
ket? Do the wealthy have more because of the poverty of others, or despite it? Do the rich have an interest in
fostering poverty, or in ending it? Must the poor exert power over the rich to reduce inequality--or would the
poor do better to imitate the rich instead?
Format: seminar. Requirements: daily discussion questions, three short papers, long final research paper, class

PSCI 430(F) Senior Seminar in Political Theory: Global Justice
One of the most important issues in normative political theory today is the problem of global justice. As the gap
between rich and poor nations increases and the changes associated with globalization render states' borders
increasingly ineffectual, moral and political philosophers can arguably no longer confine their theories of justice
to the safe space of single liberal democratic entities, such as the United States. Looming human and environ-
mental crises underscore the need to look beyond one's borders when thinking about the goals of equality and
well-being or flourishing, and the duties we owe to others. This course takes up the main works in normative
theorizing about global justice, and also looks at the possibility of transnational institutions for justice, starting
with Immanuel Kant and David Hume and moving on to such contemporary authors as John Rawls, Thomas
Pogge, Amartya Sen, Martha Nussbaum, Onora O'Neill, Antonio Negri, Richard Rorty, Anthony Appiah, Ron-
ald Dworkin, G.A. Cohen, Peter Singer, and Michael Walzer.
Format: discussion. Requirements: class participation and oral presentation, one mid-term paper, and one final
paper.
Prerequisites: open to juniors and seniors with a background in political theory or philosophy (or permission of
instructor). Enrollment limit: 15 (expected 12).

PSCI 440(F) Senior Seminar in Comparative Politics: The State
Everybody talks about "The State," but what do they mean? What is the state? Where do states get their authority
and power? Where do they come from and why do some states collapse while others survive? Why are some
states strong and others weak? And, really, what does it mean to call a state "strong" or "weak"? Should political
science in general and comparative politics in particular even use states as the central unit of analysis? What do
political scientists see and, perhaps more important, what do they miss by this focus on states? This senior semi-
nar examines a variety of definitions and perspectives on the state.
Format: seminar. Requirements: readings, 2 literature reviews presented in class, and 1 research paper.
Prerequisites: Political Science 201 or 202 or 203 or 204 or permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 15

PSCI 481(F)-W33-482(S) Advanced Study in American Politics
A year of independent study under the direction of the Political Science faculty, to be awarded to the most distin-
guished candidate based upon competitive admissions. The candidate, designated the Sentinels of the Republic
Scholar, receives a research stipend to cover costs associated with the proposed project. The Sentinels Scholar
may submit her/his essay for consideration for honors in Political Science.
Admission is awarded on the basis of demonstrated capacity for distinguished work and on the proposal's prom-
ise for creative contributions to the understanding of topics on the federal system of government. Anyone with a
prospective proposal should contact the department chair for guidance.
PSCI 493(F)-W31-494(S) Senior Thesis
The senior major, having applied for and been accepted into the honors program during the second semester of
the junior year, will devote the senior year to researching and writing a substantial and original work of scholar-
ship, under the supervision of a faculty mentor to be assigned by the department. The final work will be sub-
mitted for evaluation by a committee made up of the faculty supervisor and two additional readers to be chosen
by the department, in consultation with the supervisor. Thesis writers will not only work with their advisors but
will participate in a weekly honors seminar supervised by a faculty member in political science. The seminar
(which is one component of the 493-W31-494 designation and not a separate course) will provide a focused
forum for the exchange of ideas among the honors students, who will regularly circulate sections of their theses-
in-progress for peer review and critique. The faculty seminar leader's primary role is one of coordination and
guidance.

MAJOR
For the degree in Psychology, students must complete a minimum of nine courses as outlined below:
1) Psychology 101 Introductory Psychology
2) Psychology 201 Experimentation and Statistics
3) Three 200-level courses, with at least one from each of the following groups.
Group A Psychology 212 Neuroscience
Psychology 221 Cognitive Psychology*
Psychology 222 Cognitive Science*
Group B Psychology 232 Developmental Psychology
Psychology 242 Social Psychology
Psychology 252 Psychological Disorders
Psychology 272 Psychology of Education
* Either Psychology 221 or 222, but not both, can count towards the three required 200-level courses.
4) Three 300-level courses from at least two of the areas listed below:
Area 1: Behavioral Neuroscience (courses with middle digit 1)
Area 2: Cognitive Psychology (courses with middle digit 2)
Area 3: Developmental Psychology (courses with middle digit 3)
Area 4: Social Psychology (courses with middle digit 4)
Area 5: Clinical Psychology (courses with middle digit 5)
Area 7: Educational Psychology (courses with middle digit 7)
At least one of these courses must be from among those carrying the format designation Empirical Lab
Course.
5) Psychology 401 Perspectives on Psychological Issues
Students who place out of Psychology 101 are still required to take nine courses to complete the major.
The department recommends that students take Psychology 201 in their sophomore year. The department
requires that 201 be completed by the end of the junior year.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN PSYCHOLOGY
Students who are candidates for honors need take only two 300-level courses from two different areas, but
they must enroll in Psychology 493-W31-494 and write a thesis based on original empirical work. Presentation
of athesis, however, should not be interpreted as a guarantee of a degree with honors. Guidelines for pursuing the
degree with honors are available from the department.
STUDY ABROAD
With some advance planning, studying abroad (especially for one semester) can easily be worked into the
psychology major. To facilitate this, we recommend that students:
1) meet with the Department Chair as soon as they decide that they are interested in studying abroad
2) take Psychology 201 (Experimentation and Statistics) in the sophomore year
3) think ahead to the 300-level courses they are interested in taking so that they can fulfill the 200-level pre-
requisites before they go away or, if possible, while they are away. In our experience, study abroad pro-
grams in the following places are most likely to offer psychology courses: England, Ireland, Scotland,
Spain, Australia, New Zealand, Hawaii, and Scandinavia. Students should procure the descriptions of the
psychology courses they are considering taking and bring them to their meeting with the Chair.
There are some costs to studying away, particularly for the year. This limits students' opportunities to choose
the particular 300-level courses they would like to take and they must sometimes settle for those that are open,
those which happen to be offered, or those for which they have the prerequisites, once they return in their senior
year. Many students who are keen on psychology begin doing research with professors during their junior year,
and for some this leads to an honors thesis in the senior year, summer research, etc. If you are going away for the
entire year and do not make such connections with a professor ahead of time (i.e., before you go), you may lose
out on some of these opportunities to deepen your involvement in the major on campus. On the other hand,
studying abroad can be an invaluable learning experience, so you need to think carefully, in consultation with
your advisor and/or the Department Chair, about the costs and benefits of it. Very occasionally, a student who just
begins taking psychology courses late in the sophomore year and wishes to go abroad for the year finds that
he/she is not able to do both, or is restricted in the choice of study-abroad programs.

This course introduces students to a broad range of theories and research on education. What models of teaching
work best, and for what purposes? How do we measure the success of various education practices? What is the
best way to describe the psychology processes by which children gain information and expertise? What accounts
for individual differences in learning, and how do teachers (and schools) address these individual needs? How do
social and economic factors shape teaching practices and the educational experiences of individual students? The
course will draw from a wide range of literature (research, theory, and first hand accounts) to consider key ques-
tions in the psychology of education. Upon completion of the course, students should be familiar with central
issues in pre-college education and know how educational research and the practice of teaching affect one anoth-
er.

PSYC 322(F) Concepts: Mind, Brain, and Culture
Every time we see something as a kind of thing, every time that we decide that an object is a cup rather than a
glass, when we recognize a picture of a familiar face as a picture of ourselves, or even when we understand
speech, we are employing categories. Most categorization decisions are automatic and unconscious, and there-
fore have the illusion of simplicity. The complexity of these decisions, however, becomes apparent when we
attempt to build machines to do what humans perform so effortlessly. What are the systems in place that allow us
this extraordinary ability to segment the world? Are they universal? How does conceptual knowledge differ
across cultural groups? How do concepts affect our perception? How do the categories of experts differ from the
categories of novices? Do children have the same kind of conceptual knowledge as adults? How are categories
represented in the brain? In this course, we explore various empirical findings from cognitive psychology, cogni-
tive neuroscience, and anthropology that address these questions.
Format: Empirical Lab Course. Requirements: short papers, class presentation, and research paper.
Prerequisites: Psychology 221 or 222 or permission of instructor.Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 15). Preference

PSYC 325(S) Psychology of Language
Language plays a central role in our lives and is the primary manner in which we communicate our experiences
and views of the world with one another. In this course, we ask several fundamental questions about the psychol-
ogy of language: Are all languages essentially the same or different? What is the relationship between language
and thought? How are concepts represented by language? Why do children learn languages so effortlessly? To
what extent is language a special cognitive system? What are the biological foundations of language? We will
address these questions by critically reviewing classic and contemporary literature concerning language compre-
hension and production, with emphasis given to experimental techniques researchers have used to study lan-
guage. All students will design and conduct an empirical research project.
Format: Empirical Lab Course. Requirements: a series of weekly1- to 2-page response papers, participation in
class discussion, written and oral reports of empirical research.
Prerequisites: Psychology 221 and 201 (or 222 and 201) or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 19 (ex-
pected: 15). Preference given to Psychology majors.

PSYC 326(F) Choice and Decision Making
One aspect of "being human" is that we often make choices that we know are bad for us. In this course we survey
theoretical and experimental approaches to understanding our strengths and weaknesses as decision makers.
Topics include normative decision theories, biases in probability judgments, "fast and frugal" heuristics, impul-
siveness and self-control, addictions and bad habits, gambling, and moral decision making.
Format: seminar, with scheduled lab. Requirements: lab attendance, an empirical research project, a written re-
port of the research project, short essays, and class participation.
Prerequisites: Psychology 221 or 222 or permission of instructor. Permission is typically given to students who
have successfully completed Economics 110. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 15). Preference given to senior
psychology majors who need the course to fulfill the major. Satisfies one semester of the Division II requirement.
Hour: 1:10-2:25 TF Lab: 1:10-3:50 R KIRBY
PSYC 332(F) Cognitive Development
In this course we consider how mental abilities, such as language, memory, thinking and imagination develop
during the childhood years. We begin by asking how infants, who do not have language, make sense of their
world and how language, once acquired, changes the way children understand their world. We study how chil-
dren remember events, both every day and traumatic, and how memory relates to narratives about the self. We
examine the development of thinking, reasoning, and imagination (e.g. pretend play, imaginary companions) and
their intersection with related topics, such as children's ability to distinguish between fantasy and reality.
Throughout these discussions, we consider the impact of biology (e.g. changes in the brain) and culture on cogni-
tion, as well as the similarities and differences in the cognitive abilities of normally-developing children and chil-
dren with developmental problems (e.g., autism). All students will design and conduct an empirical research
project.
Format: Empirical Lab Course. Requirements: hour exam, thought papers, and a written/oral report of final re-
search project.
Prerequisites: Psychology 201 and Psychology 232 or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 20 (expected:

PSYC 333(F) Children's Lives: Thinking, Feeling and Doing
How do we know what children know, what they feel, and what they do? This course provides students with
direct experience with children and the approaches used to investigate the world of childhood. Through
observation and interaction with children, we discover how they develop social skills, sex roles, emotions and
emotion control, and self-knowledge. All students will design and conduct an empirical research project.
Format: Empirical Lab Course. Requirements: two hour tests and a report of research project.
Prerequisites: Psychology 232 and Psychology 201. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected:15). Preference given to

and emotional growth. The theoretical and empirical work addressing these broad areas of development from the
prenatal period and throughout the first two years is covered. Special attention is given to the dynamic interplay
of environmental and biological influences on early development and the unique methodological challenges
posed to scientists who examine infant behavior and development.
Format: Empirical Lab Course. Requirements: active class participation, regular thought papers and class pre-
sentations based on these, and a written report and accompanying presentation of an independent research proj-
ect.

PSYC 340(F) Ideologies, Values, Worldviews
The September 11th attacks, the war on terror, and the polarization of the electorate have stimulated a resurgence
of interest in the psychological bases and functions of ideologies. In this course we will examine conservative,
liberal, reactionary, and progressive ideologies from a social psychological perspective. How do ordinary people
Psychology
­ 276 ­
become political extremists? Why do people sometimes vote against their own material self­interest? How do
ideologies bias our interpretations of events and how do psychological biases influence the appeal of competing
ideologies? Why do some social problems attract a great deal of attention while other, arguably more important
problems are ignored? How do implicit ideologies influence everyday judgment? We will draw on theoretical
perspectives and methodologies from social psychology, sociology, and political science to address these and
many other relevant questions.
Format: seminar. Requirements: brief reaction papers and a final integrative paper.

PSYC 341(S) Stereotypes, Prejudice, and Discrimination (W)
This course will examine social psychological theories and research that are relevant to the understanding of
stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination. We will take a variety of social psychological perspectives,
emphasizing sociocultural, cognitive, personality, or motivational explanations. We will examine the impact that
stereotypes and prejudice have on people's perceptions of and behaviors toward particular groups or group
members and will explore a variety of factors that tend to exacerbate or weaken this impact. We also will
consider some of the sources of stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination and some of the processes through
which they are maintained, strengthened, or revised. In addition, we will examine some of the effects that
stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination can have on members of stereotyped groups, as well as some
implications of the social psychological research findings for issues such as education and business and
government policies. A major component of this course will be the examination of classic and ongoing empirical
research.

PSYC 358(S) Mood and Personality
Over the lifespan there are stable differences between individuals in mood-such as differences in how irritable,
optimistic or anxious a person feels on average. We will investigate the origins, hypothesized functions, and con-
sequences of the major moods, consider how mood tendencies inform personality, and explore what is known
about both conscious and unconscious influences on mood. Readings will include theoretical articles, empirical

PSYC 372(F) Advanced Seminar in Teaching and Learning
This advanced seminar will give students an opportunity to connect theory to practice. Each student will have a
teaching placement in a local school, and participate in both peer and individual supervision. In addition, we will
read a range of texts that examine different approaches to teaching, as well as theory and research on the process
of education. What is the best way to teach? How do various theories of children and pedagogy translate into
everyday practices with students? Students will be encouraged to reflect and modify their own teaching practices
as a result of what we read as well as their supervision. Questions we will discuss include: What is the relation-
ship between educational goals and curriculum development? What is the relation between substance (knowl-
edge, skills, content) and the interpersonal dynamic inherent in a classroom setting? How do we assess teaching
practices, and the students' learning? What does it take to be an educated person?
Format: seminar. Requirements: This course involves a field placement, weekly readings, as well as seminar
discussion, supervision, 1 essay and 1 final paper.

RELIGION (Div. II)
Chair, Associate Professor DENISE K. BUELL
Professors: BUELL, DARROW, DREYFUS**. Assistant Professors: HAMMERSCHLAG, JOSEPH-
SON, SHUCK. Visiting Assistant Professor: GUTSCHOW**.
MAJOR
The major in Religion is designed to perform two related functions: to expose the student to the methods and
issues involved in the study of religion as a universal phenomenon of psychological, sociological, and cultural/
historical dimensions; and to confront students with the beliefs, practices, and values of specific religions through
a study of particular religious traditions. It is a program that affords each student an opportunity to fashion his/her
own sequence of study within a prescribed basic pattern constructed to ensure both coherence and variety. It
consists of at least nine semester courses as follows:
Required sequence courses
Religion 101 Introduction to Religion
Two seminars (courses numbered 280, 301-309)
Religion 402 Issues in the Study of Religion
Elective courses
Five additional courses in Religion are to be selected in such a way that at least one course is taken in both the
Western and non-Western traditions. Students will construct their sequence in consultation with departmental
Religion
­ 278 ­
advisors and subject to their approval. In order to achieve a deep coverage of a particular religious tradition or set
of related problems in the study of religion, students are urged to select three electives that together have some
kind of coherence, be it cultural, historical, or topical. Related courses from other departments or programs may
be included among the three courses, and the point of coherence can be the subject of research papers in the
senior seminar.
Students are advised to elect additional courses in related fields (e.g., psychology, sociology, anthropology, art,
history, philosophy) in order to gain a clearer understanding of the social and cultural contexts in which religions
appear.
For those who wish to go beyond the formally-listed courses into a more intensive study of a particular
religious tradition, methodological trend, or religious phenomenon (e.g., ritual, symbol-formation, mysticism,
theology, etc.), there is the opportunity to undertake independent study or, with the approval of the department, to
pursue a thesis project.
The value of the major in Religion derives from its fostering of a critical appreciation of the complex role
religion plays in every society, even those that consider themselves non-religious. The major makes one sensitive
to the role religion plays in shaping the terms of cultural discourse, of social attitudes and behavior, and of moral
reflection. But it also discloses the ways in which religion and its social effects represent the experience of indi-
vidual persons and communities. In doing these things, the major further provides one with interdisciplinary
analytical tools and cross-cultural experience and opens up new avenues for dealing with both the history of a
society and culture and the relationships between different societies and cultures. What one learns as a Religion
major is therefore remarkably applicable to a wide range of other fields of study or professions.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN RELIGION
The degree with honors in Religion requires the above-mentioned nine courses and the preparation of a thesis
of 75+ pages with a grade of B+ or better. A thesis may combine revised work done in other courses with new
material prepared while enrolled either in Religion 493-W31 or Religion W31-494. Up to two-thirds of the work
in the thesis may be such revised work, but at least one-third must represent new work. The thesis must constitute
a coherent whole either by its organizing theme or by a focus on a particular religious tradition. Candidates will
also be expected to present the results of their thesis orally in a public presentation. Students who wish to be
candidates for honors in Religion will submit proposals and at least one paper that may be included in the thesis
to the department in the spring of their junior year. Students must normally have at least a 3.5 GPA in Religion to
be considered for the honors program.
The chair will serve as advisor to non-majors.
STUDY ABROAD
The Williams College Religion Department encourages potential majors to study abroad in order to enhance
their education and gain international perspectives on religious studies. There are many excellent study abroad
opportunities offering students a variety of possible experiences: among them cultural immersion, field work,
intensive language learning, independent study, participation in another educational system. Many of our majors
study in the Williams College Oxford Program, but our majors also regularly pursue a semester or year-long
study in other programs.
REL 101(F,S) Introduction to Religion
As an examination of the structure and dynamics of certain aspects of religious thought, action, and sensibility--
employing psychological, sociological, anthropological, and philosophical modes of inquiry--the course offers
a general exposure to basic methodological issues in the study of religion, and includes consideration of several
cross-cultural types of religious expression in non-literate and literate societies.

THE JEWISH TRADITION
REL 201(F) The Hebrew Bible (Same as Comparative Literature 201 and Jewish Studies 201)
The Hebrew Bible is perhaps the single most influential work in the history of Western philosophy, literature, and
art. But the overwhelming presence of the text in nearly every aspect of modern culture often obscures the sheer
brilliance of its narrative technique as well as the complex interplay between law, history, prophecy, and poetry.
This course offers a comprehensive introduction to the literary, historical, and theological aspects of the Hebrew
Bible with an eye towards developing a sophisticated understanding of the text in its ancient context. Through the
close reading of substantial portions of the Hebrew Scripture in translation and the application of various modern
critical approaches to culture and literature, students will explore fundamental questions about the social, ritual,
and philosophical history of ancient Israel, as well as the fundamental power of storytelling that has resonated
across two millennia.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, short written assignments, and two
longer papers.

REL 204(F) Endtimes: Messianism in Modernity (Same as Jewish Studies 204 and Philosophy
204) (W)
The sociologist Zygmunt Bauman has described modernity as the period of the world's disenchantment, when
God absconded and religion was either rationalized or reduced to the category of superstition. Ironically, this very
disenchantment might help to explain the persistence of the concept of the messianic in even the most secular
branches of modern European thought. One of Judaism's most powerful and elastic concepts, the notion of the
messiah saw a variety of radically different interpretations between the 17th and 20th centuries. This course will
consider the range of modern interpretations of the messiah, taking as its concrete starting point the Sabbatian
Heresy of the 17th century and concluding with Derrida's philosophical development of the concept of the mes-
sianic as pure interruption. The course's aim is to use messianism as a focal point around which to consider the
dynamic relationship between philosophy and Judaism in modernity. This course will expose the mutual in-
fluences of these two forces, illustrating both how Enlightenment conceptions of progress helped to create the
notion of "messianism" understood as an abstract idea, and how the modern/post-modern philosophical concep-
tion of the "messianic" as a force that interrupts time is dependent upon historical studies of the messianic dimen-
sion of traditional Judaism. The readings for each class will not generally exceed 40 pages but will require close
attention. Authors to be read include GWF Hegel, Immanuel Kant, Hermann Cohen, Franz Rosenzweig, Ger-
shom Scholem, Walter Benjamin, and Jacques Derrida.
Format: seminar. Requirements will include regular participation, weekly writing assignments of 2-3 pages, and
a final 12- to 15-page paper an approved topic of the student's choice.

The story of the Jewish man who drove Christ away when he stopped to rest for a moment on his way to the
Crucifixion and was doomed to roam the earth until the Advent is one of the most enduring and productive tales
of the Middle Ages. Alternately a shoemaker, carpenter, or even doorkeeper to Pontius Pilate, the Wandering Jew
appears in the folklore, literature, and visual arts of every region and era in European history. This course will
explore the rich and varied traditions associated with this legend from its pre-history in the Hebrew Bible and the
Gospels up through its early modern and Romantic heyday. In readings ranging from medieval chronicles and
Reformation pamphlets to works by Chaucer, Schiller, Shelley, and Hans Christian Andersen, we will trace the
evolution of this mysterious wanderer from reviled figure of anti-Jewish polemic, to righteous convert and mis-
sionary, to learned sage. Along the way we will also examine the intersection of the tale with such legendary
figures as Cain, Prester John, and the Wild Huntsman. We will then turn to several modern literary reflections
and contemporary artistic renderings of the story. All readings are in translation.
Format: discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation and several writing assignments.

students to a range of methods of biblical interpretation, to cultivate an understanding of the texts in the ancient
historical and literary contexts of the Roman Empire, Judaism, and emerging Christian communities in which
individual New Testament writings were composed and interpreted. The course also explores the process by
which this collection of writings became authoritative for Christians.

REL 221(S) Post-Enlightenment Christian Thought
Christianity in the Western world has undergone numerous challenges since the early eighteenth century. Many
thinkers have turned inward, developing pietistic theologies compatible with the modern world, while others
have searched for an adequate expression of Christianity after the "Death of God." Another, remarkably resilient
strand has actively turned against the Enlightenment in ironic ways, appropriating modern technologies, for ex-
ample, while repudiating scientific discoveries that undermine their belief. This course will examine these issues,
along with a careful consideration of the way gender, identity, and community have come to play a powerful role
in contemporary expressions of Christian belief.

REL 226(S) New Religions in North America (Same as American Studies 226)
This course explores contemporary North America religion from a historical, sociological, and philosophical
perspective. We will examine the historical and contemporary experiences of America's ever-expanding
religious diversity, prominently featuring the voices of those traditionally excluded from older, Protestant-in-
formed accounts of American religion. The focus of the course will be the exploration of the ever-expanding
variety of new religions in North America, challenging students to engage the numerous cultural, philosophical,
and methodological issues involved with the study of marginal religions. New religions often highlight cultural
anxieties, e.g. loss of identity in contemporary secular societies, responses to new technologies, changing gender
roles, globalization, etc. The study of new religions becomes, then, a closer, reflexive examination of contempo-
rary American culture and its underlying tensions. For example, the Raëlian Movement claims to have cloned
the first human. Wicca, on the other hand, offers critiques of environmental depredation and traditional gender
roles. In sum, we will explore the historical roots of the current boom in new religions, detail contemporary is-
sues, and outline the possible forms new and emerging religions may assume in the coming years. This course
will also have a website dedicated to the exploration of new religions, providing links to interesting sites, basic
resources, and student essays/projects.
Lecture/discussion. Students will be evaluated on the basis of their writing and presentation projects, three 5- to

REL 231(S) The Origins of Islam: God, Empire and Apocalypse (Same as History 209)*
The rise of Islam in the seventh-century C.E. is usually seen, by both Muslim and non-Muslim historians, as a
total break with the past. This course will challenge that assumption by placing the rise of Islam in the context of
the history of late antiquity (c. 300-700 C.E.). The first half of the course will examine the impact of Judeo-Chris-
tian monotheism in the ancient world, the rise of confessional empires, articulation of new ideas about holiness
and its relation to sexuality and the transformations undergone by Judaism, Christianity, Zoroastrianism and
Manichaeism. We shall examine the conversation of these traditions with classical paganism and philosophy, the
internal struggle within traditions to define rules of interpretation, the impact of ascetic, iconoclastic and apoca-
lyptic ideas and, finally, polemics among the traditions. Special attention will be given to borderlands (Armenia,
Syria, and Arabia), where the problems of regionalism and religious diversity were prominent. We will then
examine the career of Muhammad (PBUH) in the context of Arabia, the spread of the Islamic empire into Chris-
tian and Iranian worlds, the impact of apocalyptic expectations, the fixation of religious decision-making within
the tradition and the question of conversion and religious diversity within the commonwealth of Islam. The
course will end with the flourishing of the Abbasid empire in the ninth century. This course will make use of the
Antioch 2000 exhibit at the Worcester Art Museum.

REL 234(F) Shi'ism Ascendant?*
One consequence, intended or not, of recent U.S. actions in the Middle East has been to inflame the Sunni/Shi'ite
division and raise fears of Shi'ite ascendancy. Sectarian conflict is, in fact, the exception rather than the rule in
Islamic history because Sunnis and Shi'a have in most places been separate and lived relatively peacefully to-
gether where they intermixed. This is the fourth time in Islamic history when the specter of an ascendant Shi'ism
has occupied the Muslim community. Shi'ism has always been an alliance of the dispossessed and the intellectu-
als (assuming the latter are not among the former) and functioned in Islam to provide a vocabulary of revolution,
a highly developed philosophy of religion, and a pietistic fervor in contrast to which Sunnism emerged. This
course will compare the three earlier putative episodes of Shi'ite ascendancy in the eighth, tenth and sixteenth
centuries C.E. and set these in conversation with contemporary developments. We will focus on the role of early
Shi'ism as the vocabulary of an alternative vision of the legitimacy of the Islamic state, the ideas of the imamate
and martyrdom, the emergence of Isma'ili and Twelver versions of Shi'ism, the conversion of Safavid Iran to
Shi'ism, the Iranian revolution of 1979 and the scene in the post-Saddam Islamic world.

Often depicted as Shangrila, a mythical and ideal country, Tibet has had the dubious privilege of being a focus of
Western orientalism. One cannot but wonder about the motives and sources of this mythology. But, rather than
focus narcissistically on "our" representations, this course mostly looks at "them," examining more particularly
the cultural and historical aspects of Tibetan civilization. We first consider the early history of Tibet, the introduc-
tion of Buddhism in this country, the relations between Buddhism and the indigenous religion, and some of the
stages in the development of Tibetan Buddhism. In this way we see how Buddhism in Tibet became integrated in
an overall religious system that comprises much more than the doctrines and practices often essentialized as
"Buddhism." We also examine the historical developments that led to the development of the institutions (such
as the Dalai-Lama) unique to Tibet, consider the more recent tragic events and examine the profound trans-
formations that they have brought to this culture. Throughout the course we focus on the unusually central role
that the complex interaction that religion and politics has had in Tibetan history. In this way, we get a footing in
the Tibetan world, and the assessment of Western representations of Tibet becomes not just an exercise in self-re-
flection but also a gate to a better understanding of a remarkable civilization.

REL 251(F) Zen Buddhism: History and Historiography*
Because mystifying references to Zen are strewn throughout American popular culture-from episodes of the
Simpsons to names of perfumes and snack foods-most Americans have an image of Zen Buddhism that is dis-
connected from anything actually practiced in East Asia. This course offers a corrective to this image by familiar-
izing students with both the history of Zen and the historiographical roots of these popular perceptions. This
course will examine the origins of Zen (Ch'an) in China, trace its transmission to Japan, and cover its develop-
ment in both cultural contexts. It will conclude with an examination of Zen's unique role in American popular
culture. The course will enrich the conventional image of Zen by addressing its involvement with power and
governance, gods and demons, mummies and sacred sites, sex and violence, nationalism and scholarship. Texts
will include selections from primary works in translation (The Platform Sutra of the Sixth Patriarch, The Gate-
less Barrier, The Lancet of Seated Meditation) as well as selections from secondary literature including Suzuki,
Zen and Japanese Culture, Victoria, Zen at War, and Faure, The Rhetoric of Immediacy.

REL 256(S) Engendering Buddhism: How Women and Men Shape and Are Shaped by
Buddhism (Same as Women's and Gender Studies 256) (W)*
This course will address the dual question of how gender has shaped Buddhism as well as how Buddhism has
produced a discourse on gender. We will use the Buddha's own life and his first disciples as a lens to consider the
issue of gender in both early and later formulations of Buddhist soteriology, society, and practice. We explore the
varying lives women and men live in Buddhist literatures and societies across both time and space. Throughout,
we will remain focused on the specific ways in which Buddhism produces individual and social gender hierar-
chies despites its putative goal of gender egalitarianism. Our analysis revolves around several interdependent
themes. (1) Is it possible to gain enlightenment in the female body? How do female and male bodies become the
subject of a specific set of Buddhist gazes in various Buddhist societies? (2) How do biological bodies reflect
social divisions in Buddhist discourse? How and why can sex serve as a means for constructing as much as
transcending difference in Buddhist theory and practice? (3) How do Buddhism and feminism reflect each other
in contemporary theory and practice? Here we turn to contemporary critiques and deconstructions of Buddhism
in America and Asia that focus on radical reinventions of Buddhism and its traditions that seek to re-envision
social and economic difference. Readings may include: Susan Murcott, Liz Wilson, Anne Klein, Miranda Shaw,
Ellison Findly, Caroline Bynum, Mary Douglas, Pierre Bourdieu, Luce Irigaray, Rita Gross, and Don Lopez.

REL 257(F) Gods and Demons in East Asian Religion*
Scholars usually distinguish between three different religious traditions in East Asia: Buddhism, Confucianism,
and Daoism (with Shinto standing in for Daoism in the Japanese case). Yet, this tradition-based approach ignores
the rich landscape of East Asian religion, which encompasses another world of gods and demons only loosely
connected with established institutions. Even today, at popular sites all over China, Taiwan, Japan and Korea,
people offer incense to a heterogeneous collection of supernatural entities-sometimes called gods, goddesses,
demons, immortals, ancestors or even buddhas. The "same" entity can be simultaneously a beneficent god to one
group and a malevolent demon to another. Rather than being static, this rich tapestry is constantly in evolution,
elevating historical heroes (or philosophers) to godhood, while other once popular deities are demoted and dis-
missed as monsters. This course will address this stratum of "popular" religion in East Asia. Focusing on con-
temporary scholarship on China and Japan, we will take a multi-disciplinary approach to this material to provide
a very different picture of East Asian religion as a lived tradition.
Format: seminar. Requirements: active participation, class presentations, one 15-page research paper.

For most of Japanese history religion and government have been closely intertwined. This course will examine
the parallel evolution of political structures and religious institutions in Japan, beginning with the articulation of
the mythological narrative of divine sovereignty in the Kojiki (712) and ending with the separation of Shinto
from the state after World War Two. It will situate concepts such as law, punishment, emperor and nation within
the context of wider politico-religious discourse. We will address issues of religion and violence, nationalism and
utopian imagery, and will raise larger questions about the relationship between human religiosity and power.
Texts to be considered will include selections from law codes and primary works in translation (the Kojiki, The
Religion
­ 283 ­
Constitution of Prince Shotoku, The Tale of the Heike,The Propagation of Zen for theProtection of the State, and
The Constitution of the Empire of Japan) as well as secondary works (Botsman, Punishment and Power in the
Making of Modern Japan, Hardacre, Shinto and the State, Victoria, Zen at War).
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: active participation, three short writing assignments of 3-5 pages, one
15-page research paper.

REL 271(S) Religion and the Modern Literary Imagination (Same as Comparative Literature
271 and English 271) (W)
In this course we will examine themes of religious life such as ritual, sin, redemption, evil, magic, heresy, prophe-
cy, faith and devotion as they appear as sources of conflict and reflection in novels, poems and short stories from
the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Our task will be to consider first, how literary form can be used as a tool to
conceptualize religious experience, but second the ways in which literature, in its expressions of wonder and
despair, converges or conflicts with the aims of worship and religious performance, producing either modern
sacrament or idol. Of the novels, stories and poems that we will read, some will arise directly out of the Christian,
Jewish and Islamic traditions, while others will have more explicitly tangential, or even heretical relations with
these traditions. We will consider a range of novelists from Dostoevsky to Cynthia Ozick and Orhan Pamuk and
a range of poets from Gerard Manley Hopkins to Wallace Stevens and Paul Celan. Assignments will be both
critical and creative. You will be asked to think like a writer and a critic and thus to try your hand at writing a
sestina as well as a personal essay.
Format: seminar. Assignments will include bi-weekly response papers of 1-2 pages, a short essay of 5-7 pages
and a final writing assignment of 8-10 pages.

REL 284(F) Foucault (W)
Michel Foucault was first and foremost a scholar of power. His ironic "genealogies" of how the Enlightenment
promised freedom but instead delivered intricate and perilous technologies of control have inspired philosophers,
intellectual historians, and even novelists. Yet for all of this Foucault is often thought of as having posited a help-
less subject trapped in an inescapable web. Worse, scholars such as Rosie Braidotti have seen this subject as a
uniquely masculine maneuver-ignoring women's struggles. This course will consider Foucault and his own
"mentors," Heidegger, Nietzsche, and Kant, among others, as well as exploring such central questions as Fou-
cault's views on gender and sexuality. We will also examine whether Foucault was able--as he intended--to
move beyond "resistance" in his later writings and help post-Enlightenment individuals engender a more em-
powered sense of subjectivity.

REL 287(F) The Dynamics of Globalization: Society, Religion and the Environment (Same as

This course offers a theoretical reflection on the social, cultural and environmental dynamics of globalization and
their consequences for the nature and place of religion. Rather than argue for or against globalization, we first
examine the nature of this new configuration and its relation to (post)modernity, asking questions such as: What
are the cultural and social dynamics of globalization? What are the effects on the nature of the state and the politi-
cal practices that take place in the global world? What are its environmental consequences? We then shift to
examining the role of religion, arguing that its renewed relevance is a function of the socio-cultural transforma-
tions that globalization brings about, particularly the loss of community and the increasing atomization of indi-

viduals. We conclude by examining some of the perspectives created by the new religious expressions that at-
tempt to respond to this situation, from personal spiritual quests as manifested in interest in Buddhism, ecology or
mountain climbing, to various forms of fundamentalism, such as Evangelicalism, the fastest growing religious
movement in the Americas, and the most radical forms of Islamicism. Reading list: Harvey, The Condition of

REL 288(F) Embodied Mind: A Cross-Cultural Exploration (Same as Philosophy 288)
This course examines some of the central questions concerning the nature of the mind: the place of intentionality,
the role of emotions, the relation with the body, the nature of subjectivity, the scope of reflexivity, etc. In con-
fronting these questions, we do not proceed purely theoretically but consider the contributions of various ob-
servation-based traditions, from Buddhist psychology and meditative practices to phenomenology to neurosci-
ences. We begin by examining some of the central concepts of Buddhist psychology, its treatment of the mind as
a selfless stream of consciousness, its examination of the variety of mental factors and its accounts of the relation
between cognition and affects. We also introduce the practice of meditation as a way to observe the mind and
raise questions concerning the place of its study in the mind-sciences. We pursue this reflection by examining the
views of James, Husserl, Sartre and Merleau-Ponty, particularly as they concern the methods for the study of the
mind and the relation between intentionality, reflexivity and the body. In this way, we develop a rich array of
analytical tools and observational practices to further our understanding of the mind. But we also question the
value of these tools, which are based on first person approaches, by relating them to the third person studies of
neurobiologists such as Damasio. We come to appreciate the importance of considering the biology on which
mental processes are based and the light that this approach throws on the central questions of the course. We
conclude by considering the relation between first and third person studies of the mind, focusing on Varella's
concept of the embodied mind as a fruitful bridge between these different traditions.
Format: seminar. Requirements: attendance to a day-long introduction to the practice of meditation, regular prac-
tice of meditation, a class presentation and a research paper (15 pages).

REL 301(S) Word Virus: Cultural Theory after the Linguistic Turn (Same as Comparative
Literature 301)
"My general theory since 1971 has been that the Word is literally a virus, and that it has not been recognized as
such because it has a achieved a state of relatively stable symbiosis with its human host." (William S. Burroughs
1986, 47). Parallel movements in continental European and Anglo-American philosophy (known popularly as
"the linguistic turn") led to an interdisciplinary emphasis on the way in which language constitutes reality. Lan-
guage could no longer be thought of as simply a mechanism for the transmission of "facts." Increasingly, theo-
rists recognized that differences in language created incommensurable worlds of meaning; that specialized forms
of linguistic discourse are both determined by and constitutive of their putative objects. Accordingly, linguistic
phenomena have taken center stage not only in philosophy, but also in the study of culture and society. The influx
of these new theories of language has also dramatically reshaped the discipline of religious studies. By examin-
ing the linguistic turn and its implications for the study of cultural phenomena, this course will introduce ad-
vanced students to some of the most important theoretical approaches to come out of this movement. Authors
whose work will be considered include: Ludwig Wittgenstein, Ferdinand de Saussure, Benjamin Whorf, George
Lakoff, Claude Lévi-Strauss, Jacques Derrida, Roland Barthes, Paul Ricoeur, Mikhail Bakhtin, Luce Irigaray,
Richard Dawkins, and Dan Sperber.

This course will consider the ongoing conversation between the ideas of religion and reproduction. Both religion
and reproduction are intertwined social and cultural constructions that have profoundly shaped each other. In-
deed, the reproduction of religion itself has depended on policing the reproductive body in ideological and often
contradictory ways. By naturalizing culture and socializing biology, religious discourses have sought to legiti-
mize the endless variety of human practices surrounding reproduction including sexuality, fertility, procreation,
birth, and abortion. We are interested in how conflicting ideologies of reproduction have led to a spate of recent
cultural confrontations over several key issues including sexuality, abortion, the new reproductive technologics,
and motherhood. We will venture afield by culling readings from a range of cultures and disciplines including
religious studies, anthropology, sociology, women's studies, and medicine. Readings may include Emile Durk-

emerged out of particular religious contexts or have been applied to the study of religious traditions and practices.

In terms of vocabulary and metaphor, the Jewish experience of exile pervades modern, western discourse on the
experience of being alienated, severed, and separated from one's national and natural homeland. Thus in this
course we will take the Jewish experience of exile (galut) as our point of departure for a broader discussion of
these themes as they relate to other diasporic communities. As a consequence of increased mobility, political
instabilities, economic insecurity and the proliferation of means of communication, the state of Diaspora increas-
ingly characterizes populations across the globe, from Africa, Asia, South America, and Europe. While we will
not focus specifically on these communities, one of our tasks will be to discover how the Jewish experience
shapes the discourse on exile and Diaspora that pervades modern discussions of displacement and emigration.
We must further consider what is at stake politically and philosophically in privileging the Jewish experience,
especially given the post-1948 community of Palestinian refugees. To illuminate this discussion we will draw on
the literature of the Jewish tradition from the Hebrew Bible and rabbis to Twentieth Century accounts and reflec-
tions of Franz Kafka, Walter Benjamin and Emmanuel Levinas, as well as materials that reflect the voices of
other refugee communities. We will then move to examine the relationship of the notion of the homeland to that
of the promised land. We will consider the ambivalence in the nineteenth and twentieth century concerning dis-
course of blood and soil, and the consequent possibility that exile and rootlessness could signal positively.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: meeting in pairs, each student will either write and present a paper or respond to

MAJOR--French Language and Literature
The French major seeks to provide training in literary and cultural analysis and linguistic expression through
the study of selected texts from the French-speaking world. Emphasis is placed on the changes in form and sub-
ject matter from the early modern period to the contemporary era.
The major consists of nine courses above the 105 level with optimally one course each from the following
areas:
1) Poetry and Poetics
2) Prose Narrative and Fiction
3) Theatre and Dramatic Literature
4) Thematics, Special Topics, Survey Courses
Students must also take a 400-level capstone seminar which may count toward any of the four re-
quired areas.
As RFLR 104 is a special course that replaces 105 and 106 for those students starting French at the 103 level,
104 will count towards the major as a substitute for RLFR 106.
Students entering the major program at the 109/110-level may, with the permission of the Department, choose
as part of their major program, one course in Art History, History, Philosophy, Comparative Literature or other
subjects that relate to and broaden their study of French. Students entering the major program at the 200-level
may, in some cases and with the permission of the Department, include two such courses in their major program.
Working with the major advisor, the student will formulate a curricular plan that will ensure balance and co-
herence in courses taken. Such balance and coherence will be based on the above areas of literary and cultural
investigation. Prospective majors should discuss their program with the major advisor by the end of their sopho-
more year. This is especially imperative for students who are planning to spend a part or all of their junior year in
France.
Inasmuch as all courses in French assume the active participation of each student in discussions conducted in
the foreign language, regular attendance at class meetings is expected.
MAJOR--French Studies
The major in French Studies is an interdisciplinary program that provides students with the opportunity to
acquire skills and knowledge embracing the cultural, historical, social, and political heritage of France and the
Francophone world. The program allows for an individualized course of study involving work in several depart-
ments and the opportunity to study abroad.
Students electing the French Studies major should register with the French Studies faculty advisor during their
sophomore year. At that time they should submit a feasibility plan that articulates their projected program.
The French Studies major consists of ten courses satisfying the following requirements:
1) at least two courses in French language and/or literature above the French 103 level;
2) a senior seminar;
3) Electives: The remaining courses needed to complete the major must be drawn from at leastthree different
departments and relate primarily to an aspect of the culture, history, society, and politics of France and the Fran-
cophone world. These courses will be selected in consultation with members of the Department of Romance
Languages. Appropriate electives might include:
History 331 The French and Haitian Revolutions
Religion 301 Psychology of Religion
All courses in French literature and language above the 103 level.
In addition, students should take at least two non-language courses that are taught in French.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN FRENCH
Honors candidates are required to have maintained a GPA of 3.5 in the major to qualify for submitting a thesis
proposal.
By May 15th of their junior year, candidates will have found a thesis advisor, and given the Department a
three- to five-page proposal and a preliminary bibliography. (In some cases, and upon consultation with the De-
partment, candidates will have the option to choose a second reader in addition to their primary advisor; for ex-
ample, when the thesis is interdisciplinary enough in nature that it requires the expertise of an additional reader).
This proposal will be discussed by the Department; by June 1st, the candidate will be informed whether he/
she can proceed with the thesis, and if so, what changes need to be made to the focus and scope of the project.
The summer before the senior year will be spent compiling a more detailed bibliography and reading.
Upon their return to Williams, candidates will devote to their theses two semesters of independent study (be-
yond the nine courses required for the major) and the winter study period of their senior year (493-W31-494).
Romance Languages
­ 287 ­
The thesis will be written in French and will usually not be shorter than fifty pages. By the end of the Fall semes-
ter, students will normally have a clear outline of the project, have done substantial research, and produced the
draft of at least the first half of the project. During January this draft will be suitably rewritten and edited with a
view to a final version, while the candidates will also begin work on remaining chapters.
Candidates will submit what they have written to the department on the last day of Winter Study.
On the Tuesday of the first week of the spring semester candidates will make a presentation of the project at a
departmental colloquium in French. The thesis will be promptly discussed and evaluated to determine whether or
not the student should continue in the honors program. The second semester of independent thesis work will be
spent writing more chapters, as well as revising, rewriting, and polishing the project where necessary. The com-
pleted thesis in its final form will be due on April 25th. At the end of the Spring term, the student will present and
defend the final project before members of the Department and others by invitation. The grade will be awarded
once members of the Department have consulted after the defense.
THE CERTIFICATE IN FRENCH
The Certificate in French Language and Cultures consists of a sequence of seven courses for which the stu-
dent must earn a cumulative grade average of B or higher. In addition, the student must take a proficiency test and
achieve a score of "Advanced." The test will be administered by the department once a year during the month of
April to all students desirous of obtaining the Certificate. Those interested should express their intent to the chair
of the department by March 1 or earlier.
For students with no prior French background, the course sequence will consist of French 101-102,
French 103 and 104, and three courses in French above the 104 level, with at least one of these courses at the
200-level or higher taken at Williams. If the student starts out the sequence at French 103, in addition to the three
courses in French beyond the 104 level (including a 200-level course or higher), two electives may be taken in
other departments. One elective should be in French or Francophone cultural history (art, literature, drama, mu-
sic) and the other in French or Francophone intellectual, political or social history.
See French Studies Major description above for list of possible electives in other departments.
PLACEMENT
A placement test in French is administered at Williams at the opening of the fall semester. Incoming first-year
students who register for any French course above the 101-102 level must take this test, regardless of their pre-
vious preparation.
STUDY ABROAD
French majors are strongly advised to complete part of the requirements for the major by studying abroad
either during the academic year or the summer. Most American study-in-France programs require applicants to
have completed a fifth-semester, college-level French course (French 105, for example) before they go abroad. A
special affiliation with the Hamilton Junior Year in France program enables Williams students (who have com-
pleted 105) to participate in a comprehensive academic and cultural experience in a French-speaking environ-
ment. Credit for up to four courses towards the major can be granted at the discretion of the Department: normal-
ly 2 major credit for one semester and up to 4 major credits for a full year or two semesters. The final assignment
of credit will be authorized in consultation with the student's major advisor once the student has returned to Wil-
liams. Such credits can only be determined by review of course format, course materials, and evidence of satis-
factory academic performance. Students interested in studying abroad need to consult with faculty members in
French by the second semester of their first year. Early planning is essential. Because the academic quality of
certain programs of study in France may well be beneath the pedagogical standards normally associated with a
Williams education, students will receive major credit for only those programs recommended by the Depart-
ment. Please consult a faculty member to find out which programs are acceptable. Normally, the Department
does not administer proficiency exams (for study abroad) to any student who has not completed a French course
at Williams.
LANGUAGE AND CIVILIZATION COURSES
RLFR 101(F)-W88-102(S) Introduction to French Language and Francophone Cultures
This year-long course offers a complete introduction to the French language and is designed to help you become
fully conversant in French by focusing on four fundamental language skills: listening, speaking, reading, and
writing. Through daily practice, class activities, interactive discussion, listening exercises, written work, reading
assignments, video-observations, and film-viewing, you will quickly gain confidence and increasing facility with
your abilities to speak and understand both spoken and written French. In addition, our study of grammar, vocab-
ulary, and communication skills will be organized around an engaging and dynamic introduction to a variety of
French-speaking cultures around the world, from France and Belgium, to Québec and Martinique, to Sénégal
and Morocco.
Format: the class meets five hours a week. Evaluation in both semester-long courses will be based on active class
participation, workbook exercises and compositions, chapter tests, midterms, and final examinations. Students
registered for 101-102 are required to attend and pass the sustaining program during the winter study period.
Credit granted only if both semesters are taken. For students who have taken less than two years of high school
French. Conducted in French.

RLFR 103(F) Intermediate French I: Intermediate Studies in French Language and Francophone
Cultures
A first-semester intermediate-level course in French designed to strengthen your skills in each of the four do-
mains: reading, writing, listening and speaking. We will revisit and expand upon fundamental grammatical struc-
tures encountered in 101-2 while also delving into French and Francophone cultures through discussion of litera-
ture, film, music and current social and political trends. We will work actively on vocabulary enrichment with the
goal of preparing you both to meet the conversational challenges of daily life in a French-speaking environment
and to pursue further study of literary texts. An up-to-the-minute textbook will guide our progress, ensuring that
you receive that which is most essential to language learning at this stage: consistent, daily practice. Authentic
literary and journalistic documents will enhance and add dimension to your studies as will the movies we will
watch and discuss. The course will culminate in a two-fold literary/cinematic experience: we will read Éric-Em-
manuel Schmitt's much loved Monsieur Ibrahim et les Fleurs du Coran, which we will then compare to its
cinematic adaptation; you will write your own scènes dramatiques, which will then be filmed and screened.
Conducted in French.
Format: lecture. Requirements: active class participation, workbook exercises, weekly journal, 2 short papers,
chapter tests, a midterm, two oral tests by appointment and a final exam.
Prerequisites: French 101-102 or examination placement. Note: Students should seriously consider taking
French 103 AND 105 if they intend to enroll in more advanced French courses at the level of French 106 or
above, or if they anticipate studying in France or in a Francophone country during their junior year. Enrollment

As a continuation of French 103, this course explores the diverse cultural and political identities in the
Francophone world through short literary texts and film from France, Africa, the Caribbean and the Middle East
while building on linguistic skills in French. The course will provide an in-depth advanced review of grammar
structures, but will emphasize the application of those structures in activities of composition, reading, oral
presentation and discussion. After successfully completing French 104, students may register for French 109.

RLFR 105(F) Advanced French I
What mysterious set of connections brings together a young Québecoise graduate student, an 18th-century
French manuscript by the author of Dangerous Liaisons, a chameleon-like Parisian bent on tracking the young
student, a sinister French police inspector, and a suave Caribbean book collector with roots in two continents?
Where is the kaleidoscope of cultural signs leading us: the Zydeco culture of Louisiana and New Orleans,
enigmatic Creole proverbs such as "The green beans are not salted" and "Okra is not eaten with one finger," the
dizzying shift of international locales, and the autumnal radiance of Paris? We set out with Claire Plouffe and her
young, somewhat sinister admirer, Jean-Louis Royer, through a deepening international mystery set in a
Francophone environment and embracing the rich variety of cultural and linguistic experience that has helped
shape the role of France in the world. Against this backdrop, the course seeks to build on the writing, reading, and
aural comprehension skills in French developed at the elementary and intermediate levels (especially those of
French 103). It will consist of a continued review of fundamental grammar structures, but will emphasize the
application and assimilation of those structures in activities of composition, oral presentation, and discussion.
Conducted in French.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: class participation, attendance, short papers, and five hour-long

RLFR 106(S) Advanced French II
An advanced language course designed to help you refine both your spoken and written expression in French
and to allow you to develop the linguistic independence necessary for future literary studies in French and for
spending time in a Francophone country. Review of the more complicated French grammatical structures will
thus be largely personal. Armed with a thorough reference grammar and a collection of pointed exercises, you
will work on mechanics primarily on your own time. Class time will be devoted principally to developing fluen-
cy and freedom of expression through discussions, debates, dramatizations and presentations. A diverse array of
carefully selected, linguistically rich and thought-provoking stories, poems, article, films and songs will enable
you to observe the grammatical constructions we will study in context and will serve as fodder for diverse in-
class activities. Vocabulary drawn from these texts and chosen to tap into the larger literary, cultural and political
issues posed by the texts will help you express your ideas and opinions in increasingly idiomatic and sophisti-
cated ways. Copious and varied writing assignments including reader responses, pastiches, short papers and edi-
torials will further the link between grammatical mastery and active self-expression.
Format: lecture. Requirements: active class participation; 5 short papers, which will then be revised; weekly writ-
ing assignments; numerous short presentations and structured interventions in controlled rhetorical activities;

LITERATURE COURSES
RLFR 109(F) Introduction to French Literature: Objects of Desire
Desire, though its object(s) may change, is a fundamental part of the human experience. Not surprisingly, authors
throughout the ages have examined desire through various lenses and to various ends, raising such questions as:
does self-consciousness provoke or prevent desire? Is desire tantamount to objectification? How are property and
desire related? Does desire inspire or destroy? Is it possible to free oneself of desire? Is writing itself a manifesta-
tion of desire? In exploring the ways in which authors have addressed these and other questions, this course will
introduce students to a diverse range of works of the French literary tradition, from bawdy medieval tales that
pair erotic desire and rhetorical ability to the noble desire for poetic immortality of the Renaissance to the equa-
tion of desire with démesure in the seventeenth century to the philosophical rumination on the possibilities of
freeing oneself from desire of the Enlightenment to the eclectic array of tangible and ephemeral objects of desire
that characterize the modern period. Conducted in French.
Format: lecture/seminar. Requirements: four short papers, one oral test by appointment, active participation,
which may include one or more short exposés, to be assigned over the course of the semester.
Prerequisites: French 104 or 105 or by placement test or by permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 20 (ex-
pected: 20). Preference will be given to French majors and those with compelling justification for admission.

RLFR 110(S) Révolution(s) Française(s): Literature and Change in France in the 19th and 20th
Centuries
After the French Revolution at the end of the eighteenth century, France entered a period of ongoing cultural
upheaval unlike any other. In the realms of literature, the arts and culture, as well as in society, government and
politics, the nineteenth and twentieth centuries were characterized by change. From Romanticism to the nouveau
roman, literary movements succeeded those that preceded them in the same revolutionary spirit that manifested
itself in the (first) French Revolution--that of replacing the old with the new, of consciously rejecting what came
before in favor of a new and often opposing ideas. This course will examine these two turbulent centuries in
French literature. We will explore literary and artistic movements including romanticism, realism, symbolism,
surrealism, the absurd and the nouveau roman. We will also see the ways in which cultural phenomena and his-
torical events such as the revolutions and regime changes of the nineteenth century, the World Wars in the twen-
tieth, the censorship and control of the Second Empire, and movements such as feminism and négritude, are
manifested in literature. Readings to include works by Lamartine, Hugo, Sand, Flaubert, Baudelaire, Rimbaud,
Apollinaire, Éluard, Senghor, Césaire, Sartre, Beauvoir, Ionesco, Duras and others. Conducted in French.
Format: seminar. Requirements: active class participation, two short papers, an oral presentation, and a final pa-
per.

RLFR 228(S) The Invention of the Self
Today we take our Self for granted. That is, we consider each person to be a unique individual with a distinct
view of the world, set of experiences, and private, inner thoughts that may or may not match the image s/he
projects at any given moment. So "Selfish" are we, so to speak, that it may be hard to imagine a time when the
Self, for all intents and purposes, did not exist. Yet it was not until the major sociocultural transformations of the
Renaissance of the Twelfth Century that our modern vision of the Self was invented, for invention it was. By
Romance Languages

exploring a diverse range of literary works spanning the French High Middle Ages in their historical contexts,
this class will trace the process of Self-invention. Our exploration will begin with two of the very earliest surviv-
ing literary works in French, La Vie de Saint Alexis and La Chanson de Roland. In these poems we will see what
has long been held to be the "degree zero" of individuality. We will move on to consider texts by some of the
most enduringly influential theologians: Guibert de Nogent, whose autobiographical writings may have been
inspired by Augustine, but whose tone is much more personal; Pierre Abelard, who gave us the idea of intention
and of the intrinsic worth of individuality; Saint Bernard of Clairvaux, who redefined the concept of monasticism
as a both collective and highly personal route to redemption; the Abbé Suger, who designed the first Gothic
Cathedral, setting developing notions of perspective, relativism and nationalism quite literally in stone. We will
then turn back to contemporary fiction to see how these major cultural changes played out on parchment, most
notably in the flourishing of the poetic voice and first-person narration. We will see, at last, how the rise of the
city contributed to the invention of the Self in satirical works and a mystery play of the late High Middle Ages.

RLFR 232(S) Battling for Legitimacy: The Rise of the French Novel in the Eighteenth Century
Widely spread and securely established as a canonical genre today, the novel struggled to gain legitimacy in the
eighteenth century. In this course we will examine how French novelists grapple with the novel's clandestine
origins, standing up against moralist criticism to create the genre's modern foundations. We will follow the
evolution of the French novel from its surreptitious beginnings in the seventeenth century to its early Romantic
expressions in the nineteenth century by focusing on the genre's most popular forms, the memoir- and the episto-
lary novels. Our primary readings will beLettres portugaises, Abbé Prévost'sManon Lescaut, Crébillon fils'Les
Egarements du cour et de l'esprit, Graffigny's Lettres d'une péruvienne, Laclos' Les Liaisons dangereuses, Ber-
nardin de Saint-Pierre's Paul et Virginie, and Constant's Adolphe. Secondary readings will be assigned as well.

RLFR 234(S) The World of Les Misérables, Then and Now
From its immediate success at the time of its publication in 1862 to the legendary status of its characters, and
from the episodes known to every French schoolchild to its countless partial and full adaptations for theater and
film, evidence abounds of the lasting impact of Victor Hugo's novel Les Misérables. It is a book which captured
in detail many of the social, political, historical, and cultural movements of the first half of the nineteenth century
and yet has remained relevant to readers through the present day. In this course, we will examine this monumen-
tal work in order to gain an understanding of the era that it represents through the point of view of its author and
of the influence that it has since exerted on the cultural imagination. We will discuss the myriad of nineteenth-
century social, cultural, and political issues that the novel incorporates and will thereby gain a more complete
understanding of the period. We will also examine this vast novel by one of the century's most renowned writers
as an aesthetic object, discussing issues particular to the genre of the novel. In addition, we will discuss the ways
in which the novel has been re-worked into various more modern contexts through adaptations in other media
(theater and film) and will analyze the ways in which artists in these media undertake the telling of this classic
story. Reading will consist primarily of Hugo'sLes Misérables; film viewings (including adaptations by Le Cha-
nois and Lelouch) will be required and other optional readings will be suggested. Conducted in French.
Format: seminar. Requirements: consistent and active class participation, one oral presentation, one short paper,
and a longer final paper.
Prerequisites: French 110 or permission of instructor or results of the Williams College Placement Test. Enroll-
ment limit: 20 (expected: 20). If overenrolled, preference given to French and Comparative Literature majors

Utopia, paradise, shipwreck, abandonment, exile, death. From Shakespeare's The Tempest to CBS's Survivor,
Western fascination and obsession with the island as place of discovery, beauty and imprisonment stretches
across the centuries. In this class, we will read French literary and imagined islands alongside islands constructed
by Francophone Caribbean, Indian Ocean and non-Western writers in French. What happens when the island
starts writing back? How do writers respond to reifications of their world? What does the island symbolize in
personal and national imaginations? And how does the island become an agent in discussions of gender, race,
modernity and history? Readings will include works by Paul Gauguin, Pierre Loti, Jules Verne, Aimé Césaire,
Michel Tournier, Ananda Devi, Maryse Condé and Edouard Glissant.

RLFR 314(F) Between the Two World Wars
The period from 1913 to 1939 was an adventurous time for the French novel. In this course, we will study novels
by Gide, Proust, Colette, Camus, Martin du Gard, Mauriac, Malraux, and Sartre. Although there is great diversi-
ty among these authors, they were all reacting to the aftermath of the First World War and the breakdown of
traditional French culture. Through the popular character of the rebellious adolescent, they experimented with
revolt against the stifling social order of Church and family. The real challenge of the period, however, concerned
not a break with the past or discoveries of new levels of consciousness and freedom, but rather the mature accep-
tance of responsibility for the future and the articulation of fresh spiritual and political visions. Conducted in
French. Requirements: several short papers and oral class presentations.
Prerequisites: any French literature course or permission of the instructor.

RLFR 410(S) Senior Seminar: Landscapes of Movement and Migration in French*
How do migration and movement construct and disrupt landscapes of identity--home, city and nation--in the
French-speaking world? How do migration and movement contribute to conditions of alienation, nostalgia and
violence? This seminar explores such fundamental questions and asks us to think about how in an increasingly
mobile and de-territorialized world, place is imagined, experienced and remembered. Over the course of the se-
mester, we will examine theoretical texts on memory, space, identity and movement, and analyze literary and
film narratives of migration that focus on: the immigration experience in France, the construction of an Atlantic
identity between Africa, the Caribbean, Europe and the Americas, internal migration between the country and
the city, clandestine migration between Africa and Europe, population displacement due to war, and the possibil-
ity of creating portable places of memory. Works by Nora, Benjamin, Deleuze, Barthes, Charef, Chamoiseau,
Glissant, Diome, Condé, Mernissi, Poulain, Pineau, Sembene, and Binebine among others. Conducted in
French.
Format: seminar. Requirements: weekly 1-page response papers, short mid-term paper and a final research paper.
Prerequisites: one literature course in French beyond the 100 level or by permission of instructor. Qualified stu-
dents in first, second, or third years of their career at Williams can enroll in the Senior Seminar with the permis-
sion of the instructor. However, this will not replace the senior seminar requirement in the senior year of French
majors. Enrollment limit: 15 (expected: 10). Preference given to seniors who are French majors or completing

SPANISH
The Spanish major consists of nine courses above the 103-104 level. These nine courses include 301, any 200
level or above(excluding RLSP 205 and RLSP 303), and 403. Spanish majors should note that RLSP 301 is only
offered in alternate years, and they are therefore required to plan their courses accordingly. One 200-level course
must be completed at Williams. Other courses, taken at overseas programs, may be used to satisfy the require-
ments of the major, with approval of the department. The Spanish faculty strongly suggests that students take 201
and 200 at some point in their studies, and especially recommends that they do so before rather than after study-
ing abroad.
The major seeks to provide training in literary analysis and linguistic expression, as well as an appreciation of
Hispanic civilization, through the study of the major writers of the Spanish-speaking world.
Students majoring in Spanish may replace one of their Spanish electives with a course in Comparative Litera-
ture, with one course in Latin-American Studies that is 200-level or higher, or with a course in Linguistics.
Inasmuch as all courses in Spanish assume the active participation of each student in discussions conducted in
the foreign language, regular attendance at class meetings is expected.
Courses numbered in the 100s are language courses, with 105 and 106 combining grammar and literature.
RLSP 200 and RLSP 201 focus on civilization and culture, while other 200-level classes serve as gateway
courses for literary study, in ascending order of difficulty; they are thus suitable for first-years and sophomores.
Courses in the 300s require both serious grounding in the study of literature and an advanced command of the
language. The 400-level course offered annually is the senior seminar, serving as "capstone course" to the Span-
ish major.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN SPANISH
Candidates for a senior thesis must have maintained a 3.5 GPA in the major by the time of proposal submis-
sion. Two alternative routes are available to those who wish to apply for the degree with honors.
The first of these involves the writing of a senior thesis. Honors candidates are required to have maintained a
GPA of 3.5 in the major to qualify for submitting a thesis proposal.
By May 15th of their junior year, candidates will have found a thesis advisor, and given the Department a
three- to five-page proposal and a preliminary bibliography. (In some cases, and upon consultation with the De-
partment, candidates will have the option to choose a second reader in addition to their primary advisor; for ex-
ample, when the thesis is interdisciplinary enough in nature that it requires the expertise of an additional reader).
This proposal will be discussed by the Department; by June 1st, the candidate will be informed whether he/
she can proceed with the thesis, and if so, what changes need to be made to the focus and scope of the project.
The summer before the senior year will be spent compiling a more detailed bibliography and reading.
Upon their return to Williams, candidates will devote to their theses two semesters of independent study (be-
yond the nine courses required for the major) and the winter study period of their senior year (493-W31-494).
The thesis will be written in Spanish and will usually not be shorter than fifty pages. By the end of the Fall semes-
ter, students will normally have a clear outline of the project, have done substantial research, and produced the
draft of at least the first half of the project. During January this draft will be suitably rewritten and edited with a
view to a final version, while the candidates will also begin work on remaining chapters.
Candidates will submit what they have written to the department on the last day of Winter Study.
On the Tuesday of the first week of the spring semester candidates will make a presentation of the project at a
departmental colloquium in Spanish . The thesis will be promptly discussed and evaluated to determine whether
or not the student should continue in the honors program. The second semester of independent thesis work will
be spent writing more chapters, as well as revising, rewriting, and polishing the project where necessary. The
completed thesis in its final form will be due on April 25th. At the end of the Spring term, the student will present
and defend the final project before members of the Department and others by invitation. The grade will be
awarded once members of the Department have consulted after the defense.
The second route is a group of three clearly related courses (offered by the Department of Romance Lan-
guages or by other departments, such as History, Art, Philosophy, English, etc.), only one of which may be
counted in the nine courses comprising the major. One of the courses will be an Independent Study (plus senior
year WSP 030) in the spring of the senior year, at the end of which the student will write an essay that synthesizes
the content of the three related courses. Students may apply for this route by November 2 of the senior year.
In the case of both routes to the degree with honors, the department's recommendation for graduation with
honors will be based on the originality and thoroughness of the finished project.

THE CERTIFICATE IN SPANISH
The Certificate in Spanish Language and Culture consists of a sequence of seven courses for which the stu-
dent must earn a cumulative grade average of B or higher. In addition, the student must take a proficiency test and
achieve a score of "Advanced." The test will be administered by the department once a year during the month of
April to all students desirous of obtaining the Certificate. Those so interested should express their intent to the
chair of the department by March 1 or earlier.
For students with no prior Spanish background, the course sequence will consist of Spanish 101-102, Spanish
103 and 104, and three courses in Spanish above the 104 level, with at least one of these courses at the 200-level
or higher taken at Williams. If the student starts out the sequence at Spanish 103, in addition to the three courses
in Spanish beyond the 104 level (including a 200-level course or higher), two electives may be taken in other
departments. One elective should be in Spanish or Latin-American cultural history (art, literature, drama, music)
and the other in Spanish or Latin-American intellectual, political, or social history. Spanish 200, 201, or 208 can
be counted for the elective requirement.
Electives may be considered from a variety of departments and programs. However, students should consult
with the chair of Romance Languages before making any enrollment decisions.
PLACEMENT
A placement test in Spanish is administered at Williams at the opening of the fall semester. Incoming first-year
students who wish to register for any Spanish courses above the 101 level must take this test.
STUDY ABROAD
Spanish majors, as well as non-majors interested in further exposure to the language and the culture, are
strongly encouraged to include study in Spain or Latin America as part of their program at Williams. Through its
special ties with the Hamilton College Academic Year in Spain, the department offers a comprehensive linguistic
and cultural experience in a Spanish-speaking environment, for periods either of a semester or a year. Credit for
up to four courses can be granted at the discretion of the Department for study overseas. Students interested in
study abroad should consult with a member of the department at their earliest convenience.

point in any understanding of Spain's rich cultural heritage and traditions. Cultural diversity in contemporary
Spain reflects at once the distinct autonomous regions which constitute the socio-political fabric of the country,
such as Catalonia and the Basque Country, and also patterns of migration both within and beyond the European
Union. In this course we will examine and consider Spain past and present. We will study periods of tolerance
and cultural brilliance, such as the co-existence of Arabs and Jews in Medieval Cordoba, as well as censorship
and repression, brought about by the institution of the Inquisition, for example, or during the Franco Regime.
Materials will include representative works from literature, art, architecture, music, and film. Secondary texts
providing essential socio-political and historical context will be supplied. Conducted in Spanish.
Requirements: active participation in class discussions, an oral presentation, several short writing assignments, a
midterm and a final.

RLSP 208(S) The Spanish Civil War in Literature and Film
The Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) has generated a vast bibliography and filmography that to this day reflect
widely antagonistic interpretations of the conflict itself, its roots, and its impact. From the Spanish perspective,
the war is the most important single event in understanding modern Spain. The ideals, passions, and
consequences of the Spanish Civil War still divide Spaniards and have been recreated and relived by writers,
artists, and filmmakers, and debated by historians. The course will begin with a historical introduction to the
origins, development, and outcome of the war. Was the Spanish war a national struggle or an international
struggle played out on Spanish soil? Along with studying internal Spanish political divisions, we will also
consider the impact of the foreign policy positions of other countries-including Germany, Italy, the United States,
and Russia--vis-a-vis Spain, as well as the role of the thousands of foreign volunteers who formed the
International Brigades and came from all over the world to fight against Franco. With this historical basis, we
will see how the themes and issues of the war are reflected in Spanish poetry, short fiction, novels, and films from
the time of the war up through the present day. Readings will include works by Ayala, Cernuda, Neruda,
Goytisolo, Sender, Fernan-Gomez, and Matute. Films will include documentaries as well as classic and
contemporary features.Conducted in Spanish.
Evaluations will be based on lively class participation, an oral report, short written assignments, and two papers.

RLSP 219(S) Humor in Spanish-American Literature
From the sixteenth century to the twenty-first, humor has been an essential element of Spanish-American cultur-
al discourse, frequently mixing entertainment with sharp criticism of repressive political regimes and social insti-
tutions. This course will examine the role of humor in Spanish-American literature with emphasis on the colonial
period and the nineteenth century, considering the use of satire, parody and farce to diagnose social ills ranging
from the oppression of indigenous and African Americans to administrative corruption, promiscuity and sexual
hypocrisy, and sadism among medical practitioners. Drawing on theorists including Erasmus, Henri Bergson
and Mikhail Bahktin, we will discuss various categories of literary comedy and their functions as subversive or
transgression discourses. Spanish-American authors to be read may include Juan Rodríguez Freile, Sir Juana
Inés de la Cruz, Catalina de Erauso, Juan del Valle Caviedes, Alonso Carrió de la Vandera, and Ricardo Palma.
For students with little or no background in early Spanish-American literature, we will also read selected works
of "serious," canonical literature. We will conclude by considering colonial and nineteenth-century satire as pre-
cursors of the anti-authoritarian discourse in contemporary texts such as Gabriel García Márquez's Los funerales
de la Mamá Grande.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based on contribution to class discussions, three short papers, and mid-term

In this course we will study a number of key literary texts produced in the Medieval period and the Golden Age
of Spain (approximately the 11th to the 17th centuries). Throughout, our special focus will be on a feature that is
often highlighted as unique to Spain: the co-existence of three religions and cultures on the Iberian Peninsula
over a period of at least eight-hundred years. We will analyze and critique the idea of the influence of one culture
over another, the meaning of co-existence, and the boundaries between hostility and entente, all as seen through
the lens of literature. We will supplement our primary readings with theoretical and historical analyses. Texts will
include selections from Hebrew and Arabic literature produced in Spain,El Cid, El libro de buen amor, La Cele-
stina, popular and learned poetry, drama by Golden Age artists, short stories by Cervantes, writings by San Juan
de la Cruz and Fray Luis de León. Conducted in Spanish.

Writing by U.S. Hispanics constitutes a new voice in American letters. In this tutorial, we will read and discuss
work by U.S. Latinos and examine the social backgrounds to their texts. The experiences of immigration and

thors to be studied: Jose Antonio Villarreal, Tomas Rivera, Richard Rodriguez, Sandra Cisneros, Rudolfo Anaya,
Piri Thomas, Edward Rivera, Oscar Hijuelos, Cristina Garcia, and historical texts by Carey McWilliams, and
Rodolfo Acuna. Given the absence of a critical consensus around these recent titles, our task is to gain some
sense of their common traits as a tradition, and place them within the larger body of literature of the Americas and
the world. The tutorial will examine one work or set of authors per week. A student will bring, written out in full,
an oral presentation focusing on the artistic features and sociocultural content of the assigned reading. Question-
ing of the presenter, on the part of the second tutee and the tutor, will follow. The course is designed to accommo-

RLSP 403(F) Literature and the Body Politic: Space, Power and Performance in Latin
America*
For the last decade or so, scholars have discussed Latin American cultural production through a range of meta-
phors that descend from two distinct but closely related tropes: place and performance. Power, for contemporary
theorists, is both exercised in and resisted by gendered bodies that move through the structures of public and
private spaces. Identity is understood primarily in terms of performance; history and meaning are embodied, not
just encoded in texts, while political, economic, and cultural discourses are all dominated by a rhetoric of flow,
movement, and migration. This seminar proposes to examine these spatial metaphors in contemporary Latin
American literature and cultural theory. Where do figures like "mapping," "marginality" and "embodiment"
come from, and what does their emergence in the 1990s signify? How are they prefigured in earlier periods of
Latin American cultural discourse, and how does their widespread circulation (to use another trope from the
same series) influence the ways that we think and act politically today? More specifically, is the nation still a
viable model for constructing identity and struggling for political change in the age of globalization and mass
migration? To get to the bottom of these issues, we will explore representations of space, place, and the body in
recent narrative, poetry and performance, with a particular focus on the postdictatorial literatures of the Southern
Cone of South America. Literary readings may include work by: Diamela Eltit, Ricardo Piglia, Luisa Valenzue-
la, Tomás Eloy Martínez, Juan José Saer, Julio Ortega, Juan Gelman, and others. Theoretical readings may in-
clude the work of: Michel Foucault, Judith Butler, Diana Taylor, Walter Mignolo, Nelly Richard, Néstor García
Canclini, José Joaquín Brunner, Mary Louise Pratt and Homi Bhaba. As a capstone experience, the seminar will
require participants to take an active role in shaping discussion.
Format: seminar. Requirements: regular participation, two oral presentations, 7-page paper, 15-page term paper

LANGUAGE STUDY
The department provides language instruction to enable the student to acquire all four linguistic skills: under-
standing, speaking, reading, and writing. Russian 101-W88-102 covers the basics of Russian grammar. Russian
103 and 104 offer additional instruction in grammar and provide extensive practice in reading and conversation.
Russian 201 and 202 aim to develop facility in speaking, writing, and reading.
STUDY ABROAD
The department strongly encourages students desiring to attain fluency in Russian to spend a semester or year
studying in Russia or one of the former Soviet republics. Students generally apply to one of several approved
foreign study programs. Russian 104 or the equivalent and junior standing are normally prerequisite for study
abroad.
LITERATURE AND CULTURE IN TRANSLATION
The department regularly offers courses on Russian literature and culture in English for those students who
have little or no knowledge of Russian, but who wish to become acquainted with the major achievements in
Russian literary and cultural history.
THE CERTIFICATE IN RUSSIAN
To enhance a student's educational and professional profiles, the Certificate in Russian offers a useful tool for
using the language in a wide variety of disciplines. The sequence of language and culture courses is designed to
supplement a student's major at Williams by enabling the student to expand his or her knowledge in a related
field.
Russian
­ 297 ­
Students who enter Williams with previous training in Russian may substitute more advanced courses for the
100- and 200-level courses; they can also be exempted from up to two of the required courses. Thus, in order to
earn acertificate a student must take no fewer than five courses (including three language courses) after enrolling
at Williams.
Students must receive a minimum grade of B in each course taken in the sequence. In addition, they must
receive a score of at least 85% on a standardized language proficiency test administered by the department.

THE MAJOR
The Russian major offers students an interdisciplinary approach to the intellectual and cultural history of Rus-
sia and the former Soviet republics. Students complete the major by combining courses in Russian language and
literature with courses in history, political science, music, economics, and art.
For students who start Russian at Williams, the major requires a minimum of ten courses: Russian 101-102,
103, 104, 201, 202, and 402; one elective in Russian above 202; and two electives from either Russian courses
above 202 or appropriate offerings of other departments.
For students who have acquired intermediate or greater proficiency in the language before coming to Wil-
liams, the minimum requirement is nine courses: Russian 402; one elective in Russian above 203; and seven
other courses selected from Russian courses above 102 and appropriate offerings in other departments.
Students selecting the major must normally complete Russian 202 or the equivalent by the end of the junior
year. Majors will normally be expected to take the 400-level seminar offered in their senior year, even if they
have previously taken another version.
Examples of appropriate courses in other departments are:
History 140 Fin-de Siecle Russia: Cultural Splendor, Imperial Decay
History 240 Muscovy and the Russian Empire
History 241 The Rise of the Soviet Union
History 440 Reform, Revolution, Terror: Russia, 1900-1939
Russian majors may receive major credit for as many as four courses taken during study abroad.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN RUSSIAN
At the beginning of the second semester of the senior year, students may nominate themselves to candidacy
for the degree with honors. By the end of the junior year at the latest, however, they will have established in
consultation with the department their qualifications for embarking on the project, the pattern of study to be fol-
lowed, and the standards of performance.
Students earn a degree with honors by submitting a senior thesis (493-W31-494) of honors quality.

RUSS 203(F) Nineteenth-Century Russian Literature in Translation (Same as Comparative
Literature 203)
Literature provided the primary medium for political, philosophical, and religious debate in nineteenth­century
Russia. It was also one of the major fora through which "Russia" could begin to define itself as a nation, tied to,
but distinct from, Western Europe. For a long time, Russian authors had relied quite heavily on foreign literary
models for inspiration and direction, and it was only in the early part of the nineteenth century that a specifically
"Russian" tradition could be seen to emerge. In addition to its task of introducing major Russian authors and their
creative ideas, this course will seek to examine the rise of Russian literature as such, its key movements and their
proponents, and the recurring theme of "Russianness" and national identity. We will read works by the major
literary figures of the century, including Karamzin, Chaadaev, Pushkin, Gogol, Goncharov, Turgenev, Dostoev-
sky, Tolstoy, Chekhov. All readings will be in English. This course will focus on developing students' ability to
analyze literature objectively and to interpret literature in both written and oral arguments.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: active class participation, papers, one oral presentation, and a final
research project.

Revolution has provided one of the key impulses behind literary and cultural movements of the twentieth century
around the world, and nowhere more so than in Russia. This course will examine the emergence and
development of revolutionary culture in Russia during the early twentieth century. We will study a variety of
materials, including history, literature, journalism, theater, and film, in an attempt to understand the many
revolutions that shaped Russia's destiny from approximately 1900-1930. We will begin the semester with the
Revolution of 1905 ("Bloody Sunday") and devote significant attention to the two revolutions of 1917 (in
February and October). In addition, we will examine the so-called Stalin revolution of the late 1920s and end the
semester with a historical reassessment of these revolutions after the fall of the Soviet Union. Primary course
readings will be in Russian; some background reading will be in English. Class sessions will be conducted
entirely in Russian.

RUSS 402(S) Senior Seminar: Soviet Satire
Satire is a tricky genre. Satirists must remain politically, artistically, and socially viable while critiquing the politi-
cal, artistic, and social formations which legitimize them. Is satire a real tool of change, wielding laughter as its
weapon, or is it simply a way to let off steam, to channel dissatisfaction toward acceptable targets? How reliably
can satire be wielded or channeled? Perhaps nowhere is the inherent tension of satire more taut than in Soviet
satire; in fact, parts of the early Soviet literary establishment were so conflicted about satire's ambiguous power
that they proposed eliminating satire completely, nervously claiming that satire "wasn't necessary" in the victori-
ous Soviet state. The defenders of a particularly Soviet satire eventually won out, but ­what was this satire? How
did it survive the massive upheavals of subsequent Soviet history? This course will focus on the theory and prac-
tice of Soviet satire, beginning with an introduction to the pre-Revolutionary Russian satire which informed So-
viet practices and attitudes. Readings will include classics of Soviet satirical drama, poetry, and prose, as well as
contemporary theory and debates. All course readings will be in the original language. The seminar will be con-
ducted entirely in Russian.
Format: seminar. Requirements: active class participation, frequent short writing assignments, class presenta-

Science and Technology Studies (SCST) is an interdisciplinary program concerned with science and technol-
ogy and their relationship to society. In addition to being concerned with the historical development and a philo-
sophical understanding of the ideas and institutions of science and technology; Science and Technology Studies
also examines their ethical, economic, social, and political implications.
The role that science and technology have played in shaping modern industrial societies is generally acknowl-
edged, but few members of those societies, including scientists and engineers, possess any understanding of how
that process has occurred or much knowledge of the complex technical and social interactions that direct change
in either science or society. The Science and Technology Studies Program is intended to help create a coherent
course of study for students interested in these questions by providing a broad range of perspectives. At present,
courses are offered which examine the history or philosophy of science and technology, the sociology and
psychology of science, the economics of research and development and technological change, science and public
policy, technology assessment, technology and the environment, scientometrics, and ethical-value issues.
To complete the requirements of the program, students must complete six courses. The introductory course
and senior seminar are required and three elective courses are chosen from the list of designated electives. Stu-
dents may choose to concentrate their electives in a single area such as technology, American studies, philosophy,
history of science, economics, environment, current science, or current technology,but are encouraged to take at
least one elective in history, history of science, or philosophy. The sixth course necessary to complete the pro-
gram is one semester of laboratory or field science in additiontotheCollege'sthree-coursesciencerequirement.
Other science courses of particular interest include Chemistry 110 and Biology 134.
The program is administered by a chair and an advisory committee of faculty who teach in the program. Stu-
dents who wish to enroll normally register with the chair by the fall of their junior year.

approach. They then apply these methods to a major research project. Students may choose topics from fields
such as biotechnology, computers, biomedical engineering, energy, and other resource development. Students
will apply their background of historical, philosophical, and technological perspectives in carrying out their
study.

The program in teaching is designed to enable Williams Undergraduates to study the ideas, questions, and
practices involved in good teaching at all levels. The program seeks to promote and facilitate an exchange of
ideas about teachers, learners and schools, within and beyond the Williams campus. The program offers a range
of opportunities including courses on education, intensive supervised student teaching, workshops, advising, lec-
ture series, and ongoing peer groups for those who teach. Students may participate in a variety of ways, ranging
from taking one course to a sustained in-depth study of teaching and learning geared to those who want to be-
come teachers, or educational psychologists. We seek to connect students with one another, to bring in expert
teachers to provide mentoring, and to create links across the curriculum so that students can see the vital connec-
tions between what they study (French, Algebra or Biology for instance) and the process of teaching those topics
to elementary and high school students. The program is open to any student interested in education and offers
opportunities for all levels of interest, including those who want to find out about certification and graduate study.
Students seeking certification through an arrangement with the Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts (MCLA)
should consult with Susan Engel before the end of their sophomore year.
The following provides a sample outline of the sequence of courses and experiences that an interested student
might take

Psychology 232 Developmental Psychology and/or
z
Psychology 242 Social Psychology;
z
Psychology 272 Psychology of Education;

At least one Winter Study in an intensive teaching practicum. The major programs are in Berkshire
County (under PSYC) or in New York City (under SPEC), although other opportunities may be listed
elsewhere in the Winter Study section of the course catalogue.
No specific major is required to participate in the program--although some lend themselves easily to certifi-
cation, such as Mathematics, English, Biology, American history, or French, almost all of our majors can provide
the basis of teacher certification. Alternately, students can major in Psychology, take a concentration of courses in
a different field, and then pursue that content area more intensively in graduate work.

THEATRE (Div. I)
Chair, DEBORAH BROTHERS
Professors: BAKER-WHITE*, EPPEL. Assistant Professors: LIEBERMAN, SANGARE, HOLZAP-
FEL. Lecturers: BROTHERS, CATALANO**. Visiting Lecturers: CHIA, DANKMEYER, ERICK-
SON, MORRIS, WEST. William Dwight Whitney Professor of Arts and Theatre: BUCKY.
As a reflection of the theatre's historical relationship to literature and the arts, stage production is studied in the
context of the literary and artistic movements which have informed theatrical endeavor. The major in Theatre
emphasizes the collaborative nature of the discipline by drawing upon courses offered by faculty of the Lan-
guage, Literature, Music, and Art Departments. Although students will be equipped to proceed to graduate and
professional schools in theatre, the major is primarily directed toward those interested in studying the theatre as
an artistic phenomenon and as an interpretive tool. Because a deep understanding of theatre requires training and
experience with the synthesis on stage, the major includes curricular study of production and performance, as
well as continued participation in departmental stage production.
Williamstheatre, the production arm of the Department of Theatre, operates under the supervision of the de-
partmental faculty. Major departmental productions as well as laboratory and experimental productions of all
kinds are mounted on the new stages of the '62 Center for Theatre and Dance. Participation in acting or technical
work is open to all members of the Williams College community. Students majoring in Theatre will be asked to
consult regularly with departmental advisors in devising the sequence of courses and production participation
that will constitute their major.
MAJOR
The major in Theatre requires six specific courses, plus three electives as specified below. The specific
courses are:
Theatre 103 Acting I
Theatre 102 Theatre Technologies
Theatre 201 Theatrical Design: Process and Collaboration
One course focusing on Critical Studies/Dramatic Literature taught from within the department and to be tak-
en in first two years (prospective majors should consult with department chair for a list of appropriate
courses)
Prospective theatre majors should attempt to complete the above four courses, in no particular order, by the
end of sophomore year.
The remaining two specific courses are:
Theatre 301 Junior Seminar
Theatre 401/402 Independent Senior Practicum
Students must also take three electives from the department's other offerings, and at least one of these elec-
tives must be drawn from each of the two categories "Theatre Scholarship" and "Theatre Practice."
Theatre Practice: courses where students learn the basic artistic skills of theatre practice through creative
endeavor. (Examples: Acting, Scenic Design, Lighting Design, Costume Design, Directing.)
Theatre Scholarship: courses where students employ critical skills through research and reflection focused
on the traditional canon or on selected more recently defined subject areas. (Examples: Approaching Per-
formance Studies, Contemporary Play and Performance Analysis, Theatre History, Classical Drama,
Modern Drama and Shakespeare).
Courses which mix modes of inquiry between the above categories may be counted in either; in any case,
majors should consult with the department chair to assure an adequate distribution of electives.
The department strongly recommends that students elect additional collateral courses in dramatic literature
taught by the English, Classics, and modern language departments, and courses in opera taught by the Music De-
partment. Students with an interest in theatre design should particularly elect Art Studio courses in drawing.
Production requirement for the major: All majors in Theatre are required to participate in a minimum of four
department productions in addition to the laboratory requirement for Theatre 102. Participation in at least two of
the four must be in technical production, and one must be in stage management. Assignment to productions is
normally made in consultation with the department chair.
Theatre majors are strongly urged to include dance and fencing in fulfilling their Physical Education require-
ments.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN THEATRE
Candidates for Honors will apply for admission through the submission of a portfolio to the Department Chair
by February of their junior year, as well as a description of their proposed project. The portfolio will be com-
prised of four parts:
1. The first part will include a list of the courses students have taken relevant to their work towards the major.
This list will include courses offered by the Theatre Department, but may also include classes taken in
other Departments. Students should also list and describe relevant independent studies and production
credits.
2. The second part of the portfolio will include a selection of materials developed for these courses and pro-
ductions listed in Part 1. The selection should include at least three papers or samples of other written work,
Theatre
­ 302 ­
and might also include design projects, director's notebooks, studio art projects, actor's journals or other
forms of documentation of the candidate's work. For students who have taken a semester away, it is partic-
ularly important that they provide the Department with a detailed picture of their activities while studying
off-campus. Course descriptions and syllabi should be submitted in addition to a list of courses taken and
activities performed.
3. The third part of the portfolio is an annotated bibliography of dramatic texts which the student has read,
drawn from a list supplied by the Department. Annotations should be based upon a particular angle of
engagement with the text, that reflects the area or areas that the student has chosen to emphasize in their
theatrical training. For instance, one might choose to write from the point of view of an actor, a designer, a
director, a playwright, or a dramaturg.
4. The portfolio should conclude with a retrospective essay that reflects on the materials that are being sub-
mitted. Students should look for connections between the various aspects of their work, state any theoreti-
cal positions that they have come to embrace, assess their strengths and weaknesses, and discuss their edu-
cational goals for their work with the Department during their Senior year.
The portfolio will be examined alongside the student's record and his or her project description; a determina-
tion will then be made as to admission into the Honors program. Students intending to apply for Honors should
meet with the Department Chair by the end of the fall semester of their junior year. Once a student is admitted to
the Honors program, the department Chair will assign an Honors Project Advisor, who will work with the stu-
dent to specify a timeline and work program for the completion of the Honors Project. At a minimum, this will
entail enrollment in Theatre 493 or 494, plus W32, plus one other course offered either within the department or
elsewhere that the candidate and thesis advisor designate as contributing specifically to the overall goals of the
honors work. This honors elective may not fulfill any other portion of the Theatre Major, or any other major the
student may be pursuing. All honors candidates will present their completed projects to the Department Honors
Committee for evaluation. Honors candidates are exempt from the senior project in theatre (THEA 401/402).
STUDY ABROAD
The Theatre Department attempts to work individually with majors and prospective majors who desire to
study abroad. In general, with careful planning it is usually quite easy for students to complete the major in
Theatre if they study abroad in the spring of their junior year. For those wishing to study abroad in the fall of
junior year, a more complicated situation may arise, but one that can often be successfully managed through
close consultation with the department chair. Students are encouraged to consult with the chair early in their
Williams careers if they anticipate a combination of Theatre major and study abroad.
THEA 102(S) Introduction to Theatre Technology
As an overview of performance spaces, play technologies, and production, the course will examine how and
where plays are performed, produced, and designed. Students will attend lectures, participate in labs in drafting
and technical production, and will be required to participate on the production crew of one or more departmental
productions.
No prerequisites.

THEA 104(F) World Theatre History I: Performance in Oral, Written and Print Cultures (Same as
Comparative Literature 104)
Theatre, like all art, is a form of communication that varies across time and geography. How have different cul-
tures used performance to communicate and for what purposes-social, political, spiritual? This introductory
seminar will employ a historiographic approach to answer questions like these. Mapping our way through the
dawn of human culture to circa 1900, we'll explore many unique theatre and performance traditions, such as
Korean Shamanistic performance, Greek and Roman civic theatre, Islamic mourning dramas, Carnival tradi-
tions, Commedia dell'arte, French Neoclassical theatre, Kathakali dance-drama, and nationalist theatres in Ire-
land and Russia. Some interpretive approaches, such as gender and queer theory, ethnography, and linguistics,
will be applied. As a way of exploring how the work of the theatre historian informs our work as theatre artists,
the course will also include a "workshop" meeting time, during which we'll experiment with material covered in
class.
Format: seminar. Requirements/Methods of Evaluation: Students will complete case-studies and two short re-
search papers based on their individual interests. A final, collaborative project will require students to perform
short adaptations of select historical theatre traditions.

THEA 201(F) Theatrical Design: Process of Collaboration
This course examines the designer's process and collaborative role in the creation of theatre through a combina-
tion of lecture, discussion, and individual/group projects. Text and music will be analyzed in ways that help clari-
fy how a designer develops a point of view while solving the practical needs of production. All aspects of de-
sign--scenery, lighting, costume, and sound--will be explored with particular emphasis on how these elements
synthesize and contribute to the larger intellectual, emotional, and physical context of the stage. Basic presenta-
tion skills and technique will be taught as crucial elements of design development.
Evaluation will be based upon committed class participation and thoughtful, timely completion of all assign-
ments and projects.
No prerequisites.Enrollment limit: 10.
Hour: 1:10-3:50 TF MORRIS
THEA 204(S) Acting II
Building on the foundation of Theatre 103, students will develop advanced performance skills through various
acting techniques defined by Stanislavsky, Brecht, Strasberg, Adler, Meisner, Grotowski, and Suzuki. Improvi-
sation may be used to explore clarity of expression, listening, and specificity in the actor's task. Focus will be on
the imagination and creation of character, and will be emphasized through scene work. The dramatic literature
employed will range from classical through contemporary playwriting. Students will present diverse acting
forms in a final theatre performance.
Format: studio. Prerequisites: Theatre 103 and sophomore standing. Enrollment limit: 14.

THEA 236(F) Political Theatre Making
Placing twentieth-century theatricality in the context of its historical roots in Western theatre, this course will
examine a broad range of types of protest movements. From the biting observations of the British class system
by playwrights such as Oscar Wilde, Noel Coward, and John Osborne, to mid-century American political writers
such as Clifford Odets and Edward Albee, and Italy's Dario Fo, to the relentless satire of contemporary South
African performers such as Pieter Dirk-Uys, we will investigate dramatic writing and
performance style as aspects of social and political resistance. Other groups studied may include the protest
theatre of Johannesburg's Market Theatre, Luiz Valdez's Teatro Campesino, and a younger generation of post-
apartheid experimentation in multi-ethnic South African theatre.
Format: seminar. Evaluation: A semester-length research project, including a substantial paper, based on the hy-
pothetical creation of a theatre company within specific historical, social, and political contexts.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15. First-year students must get permission of instructor.
Hour: 11:20-12:35 TR EPPEL
THEA 239(S) World Theatre History II: Performance in Modern Media Cultures (Same as
Comparative Literature 239)
The modern period saw the rapid development of new forms of communication or media, such as cameras,
X-rays, electrical lighting, radios, telephones, cinema, and computers. Alongside technological innovation came
massive world warfare, political revolutions across the globe, and the downfall of many longstanding cultural
regimes. Considering theatre as both a form of media and a form of resistance, this introductory seminar course
will explore forms of theatre and performance throughout the modern and postmodern periods, such as popular
Theatre
­ 304 ­
performance, avant-garde movements, anti-imperialist theatre, revolutionary theatre, post-colonial theatre, inter-
cultural theatre, and virtual performance. Some consideration will also be given to interpretive theories, such as
cultural materialism, deconstruction, and media theory. As a way of exploring how the work of the theatre histo-
rian informs our work as theatre artists, the course will also include a "workshop" meeting time, during which
we'll experiment with material covered in class.
Format: seminar. Requirements/Methods of Evaluation: Students will complete case-studies and two short re-
search papers based on their individual interests. A final, collaborative project will require students to create a
short performance piece that explores the relationship between theatre and another form of contemporary media,
such as blogs, digital video, or the Jennycam.
Prerequisites: Theatre 104 World Theatre History I. Enrollment limit: 20 (expected: 15). Preference given to first
year students and sophomores who are considering the Theatre major.
Hour: 9:55-11:10 TR Lab: 1:10-3:50 W HOLZAPFEL
THEA 240(F) Solo Performance
In this interdisciplinary course, students will examine the process of the creation of one-person performance
pieces and will work individually or in collaboration to create original solo works. Each student will perform his
or her own piece at the end of the semester in a final show. Students will learn about developing a general pro-
duction concept and scenic vision, choosing or writing a script, building a character, designing set/costumes/mu-
sic/publicity, and combining all aspects of theatrical craft to create a successful solo piece. Students interested in
acting, directing, writing, producing, dramaturgy, design, stage management, and criticism are all welcome. Solo
works produced in the course may be invited to participate in a departmentally sponsored solo performance festi-
val.
Format: studio. Evaluation will be based on committed participation in the preparation and performance of pro-
duction exercises, performance of the final project, and some modest written assignments.
Prerequisite: permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected:10). Preference given to theatre majors.
Hour: 11:00-12:15 MWF SANGARE
THEA 241(F) Performing Race: From Shakespeare to Spike Lee (Same as Africana Studies
241 and Comparative Literature 241)*
This cross-historical survey considers plays, film, and performance art and the capacity of these artistic forms to
reinforce racial stereotypes and, equally, to question them. The course begins in the Renaissance by approaching
theatre as a visual (as well as literary) medium and asking: What do we see? How is race constructed on stage?
With these conditions of performance in mind, we will examine the significance of race and racial iconographies
in such works as Shakespeare's Titus Andronicus and Othello and Ben Jonson's Masques of Blackness and
Beauty. With Spike Lee's film Bamboozled as a transition, the focus will turn to the contemporary field encom-
passing drama by Djanet Sears, August Wilson, and Anna Deavere Smith, and video work by black British artist
Isaac Julien, among others. Specific topics to be discussed include blackface performance; studio photographs of
black actor Paul Robeson as Othello; and colorblind casting. In its application of a comprehensive definition of
race, the course will address racial whiteness.
Format: lecture. Evaluation based on participation in class discussion; short papers; final exam.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15 (expected : 15). Preference given to Theatre majors.
Hour: 8:30-9:45 TR P. ERICKSON
THEA 242(S) Body of Knowledge (Same as ArtS 242)
This is a movement course designed for actors, musicians, and visual artists. The body is the site where all cre-
ative work resides, so as artists we must integrate movement as a source and resource in our work. We will en-
gage the body as an expressive tool in support of artistic craft and technique and build confidence in our ability to
translate creative impulses through physical action. We will focus on the kinetic application of movement in the
art-making process, using core energy, dynamics, breath connection, strength, flexibility, range of motion, stami-
na, and relaxation techniques in order to strengthen our creative output. We will also examine how movement
informs creative work across disciplines.
Format: studio and seminar. Requirements: Students will be assessed individually based on active class partici-
pation, journals, and final project.
Prerequisites: experience in acting, music, or the visual arts. Enrollment limit: 12 (expected: 12). Preference to
Theatre Majors.

THEA 243T(S) Strategies of Political Theatre (W)
"Change the world; it needs it," is the German playwright Bertolt Brecht's famous clarion cry. In this tutorial, we
will take a critical look at the strategies employed in the twentieth century by several dramatists who have at-
tempted to heed Brecht's exhortation. After a brief glance at Aristophanes and Shakespeare to correct any pos-
sible mistaken impression that political theatre is a twentieth-century invention, the class will proceed, of course,
to the plays and essays of Brecht himself (and his predecessor Erwin Piscator). Students will read Brecht'sMoth-
er Courage on war; The Measures Taken on political morality; Peter Weiss' Marat/ Sade on revolution and The
Investigation on the Holocaust; Marc Blitzstein's The Cradle Will Rock on corruption and corporate greed; Ar-
thur Miller's The Crucible on modern "witchhunts;" Harold Pinter's The Birthday Party, Mountain Language,
The New World Order, and One for the Road on torture; Athol Fugard's Statements After an Arrest Under the
Immorality Act on Apartheid; Barbara Garson's MacBird on Vietnam; Caryl Churchill's Cloud Nine on gender
and sexuality; and Anna Deavere Smith's Twilight: Los Angeles, 1992 on race in America. With these plays and
associated essays, the tutorial will focus on a critical appraisal of the works in their dramatic design, as artful
political commentary, and as calls to political action.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: In the first two weeks of the tutorial the class will meet together as a group to
establish its bearings. Thereafter students will meet in pairs once a week. Each student will write a 4- to 6-page
Theatre
­ 305 ­
paper every other week, and be prepared to mount a detailed comment/response in the alternate weeks. The focus
will be both on interpretative skills in reading dramatic texts, and on the ability to construct critical arguments and
respond to them. A final project that can take the form of a performance piece, a playtext, or a paper on a major
American performance ensemble devoted to political drama is required.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected 10). Open to sophomores and upperclassmen.

THEA 303(S) Stage Lighting
A study of the art and techniques of stage lighting. This class will provide instruction in the basic physics of light
and color; the use of angle, intensity, color, texture and movement of light as compositional tools; various kinds
of stage lighting instruments and their uses; conceptual development of a lighting design; translation of concept
into light plot and channel hookup; focusing the plot in the theater; and writing cues.
Texts for the course will be the texts and scores of the plays, operas and other dramatic works that we will
examine from the lighting designer's perspective, supplemented with readings that address the technical aspects
of stage lighting. The class format will be a combination of lecture/discussion sessions and practical labs.
Every effort will be made to provide students with lighting design opportunities on departmental productions as a
part of their coursework, in accordance with students' abilities and interests and in consultation with directors and
other faculty. Students are encouraged to seek out lighting design opportunities outside the department as well,
and may incorporate these projects into their coursework.
Evaluation will be based on class participation, successful completion of weekly projects, thorough technical
understanding of a basic stage lighting system, and performance on a final exam.
Enrollment limit: 12.
Hour: 1:10-3:50 TF WEST
THEA 305(F) Costume Design (Same as ArtS 200)
This course is an introductory and intensive study of the art of costume design. The course focuses on the design-
er's process: script analysis, collaboration, research, color theory, basic design principles, rendering techniques,
fabric research, organizational skills and presentation of designs. Evaluation will be based on multiple design
assignments including a detailed final design project, costume labs, image and research files, costume sketch-
book, short papers, committed participation, and attendance. Students are required to attend at least one rehearsal
and one department theatre performance during the semester. Students will also be expected to partake in intelli-
gent critiques of fellow classmates' design work.

THEA 338(F) Facing the Music
Music has accompanied theatrical performance since the birth of drama. Over time music on stage has served
many dramatic functions: sometimes it merely serves to embellish the emotive temperature but, more conse-
quentially, music can also constitute the major source of dramatic articulation. In this course we will study the
specific dramatic function of music in such works as D.W. Giffith's film Orphans of the Storm, Mozart's Cosi
Fan Tutte, Wagner's Die Meistersinger, Verdi's Otello, Brecht's Mahagonny and The Measures Taken, (music
by Weill and Eisler), Rogers and Hammerstein'sOklahoma and Carousel, Sondheim's Sweeney Todd, and Glass
and Wilson's postmodern opera Einstein on the Beach. The course will also study the variety of working rela-
tionships that musicians have enjoyed with their collaborators in theatrical production.
Format: Discussion/seminar. Requirements: Energetic and committed participation is required. Written exercises
will include short weekly responses, a midterm report on the role of music in a live performance, and a final
paper on a dramatic work to be chosen in consultation with the instructor.

THEA 339(F) Introduction to Dramaturgy: The Art of Classical Adaptation
The dramaturg is an important collaborator in the theatrical production process, playing the multi-faceted role of
historian, cultural critic, audience educator, and overall supporter of the production team. Working closely with
the director, the dramaturg helps to shape a production and facilitate the demanding process of creating a world
on stage. This course will introduce students to the fundamentals of production dramaturgy, applying our study
of the practice to the topic of classical adaptation and translation. Sophocles' Antigone and Euripides' Hippolytus
will serve as two of our foundational texts, from which we'll consider adaptations by Racine, Anouilh, Brecht,
Gambaro, and LeCompte. We'll also view how modern directors have interpreted the classics through unique
productions, such as Breuer's The Gospel at Colonus, Brook's Mahabharata, Mnouchkine's Les Atrides, and
Ninagawa's Medea.
Format: seminar. Requirements/Method of evaluation: Assignments will be project-based and will range from
making image boards to writing program notes. As a final assignment, students will research and write their own
mini-adaptations of classical works and present their material to one another through informal, staged readings.
Prerequisites: This course will serve as the Junior Seminar for majors in the Department of Theatre. Enrollment
for non-majors is possible with permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Preference if over-

THEA 401(F), 402(S) Independent Senior Practicum
All majors in theatre must enroll in the Independent Senior Practicum (401 or 402) in order to complete a Senior
Project. Majors will work with the department chair and the theatre faculty during junior year to determine the
goals and scope of the project, and, when a project is approved, the chair will assign a Project Advisor, who will
then be instructor for the independent study course. Senior projects may be artistic or scholarly in design and
execution, and should grow from students' experience within the curricular and extra-curricular work in the de-
partment. They may build on previous academic achievements, or venture into new territory, but should be con-
ceived as a capstone experience within the theatre major. Students may propose collaborative senior projects in
groups of two or more. If such projects are approved, students in such a group will either be assigned one or
multiple Project Advisors to oversee the work. In any case, each senior will be responsible for fulfilling a unique
and specific set of requirements for the course as set by the advisor at the start of the semester. Students accepted
into the Honors Program in Theatre are exempt from the Senior Project requirement.

THE NATIONAL THEATRE INSTITUTE
The Department of Theatre is affiliated with the National Theatre Institute, which offers additional theatre
study through its resident semester program. The Institute is fully accredited by Connecticut College and is a
Theatre, Women's and Gender Studies
­ 307 ­
member of the Twelve-College Exchange. Limited numbers of Williams students can therefore be selected to
take a full semester of intensive theatre study at the NTI, located at the Eugene O'Neill Memorial Theatre Centre
in Waterford, Connecticut. During the semester, students from participating colleges live and work as members
of a theatre company gaining experience with professional theatre artists in a workshop environment. Early ap-
plication is essential.
WOMEN'S AND GENDER STUDIES (Div. II)

Women's and Gender Studies can be defined as the study of how gender is constructed, how it is inflected by
differences of race, ethnicity, sexuality, class, and so on, how gender affects the experiences and situations of men
and women, and how assumptions about gender influence the construction of knowledge and experience. Schol-
arship in Women's and Gender Studies has brought neglected material into established fields and raised impor-
tant methodological questions that cross disciplinary boundaries and challenge established intellectual frame-
works. The program in Women's and Gender Studies thus includes courses from a wide variety of disciplines
that focus in a coherent way on gender issues, as well as core courses that acquaint students with the interdiscipli-
narity of the field.
THE MAJOR
The Women's and Gender Studies major encourages exposure to the interdisciplinary character of feminist
scholarship. In addition, majors are required to gain some knowledge of methods within a field or discipline (3
courses in one of the categories listed below), to appreciate the importance of diversity (racial, sexual, class, eth-
nic, national, etc.) in scholarship on gender, to gain exposure to feminist theory, and to pursue work at an ad-
vanced level (3 courses at the 300-level).
In order to ensure that students reflect about the paths that they choose through the major, each major will be
assigned to an advisor in the spring of the sophomore year. With the advisor, the student will establish a revisable
course of study for the following two years. Students interested in declaring a major should contact the chair of
the Program (Kent, x2549).
[ ] Courses not offered in 2007-2008 are listed in brackets.
Required Courses
The major consists of at least 9 courses. The following are required:
Women's and Gender Studies 101 Introduction to Women's and Gender Studies

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN WOMEN'S AND GENDER STUDIES
Honors in Women's and Gender Studies may be granted to majors after an approved candidate completes an
honors project, delivers a public presentation of the work, and is awarded honors by the Women's and Gender
Studies Committee.
The honors project may be fall semester (plus winter study) or a year-long project. It may consist of a conven-
tional research thesis of 40-70 pages or of other modes of presentation (e.g., art, music, poetry, theater, fiction).
Proposals for non-thesis projects should include evidence of experience and competence in the chosen mode.
A student may become a candidate for honors in Women's and Gender Studies after the following criteria are
met:
1). in April of the junior year, submission and Women's and Gender Studies Committee approval of a 4- to
6-page project proposal, in which the ideas, aim, general methodology, and preliminary bibliography for the
project are outlined and a faculty advisor is named; prior to submission of this proposal, students must con-
sult with a reference librarian.
2). at the end of the junior year, cumulative grade point average of 3.5 from courses taken in the major;
3). in the first week of classes of the senior year, submission and approval by the faculty advisor and second
reader of a 5- to 10-page "Plan of Action" (an overview of what has already been completed and a schedule
of what needs to be accomplished to finish the project). Where appropriate, students pursuing honors will
continue to consult with the second reader over the course of the semester(s).
All honors work, including the public presentation, will be evaluated by the Women's and Gender Studies
Committee. It will decide on the awarding of honors; the advisor will award the grade(s)
STUDY ABROAD
The Williams College Women's and Gender Studies Program encourages potential majors to study abroad in
order to enhance their education and gain international perspectives on gender and women's issues and femi-
nism. There are many excellent study abroad opportunities offering students a variety of possible experiences:
among them cultural immersion, field work, intensive language learning, independent study, participation in
another educational system. There are several semester-long programs with a specific focus on women and/or
gender administered by other U.S. Colleges that would especially enrich the educational experience of our ma-
jors:
Antioch College: Comparative Women's Studies in Europe fall semester
Augsburg College, Center for Global Education: Crossing Borders: Gender and Social Change in Mesoamer-
ica fall semester; and Social and Environmental Justice in Latin America spring semester
School for International Training:
The Balkans: Women and Democratization, fall or spring semester
Jamaica: Gender and Development, fall or spring semester
Mali: Gender and Development, fall or spring semester

WGST 402(S) Romantic Love (W)
This course is designed to enable advanced Women's and Gender Studies students to engage in vital research on
interdisciplinary topics. Both sexuality, in all its permutations, and"marriage" as a social and economic institution
have been the subject of widespread and intensive scholarship, analysis and theorizing within women's studies,
gender studies, and queer studies. Less strenuously examined is the category we often turn to to resolve and
redeem our ambivalences about both: romantic love. This course will focus on the concept of romantic love from
a variety of disciplinary and interdisciplinary perspectives, including history, literature, philosophy, anthropology,
and psychology. We will look at the development of the concept from its supposed"invention" in twelfth-century
France, through its establishment as the only"proper" foundation of marriage in nineteenth-century Britain and
America, to the present-day emphasis on same-sex romantic love as the most compelling reason homosexual
couples both need and deserve the right to marry. Key questions we will consider include: Is romantic love a
fundamentally Western concept? How have our ideas about it been shaped by gender ideology and gender roles?
Should we view it as a genuine ideal? a concept in need of "revisioning"? a dangerous mystification? Students
will have wide latitude in designing individual research projects.
Format: seminar. Requirements for the course include weekly 1-to 2-page critical response essays and one sub-
stantial research paper (15-20) pages.
Prerequisites: Women's and Gender Studies 101 and two electives (one of which may be taken during the spring
term in which the seminar is held). Enrollment limit: 15 (expected: 10).

CRITICAL REASONING AND
ANALYTICAL SKILLS (CRAAS) COURSES
Coordinator, Lecturer KAREN L. SHEPARD
To one degree or another, every class at Williams goes beyond its subject--be it mathematics, Machiavelli, or
modernism--to teach intellectual skills that have wide application in other fields as well as outside of the acade-
my: scientific reckoning, expository writing, rhetorical analysis, oral presentation, and so on.
Courses offered under the CRAAS initiative foreground such analytical skills. While each CRAAS class cov-
ers a different topic, all are aimed particularly at developing the processes necessary for excellence in a range of
fields: techniques for analyzing ideas, data, texts or artworks; approaches to interpreting, synthesizing, and devel-
oping arguments; strategies for presenting ideas and results.
CRAAS classes typically emphasize the practices of meta-analysis--self-criticism, editing, and revision--
with the goal of constant improvement. Many classes feature peer tutoring, small group work, and intensive
one-on-one engagement with the professor. Students should leave a CRAAS course with a substantially height-
ened ability to approach problems, analyze texts, and craft arguments in whatever discipline they may go on to
explore.
A few CRAAS courses are restricted to advanced students, but the majority are open to all, and some are
specifically targeted for first year students. Most have strictly limited enrollment. Because these classes cultivate
the general strategies of effective scholarship, students are encouraged to consider taking a CRAAS course early
in their academic careers.

PEOPLES AND CULTURES COURSES
The peoples and cultures requirement is intended to help students to begin to understand the cultural diversity
of American society and the world at large, so that, as citizens of an increasingly interconnected world, they may
become better able to respond sensitively and intelligently to peoples of varied social backgrounds and cultural
frameworks. Courses which fulfill this requirement are thus designed to familiarize students with some dimen-
sion of American cultural diversity or that of the non-Western world. Each student must complete one graded
semester course primarily concerned with: (a) the peoples and cultures of North America that trace their origins
to Africa, Asia, Latin America, Oceania, or the Caribbean; Native-American peoples and cultures; or (b) the
peoples and cultures of Africa, Asia, Latin America, Oceania, or the Caribbean. Although this course, which
may be counted toward the divisional distribution requirement, may be completed any semester before gradua-
tion, students are urged to complete the course by the end of the sophomore year.

QUANTITATIVE/FORMAL REASONING COURSES
Williams students should be adept at reasoning mathematically and abstractly. The ability to apply a formal
method to reach conclusions, to use numbers comfortably, and to employ the research tools necessary to analyze
data lessen barriers to carrying out professional and economic roles. Prior to their senior year, all students must
satisfactorily complete a Quantitative/Formal Reasoning (QFR) course--those marked with a "(Q)." Students
requiring extra assistance (as assessed during First Days) are normally placed into Mathematics 100/101/102,
which is to be taken before fulfilling the QFR requirement.
The hallmarks of a QFR course are the representation of facts in a language of mathematical symbols and the
use of formal rules to obtain a determinate answer. Primary evaluation in these courses is based on multistep
mathematical, statistical, or logical inference (as opposed to descriptive answers).

RELATED COURSE LISTINGS
There are a number of significant areas of studies in which Williams offers many relevant courses, yet no
formal program. To alert students to the opportunity for integrating courses from diverse disciplines into a focus
area and to encourage them to do so, the courses in this section are organized as lists of topic-related courses. For
their full descriptions, see the respective departmental sections.
Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual Studies
Gay, lesbian, and bisexual studies focuses on the social construction of sexuality, past and present. Although,
at present, Williams does not have a formal concentration in gay, lesbian, and bisexual studies, the College offers
a number of courses which examine how social, cultural, and political institutions shape sexualities, as well as the
responses and resistances thereto, through a variety of texts and contexts. The following courses include signifi-
cant components on gay, lesbian, and bisexual studies (at least two weeks out of the semester).

WRITING-INTENSIVE COURSES
Courses designated as "writing intensive"--those marked with a "(W)"--stress the process of learning to
write effectively. Such courses include a substantial amount of writing (a minimum of 20 pages), usually divided
into several discrete assignments. Instructors pay close attention to matters of style and argumentation. Enroll-
ments are limited to 19.
All Williams College students are required to take two writing-intensive courses: one by the end of the sopho-
more year and one by the end of the junior year. Students will benefit most from writing-intensive courses by
taking them early in their college careers and are therefore strongly encouraged to complete the requirement by
the end of the sophomore year.

WILLIAMS OFF-CAMPUS PROGRAMS
WILLIAMS-EXETER PROGRAMME AT OXFORD UNIVERSITY
Directors, Professor GUY M. HEDREEN
and Professor ELIZABETH P. MCGOWAN
THE PROGRAMME
Williams College offers a year-long programme of studies at Oxford University in co-operation with Exeter
College (founded in 1314), one of the constituent colleges of the University. Williams students will be enrolled as
Visiting Students at Exeter and as such will be undergraduate members of the University, eligible for access to
virtually all of its facilities, libraries, and resources. As Visiting Students in Oxford, students admitted to the Pro-
gramme will be fully integrated into the intellectual and social life of one of the world's great universities.
Although students in the Programme will be members of Exeter College, entitled to make full use of Exeter
facilities (including the College Library), dine regularly in Hall, and join all College clubs and organisations on
the same terms as other undergraduates at Exeter, students will reside in Ephraim Williams House, a compound
of four buildings owned by Williams College, roughly 1.4 miles north of the city centre. Three students from
Exeter College will normally reside in Ephraim Williams House each year, responsible for helping to integrate
Williams students into the life of the College and the University. A resident director (and member of the Williams
Faculty) administers Ephraim Williams House, oversees the academic programme, and serves as both the prima-
ry academic and personal advisor to Williams students in Oxford.
Students enrolled in the Oxford Programme must enroll for the full academic year, which consists of three
academic terms, each of which includes eight full weeks of instruction: MICHAELMAS TERM (early October
to early December), HILARY TERM (mid-January to mid-March), and TRINITY TERM (late April to late
June). Students are expected to be in residence to write their first tutorial papers before the eight weeks of instruc-
tion begins and to remain in residence during the week after the term ends in order to sit their final examinations.
Between the three terms there are two intervening four-five week vacations, during which students may be ex-
pected to continue reading as preparation for their upcoming tutorials.
THE TUTORIAL SYSTEM
Undergraduate instruction at Oxford University is largely carried out through individual or small-group tuto-
rials, in which students meet weekly with their tutor to present and discuss an essay they have written, based on
an extensive amount of reading undertaken from an assigned reading list they will receive at the beginning of
each term. In addition to the weekly tutorial, students are from time to time encouraged to attend a pertinent
course of lectures offered by the University that corresponds to the material being addressed in their tutorials.
Each student will plan a course of study for the three terms of the academic year in consultation with the
director of the Programme. In his or her capacity as the Tutor for Visiting Students at Exeter College, the director,
working closely with Exeter's subject tutors, will arrange the teaching for the students, monitor student progress,
be in regular contact with the student's tutors, supervise the examinations that students will sit at the end of each
academic term, and report on each student's academic progress to the Senior Tutor at Exeter College. There are
no "add/drop" periods at Oxford; once a student has made a commitment to a particular tutorial course, and the
director has then secured a tutor to teach that course, students cannot back out.
Over the course of the three terms, students are required to enroll in a minimum of FOUR full tutorial courses
(each consisting of eight individual tutorial meetings and requiring the preparation of eight essays) and ONE half
tutorial course (consisting of four individual tutorial meetings and the preparation of four essays). Some students
choose to substitute a fifth full tutorial course for the half tutorial course and a few will decide to enroll in two full
tutorial courses each term. The average course load undertaken by most students in residence in Oxford during
the past has been five full tutorial courses or their equivalent.
GRADES AND CREDIT
Grades for each tutorial course reflect the grade assigned to all eight (or four) tutorial sessions, including their
related essays, considered together, as well as the grade for the final examination on work accomplished in the
Williams-Exeter Programme at Oxford
­ 326 ­
individual tutorials and supplementary readings. Final examinations last three hours in the case of full tutorial
courses and two hours in the case of half tutorial courses and are always sat in the ninth week of term, following the
eight weeks of instruction each term. The final grade recorded on the Williams transcript is calculated by counting
the grade for the tutorial meetings and essays as two-thirds of the grade and the final examination as one-third of
the overall grade. For some tutorial courses (especially in writing and the studio arts), tutors may offer the student
the option of a final paper or project in lieu of an examination.
Upon satisfactory completion of the requirements for the Williams-Exeter Programme at Oxford University,
students receive academic credit for a regular Williams academic year, the four tutorial courses replacing the
regular eight semester courses the student would normally take at Williams, the half tutorial course replacing the
Winter Study Course. Grades eventually become a part of their Williams transcript and will be included in the
computation of their Grade Point Average.
Tutorial courses in Oxford may be used toward fulfilling the divisional distribution requirement; a student
may earn a maximum of three distribution requirements, with no more than one from each division, for the year.
All tutorial courses at Oxford meet the Williams College "Writing Intensive" designation, except for those in the
studio arts, mathematics, and the sciences.
Tutorial courses in Oxford may also be used to meet major requirements. Some departments at Williams will
grant a two-course credit towards the major for each full tutorial course taken at Oxford, and one course towards
the major for each half tutorial course taken at Oxford. Most departments, however, will grant a one-course credit
towards the major for each relevant tutorial course taken at Oxford (whether a full or a half). Half tutorial courses
are sometimes deemed to be insufficiently broad to satisfy certain requirements for the major. Students are en-
couraged to check with their department chair(s) to confirm official department policy.
THE COURSE OF STUDY
In addition to the opportunity to pursue British and Commonwealth Studies, Williams students in Oxford will
be able to pursue tutorials in fields in which Oxford is particularly noted (English Literature, Modern History,
Philosophy, Politics, Classics, Theology, etc.). Exeter College also has a Fellow in English Language and Litera-
ture (with interests ranging from the Renaissance--including Shakespeare--to the early nineteenth century)
committed to teaching Williams students, and students are thus encouraged to consider undertaking at least one
tutorial course in these fields as part of their course of study.
What follows is a list of tutorial courses normally available to students studying with the Williams-Exeter
Programme at Oxford. The tutorials listed below (WIOX 311-384) represent a selection of some of the standard
"papers" (courses) that comprise the Oxford degrees in various subjects and that are taught in tutorial format.
Normally, but not always, tutors can be secured who can teach these subjects to Williams students, although
demand, leave patterns, and other constraints, sometimes mean that not all of these subjects can be staffed in all
terms.
Some tutorial courses are accompanied by lectures. In such cases the term in which the lectures are delivered
is listed, as is the term in which students should take the tutorials (MT-Michaelmas Term; HT-Hilary Term; TT-
Trinity Term). Sometimes, where appropriate, prerequisites are also listed.
While many students enroll in the tutorial courses listed below (WIOX 311-384), it is also possible to choose
from other available Oxford courses under the heading of WIOX 390, a general rubric for more specialized tuto-
rial work. This is described in more detail below.

prerequisites; normally available in all three terms.
WIOX 333 English: Special Authors
This course allows students to focus in detail on the work of one or more authors of their choice, as a "full" or
"half" course. Here, the choice of author is broader than that available within the Oxford undergraduate syllabus.
The choice of Special Author should approximately correspond chronologically with the period papers on offer
at any given point in the year, and with the provision of teaching and lectures.
Prerequisite: some background in the close reading of literary texts and a general familiarity with the literature of
the period. The following are examples of some of the Special Authors who are currently, or have been, or will
be studied for the Special Authors course of the Oxford University syllabus. It is important to note that other
authors can usually be studied, depending on the availability of tutors:
WIOX 333a The Beowulf poet, Alfred, Aelfric, the Exeter Book (600-1100) MT
WIOX 333b Chaucer, Julian of Norwich, Langland, the York Cycle, the N-Town Cycle (1100-1509) MT, HT

WIOX 334 English: Special Topics
It is open to Williams students to devise a general topic of their own choice for study, falling within one of the
categories below, when tutors are available. The option is similar to the Special Topic course followed by third-
year Oxford undergraduates. The choice of Special Topic is usually configured so as approximately to corre-
spond chronologically with the period papers on offer at any given point in the year (as given at WIOX 330
above), and with the provision of teaching and lectures--although in practice there may often be some overlap
across periods.
Prerequisite: some background in the close reading of literary texts and a general familiarity with the literature of
the period. The Director should be available to advise you on the best arrangement of your choice.

WIOX 390 Specially Arranged Subjects
Specially arranged tutorial courses in some subject areas other than those covered by the WIOX 311-384 courses
might also be possible. A WIOX 390 is not simply what would be called an "independent study" course at Wil-
liams. Rather, a WIOX 390 is normally a "paper" (course) that is regularly offered at Oxford as either a required
or optional part of the degree in various subjects. For a list of all the "papers" that make up the degree require-
ments in various disciplines, students should consult the University of Oxford Examination Regulations, a recent
copy of which can be found in the Dean's Office. Important guidelines for how to make sense of this complex
and weighty tome (the equivalent of the Williams College Bulletin) are available from the Dean's Office and also
from the director. Much easier to use are the web sites belonging to the individual departments or "faculties" at
Oxford University (e.g., History, Philosophy, etc.); for lists of regular papers, go to the lecture lists or "schemes"
on the faculty web pages. It is easier to find tutors for a WIOX 390 in some fields (Classics, English, History,
Philosophy, Theology, etc.) than in others (Psychology, the natural sciences, etc) and students should realize that
it is not always possible for the Programme to accommodate their requests.
A sample list of Specially Arranged Subjects (WIOX 390) staffed during the past few years is offered below.
This list is not comprehensive. Furthermore, students who wish to undertake a WIOX 390 course are encour-
aged to consult the Examination Regulations rather than simply repeat what other students in the past have done.

NON-CREDIT FOREIGN LANGUAGE STUDY
In addition to their regular tutorial courses, students may begin or continue the study of a wide range of foreign
languages on a non-credit basis through a variety of arrangements available through the University as well as a
number of other educational and cultural institutions in the city of Oxford. The Programme normally subsidizes
such study.
STUDENT LIFE
By virtue of the fact that, while in Oxford, they are officially Visiting Students at the University--and full
members of Exeter College--Williams students are offered every opportunity to become fully integrated into
student life in Oxford. Both Exeter College and Oxford University are home to an exceptional variety of sports
clubs, debating societies, interest groups, cultural organizations, and social activities, virtually all of which are
available to Visiting Student members of the University. Students are encouraged to participate fully in the social
life of Exeter College--to dine in Hall as often as they wish, to frequent the College bar, to use the College's
athletic facilities, and to become members of the various College clubs and organizations. Furthermore, Williams
students also have access to the University's athletic events, concerts, theatrical productions, museums, and li-
braries. All Williams students in Oxford are provided with membership in the Oxford Union, which, in addition
to its debating activities and club rooms, possesses dining facilities and the largest lending library in the Universi-
ty.
At the Ephraim Williams House, all Williams students are housed in capacious double rooms and enjoy full
access to the House's library, common rooms, laundry facilities, computer lab, and a large dining room, in which
a weekly catered meal is served during the eight weeks of term. There are also a number of small kitchens in the
House which students may use. All rooms are fully wired for high-speed internet access and are fully equipped
with furnishings, bed linens, and a telephone. The grounds include a courtyard where basketball can be played,
sheltered bike racks, barbecue facilities, and gardens. A number of student jobs are available during the academic
year for students who wish to earn a little spending money by helping to maintain the facilities and organize
Programme activities. Ephraim Williams House is a short bike or bus ride (or a twenty-minute walk) from Exeter
College and the center of town, and is within easy walking distance of the University parks and the local shops,
restaurants and banks of Summertown. The Programme will partially subsidize student bus passes or bicycle
purchase or rental to facilitate travel around Oxford.
Before the academic year begins--at the end of September and in early October--ten days of orientation
activities are scheduled. Students are expected to be in residence for all of these many activities, some of which
take place in Ephraim Williams House, others at Exeter College. At this time students will become acquainted
with the workings of the Programme, of Exeter College, and of the University, and will be familiarized with the
rules and regulations they are expected to abide by during their residence in Oxford.
Throughout the academic year, provision will be made for trips to a number of sites of historical, cultural, or
political interest. In the past these have included the Cotswolds, Stratford, Stonehenge, Bath, Wells, Warwick
Castle, Blenheim Palace, and various sites of interest in London. Students will also be given the opportunity to
attend a number of theatrical productions and other cultural events. Oxford's proximity to London gives students
ready access to that city's multiple attractions and many resources. The Oxford-London train service is frequent
and the journey takes just over an hour. The buses to London run even more regularly (and are cheaper), and the
one-way journey takes about ninety minutes.
Williams-Exeter Programme at Oxford, Williams-Mystic Maritime Studies Program

During the summer before students arrive in Oxford, they will receive a copy of the latest edition of Ephs
Among the Dreaming Spires, which will further explain the perks, policies, and procedures of the Programme,
the rules and regulations they are expected to follow, and tips for how best to enjoy a fulfilling year in and around
Oxford.
ILLNESS AND INSURANCE
Students must ensure they are covered either by the Williams College health insurance policy or by some
other comprehensive health insurance plan (generally a family health insurance policy). While in Britain, stu-
dents will be covered by the National Health Service (NHS) for routine visits at the Group Medical Practice used
by Exeter College and for emergency hospital treatment. The programme also works with a physician in private
practice attached to a local private hospital. +Prescription drugs are available through the NHS for a nominal fee.
There are limited outpatient psychological counseling services available through the NHS and the Programme,
although, as Visiting Students at the University, Williams students are entitled to make use of the University
Counseling Centre. Any extensive or long-term counseling, however, would need to be covered by the student's
personal health insurance policy. Finally, students are not likely to be covered under the NHS for medical ser-
vices received in foreign countries, especially those countries that do not enjoy membership of the European
Union.
FEES
The tuition and room fees paid by students on the Williams-Exeter Programme at Oxford are the same as
those for a year spent in residence at Williams. Students are responsible for some of their own meals and for all of
their personal expenses. They are also responsible for the cost of their air travel to and from Britain, although they
may select to take the group flight to London arranged by the Programme at competitive rates. They are provided
with three meals a day for the first four or five days in Oxford and with a weekly catered meal in Ephraim Wil-
liams House during the eight weeks of term. They may also eat breakfast, lunch, and/or dinner on any day of the
week at Exeter. Students will not be charged the full Williams board fee during their year in Oxford, but they will
pay a proportion of the board fee to help cover these costs. For planning purposes, students and their parents
should expect the cost of a year on the Programme to be roughly the same as a year at Williams. Financial aid
eligibility will be figured on the usual basis of tuition, fees, room, board, and personal and book expenses, as if
the student were at Williams for the year. Similarly, the normal self-help contribution would be expected. Since
the academic year ends later at Oxford than at Williams, the summer earning expectations for students for the
following year will be reduced by one half and the difference will be made up by additional Williams aid.
APPLICATION
Admission to the Programme is on a competitive but flexible basis. Students must apply to the Dean's Office
by the prescribed deadline (normally early in February) and, prior to applying, should consult with the chair of
their major department. Any questions students might have about curricular offerings at Oxford can also be
raised with the director of the Programme in Oxford. In addition to completing the formal application form,
students can expect to be interviewed at Williams and will subsequently need to complete an application for
Visiting Student status at Oxford University. All admissions to the Programme are subject to approval by Exeter
College. Students can expect to be notified of acceptance before Spring Break. It is normally expected that they
will have completed the College's distribution requirement by the end of their sophomore year. In making its
decisions, the Admissions Committee of the Williams-Exeter Programme at Oxford University takes student
GPA into account, expects all applicants to have demonstrated capacity for rigorous independent work and ex-
tensive essay writing, and looks favorably on those students whose intellectual maturity, curiosity and enthu-
siasm would best prepare them for a demanding course of study in Oxford. All applicants must identify two
Williams faculty members who are willing to provide references. Because of the emphasis at Oxford on weekly
written work for each tutorial course, at least one of those faculty members should be able to offer an assessment
of the applicant's writing ability.
WILLIAMS-MYSTIC MARITIME STUDIES PROGRAM
Director, JAMES T. CARLTON
Faculty: JAMES T. CARLTON (Williams College), LISA GILBERT (Williams College), GLENN S.
GORDINIER (University of Connecticut), CATHERINE ROBINSON HALL (Mystic Seaport),
MARY K. BERCAW EDWARDS (University of Connecticut), RICHARD KING (University of St.
Andrews).
The Williams College-Mystic Seaport Maritime Studies Program offers students a unique opportunity to ex-
plore the ocean, to travel the Atlantic, Pacific, and Gulf coasts, and to undertake original research of their own
design in the humanities and sciences. No sailing experience necessary, and all majors welcome. Sophomores,
juniors, and seniors may attend. A term at Williams-Mystic includes credit for one semester plus one winter
study requirement, as well as intensive writing course credit. Four Williams courses are offered as an integrated,
multidisciplinary curriculum in the semester-long program at Mystic Seaport, in Mystic, Connecticut: Maritime
History, Literature of the Sea, Marine Policy, and either Marine Ecology or Oceanography (see the Maritime
Studies section in this catalog). Travel includes an offshore voyage on the open ocean sailing aboard a tall ship, a
seminar along the Pacific Coast, and a Louisiana field seminar, all of which are cross-disciplinary and inter-disci-
plinary exercises. Students live in historic, cooperative, coed houses at Mystic Seaport, the world's largest mari-
time museum, and have full access to world-class maritime collections, a maritime library, a new 2007 state-of-
the-art Marine Sciences teaching and research center, and diverse coastal habitats (where field research can be
undertaken in a wide variety of environments, ranging from tidepools and salt marshes to sandy beaches and

estuaries). Students also participate in maritime skills under professional instruction, with choices such as celes-
tial navigation, music of the sea, boat building, or small boat handling and sailing. Williams-Mystic seeks candi-
dates who are willing to try new things and work in a compelling academic environment. Participation in Wil-
liams-Mystic can also be used in partial fulfillment of the Maritime Studies Concentration at Williams. Interested
students should email admissions@williamsmystic.org, call (860-572-5359), visit the website (www.williams.e-
du/williamsmystic), or obtain a Williams-Mystic catalog from the Dean's office. Applications are on the web and

WNY 303(F) The Social Worlds of New York*
A glimpse of key social worlds in the great metropolis. The class will meet some of the men and women who
make the city tick: city officials; cops and prosecutors; entrepreneurs and trade unionists; housing activists; Wall
Street bankers; immigrant community leaders; coordinators of homeless shelters; and church leaders. The class
will also go behind the scenes of important businesses, including the fashion and entertainment industries. In
addition, each student will profile a city neighborhood and its social life, learned through participant observation
and intensive interviews and analyses of public reports. Readings include E. B. White, Here is New York and
Colson Whitehead, The Colossus of New York, as well as short pieces to orient students for group visits to differ-
ent social worlds.
Format: seminar. Requirements: full participation in the seminar, brief papers on class excursions, neighborhood
profile, oral presentations. Satisfies one semester of the Division II requirement.
KASINITZ
WNY 305(F) Craft and Consciousness
A sociological examination of how craft shapes consciousness. How and in what ways do work experiences
shape habits of mind, sensibilities, moral rules-in-use, ways of seeing and knowing, images of our society, and
world views? How do men and women in different occupations and professions establish criteria of validity and
reliability to assess their work experiences? How do they develop and internalize rules for discernment that en-
able them to sort through multiple and always conflicting versions and representations of social reality? How do
they make moral judgments on complex business, political, and social issues? How and with what results do
common work experiences shape close-knit occupational communities in a great metropolis? The course will
pay particular attention to the functionally interconnected but experientially disparate occupational worlds of
New York City.The course will host men and women from a wide range of occupations and professions from
police detectives to policy analysts, journalists, filmmakers, artists, educators, attorneys, corporate executives,
and scientists to discuss their work and work worlds with students. Several Williams alumni and alumnae will
participate in the course.
Format: discussion seminar. Requirements: full participation in the seminar, term paper.
Satisfies one semester of the Division II requirement.

WNY 307(F) Arts and the City
The legendary city that never sleeps, New York offers an unparalleled array of artistic activities and diversions.
As a global city, it boasts a depth of cultural institutions to match the power of its political, financial, and corpo-
rate spheres. Yet New York is also the most diverse city in the United States in terms of its immigrant population,
which is now more than 50 percent of the city's residents. Our course will explore the practice of the arts in
settings that range from canonical institutions of international repute (i.e. The Metropolitan Opera or MoMA) to
sites of vernacular artistic production (i.e. Haitian painting in Brooklyn or Bukharian Jewish music in Queens).
We will investigate the realms of music, dance, theater, literature, film, the visual arts, and a few things that defy
easy definition. We will pose questions about the many contexts of creation, presentation, and reception that
overlap in the Big Apple. Students will explore these many realms for themselves and bring their "field" experi-
ence back to the seminar. "Wandering off a city's beaten track, like wandering off in a wood," noted the German
social theorist Walter Benjamin, "requires a whole separate education." And a Metrocard for the subway, New
Yorkers will add.
Format: seminar. Requirements: attendance at 12 arts events and brief papers on each of these experiences, a field
journal, and full participation in seminar discussions. Satisfies one semester of the Division I requirement.

WNY 302(S) Cinema and the City
This multidisciplinary video production course brings together cinema, geography, and architectural and urban
studies, taking New York City as a case study. What cultural narratives are told about the city, and how does
cinema use the city in the service of the stories it tells? The course will explore treatments of the city in their
historical context, focusing on three periods. The first section will focus on discourses of alienation and corrup-
tion as they played out in the New York noirs of the 1940's and 1950's. In the second section of the course we
will look at the ways that these same mean streets were rendered in relation to the social and political geography
of the1960's and 1970's. The third section of the course will consider how stories are told in the increasingly
privatized, highly policed, electronically surveyed, and telemediated urban space of the post-Guiliani and
post-9/11 era. Production assignments will ask students to respond to issues raised by the screenings and read-
ings, and to use the built environment towards making their own moving images. Screenings will include from
The Naked City, Asphalt Jungle, Chelsea Girls, Panic in Needle Park, The Wiz, Symbiopsychotaxiplasm, Panic
Room, The 25th Hour, and many others. The course will also make use of the Tribeca Film Festival's NYNY
series. Lab sessions will offer instructions in narrative filmmaking technique and in the technologies of shooting
and editing.
Format: discussion seminar. Requirements: three short papers, three videos.
Satisfies one semester of the Division I requirement

WNY 304(S) Revolutions: Contemporary Art in the City
Utilizing the multiple meanings of "revolutions" as its conceptual structure (the term allows for a number of
interpretive definitions--historical cycles, cultural paradigm shifts, agents of change, notions of resistance and
subversion), this course will explore the manifold ways one can view and understand contemporary art, taking
advantage of the concentration of artists and art institutions that New York offers. The history of the city over the
last half-century as the definitively American (and debatably international) fulcrum of the art world provides
inimitable possibilities for field experience. How is contemporary art formed and shaped in this context? What
has changed about creative production within a "post-everything" worldview where so many boundaries have
been dissolved, and conversely, what has been retained? How has the specific history of New York been central
to cultural shifts in the art world? Ultimately, we will focus on the symbiotic relationship between the artist/art-
work itself and all the other aspects of the art world--critics, curators, and dealers, art schools, and, of course,
collectors and the market.
Format: discussion seminar. Most classes will be held in museum exhibitions, gallery shows and, primarily, art-
ists' studios. Requirements: Active participation in class discussion will be expected. Some historical and con-
temporary reading will be required. And students will be asked to visit and respond to specific exhibitions/events
Williams in New York

outside of class time. Class discussions will take place in the form of on-line conversations, a weekly, topical
blog. In addition, students will produce a final term paper for the course (other project proposals can be consid-
ered, if the structure maintains a focused, rigorous argument).
Satisfies one semester of the Division I requirement.
MOMIN
WNY 306(S) Street Smarts: Learning to Read the City
An on-the-ground introduction to the great American metropolis, the physical city as it has evolved over the past
three centuries. Libraries are overflowing with accounts of New York's history, architecture, and neighborhoods,
but the city is best learned on the streets. In walks throughout New York we will learn how to read the cityscape,
visiting such major monuments as Rockefeller Center, Central Park, and Grand Central Terminal, and such dis-
parate neighborhoods as Times Square and SoHo, the Lower East Side, and Flushing. We will study skyscrapers
and Broadway theaters, tenements, and planned suburbs. We will examine the various forces that created these
places and caused them to evolve over time. We will discuss the impact of modern monuments, historic pres-
ervation, speculative development, and public and private plans and consider their various intended and unin-
tended consequences.
Format: discussion seminar. The course will be conducted entirely on the city's streets. Requirements: each stu-
dent will be responsible for assigned readings, a journal with entries on each walk, a mid-term presentation on an
assigned topic, and a final paper on the same topic. Students will be graded on their attendance, journals, mid-
term presentation, and final paper.
Satisfies one semester of the Division I requirement.

WINTER STUDY PROGRAM
REMINDERS ABOUT WSP REGISTRATION
All students who will be on campus during the 2007-2008 academic year must register for WSP. Registration
will take place in the early part of fall semester. If you are registered for a senior thesis in the fall which must be
continued through Winter Study by departmental rules, you will be registered for your Winter Study Project
automatically. In every other case, you must complete registration. First-year students are required to participate
in a Winter Study that will take place on campus; they are not allowed to do 99's.
Even if you plan to take a 99, or the instructor of your first choice accepts you during the registration period,
there are many things that can happen between registration and the beginning of Winter Study to upset your first
choice, so you must list five choices. You should try to make one of your choices a project with a larger enroll-
ment, not that it will guarantee you a project, but it will increase your chances.
If you think your time may be restricted in any way (ski meets, interviews, etc.), clear these restrictions with
the instructor before signing up for his/her project.
Remember, for cross-listed projects, you should sign up for the subject you want to appear on your record.
For many beginning language courses, you are required to take the WSP Sustaining Program in addition to
your regular project. You will be automatically enrolled in this Sustaining Program,so no one should list this as a
choice.
The grade of honors is reserved for outstanding or exceptional work. Individual instructors may specify mini-
mum standards for the grade, but normally, fewer than one out of ten students will qualify. A grade of pass means
the student has performed satisfactorily. A grade of perfunctory pass signifies that a student's work has been
significantly lacking but is just adequate to deserve a pass.
If you have any questions about a project, see the instructor before you register.
Finally, all work for WSP must be completed and submitted to the instructor no later than Friday, January
25th. Only the Dean can grant an extension beyond this date.
WINTER STUDY 99'S
Sophomores, juniors and seniors are eligible to propose "99's," independent projects arranged with faculty
sponsors, conducted in lieu of regular Winter Study courses. Perhaps you have encountered an interesting idea in
one of your courses which you would like to study in more depth, or you may have an interest not covered in the
regular curriculum. In recent years students have undertaken in-depth studies of particular literary works, in-
terned in government offices, assisted in foreign and domestic medical clinics, conducted field work in econom-
ics in developing countries, and given performances illustrating the history of American dance. Although some
99's involve travel away from campus, there are many opportunities to pursue intellectual or artistic goals here in
Williamstown.
99 forms are available online: http://www.williams.edu/Registrar/winterstudy/99direct.html
The deadline for submitting the proposals to faculty sponsors is Thursday, 27 September.
AFRICANA STUDIES
AFR 11 Very Contemporary African Literature (Same as Comparative Literature 11 and English
11)
This course will cover recently published sub-Saharan African literature written in English. Our reading will be
framed by a set of critical questions: how does the very contemporary literature look back at the past, the preced-
ing (20th) century? How are we to understand recent texts' representations of the past? What insights do they
yield? What do their preoccupations reveal about the present age? The very contemporary nature of this work
will serve as an introduction not only to new writers but also to new thematic concerns they offer their publics.
This sampling will enable the class to consider current trends that (may) define and perhaps question the contours
of the established "African Canon"-from a reconsideration of realism to a broaching of previously taboo sub-
jects. Course readings-two to three texts-will be selected from among some of the following: Adichie's Half of a
Yellow Sun (set in the Nigerian civil war), Isegawa's Abyssinian Chronicles (set in Idi Amin's Uganda), Wi-
comb's David's Story (set in post-apartheid South Africa), and selected readings from Granta's The View from
Africa.
Evaluation will be based upon regular attendance, class participation, tri-weekly short writing responses and a
final book review.
No prerequisites, but previous literature course preferred. Enrollment limit: 15. Preference will be given to Afri-
cana concentrators.
Costs to students: approximately $60 for books and photocopying.

ing techniques, publicity for events, and today's music industry. This class will culminate in a public performance
of material written during the course.
To successfully pass this course, students are required to create, edit, perform and possibly record two original
songs. These songs must be conceived during the course period (in other words, previously written material is
not usable.) Students will be guided to create both music and lyrics. They may also be required to participate in a
co-write session. One of these songs will be presented during the final performance, preferably by the student.
Attendance at classes, feedback sessions, and all officially scheduled events is mandatory and crucial. Also, a
short writing assignment will be passed in on the last day of class.
No prerequisites. Students with a musical background and the ability to play and instrument may be given pref-
erence, but anyone interested is encouraged to register. (Bernice.Lewis@williams.edu). Enrollment limit: 15.

AMST 25 Asian American Experimental Poets and Artists in New York City
This course examines the work of Asian American experimental poets and artists who live in New York City. We
will contemplate various questions: what is the link between work that pushes formal boundaries (and may not
be explicitly ethnically marked) and the social context from which it springs? How do poets learn from the visual
arts and how do visual artists learn from poetry? What does it mean to be an Asian American poet or artist work-
ing on the East Coast? How has New York City influenced their work? The middle portion of the course (about
eight days) will take place in New York City, where students will meet with poets and artists and have the oppor-
tunity to ask them questions about their work and see firsthand the material working conditions of the artists'
studios. We will also visit various galleries and museums (including P.S. 1, the Studio Museum of Harlem, the
Asia Society, the Museum of Modern Art, the Whitney Museum) and talk with Asian American curators. We
will also explore various Asian American venues in NYC: the Asian American Writers' Workshop, the Museum
of Chinese in the Americas, ImaginAsian theater, and Chinatown, among other places. Students will be given the
option for their final project of writing a critical paper or writing a series of poems and/or producing a piece of art.
They will also be asked to write short response papers during the course.
Enrollment limit: 10.
Cost to students: $1275.

ANTHROPOLOGY AND SOCIOLOGY
ANSO 10 Meditation-Based Stress Reduction: Adopting a Mindfulness Practice (Same as Religion
10)
This course provides an opportunity to actively participate in your own health and well-being. Students will be
introduced to the concept of mindfulness and guided in how to create their own mindfulness practice, one that
incorporates meditation and yoga. Mindfulness is a way of relating directly to what is happening in your life, a
way of taking charge of your life, a way of doing something for yourself that no one else can do for you--con-
sciously and systematically working with your own stress, pain, illness and the challenges and demands of colle-
giate life.
We will meet twice per week for 3-hour sessions of meditation, yoga, and inquiry into the interplay of mind and
body in health and illness, calm and stress. The origin of meditation and yoga in the Hindu and Buddhist tradi-
tions will be explored, with specific emphasis on the influence of Buddhist meditation on this secular stress re-
duction practice.
Students are required to commit to 45 minutes of mindfulness meditation and yoga practice on a daily basis.
Additional assignments will include weekly reading of texts relevant to the course as well as brief presentations
of concepts from these texts. You will be evaluated on these presentations, as well as a final paper. Attendance
and participation will also be taken into account.
Please note: all queries about this course should be directed to the instructor, who can be reached at

and hail from both urban and rural areas throughout New York State. The problems that they bring to Berkshire
Farm are multiple. These include: the psychological scars of dysfunctional families, including those of physical,
emotional, and sexual abuse; chemical dependency; juvenile delinquency; inability to function in school settings;
and various other issues. Residential treatment is a multi-modal approach that includes anger-replacement train-
ing, social skills training, and behavioral modification.
Williams students will commute to Berkshire Farm and work under supervision in one of the following areas:
school, cottage life, chemical dependency unit, research, recreation, performing arts, or in individual tutoring.
Requirements: students will keep a journal reflecting on their experiences, and a weekly seminar with the
instructor will draw on service learning experience. Students will also be required to submit a final 10-page paper
at the end of the course.

ANSO 12 Children and the Courts: Internship in the Crisis in Child Abuse
The incidence of reported child abuse and neglect has reached epidemic proportions and shows no signs of de-
creasing. Preventive and prophylactic social programs, court intervention, and legislative mandates have not suc-
cessfully addressed this crisis. This course allows students to observe the Massachusetts Department of Social
Services attorney in courtroom proceedings related to the care and protection of children. Students will have ac-
cess to Department records for purposes of analysis and will also work with social workers who will provide a
clinical perspective on the legal cases under study. The class will meet regularly to discuss court proceedings, as-
signed readings, and the students' interactions with local human services agencies. Access to an automobile is
desirable but not required; some transportation will be provided as part of the course.

films, of a notion of artistic genius, paying particular attention to the role played by gender. Our discussions will
be based on the films themselves as well as comparative material--biographical and art historical readings on the
various artists.
Evaluation will be based on class participation, written responses to films, and a 10-page paper.

ARTH 13 An American Family and "Reality" Television (Same as Women's and Gender Studies
13)
An American Family was a popular documentary series that featured the Loud family from Santa Barbara, Cali-
fornia, whose everyday lives were broadcast on national television. The series generated an enormous amount of
attention, commentary, and controversy when it premiered on PBS in 1973. Today, it is regarded as the origin of
so-called "Reality TV." In addition to challenging standard rules for television programming, the show chal-
lenged social conventions and asked viewers to think seriously about family relations, sexuality, and the "Ameri-
can dream." Documenting the family's life over the course of eight months, the series chronicled the dissolution
of the Louds' marriage and broadcast the "coming out" of eldest son Lance Loud, the first star of reality televi-
sion.
In this class, we will view the An American Family series in its entirety, research the program's historical recep-
tion, and analyze its influence on broadcast and film media, particularly on "reality" television.
Format: seminar. Requirements: students will write weekly response papers and prepare annotated research bib-
liographies that will be used to develop a final research paper.

ARTH 14 The Philadelphia Tradition in American Art
How is that a city with so unpromising an artistic culture as Quaker Philadelphia produced some of America's
most important artists and architects? Among painters, Thomas Eakins, Mary Cassatt, and the Ashcan School
are all Philadelphians, as are the architects Frank Furness, Louis Kahn and Robert Venturi. This winter study will
be devoted to an examination of the artistic and architectural culture of Philadelphia--its Quaker roots, its nine-
teenth-century realism and its leadership in post-modernism. During an extended field trip we will visit the Penn-
sylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, Philadelphia's Victorian suburbs and the campuses of Bryn Mawr and Hav-
erford Colleges.
Students will prepare a report on a major work or artist, and where possible will present their findings on site.
Prerequisite: ArtH 264 or consent of instructor. Enrollment limit: 10.
Meeting time: afternoons.

ARTH 15 Inventing Joan of Arc: The History of a Hero(ine) in Pictures and Film
Joan of Arc (known during her own lifetime most commonly as Jeanne "la Pucelle," or Joan "the Maid") was
one of the most dynamic and yet enigmatic personalities of the European Middle Ages. Born into a peasant
family in the French border province of Lorraine in 1412, she gained control of an army, won brilliant military
victories, crowned a king, and was burnt at the stake as a heretic, all before her twentieth birthday. Triply mar-
ginalized by gender, age, and socio-economic status, she nonetheless managed to shake the Church and State
establishments to their very core. But who was Joan of Arc? Nationalist martyr? Pioneer feminist? Champion of
the people? Instrument of God's grace? Victim of post-traumatic stress disorder? Over the centuries since her
death, artists--and not just politicians and scholars--have attempted to answer this question, creating myriad
visions of la Pucelle under the influence of an ever-changing lens of contemporary tastes and concerns. Through
readings and discussion, this course will survey the history of representations of Joan of Arc in painting, prints,
sculpture, and film, from the time of her death to the present.
Requirements: 10-page paper or comparable creative project.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15.
Meeting time: afternoons.

ARTH 25 At the Junction of Aesthetics and Commerce--A Close Look at Antique and New
Production Rugs and Textiles in the US and Turkey (Same as Chemistry 25 and Economics 26)
After looking at two antique rug collections here in the Berkshires, and perhaps one in Northampton, the group
will visit "Woven Legends" in Philadelphia, to discuss with George Jevremovic and his partners their longstand-
ing and successful production of new rugs in Eastern Anatolia, Turkey, and in China. During this first week, we
will also organize a seminar to discuss the issue of what is art, what is craft, what is "reproduction", and the
relation between the price/availability of "good' reproductions, and the price of "genuine" art/antiques.
At the end of the first week, we fly to Istanbul to explore the antique rug and textile market, several museums,
perhaps a private collection, and also visit the most important cultural monuments in the old city. If there is a dye
chemist among our group, we may be able to arrange a meeting and possible laboratory project with Harald
Winter Study Program
­ 342 ­
Boehmer, aleading dye chemist long associated with the DOBAG Project, which re-introduced natural dyes into
Turkish village weaving in the 1980s. After about a week in Istanbul, we will take a bus to Izmir to inspect a
major rug repair facility, Antique Textile Conservation, run by the Opcin brothers. After proceeding further east
by bus/train to Konya, in Central Anatolia, we will see cultural monuments of the Seljuks, as well as traditional
felt production, and possibly stay in a remodeled old Turkish house. Weather permitting, we will spend a few
days in a mountain village south of Konya. Returning to Konya, we will fly to Erzurum, in Eastern Anatolia, to
see the Woven Legends operation in nearby villages. Finally, we will return by air to Istanbul and wind up with
several hands-on sessions with local dealers on verbalizing aesthetics, most likely through "good, better, best"
exercises among rugs/textiles of the same genre. The final exam will consist of 10 unknown rugs at 10 points
each. Two points will be awarded for correct geographical location, and 8 for discussing why that might be so,
i.e. what elements--color, design, structure, etc.--were critical to your thinking. Because it is difficult to find
quality guides for the cultural monuments we will wish to visit, I will ask students to prepare themselves to be
guides for some of them over the Christmas break. I understand that some of the cultural monuments, for exam-
ple, Ay Sofia, can be visualized online, and there is an abundance of written material on all the ones we will
officially visit.
All interested students are asked to sign up for the course in the Registrar's Office by September 27. After signing
up, but before October 17, please send a brief email message to the instructor, wrightnh@adelphia.net, describ-
ing your educational objectives for the course, and your ability to be flexible in unexpected circumstances. Not
open to first-year students.
Cost to student: approximately $3,000.

ART STUDIO
ARTS 11 The Animate Image
The course will examine visual images and the 'impulse to move.' Through making drawings we will consider
the phenomenological experience of an object, and using a variety of tactical strategies, work with those draw-
ings to facilitate the communication of that experience. Experimenting with layering, text, and animation, we will
propel, expand, contract, and transform the image. The course will involve studio drawing intensives, stop-mo-
tion animation, looking at the impulse to move in artwork including Peter Paul Rubens, Duchamp, the Futurists,
William Kentridge, and other contemporary artists, reading text excerpts and writing a short critical paper on a
chosen artist, and participating in a collective 'circuitous drawing' project.

ARTS 12 Learning from the Art of Outsiders
Jean Dubuffet believed that true creativity came from individuals who had escaped culture. So what can we, as
cultured artists, learn from these people who have made their own direct way creating unique methods and imag-
ery unmediated by social convention? This half-lecture and half-studio art course will study naïve, folk, art brut,
visionary and other artists who do not typically look to art history as a point of reference. Students will explore
the various methods used by famous outsiders like Henry Darger, Aloise, Minnie Evans, Adolf Wolfli, and Ho-
ward Finster, and will develop their own imagery, experimenting with excess and hopefully turn their interests
into obsessions.
Each class session will consist of one hour of lecture and two hours of studio with 15 hours per week of indepen-
dent work outside of class required. The nature of this course, which focuses on art of untrained individuals,
makes it appropriate for students who have never had a fine art course as well as continuing art students. The

ARTS 14 Introduction to Sound Composition
The creation of a sound composition does not require the writing of a traditional musical score. It can be made
with physical experimentation with voice and body, with household objects such as kitchenware, with old-fash-
ioned toys, with field recordings made on the streets and grasslands of Williamstown. Recordings can be rustled
up with the aid of samplers and computers in a studio setting, or in a live improvisational setting.
This will be a workshop in which students will learn about recording and production equipment with the aim of
creating two sound compositions: one with a focus on the possibilities of the human voice, and the other made
from field recordings. Emphasis will be placed on computer editing techniques and use of live sampling technol-
ogy. Composition work will be supplemented by listening sessions. The work on the two composition assign-
ments will take at least 20 hours a week. This includes exercises and listening to relevant music and sound pieces,
as well as collecting/recording/composing materials. There may also be some additional listening and screening
sessions of relevant material as the need arises.
A final presentation of the students' creative work will be required.
No previous experience in sound or music production is necessary. Work in groups encouraged. Enrollment lim-
it: 12.

CHIN 13 Theory and Practice of Chinese Cooking
Much more than in the U.S., in China people are always talking about food; as the Chinese saying has it, min yi
shi wei tian `the people consider eating as heaven'. This hands-on course will foster an appreciation of the histor-
ical and cultural background of Chinese cooking, as well as the development of practical skills in preparing a
variety of Chinese dishes. To the extent possible, we will use locally available ingredients (organic if possible) to
cook authentic Chinese food, primarily Chinese home cooking. Since climate has had a huge impact on avail-
ability of ingredients, the course includes an introduction to the four primary regions, or schools, of Chinese
cooking--Northern, Eastern, Western, and Southern. Guest chefs will be invited to class to introduce a number
of regional dishes. While we will cook most dishes together, every student will also have the opportunity to cook
independently. Students will be expected to complete assigned readings, view films outside of class and write
film reviews, shop at an Asian supermarket to learn about the various cooking ingredients, dine at several Chi-
nese restaurants and write food critiques, and interview chefs.
Evaluation will be based on class participation, two short papers/reviews, a final project involving the creation
and cooking of original recipes, and one 10-page paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 8. In case of overenrollment, preference will be given to upper-class students
who have some background in Chinese language.
Cost to student: approximately $75 for Xerox packet and materials.
Meeting time: two three-hour sessions per week, 10 a.m.-1 p.m.

JAPN 10 Japanese Animation (Same as Comparative Literature 10)
Read or Die is the title of a popular Japanese animated series about secret agents in the employ of the world's
great libraries. But what does it mean to read in an age and culture so dominated by visual media? This class is an
introduction to writing about Japanese animation, or anime: the challenges it poses to traditional ways of reading
literature and film, and the often challenging critical work it has inspired. We will screen several animated Japa-
nese feature films and short series, focusing particularly on the work of Oshii Mamoru; we will read the work of
literature and media scholars who have tried to come to terms with anime; and we will track the latest work on
animation by taking an inside look at the editing process for Mechademia, an annual journal of anme and maga
criticism for which the instructor is an editor. We will also look at things from the creators' side by meeting with
students and faculty at the Center for Cartoon Studies in White River Junction, Vermont.
Required activities: three 2-hour morning class meetings per week and two 2.5-hour afternoon screenings per
week, plus self-scheduled viewings, readings, and a 10-page paper or visual project.
Evaluation will be based on attendance, preparation, participation, and a final project.
No prerequisites. All material is translated or subtitled in English. Enrollment limit:15. Preference given to stu-
dents with a strong interest in literature and film.

ASTRONOMY
ASTR 10 Applied Aerodynamics
The myth of Icarus illustrates the powerful attraction of flight. Some of us love the very notion of moving
through the air with three full spatial degrees of freedom. While many of us do this routinely inside large alumi-
num tubes, personally flying an aircraft adds another dimension of excitement. Though we will not be flying
full-size airplanes, we can do a great deal with miniature aircraft in an indoor setting. The course will be con-
ducted in semi-tutorial fashion, with student presentations, construction sessions, flying sessions, and traditional
lectures. We will cover the history and physics of heavier-than-air flight (balloons are boring!). No previous ex-
perience or coursework is required-students will learn the necessary fundamentals in class. On the practical side,
students will start out building and flying simple gliders. Students will eventually build a remote-controlled air-
craft (fixed- or rotary-wing), and learn to fly it. The course will culminate with our own airshow.
Evaluation will be based on completion of projects, student presentations, and a 5-page paper on some aspect of
the material.
There are no prerequisites other than enthusiasm for flight and willingness to learn some basic physics. Enroll-
ment limit: 6.
Cost to students: approximately $250 for materials.
Meeting time: 3 mornings each week; outside-class work will include reading and preparation of presentations,
construction sessions, and flight instruction and practice.
SOUZA
ASTR 11 Our Dangerous Universe
Our universe can be a very dangerous place. Compared to the destructive power of a single exploding star, the
Earth's total nuclear arsenal is a mere firecracker. Asteroids strike planets causing mass extinctions. Even our
own Sun will eventually swallow up the Earth. How real and imminent are these threats to humanity? Popular
media and literature certainly would have us believe that the end is near! In this course, we will evaluate the
likelihood of such impending doom. To understand the risks we face, we must first learn about those things that
threaten us. To this end, we will study asteroids, black holes, supernovae and gamma-ray bursts (the most power-
ful explosions in the universe since the Big Bang itself). We will examine how hazardous these phenomena are to
life on Earth and consider the influence these phenomena have on the chances for extra-terrestrial life in the
universe.
The course will be taught through a combination of lecture and discussion, including consideration of how these
risks are portrayed in popular media (movies, books, etc.)
Evaluation will be based on problems and thought exercises completed outside the classroom; class attendance
and participation will also be taken into account. A short final paper or oral presentation will be required.
No previous experience or coursework is required. The level of mathematics will be confined to basic algebra

BIOL 10 Electron Microscopy
Students will undertake an independent project to investigate a topic of their choice using the transmission and
scanning electron microscopes. They will do their own sample preparation, operate the two electron micro-
scopes, and take micrographs of relevant structures. Class time will give a brief overview of the theory and op-
eration of the microscopes and microtomes. In addition, students will learn how to develop and print their film
from the TEM, and learn how to manipulate the digital images from the SEM in Adobe Photoshop. (Do you
want your erythrocytes red or blue?)
There will be brief reading assignments, a guest speaker and a 10-page paper with 8 well-focused micrographs
required.

BIOL 11 Curing Health Care (Same as Economics 28)
For the past several years increases in U.S. health care costs have significantly outpaced both inflation and per-
sonal income growth. Many American employers have cut their employee's health care benefits in order to re-
main profitable. Experts predict that federal health care expenditures will need to double over the next decade to
cope with the unprecedented demand on health care created by the graying "baby boomer" generation. On a per
capita basis, a major reduction in funds available for health care seems inevitable. A reduction in health care
expenditures in the U.S. will create difficult questions. For example, Are all Americans entitled to the same qual-
ity of care regardless of ability to pay?; Is consumer-directed health care a good idea?; Should the U.S. adopt a
single-payer system?
This course will give students the opportunity to look at health care from various points of view, including eco-
nomic, medical, social, ethical, and legal perspectives. We will consider recent legislation that requires Massa-
chusetts residents to buy health care insurance. Students will be asked to propose the best strategies for financing
health care and to predict the positive and negative impacts of those strategies. Students will have several oppor-
tunities to interview experts and to express their own views.
Evaluation will be based on classroom participation, performance in semi-formal team debates, and a 10-page
position paper due at the end of the term.
No prerequisites. Enrollment open to all but limited to 18.
Cost to student: none.
Meeting time: MWF, 10-noon, plus each student will need to attend one Thursday meeting.

BIOL 13 Evolution Matters: Science Literacy and the Challenge of Intelligent Design
Evolution is a core concept in science, critical to a meaningful understanding of modern biology. Despite its
importance, in American public acceptance of the concept is low and has been decreasing over the past twenty
years.
In this class we will study history of opposition to evolution, from literalist Biblical creationism to the `Intelligent
Design' movement. We will examine the claims made by opponents of evolution and the ways that the contro-
versy has played out in legistlatures, classrooms, and courtrooms. We will also discuss the nature of science and
the ways that the Intelligent Design movement would redefine it. Finally, we will discuss why evolution is im-
portant for public science literacy, its relevance to practical concerns such as medicine, and ways that classroom
lessons on evolution can enhance public understanding of science and related issues.
Evaluation will be based on participation in class discussions and a 10-page paper.

BIOL 14 Mt. Greylock: Our Most Excellent Majesty (Same as Environmental Studies 11)
The highest peak in southern New England (at 3491 feet above mean sea level) has long attracted the attention of
residents, outdoor enthusiasts (Timothy Dwight in 1800), and literati such as Nathaniel Hawthorne and Herman
Melville (who coined the term "most excellent majesty" to describe the peak). After his encounter with Mt.
Greylock, Henry David Thoreau wrote, "It would be no small advantage if every college were thus located at the
base of a mountain..." The landscape, geologic, social, and natural histories of Mt. Greylock have been the sub-
ject of centuries of exploration by Williams College faculty, students and alumni, and this course will be a contin-
uation of that tradition.
The purpose of this course is to compile and interpret historical and environmental information such as images,
maps, traveller's accounts, and oral histories about Mt. Greylock, and to disseminate the results as a group digital
research paper, with each student in the course contributing a chapter to the effort. This paper will then be made
available to the public over the World Wide Web.
Evaluation: production of a 10- to 15-page chapter and participation in course discussions/field trips.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 10.
Cost to student: approximately $40 for texts.
Meeting times: 3 mornings per week, with 3 all-day fieldtrips.

CHEM 11 Science for Kids (Same as Special 11)
Are you interested in teaching? Do you enjoy working with kids? Do you like to experiment with new things?
Here is a chance for you to do all three! The aim of this Winter Study Project is to design a series of hands-on
science workshops for elementary school children and their parents. Working in teams of 2-4, students spend the
first two and a half weeks of Winter Study planning the workshops. This involves deciding on a focus for each
workshop (based on the interests of the students involved) followed by choosing and designing experiments and
presentations that will be suitable for fourth-grade children. On the third weekend of Winter Study (January 19,
20) we bring elementary school kids with their parents to Williams to participate in the workshops.
You get a chance to see what goes into planning classroom demonstrations as well as a sense of what it's like to
actually give a presentation. You find that kids at this age are great fun to work with because they are interested in
just about everything and their enthusiasm is infectious. You also give the kids and their parents a chance to actu-
ally do some fun hands-on science experiments that they may not have seen before, and you are able to explain
simple scientific concepts to them in a manner that won't be intimidating. It is a rewarding experience for all in-
volved.
Evaluation is based on participation in planning and running the workshops. Each group is expected to prepare a
handout with descriptions of the experiments for the kids, parents, and teachers.
No prerequisites: You need not be a science major; all that is needed is enthusiasm. Enrollment limit: 25.
Cost to student: none.
Meeting time: mornings. Classes meet three times a week for approximately three hours each session. The work-
shop is run on the third weekend of Winter Study (January 19, 20) and attendance from 9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. is
mandatory that weekend. There are also one or two brief meetings held in the fall term for preliminary planning.

CHEM 15 "You Are Not Listening!"--Exploring Interpersonal Conflict (Same as Leadership
Studies 15 and Special 15)
The aim of this course is to equip you with communication and leadership skills to navigate interpersonal con-
flicts in a productive manner, whether you find yourself in an uncomfortable situation in professional settings or
in relationships with family members or friends. We will discuss models of conflict resolution and examine the
structures of these commonly difficult conversations using examples from our own experiences.
Through role-plays, we will practice communication skills important to productive dialogue, learn how to listen
for and interpret the significance of what is said and not said. We will also explore how our own immediate
reactions may get in the way of achieving what we really want. By analyzing the underlying reasons for disputes
from different perspectives, we will look to create outcomes that serve our interests and address the needs of our
adversaries. We will experiment with stepping into active leadership in conflicts for the sake of creating the types
of relationships we want to have. Though the focus is on interpersonal conflict, the mediation skills taught in this
class are an asset in many negotiation settings, including the future workplace.
The class format will be largely group discussions and activities such as role-plays in which you will practice
conflict resolution and mediation techniques. Outside-of-class work is an important and integral part of the
course, and includes reading, practicing communication and conflict resolution skills, and homework exercises.
Evaluation will be based on all class related activities, with an emphasis on participation in class discussions and
activities. Attendance of all classes is expected.
No prerequisites. Students should be genuinely interested in learning how to create personal growth from con-
flicts. The topics of the class and the nature of experiential exercises and follow-up discussions call for some level
of self-disclosure and sharing of personal experiences of conflict. Every participant will be asked to keep the
content and details of shared personal experiences confidential. Enrollment limit: 18.
Cost to student: approximately $40 for books and photocopying.

COMPUTER SCIENCE
CSCI 10 Untangling the Web: A Social Analysis of the Internet
Do BitTorrent and YouTube violate copyright laws? Should you be held accountable for incriminating pictures
that your friends post on Facebook or MySpace? The Internet, which began in the late 1960s as a small govern-
ment-funded project connecting four computers, now connects billions of computers world-wide. It has un-
doubtedly become an integral part of our lives, and has provided new ways for people to communicate and share
information. Certainly any network with billions of computers requires some centralized control in order to func-
tion.
So who controls the Internet? Or more importantly, who should control the Internet? This class will examine the
complex public policy issues involved in answering these questions from both a technical and social standpoint,
and discuss how the decisions we make today will impact the design of the future Internet. Topics covered will
include a brief history of the Internet, net neutrality, Internet governance and control, copyright and patent law,
peer-to-peer file sharing legality, privacy and security, spyware and phishing, and the future of the Internet.
Format and evaluation: Class meetings will consist primarily of discussions and debates based on reading assign-
ments. Students will write a short (1 page) summary of the assigned readings before each class, and will take
turns leading discussions and serving as scribes during class. Assignments will include creating a simple personal
webpage, writing a short (2 page) position paper, and a longer (8-10 page) research paper on a topic of the stu-
dent's choice. Class attendance and participation will be mandatory to receive a passing grade.
Weekly expectations (time in and out of class): Approximately 6 hours in class, and 20 hours outside of class.

ECON 11 Public Speaking
This course will help students become effective and organized public speakers, whether public speaking means
giving a class presentation, participating in a debate, or giving a formal speech before a large audience. We will
primarily use extemporaneous and prepared class presentations as a means of learning this skill, but we will also
study the great American speeches and presidential debates of the twentieth century for further insights into per-
suasive public speaking techniques. The class will provide a supportive environment to help each student create
his or her own public speaking style that is comfortable, confident, and conversational. We will also focus on
organizational techniques, handling visual aids effectively, eye contact and body language. Finally, receiving
feedback and providing constructive criticism to other students in the class will be an important part of the
course.
Requirements: 5-6 oral presentations to the class, most of which will be videotaped and critiqued. Evaluation will
be based on in-class presentations, class participation, and a 10-page written critique of the student's own video-
taped presentations.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 12. Preference given to juniors and seniors.
Cost to student: approximately $25 for materials.
Meeting time: afternoons.

ECON 12 Personal Financial Planning
Have you been buying lottery tickets and charging them to your (or your parents') credit card? At that rate of
return (about -68%), you will be living on bread and water! Most people assume responsibility for their personal
finances on leaving college, but have little training for the decisions that they will have to make. And changing
regulations and the aging of societies is leaving workers and entrepreneurs (e.g., shortly, you) in charge of financ-
ing their retirement. Worse still, you will confront an industry--investment advising--that does a great job en-
riching itself at clients' expense. This course will provide you with some of the basic tools to make financial
decisions. It will begin by familiarizing you with Excel, which can help you understand and effectively commu-
nicate basic financial and economic concepts. Then we will move on to the time value of money, with applica-
tions to savings plans and pension planning; internal rates of return, which help you understand mortgages and
leases (for cars or housing), and student loans; and pain free budgeting and how you might become a millionaire
(sic!), one step at a time. Finally, we will cover how you can protect yourself from being fooled by randomness
and Ponzi finance.
Evaluation: creation of a financial plan.
Prerequisites: basic high school algebra. Enrollment limit: 12. Preference to upper classmen.
Cost to student: you will need to purchase Benninga's Finance with Excel, and Nassim Taleb's Fooled by Ran-
domness.
Meeting time: afternoons. Outside of class, students willbe reading, working with Excel and doing practice exer-
cises.

ECON 13 Green Taxes
The environment of the world is declining. Problems abound including global warming, natural resource deple-
tion and profligate use of land, among others. Also, although countless billions have been spent over the last
century to eliminate poverty, poverty is still endemic. The gap between the rich and the poor continues to grow.
Winter Study Program
­ 352 ­
This course will study the intimate and vital relationship between these problems and taxation. We will come to
understand that with the right mix of taxes, Green Taxes, we can reduce global warming, encourage the saving of
natural resources and land.
Many writers today have written about the use of Green Taxes to ameliorate these problems. We will read and
study the works of these writers. There will also be guest speakers who have real-world experience with these
problems and the proposed solutions.
Evaluation will be based on attendance and the completion of a ten page paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20.
Cost to student: $10 for books.
Meeting times: TWR, 10-noon.

ECON 14 Accounting
The project will examine the theoretical and practical aspects of financial accounting. Although the beginning of
the course will explore the mechanics of the information gathering and dissemination process, the course will be
oriented mainly towards users, rather than preparers, of accounting information. The project will include discus-
sion of the principles involved in accounting for current assets, plant assets, leases, intangible assets, current lia-
bilities, stockholders' equity, the income statement and the statement of cash flows. Students will be expected to
interpret and analyze actual financial statements. The nature of, and career opportunities in, the field of account-
ing will also be discussed. The project is a"mini course." The number of topics discussed will be close to that of a
full semester introductory accounting course. The project will, thus, require a considerable commitment of time
by the student including regular attendance. Each student is expected to spend a reasonable amount of time, out-
side of class, reading web-text material, completing homework cases and problems, preparing for several quizzes
and working, as part of a group, to complete a written report presenting an analysis of a company's annual report.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 30.
Cost to student: none.
Meeting time: Other than the first day of class, the class will meet from 10 a.m. until noon. The class is currently
scheduled to meet on the following dates: January 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 14, 15, 17, 21, 22, and 24.

ECON 15 Stock Market
Elementary description and analysis of the stock market. Emphasis will be on the roles of the market in our econ-
omy, including evaluation of business firms and the success of particular capital investments, allocating savings
to different types of investment, and providing liquid and marketable financial investments for individual savers.
The course will focus on the description of mechanics of trading on various exchanges and other markets, stock
market indexes or "averages" (Dow-Jones, S&P, 500, etc.), how to read the financial news, historical rates of re-
turn on stocks and portfolios, role of mutual funds, beta coefficients, and "random walk" theory. The course will
also involve a brief introduction to financial reports of firms and analysis of financial ratios.
Each student will participate in discussions, and spend a reasonable amount of time, outside of class, completing
several written homework assignments preparing for several quizzes and, as part of a team, preparing for two
class presentations and writing a 10-page report analyzing the wisdom or folly of having chosen a particular in-
vestment portfolio. The project grade will be determined on the basis of performance on several quizzes and the
written investment portfolio report.
No prerequisites. Not intended for students who already know much about the stock market. Enrollment limit:
30.
Cost to student: none.
Meeting time: Other than the first day of class, the class will meet from 12:50 p.m. until 2:50 p.m. The class is
currently scheduled to meet on the following dates: January 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 14, 15, 17, 21, 22, and 24.

ECON 17 Business Economics
The goal of this course is to explain how the economy works and how it interacts with financial markets. To ac-
complish this, the class will carry out a real-time forecast of the U.S. economy and explore its implications for the
bond and stock markets. The course will build upon principles of both macro and microeconomics. It will pro-
vide an introduction to the work done by business economists and the techniques they use. An economic data-
base, chart-generating software and a statistical analysis program will be available to each student on the Jessup
computers.
The first week will focus on becoming familiar with the database, looking for relationships between key eco-
nomic variables, and studying movements in interest rates over the period 1960-2005. Early in the first week, the
Winter Study Program
­ 353 ­
class will be divided into teams of 2 or 3 students with each team choosing a particular aspect of the economy to
forecast.
During the second and third weeks, the class will prepare forecasts of the key components of gross domestic
product and will study other key issues. In the past students have chosen to focus on such areas as: Globalization,
the Outlook for Oil Prices, the impact of China, and the consumer savings rate. We will also have several invited
guests from the Wall Street investment world speaking on various aspects of the stock market. The fourth week
will feature a formal presentation of the economic forecast with invited guests from the Williams College faculty
among others.
The class will meet 3-4 times per week in the morning. During the first week there will be two afternoons of
workshops lasting approximately 30 minutes with hands on instruction for each team.
Each student should expect to spend a reasonable amount of time on homework, to participate in short presenta-
tions of their analyses as the work progresses as well as in the formal presentation during the last week. There
will also be a 3-page paper summarizing the result of the forecast project or the special topic chosen by each
team.
To put the forecasting exercise in context, there will be class discussions of business cycles, credit cycles, long
waves in inflation and interest rates and past stock-market bubbles.
Prerequisites: Economics 110 or another semester course in Economics is strongly recommended. Enrollment
limit: 15.
Cost to student: about $25 for text and other materials.
Meeting time: mornings with afternoon labs. Because essential concepts and tools are covered during the first
week, all students are expected to attend the first class.

ECON 18 Introduction to Indian Cinema
Though the Indian film industry is the world's most prolific, American audiences have little exposure to it. This
course provides an introduction, focusing on Hindi cinema, and showing how its themes have evolved in re-
sponse to changes in Indian society. In particular, we will examine ways in which Hindi films reflect the threats
perceived by the nation, and the resolutions attempted. We will also compare Hindi cinema's norms and conven-
tions to those used by Hollywood.
We will meet twice a week to watch the films (a total of seven) and twice a week for discussion. Students will
write a 2-page response to each film. Reading will consist of articles from film journals like Screen and Jump
Cut.
Enrollment limit: 10.
Cost to students: $25 for readings.
Meeting time: afternoons.

ECON 20 Introduction to the Economics, Geography and Appreciation of Wine
This course provides an introduction to the economics, geography and appreciation of wine. We will be studying
the economics and geography of wine production, and will also learn to identify, understand and appreciate the
major wine types of the world. The course will involve lectures, outside readings, and in-class wine tastings. We
will focus primarily on the Old World wine styles and regions in France, Germany, Italy, Austria, Hungary, Spain
and Portugal, but will occasionally make comparisons to analogous New World style wines. The primary text for
the course is The World Atlas of Wine, by Hugh Johnson and Jancis Robinson.
Evaluations will be based on short quizzes, including blind tastings, and either an oral presentation or 10-page
paper at the conclusion of the course. For this final project, students will select a wine type that was not covered
during the course, and present historical, geographic and economic background on the wine.
Enrollment limit: 10. Since the course will include wine tastings, it will also be restricted to those who are of legal
age for wine consumption by the date of the first class meeting. In the event that demand exceeds the maximum
limit for the course, students will be selected on the basis of their academic record and on the basis of forming a
diverse and heterogeneous group of interested students.
Cost to student: $175 for the cost of wine purchases for the course.
Meeting time: Tuesday and Thursday evenings from 7-10 p.m.

ECON 25 Gender, Video, and Social Activism in Senegal (Same as Women's and Gender Studies
25)
This course builds on the foundation of the Winter Study Course run in January 2006, as well as this January's
group WSP99 collaborative video project in Uganda. This year we propose to introduce (a new group of) stu-
dents to the work of non-governmental and grassroots health and social organizations in Senegal, in French West
Africa. We also plan to go further, by engaging with some of those organizations in an extended conversation
about the importance of gender structures in our respective cultures, and how they shape vulnerability to HIV,
and producing collaborative videos to engage with those issues. In Senegal as elsewhere, local and national
groups have sprung up in response to concerns about poverty, unemployment, disease, and other pressing issues.
Particularly inspiring are a number of AIDS education and awareness groups that women have started up to halt
the spread of the disease in their communities and to offer support to those living with it. Students in this course
will get to meet and learn from social and health education activists, such as the DEGGO organization in Mbour,
a fishing port south of Dakar; Xel ak Xalaat, based in Rufisque, nearer the capital; and AWA, in Dakar.
In addition to gaining an understanding of the breadth, purpose and genesis of social activism in Senegal, stu-
dents will learn of the mixed effect of Western commerce and tourism on the country. Non-governmental groups
Winter Study Program
­ 354 ­
(NGOs), both those run by Senegalese and those directed by foreigners, grapple with the legacy of French colo-
nial structures and the present-day reality of market capitalism in an impoverished country. These circumstances
create a politically complex backdrop against which NGOs struggle to achieve their goals. As such, part of the
work of our Williams group will be to understand the challenges and practical impediments these NGOs face
against a background of pervasive North-South power dynamics and inequality.
Articulated with that analysis will be an analysis of Senegalese gender systems, and their interaction with the
political economy and with HIV. Gender has been widely recognized as a crucial component in the African
AIDS pandemic; but it is vital to go beyond generalizations about patriarchal African culture to an understanding
of the contestation over gender within a specific locale. Senegal is a particularly rich case study as a Muslim
country where women play a central role in anti-poverty and AIDS activism.
The winter study will start with 4 days in Williamstown, reading, training in video editing, and preparing back-
ground for the experience. After a day of traveling, we will spend 4 days in Dakar being hosted by ACI (Africa
Consultants International, a local NGO), who will provide the students with cultural introductions, basic Wolof
classes, and background lectures on the landscape of HIV and grassroots activism in Senegal. They will also
organize homestays with Senegalese families. Professor Lewis will then conduct an intensive 3-day gender train-
ing for a class comprised of our group and a group of Senegalese NGO workers, both male and female. Finally
we will break into two groups to spend 5 days working on collaborative video projects to be made by our stu-
dents working with Senegalese collaborators. We will end the trip with a day of debriefing before returning to the
US.
Course requirements: Students will submit a paper discussing the role of gender structures in HIV prevention in
Senegal, and are encouraged to keep a journal of their reflections whilst in Senegal.
Course prerequisites: The course is open to sophomores, juniors and seniors. Basic, conversational French
strongly recommended and preference will go to students with some French. Those students who have no
French at all are encouraged to enroll in a French language course in fall 2007 if at all possible. Video editing
skills will also be recommended.
Enrollment limit: 12. Not open to first-year students.
Cost to students: approximately $3,188.

ECON 51 Tax Policy in Emerging Markets
Developing and transition economies provide a number of challenges to the implementation of good tax policy.
Good tax policy strives to raise adequate revenues for public expenditures via a tax system that promotes effi-
ciency (or, at least, minimizes distortions) and distributes the tax burden fairly within the economy. Moreover,
good tax policy needs to be concerned with the administrative feasibility of the tax system. Even under ideal
conditions, these goals are difficult to achieve. Administrative issues, including measuring the tax base and tax
evasion, are especially challenging in the emerging markets context. Since tax revenues are often one-quarter of
the economic activity in these countries, implementing good tax policy is critical for raising their standards of
living and promoting economic growth. We will explore three topics in this course. First, we will examine the
choice between various tax bases--consumption, income, and wealth--in the emerging market context; this
analysis will include the possibility of choosing a mixture of these taxes. Second, case studies of specific tax
reforms in developing countries will illustrate the practical problems of applying general rules to specific situa-
tions. Third, since international capital flows play a role in economic development, we will study the taxation of
these flows from the perspective of both the source and destination countries; this analysis will include the tax
treatment of multinational corporations.
Students will be evaluated based on a 10-page research paper, some shorter written assignments, and an oral
presentation.
Prerequisites: one public economics or tax policy course (Economics 503, 205 or 351), and one empirical meth-

ECON 52 The Political Economy of Economic Strategy
Achieving economic growth and development requires more than just good policies-success depends on a coun-
try's economic strategy working effectively in an integrated manner. The demands of competent policy-making
require balancing competing interests, and policy frameworks need to address difficult trade-offs and enlist the
political support of key stakeholders.
This course will explore the political dimension underlying economic policies-with a focus on how policies fit
together into broader strategies. The course will tackle three challenging areas for economic policy-climate
change, industrial strategy and social protection. The course will first address each topic individually, from both
an economic and political perspective. Then the course will explore the strategic linkages that potentially inte-
grate the policy choices-and examine how a more comprehensive framework can better enlist political support
and improve the chances of policy success.
This course will reinforce skills for evaluating policy frameworks, exploring the coherence and interdependence
of the economic strategy and its likelihood to achieve public objectives.
Evaluation will be based on class participation, policy papers and a final presentation.
No prerequisites. This course is intended for CDE students and is open to undergraduates only with permission
of instructor.
Cost to student: none.

ENGLISH
ENGL 10 Fictions of Domesticity (Same as French 10)
We visit an author's home in search of a connection to the origin of their writing: here's the site from which a
novel or poem sprang. Museums dedicated to authors' homes feed this fantasy, that in looking at Melville's desk
(complete with glasses) or at the room where Dickinson dwelt we are even closer to them than in their words.
However, as we will explore in the course, far from an unmediated visit to the source of genius, museums of
author's homes construct narratives of their own about authorship, art, even about the value of daily life. More-
over, the writers themselves shaped conceptions of domestic space in ways that do not always correspond to the
tales told by the museums made of their homes. We will visit the homes of, and read works by, Herman Melville,
Emily Dickinson, Mark Twain, and Harriet Beecher Stowe.
Students will produce a final project that engages in the critical issues of the course. This project may be a ten-
page page paper focused on the readings, on analysis of the museum spaces themselves, or may even use visual
media to comment upon the constructions of domestic space and authorship.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 10.
Cost to student: $60 (for transportation and museum admission).

ENGL 12 Looking at Contemporary Documentary Photography (Same as ArtH 12 and Special 27)
This course explores the evolution of modern documentary photography. We will start with Robert Frank's The
Americans, and how Frank's singular vision deeply shaped the next generation of photographers working the
American streets and landscape. Diane Arbus, Bruce Davidson, Lee Freidlander, William Klein, Danny Lyon,
Gary Winogrand are some of the photographers whose work we will get to know well . Discussions will include
the new wave of independent and Magnum photojournalists (Phillip Jones Griffiths, Josef Koudleka, Susan
Meiselas, Gilles Peress, James Nachtwey, Alex Webb, Ron Haviv and Tyler Hicks) and the wars from Vietnam
to Bosnia to Iraq they cover as well as the personal visions they explore. Insight into the diverse currents of
documentary photography will be covered through the work of Bill Burke, Larry Clark, Larry Fink, Nan Goldin,
Emmet Gowin, Sally Mann, Mary Ellen Mark, Nicholas Nixon , Richard Misrach, Joel Sternfeld, Birney Imes,
Regan Louie, Edward Burtynsky, Laura Letinsky and Simon Norfolk.
The class will meet three mornings a week for two hours. Slide presentations will occupy half of the first meet-
ings and give way to discussion of issues in documentary photography. Students will be encouraged to work on
individual projects of their own choice. Each student will be required to make a brief presentation to the class on
a documentary topic of their choice. A final paper expanding on this documentary topic will be due at the end of
the course. Students will be evaluated on their classroom presentation, general participation and their written
work. A field trip to New York will let us see first hand works from the collections at the Museum of Modern

ENGL 13 Writing Non-Fiction
This is a course for students interested in writing a long, non-fiction essay. We shall begin by reading together the
work of some contemporary practitioners such as David Foster Wallace, Adam Gopnik and Janet Malcolm and
by considering the distinctive styles of several general-interest magazines including Harper's, Rolling Stone and
The New Yorker. Throughout the course, students will work independently on their essays, which should run
between 2,500 and 3,000 words and reflect extensive research or reporting. Students will be expected to have
selected a topic before the first class meeting.
Requirements: completion of a long, researched, non-fiction essay.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 14. Priority to English majors.
Cost to student: $25-$50.
Meeting time: afternoons, three times a week for two hours.

ENGL 14 Jazz and Poetry Workshop (Same as Music 19)
Jazz and Poetry have shared a mind in the arts since at least Langston Hughes spoke the language of the Harlem
Renaissance, embracing the grandeur of Ellington and Lunceford and the irony of the blues on the street. Since
then many poets and musicians with many voices, cultural backgrounds and original ideas have brought together
the elements of written and improvised words with written and improvised music.
In this course we will explore diverse examples of this multidisciplinary art form. We will read, listen to, and
discuss work by Jack Kerouac, Robert Creeley, Allen Ginsberg, Langston Hughes, Amiri Baraka, Jayne Cortez,
Charles Mingus, Kenneth Patchen and current artists. The course will run as a discussion/workshop: students
will learn, analyze and perform several classic pieces from several different eras, as well as have the opportunity
to develop their own pieces.
Students should expect to meet most afternoons, either as a class or working in groups on assignments. All stu-
dents are expected to participate in workshops, as musicians (improvisational experience is welcome but not
necessary), poets, or performers of poetry. Evaluation based on analysis assignments, ensemble participation,
and final performance.
No prerequisites, but preference to musicians and poets. Enrollment limit: 12.
Cost to students: under $50.

ENGL 15 The Writing of Orhan Pamuk
Orhan Pamuk, winner of the 2006 Nobel Prize for Literature, is a Turkish novelist whose writing makes allu-
sions to Eastern and Western culture at once. Often his novels read like postmodern mystery stories or postmod-
ern thrillers--violent reality turns into text and text into violent reality--but the thrill and the mystery have finally
to do with the confrontation or communion of Europe and Asia. We'll read (in translation) his non-fiction essay
on his native city, Istanbul, and three of the following novels: The White Castle, The Black Book, Snow, The New
Life, My Name is Red. We shall also read around in interviews, reviews, and literary background.
Requirements: 10-page final paper. Active participation in class discussions.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15.
Cost to student: $50.
Meeting time: mornings.

ENGL 16 Reading Fiction for Pleasure
In practice, different readers find different pleasures in reading fiction. We will examine these by considering a
range of short stories and a few essays, often contradictory and judgmental, on how we should read. Along the
way, we will try to become better readers in the belief that careful readers regularly encounter unexpected, even
surprising, sources of enjoyment. Zadie Smith puts it this way: "Reading, done properly, is every bit as tough as
writing." The accurate analogy is that of the amateur musician placing her sheet music on the stand and preparing
to play. She must use her own, hard-won, skills to play this piece of music. The greater the skill, the greater the
gift she gives the composer and the composer gives her." Our texts will be tales by Chekhov, Tolstoy, R. L.
Winter Study Program

Stevenson, Joyce, Borges, Faulkner, A. A. Milne, W. Cather, Thomas Mann, Salinger, Nabokov, A. S. Byatt, T.
C. Bambara, and J. Lahiri, among others. Several of these authors write also on the aims of fiction; and we will
consider Robert Alter on biblical translation, the editing practices of the Grimm brothers, and Freudian dream
analysis as forms of deconstructed story telling. Forceful expressions of concurrence, disagreement, even out-
rage, will be encouraged from class members.
Evaluation will be on the basis of class participation, and a tutorial presentation of an annotated commentary.

ENGL 17 Intellectual Property and Its Discontents
Familiar ideas about intellectual property are proving inadequate to make sense of our current moment, which
might be described as a battleground between increasingly powerful forms of reproduction, and ever more ex-
pansive notions of what materials can be protected through copyright, patenting, trademark, and so on. We will
consider what's at stake in this battle by considering recent fights over such issues as academic plagiarism; liter-
ary and artistic sampling; posthumous performance rights; the erosion of the cultural commons; the rise of genet-
ically engineered life forms; and the claims of some indigenous peoples to proprietary rights over tribal knowl-
edge of various kinds.
Can ideas or concepts be owned? How does the extension of rights to fictive legal bodies ("corporations") affect
the lives of persons in real bodies? What is the relation between a particular bit of intellectual property (computer
code, seed corn, term paper) and the enabling matrix from which it emerged? For answers to these questions,
we'll look to philosophy, anthropology, literary theory, and aesthetics, as well as to current legal practice.
Requirements for the course include attendance and participation (in class and on the field trips); two short writ-
ing exercises; and a final case study on a subject of the student's choice, analyzing a current controversy over
intellectual property.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15. Preference given to juniors and seniors.
Cost to students: approximately $75 for books and other course materials.
Meeting time: In addition to regular class meetings (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday mornings), there may be one or
two Wednesday field trips to local museums.
ROSENHEIM
ENGL 18 Literary Collaboration: Word and Image and the Narrative Between (Same as ArtS 18)
Words can be used to tell a story one way; images possess a different type of narrative potential. Together, they
present abroader range of possibilities than either one alone. The combination of word and image is often associ-
ated with children's books, comics, and graphic novels--contexts in which words and pictures work in tandem
to tell a single story, the images often subordinate to the written narrative. This course will push this dynamic,
exploring the possibilities of merging words and pictures in a literary context by giving equal weight to both or
by seeing what happens when the authority of words is subverted by image.
Creative work will be conducted with an emphasis on collaboration. The space between two minds and two
aesthetics yields a tension that can contribute to the humor, depth, and resonance of a work. The class of ten will
be broken into five writer/visual artist pairings; each pair will complete (and physically produce) an illustrated
book. The course will culminate in a group reading/presentation of finished works open to the Williamstown
community.
Following a few introductory readings, exercises, and discussions, the course will be workshop-based, with time
devoted to pair and group interaction as well as to weekly tutorial-style discussion with the instructors.
The class will also focus on the technical details of bookmaking: planning, pacing, layout, and production. Fa-
miliarity with the Adobe Creative Suite will be helpful but not required.
Enrollment limit: 10. Interested students must submit writing or visual art/illustration samples (5 pages of writing
or 5 jpegs) to matthew@idiotsbooks.com by October 1, 2007. Feel free to email with questions before submit-
ting and/or registering. Five writers and five visual artists will be selected on the basis of quality, style, and imagi-
nation of work.
Cost to student: $50 for materials.
Meeting time: afternoons for a total of six hours per week in class and one hour per week in tutorial session with
instructors; substantial work will be required outside of class, both on creative development and physical produc-
tion of books; students will be required to participate in the public reading/presentation.

inquiry and theatrical explorations, to consider the range of interpretative possibilities in both theory and stage
practice. Though this is not a production course, and students are not necessarily expected to have acting experi-
ence, students will be required to take part enthusiastically in some workshop presentations of speeches and
scenes to illuminate Shakespeare's dramatic art.

(See under PHIL 12 for full description.)
ENGL 23 Victorian Monsters
Victorian fiction conjured many of the monsters that still haunt our cultural imagination:Frankenstein,Jekyll and
Hyde, and Dracula. This course will focus on the original novels and stories from which these mythic figures
emerged: Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, Robert Louis Stevenson's "The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr.
Hyde," and Bram Stoker's Dracula considering their engagement with the dominant cultural anxieties of their
day and the grounds of their enduring appeal. We will also discuss afew of the myriad film permutations of these
stories, and students will do independent projects that focus on the evolution of one of these figures in popular
culture.
Requirements: one presentation and a final project.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15.
Cost to students: approximately $50 for books.
Meeting time: mornings.
CASE
ENGL 25 Morocco (Same as Philosophy 25)
Students in this course will spend winter study in Morocco. Morocco presents a compelling blend of historical
influences and modern world currents. Threads of Islam, Arab traditions, and the heritage of the native Berber
people are woven into a distinctive cultural tapestry, while traces of French colonialism can still be seen in the
political and social structure. Morocco is at the intersection of the West, the Middle East, and Africa. Travel there
is therefore a powerful way to introduce intellectual themes that require and reward a subtle blending of insight
from history, political science, religion, and philosophy.
We will take the first steps in engaging some of these challenging topics in order to enable independent study
facilitated by serious and multifaceted exposure to the country. For the first two weeks, students will study at the
Center for Cross Cultural Learning (CCCL) in Rabat, taking Arabic lessons (classical or Moroccan dialect) each
morning and then gathering for lectures by local university faculty in the afternoon. During this span students
will live with Moroccan families in the Rabat medina. In the third week of the course students will travel in the
interior of Morocco, exploring Fez and Marrakech, riding camels in the desert, and hiking to Berber villages in
the Atlas Mountains.
Students will be expected to attend all seminars, lead a group presentation, and complete a substantial research
paper (10-15 pages). The presentation and research paper will be occasions to explore a special topic in depth
including, for instance, justice and gender, art, literature, colonial studies, or Islam.
No prerequisites. Arabic is the official spoken language of Morocco, and French is spoken very widely. While
desirable, neither is required. Enrollment limited to 15. Preference: Student interest is more important than class
year or academic major. Final participants will be chosen on the basis of interviews regarding student goals and
intellectual interests. Not open to first-year students.
Cost to students: approximately $3500.

ing, and offset printing. Historical examples of printmaking on clay will be introduced and explored through
lectures, examples and assignments. Students will receive feedback on their work through supervised group cri-
tiques and open studio sessions. They will be evaluated based on completion of assignments with attention to
content, detail, and development of their work. Attendance and participation are required along with an exhibi-
tion of final work on the last day of Winter Study.

ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
ENVI 10 The Winter Naturalist's Journal
This course will explore the tools for studying the natural world through various uses of writing, literature, and
drawing. Students will spend time outdoors learning the ecosystem of the Williamstown area and time indoors
doing observational drawing, reflective writing, and reading and discussions of nature literature. The writing
component of the journal will be the equivalent of a 10-page paper. The drawing part will consist of ongoing en-
tries contained in a nature journal, to be displayed and discussed as part of the final project. Designed for students
with interests in environmental studies, natural history writing, and drawing.

ENVI 15 Sustainable Building Design (Same as ArtS 15)
Today, buildings account for nearly half of the energy consumed by developed countries. Awareness, under-
standing, and demand for sustainable design is critical for the mitigation of this untenable situation. This course
will review the recent green building movement, examine passive and active design strategies, and consider de-
sign guides and rating tools. The course will include case studies of existing and planned local green buildings
(e.g., Williamstown's "Zero Carbon House" and the Cable Mills project) and an ongoing class project to develop
a master green plan for Williams College. The class will also take a field trip to Cambridge, Massachusetts, to
tour the Genzyme Building and other significant green buildings in the area.
Evaluation will be based on attendance, class participation, and a 10-page paper based on a case study.

ENVI 25 Sustainable Resource Management on Eleuthera Island
The main focus of the course is environmental sustainability. While living and studying at an environmental
research facility, the Cape Eleuthera Institute, students will learn sustainable methods of resource management
using the Bahamas as a classroom. We will consider how the island can become self-sustaining while protecting
its fragile natural resource base. This will include learning methods of: permaculture and traditional farming,
food cultivation in infertile soil and arid climates, rainwater catchment, green building and environmental land-
scape design, renewable energy production, protection of depleted fisheries and damaged coral reefs, and pres-
ervation of open space and natural resources, such as drinking water. The overarching educational goal is to
understand the social, political and economic dynamics that are impoverishing the natural resources and the
people of Eleuthera and to find solutions that will help to create a self-sustaining resource-based island economy
while also developing an environmentally sensitive tourist economy.
Students will divide their time between the classroom, independent project work, field trips (which will include
meeting local farmers, fisherpeople, entrepreneurs, government officials, and representatives of non-governmen-
tal organizations), and working in the garden and orchard and caring for the pigs and chickens and the aquacul-
ture (fish farm) system. Classes and projects will be taught and led by Sarah Gardner in conjunction with the CEI
research staff members, who specialize in these topic areas.
Evaluation: Students will be evaluated on their class work, independent projects, and participation in all activities
on Eleuthera. They will also prepare and present a group presentation to the Williams community scheduled for
February 2008.
Enrollment limit: 10. Not open to first-year students.

GEOSCIENCES
GEOS 10 The Digital Darkroom
The camera is an imperfect tool. Film and digital sensors record only a fraction of the range of tones and colours
the human eye can perceive, and today's monitors and printers can display only a small portion of the informa-
tion present in a well-exposed photograph. Digital processing is about optimizing the basic image for electronic
display or print.
The digital darkroom allows the photographer complete control over his or her images. This course will demysti-
fy its principles and practices by teaching the basics of digital image manipulation and optimization.
Students will learn what makes a digital image, and how the tools they use affect the image data itself. They will
learn about digital file formats and how to use their camera's histogram to ensure that they capture the maximum
amount of information from the scene in their viewfinder. They will also learn how to scan 35 mm slides and
Winter Study Program

negatives for digital post-processing.
Using Photoshop, students will learn how to bring out the best in their images. This can range from simple tone
and colour adjustments to complex layering and masking to bring out hidden detail or to maximize the aesthetic
nature of the print. They will learn how to remove dust and blemishes from their images. The basics of digital
printing and colour management will also be taught.
The students will produce a series of image pairs-processed images and their raw photo counterparts-which will
be mounted on a class web page. Each student will keep a journal recording the processes they applied and the
results achieved.
Evaluation will be based on attendance, participation and journal quality and completeness.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15.
Cost to students: $30 for books. A digital camera (with RAW capture mode) is suggested, but students may use a
35-mm film camera, and bring prints or negatives for digital processing, if they do not have a digital camera.

GEOS 12 Landscape Photography (Same as Environmental Studies 12)
This class will broaden students' appreciation for the appearance and history of the landscape and teach the skills
of making a successful photograph.
Williamstown, situated in a valley between the Green and Taconic Mountains and bisected by the Green and
Hoosic Rivers, is a place of great natural beauty. The local landscape is a subject that inspires both professional
and amateur photographers alike. While Williamstown will be the subject of most of our work, we will use it to
learn principles of universal application. Students will discover the importance of light in making a photograph.
They will also learn camera skills and the mechanics of photography to make slides, which will be reviewed at
biweekly class meetings.
In addition to photographing and critiquing slides, the class will visit collections at the Clark Art Institute and
WCMA to see original work and examine and discuss books on reserve at Sawyer Library. An overview of the
history of landscape photography will be provided with an emphasis on American workers such as Carlton Wat-
kins, William Henry Jackson, Edward Weston, Ansel Adams, and Alvin Langdon Cobern. We will also demon-
strate examples of different cameras such as medium format, view cameras, and panorama cameras.
Students will produce a body of successful photographs/slides, which will be presented in a class web page.
Evaluation will be based on attendance, the student's photography and their presentation.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15. Priority given to first and second-year students.
Students will need a 35mm camera.
Cost to student: approximately $60 for film and materials.

GERM 20 Nietzsche and Marx
Though radically opposed in their basic world views, Karl Marx (1818-83) and Friedrich Nietzsche (1844-1900)
exhibited striking similarities in their critiques of modern bourgeois society as it was emerging in the nineteenth
century. Their analyses of the religious, economic, political, sexual and linguistic predilections of the rising
middle-class continue to exert enormous influence, even as the middle class reigns triumphant. We will compare
and contrast their ideas in the context of German society from the final defeat of Napoleon (1815) to the start of
the First World War (1914). We will also consider whether their relevance today extends beyond the academic
sphere. Among works to be read: by Marx, Early Writings, The Communist Manifesto, Capital (selections), and

This course follows up on GERM 202 (S) Berlin: Multicultural Metropolis, but is open to German-speaking
students who have completed German 104. Students will spend two weeks in Berlin, researching individual pro-
jects guided by the instructor.
In week one, we will walk around the city's historic neighborhoods and visit several Berlin-specific museums,
such as, the Jewish Museum, the Film Museum, the Berlin Mitte (district history) Museum, the synagoge at
Oranienburger Str., the "Story of Berlin" exhibit, and explore the portrayal of turn-of-the-century working class
life in the works of Heinrich Zille and Käthe Kollwitz. We will also travel through the city from West to East on
the famous bus line 100, and visit the Turkish-German district in Kreuzberg. We will study Berlin dialect on
location in several scenic, not as heavily touristed locations in the former East, and trace the remnants of the
Berlin Wall.
In week two, we will choose individual aspects of city history or present-day culture. We will explore Berlin-spe-
cific tenement architecture and Hinterhöfe, investigate Jewish life in Berlin before the Nazis and in the present,
Berlin as the city of film making in the twenties, Berlin in the Third Reich, Cold War Berlin, The Berlin Wall, and
post-unification Berlin.
Students will write a journal of their daily findings and experiences.
On our return to campus, students will present their research project to other German students in the WSP sus-
taining program.

HISTORY
HIST 10 "The Fatherland in Cleats": Soccer and Identities in the Americas
This course will examine the historical and cultural meanings of futebol/fútbol/soccer in inter-American con-
texts. Across the Americas people have used this sport to define themselves, their regions, and even their national
civilizations. Looking at both the darker tendencies (especially violence) and the aesthetically pleasing products
(such as Brazilian "football-art" or "the beautiful game") of soccer, we will discuss the boundaries involved in
such definitions-between Latin American countries and the United States, between men and women, between
macho and non-macho men, between racial and ethnic groups. Among the questions we will address are: Why
do nations develop allegedly distinct styles of play? Why has futebol achieved wide popular while soccer lan-
guishes in relative obscurity? Will the rise of women's teams challenge futebol machismo?
Evaluation will be based on class participation, a presentation, and a 10-page paper.
No prerequisites, but preference will be given to history majors and students with strong backgrounds in soccer.
Enrollment limit: 20.
Cost to student: about $50 for books and course packet.

HIST 11 Samurai in Literature and History
The samurai of myth has captured imaginations for centuries as a paragon of loyalty, honor, courage, self-sacri-
fice, and martial skill. In this course, we will explore how various images of the samurai have been constructed
and how these popular conceptions relate to the history of the warrior in Japan. Most of our attention will be
focused on the period from the late 1100s through the 1800s. We will consider questions of how literature can be
used as historical sources, and how historical contexts shape the production of literature. Readings will include
war tales, samurai manuals, and plays as well as essays on the history of the samurai. Film clips will also be
shown to illustrate how the samurai myth has been reconstructed in the recent past. Specific topics will include
the culture and conduct of war, religion and the samurai, ideas of loyalty and treachery, and samurai legacies for
the modern period.
Evaluation will be based on class participation and short response papers.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20.
Cost to student: $30 for books and photocopies.

HIST 12 Narrating Africa, Narrating History
This course will examine issues of narration, representation, and content in recent gripping narrative histories of
Africa published largely by trade presses and geared for a "larger" audience. These books, some of them sensa-
tionalized histories of colonial atrocities, the slave trade and slavery, peasant lives, etc., raise several questions
about how we do history. How might afocus on narrative distort people's experience? In what ways might such a
Winter Study Program
­ 363 ­
focus compromise historical analysis? How do these narrative histories relate content and form, story and meth-
od? How does everyday experience look when it is collapsed, expanded, and arranged into narratives? In other
words, how does narrative shape its material and our understanding of it? The course will expand our under-
standing of the kinds of histories possible, and the choices we make in representing the past.
Full class participation mandatory; one 10- to 15-page paper.

Cost to student: approximately $60 for books.
Meeting times: 2-3 mornings a week.

HIST 13 The History of Surfing in Literature and Film
In his 1784 Voyage to the Pacific Ocean, Captain James Cook became the first westerner to describe the ancient
Polynesian sport of surfing. Observing a wave-rider in Tahiti, Cook wrote, "I could not help concluding that this
man felt the most supreme pleasure while he was driven on so fast and so smoothly by the sea." Since then, the
sport of surfing has fascinated the modern imagination for its graceful beauty, communion with the sea, laid-back
life-style, and intense athleticism. This winter study explores the history of surfing and its popular image in
American literature and cinema. We will read several classic works of surf literature including Daniel Duane's
Caught Inside, Kem Nunn's Dogs of Winter, and Allan C. Weisbecker's In Search of Captain Zero, and we will
watch some of the most influential surf movies including Gidget, Endless Summer, Dogtown and Z-Boys, and
Riding Giants. The goal of this winter study is to instill students with an appreciation of surfing's colorful history
and culture.
Evaluation will be based on attendance, participation, and a 10-page paper.

HIST 15 Dances with Stereotypes?: American Indians on Film
Cinematic representations of American Indians have seemingly abandoned the negative stereotypes of early
Westerns. In the last thirty years, film makers have increasingly professed their concern for historical accuracy
and cultural sensibility in representing Indian subjects. In this course, we will test these claims by examining old
and new representations of Indians in mainstream American films and by comparing these representations with
those found in foreign films and films directed and produced by American Indians. How and why have images
of Indians in mainstream American films changed? To what extent have they remained the same? To what extent
are foreign and American Indian films proposing alternative ways of representing Indian history and culture? To
answer these questions, we will not only watch a number of movies but also read short essays on American
Indian history, film history, and movie reviews.
Evaluation will be based on class participation and a 10-page paper comparing two or more movies. Films we
will see include: Broken Arrow; Little Big Man; How Tasaty was My Little Frenchman; The Mission; Powwow
Highways; Dances with Wolves; Black Robe; Smoke Signals.

HIST 17 The Fight for Free Speech in America
There is nothing free about free speech. Although the First Amendment to the Constitution guarantees freedom
of speech and freedom of the press, these rights exist only to the extent that people are willing to fight for them.
The war on terrorism and the USA Patriot Act pose the greatest threat to free speech since the Red Scare of the
1950s. But the censors are active in many other areas of American life: they challenge books in the public
schools and seek to restrict the content of radio, television and the Internet. To understand the current debate over
free expression, this course will examine how free speech has grown over the course of the last century: how it
Winter Study Program

became a political issue; the tactics used by civil libertarians to protect offensive political ideas and shocking
artistic speech; and the growth of legal protections for free speech.

LEAD 12 The Roosevelt Century
How did three members of awealthy New York "Knickerbocker" family rise above the narrow, elitist interests of
their social class to become the great political and moral leaders of the twentieth century? In this course we will
focus on the political careers and lives of Theodore Roosevelt, his niece Eleanor, and his fifth-cousin Franklin.
Theodore and Franklin both graduated from Harvard to become lawyers, assistant secretaries of the Navy, gov-
ernors of New York, and American presidents of unusual ability and accomplishments. Eleanor Roosevelt, a
tireless advocate for the rights of working men and women of all races, led in the drafting of the United Nations
Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The three Roosevelts were committed to an inclusive, egalitarian, and
progressive democracy. Through readings, documentary films, guest lectures, and class discussions, we will ex-
plore the intertwining lives and ideas of the Roosevelts.
Requirements: There will be three class meetings a week; students will give several oral reports and write one
15-page research paper.
Enrollment limit: 12.
Cost to students: books.
Meeting time: afternoons.

LEAD 13 Political Engagement and the 2008 Election (Same as Political Science 13)
This course will engage students in the practice and possibilities of political involvement. Designed for both the
student who has yet to explore the political realm as well as politically active students, the goal will be to have
each student develop a `tool box' of skills that can be used to forward their own interests and ideals through
political activism. In the midst of the early primary activity for the 2008 Presidential election, we will use current
events to establish a framework for better understanding how leadership, community involvement and academic
knowledge in political science can be leveraged and applied to the political process and why that should matter to
Williams' students. Each student will engage with a current political cause or candidate. Students will develop
the ability to be objective and critical readers of the media coverage of political campaigns and events, will be
introduced--through guest speakers and readings--to the perspectives of those on the frontlines of the most
significant political movements and campaigns in the U.S., and will master some of the mechanics and practices
of political campaigns and movements.
Method of evaluation: end of course research project: 15-page campaign plan (80%) and class participation
(20%).
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 10. Preference given to Leadership Studies concentrators.

LEGAL STUDIES
LGST 13 United States Environmental Law: Its Historic Roots, Its Uncertain Future (Same as
Environmental Studies 13)
Taught from the perspective of an experienced trial attorney, this course will examine the role environmental law
plays in the United States today in light of how that role has developed during the nearly forty years since the
modern era of environmental law began. As a preface, we will consider the significantly more limited influence
of environmental law in our national affairs before 1970 and some of the historical and political reasons for that
situation, in particular how the law's early application in the first half of the 20th century almost exclusively to
conservation and the preservation of natural resources somehow took on in the second half a markedly different
approach, one emphasizing pollution control and all but ignoring resource conservation.
Winter Study Program
­ 366 ­
This course will begin by tracing the development of an American consciousness towards the environment
through an examination of our law and our literature. The term "law" includes state and federal judicial decisions
and legislation, particularly during the presidency of Theodore Roosevelt and during the decades which followed
the year 1970 when much of the legal basis for the American environmental protection movement was estab-
lished. The term "literature" includes not just the written word (the first book we look at is "The Lorax" by your
favorite childhood author, Dr. Seuss) but also painting, sculpture, and music. Nothing too heavy! We will ex-
amine the historical and legal choices we as Americans have made which have put our environment on trial.
What has occurred in our development as a people that explains this quintessentially American phenomenon?
Our journey begins with the Puritans of New England and the planters of Virginia and their predecessors in the
New World and then moves swiftly to the beginning of the modern era in environmental law and to its now un-
certain future.
In light of this historical situation students will examine state and federal legislative and judicial attempts to ad-
dress environmental problems and then try to reach informed, rational conclusions as to whether those attempts
were successful. What were the political, social and economic issues involved and, ultimately, how did their con-
text affect the legal solution imposed. Cases decided at the appellate level will be introduced and examined
through their trial court memoranda opinions in order to observe how the legal system actually works and how
frequently the reasoning behind the trial judge's decision changes as the case works its way through the appellate
process.
This course will be presented from a litigator's point of view, that is to say, both the practical and the theoretical,
emphasizing what is possible to achieve in the litigator's real world as informed by what the academician would
present from the security of the classroom. Evaluation will be based on attendance and classroom participation.
Students will prepare several short papers, which will present one or more sides of an issue and form the basis for
classroom discussion. They will be asked to defend or reject the conclusions reached or approaches taken by our
courts and legislatures and by our literature, as broadly defined, on environmental issues.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 16. This course is appropriate for students eager to explore the material pre-
sented and prepared to argue assigned positions on important legal, literary and historical issues.
Cost to students: approximately $60 for books and materials.
Meeting time: mornings. 3 two-hour sessions a week.

Europe.
LGST 14 So You Want to be A Lawyer?
The course, a class participation seminar, is an introduction to the legal analysis of judicial decisions, as well as a
brief survey of some of the principal types of law practice. Work outside of class will consist of reading and
analyzing court decisions set forth in the written materials provided to the students. The students will be required
to orally brief each case for presentation and to participate fully in class discussion and analysis of the issues
raised by it.
The form and content of the course will replicate the pattern of first year law school class work. Accordingly,
students will read, summarize, analyze, and evaluate legal opinions in several areas of the law, including torts,
property, contracts, criminal, and constitutional law. The students will consider and discuss the role of judicial
precedents, including instances in which precedents are binding, when they are not binding, and how courts are
able to distinguish precedents rather than disregarding them. They will be introduced to the structure of the state
and federal court systems, the differences between trial level courts and appellate courts, and the ways in which
cases that are initiated in state courts can wind up before a federal court. The students will also learn how courts
deal with statutory law, including the relationship between statutory law and the common law, and the difficult
issues of statutory interpretation with which courts are faced every day. Matters such as judicial philosophy, the
influence of societal practices and expectations, and the "craft" of the law will also be considered.
Evaluation of the student will be based primarily on thoroughness of preparation and class participation and sec-
ondarily on the quality of at least one analytical paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20. Preference given to students completing the Legal studies Program, then,
in order, juniors, seniors, sophomores, freshman.
Cost to student: photocopying 100-300 pages.

LINGUISTICS
LING 10 Linguistic Typology and the Science of Constructed Languages
Saluton! Qapla'! Suilad! Coi! From Esperanto to Klingon, from Quenya to Lojban, linguaphiles have long been
driven to duplicate and manipulate the properties of natural language to construct new languages for use in works
of fiction, for facilitating international communication, or for the pure fun of intellectual stimulation. In this
Winter Study Program
­ 367 ­
course, students will develop their own constructed languages, guided by study of the cross-linguistic typology
of patterns in phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, and language change to help make their
invented languages more realistic--or if appropriate, more realistically unrealistic! Students will also apply their
knowledge of linguistic typology to critically assess the design of existing constructed languages such as Espe-
ranto and Klingon.
Evaluation will be based upon class participation, performance on regular homework assignments, presentation
of selected readings, and the quality and thoroughness of the final project, which will be a formal description and
typological evaluation of the grammar of the student's constructed language.
Prerequisite: Linguistics 100, Linguistics 210, or permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 20. Preference
will be given based on demonstrated interest in the course material and in linguistics generally. Interested stu-
dents should contact the instructor in the fall with a brief expression of intent.
Cost to student: about $15-25 for texts.
Meeting time: afternoons, two 3-hour sessions.

in this preliminary introduction to ASL is on developing rudimentary receptive, expressive, and interactive skills
through an intensive immersion in ASL. Students will also be introduced to deaf history, culture, and politics.
This course is designed to help nonsigners develop rudimentary skills, to introduce them to the complexity of
ASL, and to cultivate interest in further study of the language.
Evaluation will be based on attendance, participation, quizzes, and student produced videotapes of their own ex-
pressive skills. Students will also be expected to spend an hour outside of class each week viewing native ASL
signers.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15 (expected: 15).
Cost to student: $40.

MATHEMATICS and STATISTICS
MATH 10 Pilates: Fitness, Philosophy, and Physiology
Pilates is a series of strengthening and conditioning exercises created by Joseph H. Pilates. Often referred to as
the first physical therapist, Pilates was dissatisfied with existing approaches to exercise at the turn of the last
century. He studied both Eastern methods of exercise such as yoga, which focused on relaxation and breathing,
and Western methods that concentrated on building strength and endurance. He combined different qualities of
both methods in an attempt to create an ideal form of physical training. Pilates exercises focus on the "core
muscles": the abdominals and the back. Even when working the arms or legs, the core muscles initiate the move-
ment.
In this course, we will study the Pilates mat exercises in detail, including performance, physiology, breathing,
muscular emphasis, and modifications. We will also look at recent research studies on Pilates and related exer-
cises, and discuss Pilates' original motivation, goals, and philosophy behind the exercises. Evaluation will be
based on weekly quizzes, participation in class, and a final project that includes a class presentation and paper.
Attendance is critical; students must attend every class.
No prerequisites. Students will be selected based on a questionnaire about interest in the course. This course is
intended for those with little to no previous experience with Pilates, but with some dance or fitness background/
experience.
Cost to student: approximately $100 for books and equipment.
Meeting times: afternoons, 6 hours per week (Pilates class plus lecture/discussion). Enrollment Limit: 10.

MATH 14 Creating Fractals
In this class we will explore three aspects of fractals: their mathematical origins, writing computer programs (in
Matlab) to generate them, and creating high quality, large, print hard copies of them. The particular type of frac-
tals we will be dealing with were first discussed by geometer Felix Klein. Throughout the class, as the mathemat-
ics and the computational techniques are being established, participants will also be developing their personal
artistic ideas (themes, colors, textures, etc.), culminating in the production of an original piece of fractal artwork
by each student.
Evaluation will be based on homework, participation in class, and a final project consisting of the full production
of your own fractal-based artwork.
Prerequisites: Interest in math and some experience with computer programming. Enrollment limit: 18.
Cost to students: approximately $60 for textbook (Indra's Pearls: The Vision of Felix Klein) and materials.
Meeting time: afternoons, 6 hours per week.

MATH 15 Electricity and Magnetism for Mathematicians
Maxwell's equations are four simple formulas, linking electricity and magnetism, that are among the most pro-
found equations ever discovered. These equations led to the prediction of radio waves, to the realization that a
description of light is also contained in these equations and to the discovery of the special theory of relativity. In
fact, almost all current descriptions of the fundamental laws of the universe are deep generalizations of Max-
well's equations. Perhaps even more surprising is that these equations and their generalizations have led to some
of the most important mathematical discoveries (where there is no obvious physics) of the last 25 years. For
example, much of the math world was shocked at how these physics generalizations became one of the main
tools in geometry from the 1980s until today. It seems that the mathematics behind Maxwell is endless. This will
be an introduction to Maxwell's equations, from the perspective of a mathematician.
Evaluation will be based on problem sets and/or a ten page paper.

MATH 16 The Social History and Craft Form (Same as Special 16)
Creating fabric out of interlocking loops can be traced back to the Neolithic period, and knitted artifacts 1600 to
over 2000 years old have been found in Egypt, Peru, and Sweden. Knitting requires little machinery and can be
done almost anywhere yet requires a significant amount of learned skill. Knitting techniques have been handed
down through generations, shared in small groups, and transferred between cultures as trade routes emerged. The
social history of knitting in America is a rich reflection of our history of culture. We will examine the social histo-
ry of knitting through a sequence of readings, lectures, and discussions, and explore knitting technique through a
series of projects. Our textbook is No Idle Hands: The History of American Knitting, by Anne L. MacDonald,
and additional readings will be handed out in class. We will engage a series of project samples designed to
introduce and improve skills of beginning knitters, starting with simple washcloths, a knitted cap, and culminat-
ing in a final project of a felted mittens. Students will also be required to select and research some aspect of knit-
ting and write a 10-page research paper. Topics will need pre-approval of the instructor.
Evaluation will be based on participation, projects and a final 10-page research paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15. Enrollment is restricted to beginning knitters and preference will be given
to first-year students.
Cost to student: approximately $90 for materials kit and $25 for textbooks.

ing, and writing.
Tournament play followed by analysis and the writing up of lessons learned is an essential part of the study of
bridge. At this level, it is much more than a "game": it is an intense intellectual and academic activity. There are
regular duplicate games Monday and Thursday evenings and Wednesday noon in Pittsfield and other tourneys in
the region, including weekends. Reading list: Commonsense Bidding by William Root; How to Play a Bridge
Hand by William Root; How to Defend a Bridge Hand by William Root; Modern Bridge Conventions by Root

MUS 10 Symphonic Winds: Music of Louis Andriessen and Stephen Songheim
Students enrolled in Symphonic Winds will rehearse and prepare music in preparation for two concerts, one
during the last week of winter study, and one in February 2008. Students will participate in a variety of perfor-
mance settings from full ensemble to various chamber ensemble settings (both conducted and unconducted).
Students will be responsible for attending all rehearsals and composer lectures to which they are assigned by the
instructor, and leading occasional sectionals; while specific, detailed schedule will be constructed once the reper-
toire is determined, rehearsals/lectures will most likely be scheduled on Monday-Thursday afternoons and
Sunday evenings. Students should expect to be in rehearsal for approximately 6-10 hours each week. Outside of
class, students are expected to spend approximately 20 hours each week preparing for rehearsals by both practic-
ing individual parts and completing required listening/reading assignments. Evaluation will be based on individ-
ual performance and preparation, and, as necessary, written assignments.
Repertoire will be selected based on enrollment. Repertoire to be studied during Winter Study will include music
of Louis Andriessen (De Materie, La Passione, and Writing to Vermeer), and possibly music by composers in-
cluding John Adams, Cornelis de Bondt, John Corigliano, Michael Gordon, and Judd Greenstein. In addition
and in conjunction with Keith Kibler's winter study musical theater course, the Symphonic Winds will serve as
the pit orchestra for the selected show (tentatively Sondheim's Sweeney Todd).
Symphonic Winds is open to students of all musical abilities, including wind, brass, and percussion players, as
well as vocalists, string players, and pianists. Instructor permission is necessary to enroll in this winter study

MUS 11 The Operas of Giuseppe Verdi
The operas of Giuseppe Verdi have long captivated audiences with their soaring melodies, dramatic intensity,
patriotic sentiments, and spectacular effects. With works such as Nabucco, La traviata, Rigoletto, Aida, and Otel-
lo, Verdi brought the 19th-century Italian operatic tradition established by Rossini, Bellini, and Donizetti to new
aesthetic heights. Through lectures, discussion, and guided listening, this course explores Verdi's contribution to
the field of opera by tracing the development of the Italian bel canto style and emergence of romantic naturalism
in his some of his greatest masterworks.
Evaluation will be based on two tests and class participation. Attendance is mandatory.
No prerequisites. An ability to read music is not required.
If possible, we will take a field trip to see a performance of a Verdi opera.

MUS 14 Brazilian Music
Students will have the opportunity to participate in an ensemble course devoted to studying and playing the mu-
sic of Brazil, focusing on Bossa Novas and Sambas. Class participants will study and learn the music of compos-
ers/singers Antonio Carlos Jobim, Elis Regina, Milton Nascimento, Ivan Lins, Gilberto Gil, Astrud and Joao
Gilberto. The course will explore how the Bossa Nova craze was brought to the U.S. and introduced to the rest of
the world by American jazz musicians in the early 1960s. We will also look into the musical couple Flora Purim
and Airto Moreira and their fame with the renowned jazz pianist Chick Corea. Guest speaker will be well-known
guitarist Romero Lubambo of the popular group Trio De Paz.
The students will experience playing (and singing) this stimulating music in an ensemble setting. The course is
open to all interested vocalists and instrumentalists (percussion, guitar, piano, bass, drums, horns). The class will
be limited to 16 students. Interested students are welcome to contact the instructor before registration by email:

manipulation. Finale's utility as a desktop music-publishing package is matched by its flexibility in preparing
score and parts from solo works to full orchestra and chorus.
This course will be tailored to fill the needs of music majors as well as interested non-major singers and instru-
mentalists. Composition students are strongly advised to take this course. The skills acquired in this course will
make the preparation and understanding of music theory and orchestration assignments in these courses, offered
in the regular academic year, much more effective.
Students will gain in-depth exposure to this program through assigned work, as well as from work on original
compositions and--for non-composers--arrangements of existing repertoire. By the end of the course, students
will have developed an advanced level of use, which will aid them in preparing publishing-quality scores, and
they will have developed a skill set of sophisticated computer/composition tools and techniques, which will
greatly enhance and expand their conceptual processes of composition and arranging.
Both group and individual notation projects will be assigned every class meeting. The level of difficulty will vary
according to the degree of mastery of the software each student brings to this course. Students should expect,
whether beginner or advanced Finale users, to spend a minimum of three hours daily, or 21 hours per week,
outside of class, in the lab, working on and completing assigned projects. Completed assignments will be graded
based on the accuracy and detail of the music inputted and printed.
Prerequisites and student selection criteria: The ability to read music fluently in treble and bass clefs; at least one
year of music theory; familiarity with the Macintosh computer and the OS X operating system. Enrollment limit:
10.
Cost to students: approximately $50 for backup media (CD-R discs and/or a flash drive); a sheaf or book (50
pages) of music manuscript paper and pencils (preferably mechanical, with 0.9 lead).
Meeting times: MWF, 10-noon in the Bernhard Music Center Macintosh computer lab.

MUS 16 Zimbabwean Marimba Music (Same as Africana Studies 16)
Created in the 1960s to provide a means of teaching African music in schools and instill pride without privileging
the music of either of Zimbabwe's main ethnic groups, the Shona and the Ndebele, the Zimbabwean marimba
tradition shows how ethnic relationships can be negotiated and how African nationalism can be represented
through music. Today after 40 years of having marimba music taught in schools, this music is a vital part of
Zimbabwe's music culture. This music is also performed by more than two dozen marimba bands in the United
States.
Students in this intensive course will learn to play marimba music and assess its impact in Zimbabwe and other
countries. The course will be taught by Professor Ernest Brown, Director of the Zambezi Marimba Band, and
Mr. Alport Mhlanga, a composer, teacher, and marimba virtuoso who helped develop the Zimbabwean marimba
and has toured internationally with his own marimba bands. Mr. Mhlanga taught marimba music for many years
in Zimbabwe at Kwanongoma College, composed many well-known songs, and currently teaches marimba at
Maru a Pula School in Botswana.
Evaluation: one 5-page paper, topic to be arranged. Regular participation in lessons and rehearsals and progress
as a marimba musician.
Required activities: This is an intensive course which meets Mondays-Fridays 2-4 p.m. Students are required to
practice individually an hour a day and to come to group lessons prepared to play the material taught in the last
lesson. This course will culminate in a performance at 7 p.m. on January 23, 2008. Additional musical, technical,
or dress rehearsals may be required (after 4 p.m.) during the week before the performance, the weekend before
the performance, or the week of the performance. Normally, students may not miss group lessons, pre-perfor-
mance rehearsals, or the final performance and pass this course. Medical emergencies must be documented. Stu-
dents who are not present for the first class will be dropped from the class and may not be allowed to re-enroll.
Readings, listening, and video viewings will be assigned.
No prerequisites. Students should email Professor Brown, indicating in one paragraph, the level of their musical
skills, their interest in the course, and their class year.
Student selection criteria: musical ability, but enthusiastic beginners are welcome to apply and will be admitted if
possible. Enrollment limit: 7.
Cost to students: approximately $50 for reading packet and recordings.
Meeting time: see above.

MUS 18 Cuban "Classical" Composers and Their Music
This course covers some of the relevant "classical" composers of Cuban Music history. We will study the com-
poser's life and work through the analysis of some of their relevant compositions. Class discussion will include
the relationship of these works with elements borrowed from Cuban popular music and how the composer incor-
porates these elements into his/her own artistic expression. We will also discuss the influence of the European
and Afro-Cuban traditions on this repertoire.
Evaluation will be based on class attendance and participation; and a 10 page paper and presentation of this paper
during the final week of Winter Study. The performance of one of the works studied in class is not required but it
is encouraged and can be taken into consideration as part of the final presentation. Possibilities for performance
include short piano pieces by Manuel Saumel, Ignacio Cervantes, or Lecuona, guitar pieces by Leo Brouwer,
and a percussion ensemble piece by Amadeo Toldan.

PHILOSOPHY
PHIL 10 Formal Logic
This course will introduce students to sentential and predicate logic. Its major goal is to give them the ability to
understand the kinds of formalization used in ordinary works of philosophy, i.e., texts that are not intended pri-
marily for specialists in logic. Depending upon the interests and rates of progression of the students, there may be
some consideration of more advanced topics, such as modal and tense logic.
Requirements: there will be readings for each class meeting, and usually problem sets.
Method of evaluation: problem sets, some to be completed in class.
Prerequisites: students who have taken courses in logic should not take this course without consulting with the
instructor. Math majors are unlikely to be challenged, but are welcome, particularly if they are willing to try to
help those in the class with less formal sophistication (including the instructor, who is far from an expert and
anticipates honing his relatively modest skills by "teaching" this course). Enrollment limit: 15. Preference to ac-
tual and possible philosophy majors; non-majors who are considering declaring or adding the major in philoso-
phy should so inform the instructor by email.
Cost to student: maximum of $50 (but probably less); for photocopies and/or books.
Meeting times: MTWR, 10:30-noon.

PHIL 11 Aikido and Ethics
Aikido is a Japanese martial tradition that combines the samurai arts of sword and grappling with the philosophi-
cal desire to manifest harmony in the face of conflict. As such, it addresses situations of conflict that manifest
themselves physically, but also offers insight into how to prevent or redirect the energies--social, political, or
psychological--that might otherwise become conflict in one or another aspect of our lives. By integrating physi-
cal and intellectual components, the course seeks to forge in each student a more coherent perspective on the dif-
ficult questions, broadly formulated as "How should I live?", that the study of Ethics puts before us. The course
also seeks to provide an opportunity for students to live, for one intensive month, as if they were 21st Century
Samurai.
The physical training (10-12 each morning in the wrestling room) will improve each student's strength, balance,
posture, and flexibility. Everyone will also learn how to throw their friends across the room. About 25% of train-
ing time will be devoted to sword and staff techniques. Intellectually, students will learn what constitutes philo-
sophical rigor, and then take turns leading class discussions on ethical topics they choose from a list grouped into
4 major categories--Power, War, Life, and Money. While this is not intended to be strictly confined as an "Ethics
of Aikido" course, the ethics discussions will be consistently and constructively flavored by our Aikido training.
Candidates need to understand that this course entails more class time each week than most Winter Study op-
tions. There is simply no other way to transmit and integrate the course's physical and intellectual components.
Students will be expected to want to immerse themselves in experiencing life as a (peaceful) warrior. Assuming
the course is fully subscribed, the Ethics classes will divide into 2 sections of 10 students. Two of the three Ethics
classes each week will be held in the early evenings, and one session each week will be over lunch. Additional
relevant experiences, such as meditation practice, misogi, and Samurai films, will be an integral part of the
course.
Students will be evaluated on the quality of their participation in both physical and intellectual course compo-
nents, a class presentation, and a final 10-page paper or project which entails a significant investigation of a topic

ciples to heal the Israeli/Palestinian conflict 20 kids at a time). He earned a Masters degree in Philosophy at Cla-
remont Graduate School in 1993, writing his thesis on the Ethics of Authenticity. This will be the third time he
has offered this course.
PHIL 12 Philosophy in Literature (Same as English 22)
What is it for a novel, a story or a play to be a philosophical novel, story or play? It is not enough for it merely to
be about a character who happens to be a philosopher; nor is it just that philosophical theories are reviewed in the
narrative, as in Gaarder's Sophie's World. Milan Kundera tried to answer this question by saying that a good
philosophical novel does not serve philosophy but, on the contrary, tries to "get hold of a domain that (...) philos-
ophy had kept for itself. There are metaphysical problems, problems of human existence, that philosophy has
never known how to grasp in all their concreteness and that only the novel can seize." If Kundera is right, litera-
ture at its best does the philosophical work that philosophy cannot do for itself. What kind of work is that, and
how is it accomplished? Why can't argumentative prose--philosophers' preferred form of expression--clearly
say, and moreover prove, what literature illustrates, shows and displays? One possible answer which we will
examine is that, while many philosophers recognize that there are intimate connections between what we believe,
feel and do, philosophical argumentation by its very nature appeals to belief alone; literature, by contrast, can
simultaneously engage our reason, emotions, imagination and will, thus resulting not only in deeper understand-
ing, but also in transformation of the self.
The class will require close readings of a (necessarily small) sample of philosophical novels, stories and plays,
and a selection of theoretical works on the nature of the relationship between philosophy and literature. We will
start with Voltaire's Candide, a straightforward illustration and dramatization of conflicting philosophical sys-
tems, and proceed to discuss the works in which literature and philosophy interact in more complex and more
interesting ways. We will read Shakespeare's Hamlet, Kafka's Metamorphosis, Sartre's No Exit, de Beauvoir's
She Came to Stay, several stories by J.L. Borges, Chekhov's Uncle V
anya and, time permitting, Ecco'sThe Name
of the Rose.
Format: seminar. Requirements: class participation, weekly short assignments and a longer final paper.
Enrollment limit: 15 (expected: 10). Preference given to students with strong background or interest in both phi-
losophy and literature.
Cost to the student: approximately $60 for books.
Meeting time: early afternoons.

PHIL 14 Intersexuality (Same as Women's and Gender Studies 14)
This winter study course examines the ethical and social-political issues raised by intersexuality. Once called
"hermaphrodites" or "pseudo-hermaphrodites," intersexed persons are individuals whose chromosomal-gonad-
al-genital configuration differs from the XX or XY norm. Over the past 50 years, it has been common medical
practice to "normalize" intersexed infants through genital surgery, hormones, and other interventions.
In this course we will discuss questions such as: Are genital surgeries on intersexed infants ethical? Should they
be illegal? Are these surgeries akin to male circumcision, which has long been legal in the U.S.? Or are these
surgeries akin to FGS (female genital surgery), which has been banned in the U.S.? Should parents be legally
required to "choose" a sex for their intersexed child? Should intersexed people be permitted to not legally declare
a sex or gender? What do intersexed cases tell us about the social institutions of sex and gender?
Evaluation will be based on attendance, active participation, and a final essay of 7-9 pages, with a required draft
submitted for comments.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 12.
Meeting time: mornings.
MCKEEN
PHIL 25 Morocco (Same as English 25)
Students in this course will spend winter study in Morocco. Morocco presents a compelling blend of historical
influences and modern world currents. Threads of Islam, Arab traditions, and the heritage of the native Berber
people are woven into a distinctive cultural tapestry, while traces of French colonialism can still be seen in the
political and social structure. Morocco is at the intersection of the West, the Middle East, and Africa. Travel there
is therefore a powerful way to introduce intellectual themes that require and reward a subtle blending of insight
from history, political science, religion, and philosophy.
We will take the first steps in engaging some of these challenging topics in order to enable independent study
facilitated by serious and multifaceted exposure to the country. For the first two weeks, students will study at the
Center for Cross Cultural Learning (CCCL) in Rabat, taking Arabic lessons (classical or Moroccan dialect) each
Winter Study Program
­ 374 ­
morning and then gathering for lectures by local university faculty in the afternoon. During this span students
will live with Moroccan families in the Rabat medina. In the third week of the course students will travel in the
interior of Morocco, exploring Fez and Marrakech, riding camels in the desert, and hiking to Berber villages in
the Atlas Mountains.
Students will be expected to attend all seminars, lead a group presentation, and complete a substantial research
paper (10-15 pages). The presentation and research paper will be occasions to explore a special topic in depth
including, for instance, justice and gender, art, literature, colonial studies, or Islam.
No prerequisites. Arabic is the official spoken language of Morocco, and French is spoken very widely. While
desirable, neither is required. Enrollment limit: 15. Preference: Student interest is more important than class year
or academic major. Final participants will be chosen on the basis of interviews regarding student goals and
intellectual interests. Not open to first-year students.
Cost to students: approximately $3500.

PHYSICS
PHYS 10 Light and Holography
This course will examine the art and science of holography. It will introduce modern optics at a level appropriate
for a non-science major, giving the necessary theoretical background in lectures and discussion. Demonstrations
will be presented and students will make several kinds of holograms in the lab. Thanks to a grant from the Na-
tional Science Foundation, we have 7 well-equipped holography darkrooms available for student use. At the
beginning of WSP, the class will meet for lecture and discussion three mornings a week and for lab 2 afternoons a
week. Later classes will be mainly laboratory.
Students will be evaluated on the basis of regular attendance, completion of 4 laboratory exercises, and a holog-
raphy laboratory project or a 10-page paper. Attendance at all classes and labs is required for a passing grade.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 30. Preference will be given to students with no previous college course in
physics more advanced than Physics 100.
Cost to student: about $50 for holographic film, chemicals, and photocopies.

PHYS 11 Explorations in Biophysics (Same as Biology 15 and Chemistry 10)
Biophysics is that branch of knowledge that applies the principles of physics and chemistry and the methods of
mathematical analysis and computer modeling to understand how biological systems work. This exciting and
rapidly evolving field is revolutionizing how we study life. This course will expose students to topics where the
techniques of physics and chemistry inspire a deeper understanding of biological questions. Possible subject
matter includes: polymer physics, DNA dynamics, protein dynamics, diffusion, cellular crowding, laser tweez-
ers, single molecule techniques, molecular rulers, ion channels, and molecular motors. The goal will be to both
instruct the student in biophysical methods and demonstrate the power of interdisciplinary research. The first part
of the course will use class time to teach the necessary physical and biological concepts. The latter part of the
course will be used to guide students through the experiments we have described in the coursework. Because
grant writing is the primary method of acquiring scientific funding, the students will be instructed on writing a
grant proposal that explores a relevant topic of interest to the student.
Evaluation will be based on take home problems, mock grant proposal (10 pages), class, and lab participation.
Prerequisites: Mathematics 209, Physics 142, Biology 101; or equivalent, or by permission of instructors.Enroll-
ment limit: 12. Preference given to juniors and seniors.
Meeting time: TR, 1-4 p.m. plus lab time. Students should expect to spend at least 20-30 hours per week on the
homework and labs in preparation for their mock grant proposal. The lab time has no set meeting time, and the
students will be given access to the available lab resources they need to complete their work.

PHYS 12 Meet the Right Side of Your Brain: Drawing as a Learnable Skill
Representational drawing is not merely a gift of birth or amagical ability, but a learnable skill. If you ever wanted
to draw, but doubted you had the ability or believed you could not learn, then this course is for you. This intensive
course utilizes discoveries in brain research to teach representational drawing. By using simple techniques and
extensive exercises you will discover and develop the perceptual shift from your symbol based left hemisphere to
your visually based right hemisphere. This cognitive shift enables you to accurately see and realistically represent
the physical world. You will learn to draw a convincing portrait, self-portrait, and still life. This course is de-
signed to develop your powers of observation and enhance your innate creative problem solving abilities, which
are applicable in any field. Students need no previous artistic experience, just the willingness and desire to learn a
new skill. Students will be expected to attend and participate in all sessions. They will also be required to keep a
sketchbook recording their progress and complete a final project.
Evaluation will be based on participation, effort, and development. The class will meet two times per week with

PHYS 15 Livres des Artists--The Artist Book
Explore and explode the boundaries that define the ancient art of bookmaking. Step outside of traditional as-
sumptions and preconceived ideas to explore a mode of expression that is creative, graphic, sculptural and very
personal. During the first half of the course, learn basic bookmaking and binding techniques, including the many
variations on the accordion, codex, tunnel, carousel and inventive.
Practice paper decoration, printmaking (including monoprint, stamping, photocopy transfers and transfer draw-
ings), collage and creative writing in order to develop a plan for the creation of a collaborative project and an in-
dividual artist's book, to be designed and executed in the last half of the class.
Students will be evaluated on class participation, a collaborative project and a final project which will be dis-
played at the end of Winter Study. Attendance is mandatory.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 12.
Cost to student: $60 plus another $50 dependent on the types of supplies/paper/books that students end up mak-
ing.
Meeting time: Students will meet three days a week in a studio/workshop like setting. Expect to spend a mini-
mum of 6 hours per day, outside of class, on daily assignments and final project.
Field trips to Chapin Library, the Clark Art Institute, and the Smith College Museum of Art will be required and
scheduled according to class needs, potentially outside of the official meeting times.

POLITICAL SCIENCE
PSCI 10 B-Sides and Rarities in The Great Books Catalogue: Spinoza's Theological-Political
Treatise
Baruch Spinoza'sTheological-Political Treatise, published anonymously in 1670, sparked significant controver-
sy in its time. In contesting prevailing orthodoxies about Scripture, outlining a theory of state power, and present-
ing a radical reinterpretation of the relation between religion and politics, the Theological-Political Treatise
marks a significant intervention in the political struggles of a young Dutch Republic and a pivotal moment in the
history of political philosophy. Yet, until recently, this text stood as Spinoza's minor work, a prelude to his monu-
mental Ethics, and largely neglected by students of politics and philosophy. The recent "rediscovery" of Spino-
za's political thought should come as little surprise, as questions of religion, the state, and violence circulate at the
very center of present political conflict and struggle. In this course, we will undertake an intensive reading of
Spinoza's Theological-Political Treatise, attuned to its rhetorical style and its philosophical arguments. We will
consider Spinoza's views on the relation of faith to reason, the relation of rights to power, religious difference and
toleration, the foundation of the state, and the connection between political philosophy and theology. Our inves-
tigation of the Treatise will prompt some consideration of the contemporary purchase of Spinoza's political, phil-
osophical, and theological arguments.

PSCI 11 The Gospel According to U2
It has been said that U2 is the "world's greatest rock band"--but is it also (unknown to most) the world's great-
est--and most unusual--Christian rock band? This course explores the theology, spirituality and politics of U2
expressed through the group's songs, stage performances and human rights campaigns. We will listen to a lot of
U2, watch some videos and tour footage--but it's not all fun and games. We will also read serious theological
and philosophical tracts on U2 lyrics and explore the band's complicated interweaving of faith, sexuality, grace,
fame, doubt, justice, and the meaning of America in a way which makes them a surprisingly popular and poi-
gnant spiritual voice in our superficial and materialistic age. We will also delve into the group's human rights and
global social justice work, from Band Aid in the 1980s to Project Red today, and in particular explore Bono's
Christian social justice moorings.

PSCI 12 Civil Rights Law
This course will examine contemporary civil rights law including application of constitutional and statutory law
to modern civil liberties issues. The course will address discrimination, employment, privacy, sexual harassment,
ethnic profiling and police misconduct issues. The course will emphasize analysis of cases, statutes and related
legal materials. Most of the class time will be devoted to discussion of the cases and statutes. Outside of class
time will involve reading the cases and materials. A model civil rights case will likely be analyzed to demonstrate
application of the law to a civil rights dispute. The class will begin with an introduction to legal research prin-
ciples including traditional and electronic legal research. Students will analyze appellate court decisions and re-
lated materials, primarily U.S. Supreme Court decisions and select federal statutes including the Americans With
Disabilities Act and the Civil Rights Act of 1964. This class is recommended for students contemplating law
school.
Requirements: A 10-page research paper addressing a civil rights topic to be decided by student and instructor.
Evaluation will be based on the analysis of a student paper and class participation.

In 2007, the world became majority urban. But most of these urbanites live not in places like New York or Tokyo
but rather in places like Lagos or Mumbai, dwelling in shantytowns and working in petty commerce. Their cit-
ies' path of urbanization diverges from the "normal" one accompanying industrialization in the West and East
Asia. We consider this phenomenon and its interpretation by various filmmakers and writers, and by the residents
themselves. Writers include Mike Davis, Rem Koolhaas, Sukhetu Mehta, and Robert Neuwirth.

PSCI 21 Fieldwork in Public and Private Non-Profits
This course is a participant-observation experience in which students work full-time for a governmental agency,
nongovernmental (including voluntary, activist, and grassroots) organization, or for a political campaign. Stu-
dents may find placements in government and nonprofit organizations in which their work involves significant
involvement with public issues. Examples include: town government offices; state or federal administrative of-
fices (e.g., environmental agencies, housing authorities); interest groups that lobby government (e.g., ACLU,
NRA); nonprofit organizations such as service providers or think tanks (e.g., Habitat for Humanity; Cato Insti-
tute); and grassroots, activist or community development organizations (e.g., Greenpeace or neighborhood asso-
ciations). In 2008, students are especially encouraged to seek fieldwork with political campaigns. The instructors
will work with each student to arrange a placement; such arrangements must be made in advance of the Winter
Term. Students should first make their own contacts with an institution or agency. The instructor and members of
the Political Science department are available to help students find placements, if necessary. Each student's field-
work mentor shall send a confirmation letter to the instructor verifying the placement and describing the nature of
the work to be performed by the student. Students will read a few short articles distributed at the beginning of
Winter Term and must agree to keep a journal, maintain weekly contact with the instructor, and write a final pa-
per summarizing and reflecting upon the experience. A group meeting of all students will occur after winter
study to discuss the experiences.
Requirements: 90 hours of fieldwork; satisfactory evaluation from the institutional sponsor; 10-page final paper
or equivalent; participation in final meeting.

PSCI 22 Research Design and Methods Minicourse
In social science research, clear rules govern how to choose cases, how to infer causation, and how to recognize
and assess disconfirming evidence. This course teaches those rules. Every class, students learn, apply, and evalu-
ate aresearch technique. We discuss how to state a researchable question and how to determine what counts as an
answer to that question. We consider what constitutes valid evidence, how to identify and evaluate alternative
explanations for the same event, and how to separate coincidence from cause. Students do interviews, surveys,
archival research, case studies and field studies. The course assumes no statistics although students will have to
(gasp) multiply; instead, our focus is on the issues involved in conceiving and executing a research project in the
social sciences.
Format: lab. Requirement: homeworks applying each method or research problem to a topic, then one larger
report.
Enrollment limit: 15.
Cost to student: one textbook.

PSCI 25 Williams in NOLA
This winter study will give students a first-hand, community level understanding of New Orleans culture and the
impact of Hurricane Katrina, framed by an academic understanding of the same. Students will be in New Or-
leans for the first two weeks of the Winter Study period. During that time, they will be involved in rebuilding
projects in New Orleans through Common Ground (a grass-roots recovery organization), Tulane's Semester in
NOLA program, or possibly Habitat for Humanity. Projects may involve demolition, rough carpentry, painting,
landscaping, or other manual labor in residential areas, or assisting in restoration of city facilities such as libraries,
museums, schools, etc.
Concurrent with the rebuilding/restoration projects, students will also participate in interdisciplinary studies
(coordinated through Tulane's Semester in NOLA) looking at New Orleans' culture, heritage, and geography,
the evolution of the city's pre-Katrina configuration, the events of Katrina's onslaught and its aftermath, and the
political, economic, and social impact of Katrina.
In addition to the exposure through their own work, students will have a tour/lecture on the construction and
geology of the levee system, and how and where it failed, and a tour of some of the area outside New Orleans
proper, where the storm alone (as opposed to levee failure) was responsible for the damage. Students will be
given readings from Breach of Faith by Jed Horne, One Dead in Attic by Chris Rose, and Rising Tide by John
Barry, and possibly other references, as well as viewings of Spike Lee's documentary "When the Levees Broke."
Speakers will include faculty from Tulane, a state representative from New Orleans, and residents of New Or-
leans, including the Lower Ninth Ward.
Students will also have the opportunity to have discussions, both amongst themselves and facilitated by faculty,
about their experiences. When students return to Williams for the third of winter study, they will continue these
discussions and some students will do presentations for the class.
Written requirements and grading: Students will be expected to keep a journal during their stay in New Orleans,

PSYCHOLOGY
PSYC 11 Children and the Media
The media's influence on child development is pervasive. American children ages 2 through 17 watch television
an average of 25 hours per week, with 20% of children viewing more than 44 hours per week. Eighty-three
percent of children ages 8 to 18 own video game systems and 45% of American households have internet access.
This course examines the effects of the media on child development, from infancy through late adolescence.
Theory and research that examines the mechanisms of influence by which media exposure impacts development
will be discussed. Outside of class time students will become consumers of media marketed to children and con-
duct brief systematic analyses about the impact of such media on various domains of child development. These
analyses will then be presented and discussed in class. Students will also complete an intensive independent in-
vestigation of one media genre of their choice, which may include television, film, video games, computer
games, internet forums (e.g., My Space and Face Book) or music by becoming extensive consumers themselves
(25 hours per week during the 3rd week of winter study) and writing a report which synthesizes their experiences
with this genre and the psychological literature into an integrative analysis. Oral presentation of this report will be
presented to the class during final day of winter study.
No prerequisite. Enrollment limit: 15. Preference given to seniors.
Cost to student: approximately $75 for books.

PSYC 12 Animal Communication: The Psychology of Human-Animal Relationships
Many of us have enjoyed the unconditional love of a pet. Such a close bond with a special animal can be incredi-
bly rewarding and fulfilling. But what goes into building such relationships? How does that relationship differ if
"Fido" is actually a 1200 lb horse or a 600 lb tiger? Are animals really telepathic communicators, or are they
simply responding instinctively to stimuli? In this course, we will try to unravel the mystery of how animals and
humans communicate with each other. We will learn about basic psychological and biological principles of be-
havior, communication, and learning. We will speak with veterinarians and trainers about their experiences and
opinions, and observe a "Horse Whisperer". Reading list includes: The Body Language of Horses by T. Ainslie;
Does a Seal Smile? by F. Ehrlich; and If Wishes Were Horses: The Education of a Veterinarian by L. Gage & N.
Gage. Guest speakers: Lisa De Mayo, a horse trainer and riding instructor in Williamstown for over 20 years,
currently the coach of the Williams College Equestrian Team; Dr. Carlin Jones, an equine veterinarian with Up-
state Equine Medical; Lisa Boshetti, an animal trainer at the Berkshire Humane Society.

PSYC 13 Get Focused & Step It Up--Climate Change Activism
Students will learn about and participate in grassroots activism addressing global climate change. We will read
in-depth about the range of grassroots efforts-from local to national and international-to stop climate change and
mitigate its impacts. Emphasis will be given to Focus the Nation, the campus-based national discussion of cli-
mate change that will culminate in educational forums taking place at Williams and across the country on Janu-
ary 31, 2008. Grassroots organizing and activism have been critical in the U.S. given the lack of governmental
leadership on this issue to date. Students will be asked to think critically about which grassroots organizing ef-
forts are most effective, and to participate in a form of activism that they will study in-depth. Examples of a final
project include staging a rally or educational event, creating a public service announcement or public information
campaign, or conducting a small research project (e.g., an observational study, survey, or questionnaire) and us-

PSYC 14 Introduction to Go (Same as ANSO 14)
The game of Go is one of the oldest continuously-played strategy games in the world and is played by millions in
China, Korea, and Japan. Its popularity no doubt has arisen from an ideal combination of intense intellectual
challenge and the meditative beauty of playing. The goal of Go is not to destroy a force (as in chess) or to run a
race (as in backgammon). Instead, two players alternate in placing black and white stones on a wooden 19x19
grid with the aim of surrounding the most territory. Go is unique because its large board and minimally restrictive
rules allow for complex strategy and expression of each players' personality. But Go is also more than a game. It
is a cultural phenomenon with deep roots in Eastern history and an art form with intriguing implications for
artificial intelligence and the nature of problem solving. In this course we will learn, study, and play a lot of Go,
culminating in a class tournament. In addition, play will be supported by game analyses, novels, articles, and
films. Expectations: 6 hours in class activities; 20 hours of work outside of class (reading, playing with other
students and on-line, game problems, commentaries and analyses). Evaluation will be based on attendance
(prompt attendance at all classes is mandatory), problem sets, game commentaries, and participation in discus-
sions.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 16. Preference to first-year students and sophomores.
Cost to student: approximately $125 for books and supplies.
Meeting time: three 2-hour morning periods each week.

tion of a sizeable project of the student's choosing (wall quilt or throw-size quilt). There will be an exhibit of all
work (Ephquilts), at the end of winter study. "Woven" into the classes will be discussions of the history of quilt-
ing, the controversy of "art" quilts vs. "traditional" quilts, machine vs. hand-quilting and the growing quilting
market. Reading list: Pieces of the Past by Nancy J. Martin; Stitching Memories: African-American Story Quilts

REL 12 Building Your Yoga Practice: Dipping in to a Long and Living Tradition
This class provides an orientation to yoga and builds a foundation for an effective and rewarding yoga practice by
integrating textual studies and personal practice. Analysis and comparison of classic yoga texts from India pro-
vides a historical, cultural, and philosophical background for yoga. As well as discussion of key yogic concepts
and how they relate to contemporary life, class meetings experientially explore how philosophical themes play
out in the physical practice. In any one class, poses may include standing poses, inversions, abdominals, hip-
openers, backbends, twists, forward bends, and restoratives. Participants learn a set of universal principles of
alignment, which facilitates skillful sequencing to create your own effective home practice and gain familiarity
with the basics of human anatomy. Throughout class, you receive individualized attention on how to work with
your particular body and needs. Interacting with the yoga tradition can promote greater physical accomplishment
and ease, prompt explorations of ethical dilemmas and philosophical questions, and uncover ways to reduce
stress and optimize your energy. This class aims to provide an overview of the yoga tradition, and to empower
each participant to creatively draw upon this tradition, and to empower each participant to creatively draw upon
this tradition for your personal intentions.
Required texts: Pantanjali's Yoga Sutras, The Bhagavad Gita, Hatha Yoga Illustrated, and related articles.
Evaluation is based on attendance and participation in all classes and sessions, a personal practice journal demon-
strating particular intentions for practice and appropriate poses and sequencing to support those intentions, and
15 pages of writing including textual analysis as well as personal reflections on the nature of yoga.
No prerequisites. Preference give to those with some previous exposure to yoga asana or philosophy. Apply by
email with a brief explanation of your interest in the class (selection based on this application). Enrollment limit:

REL 24 The Reformation in Europe
This course explores the roots of the Reformation in early-modern Europe through its immediate repercussions.
As a travel course, we will explore the key places where the Reformation took place, beginning in Wittenburg
(now appropriately named Lutherstadt Wittenburg), Muenster (The "Radical Reformation"), Munich, and end-
ing in Vechta (Lower Saxony). We will spend seventeen days in Germany and France, beginning with Muenster,
where we will tour the "Freidensaele," or the "Halls of Peace," where the treaties ending the thirty years war
were promulgated. After orienting ourselves over a two-day period, we will travel on by train to Lutherstadt
Wittenburg, where we will visit Luther's former monastery and home, and well as the Melancthon and Lucas
Cranach the Elder houses. During this time our sightseeing will be interspersed with brief lectures on the roots of
the Protestant Reformation. After three days we will travel to Erlangen, where we will will tour items of Refor-
mation interest and spend some class time wrapping up loose ends with Luther and continuing on to Calvin. We
will have lectures and read Calvin as we travel. We will then travel to Vechta in Lower Saxony.
Upon our return to Williamstown, we will reassess our experience. Students will be expected to write a 10- to
12-page page paper on selected themes.
No German language experience is expected or required. Enrollment limit: 8. Not open to first-year students.
Cost to students: approximately $2500.

REL 25 Explorations in Solidarity: A Meeting of Minds and Hearts in Nicaragua
This course will explore the lived realities of the hemisphere's second most impoverished nation, and the rele-
vance of faith and religious community to the struggle for social justice. Students will reflect on these realities
and struggles in the company of subsistence farmers, urban factory laborers, and leaders of grassroots organiza-
tions working for progressive social change. The effects, particularly on the poor, of free trade policies (CAFTA
and FTAA) in an increasingly globalized economy, natural disasters, and the changeable attentions of the devel-
oped world will be explored, using some of the methods of popular education and oral history. Significant atten-
tion will also be given to the efficacy of liberation theology and the base Christian community movement, as well
as other influences--Christian, Marxist and neo-Liberal--on the material and spiritual well-being of Nicaraguan
people.
Nicaragua offers a unique lens through which to view the culture and influence of the U.S., as well as the daily
struggles, the dignity, and the hope of some of the hemisphere's most marginalized citizens. The experience of
the course will include approximately ten days of living (with minimal amenities) with families in a subsistence
farming community. Students will also attend a number of Christian religious services. (The course is open to
students of any religious background or no affiliation.) And for a portion of the course we may be joined by
Nicaraguan peers who are involved in youth empowerment movements or in the midst of university education.
Travels in Nicaragua will be organized by the staff of the Asociación Kairos para la Formación, an NGO that
facilitates educational programs and fosters faith-based partnerships for communities and groups in North Amer-
ica and Nicaragua, working toward the goal of permanent transformative relationships. Throughout, students
Winter Study Program
­ 382 ­
will be invited to accompany our Nicaraguan hosts as they live their daily lives, and to reflect on their own identi-
ties and assumptions as North Americans. The goal is to explore the relevance of religious community to the
possibilities for restorative justice, and to discover what it would mean to shape a relationship with the people of
Nicaragua according to a paradigm of solidarity--in contrast to the more familiar paradigms of charity and na-
tional self-interest.
The course will begin in Williamstown with several days of background reading (Nicaraguan history and the
current political, economic and religious situation), writing, and orientation. Once in Nicaragua there will be dai-
ly reflection sessions, in preparation for which students will keep a detailed personal journal. Other requirements
include attendance at two orientation sessions during the latter weeks of the fall semester; participation in a group
oral presentation to the Williams community upon return; and a final 10-page paper.
Conversational knowledge of Spanish is, of course, helpful; but we will be accompanied by several translators
who will help to to make the experience accessible to non-Spanish speakers as well. Willingness to live in physi-
cally demanding situations is essential. The cost of the trip to the student, including all food, lodging, round-trip
travel between Williamstown and Managua, all in-country transportation and fees, will be no more than $2,650
(depending on airfares at the time of booking). Students are individually responsible for the cost of travel to
Williamstown at the beginning of WSP.

RLFR 10 Fictions of Domesticity (Same as English 10)
We visit an author's home in search of a connection to the origin of their writing: here's the site from which a
novel or poem sprang. Museums dedicated to authors' homes feed this fantasy, that in looking at Melville's desk
(complete with glasses) or at the room where Dickinson dwelt we are even closer to them than in their words.
However, as we will explore in the course, far from an unmediated visit to the source of genius, museums of
author's homes construct narratives of their own about authorship, art, even about the value of daily life. More-
over, the writers themselves shaped conceptions of domestic space in ways that do not always correspond to the
tales told by the museums made of their homes. We will visit the homes of, and read works by, Herman Melville,
Emily Dickinson, Mark Twain, and Harriet Beecher Stowe.
Students will produce a final project that engages in the critical issues of the course. This project may be a ten-
page page paper focused on the readings, on analysis of the museum spaces themselves, or may even use visual
media to comment upon the constructions of domestic space and authorship.

RUSS 24 Resettling Refugees in Maine
Sponsored by the Gaudino Scholar and the Gaudino Fund, this Winter Study travel course will allow a small
group of students to live in Portland, Maine for the month of January, where they will explore the impact of over
thirty years of refugee resettlement in the 'whitest' of the United States. Students will live with a refugee family
from one of the over two dozen countries represented by the refugee community of Portland, and during their
home stay they will encounter first-hand the issues confronting recent immigrants to the United States from
Southeast Asia, Africa, Eastern Europe or Latin America. Students will keep a daily journal to record their expe-
riences working with their refugee family and the organizations that serve them. Students will be challenged to
examine issues including class, race, ethnicity, and national identity; the interplay of public and private values;
the wide variety of educational, health, governmental, and religious agencies and providers serving refugee fami-
lies; and how these services are perceived and received by family members. Each student will meet weekly with
the course instructor to evaluate her or his experience, and once or twice during their stay in Maine students and
their host families will have the opportunity to meet as a group for a meal and discussions. Students as a group
will also have time in Maine at the beginning of the program for orientation sessions, and at the conclusion to
share experiences and write a short paper.
No prerequisites. If student interest exceeds the enrollment limit, preference will be given to those students who
demonstrate, in a short conversation with and essay submitted to the instructor, their interest in experiential learn-
ing generally and the problems confronting recent immigrants to the United States specifically.

Williams has a unique program in the Republic of Georgia, which offers students the opportunity to engage in
internships in their chosen field of interest in a country that is undergoing the transition to a market economy and
democracy. Past students have worked in the Georgian Parliament, helped in humanitarian relief organizations
like Save the Children, interned in journalism at The Georgian Times, taught unemployed women computer
skills at The Rustavi Project, documented wildlife, studied with a Georgian sculptor, done rounds at the Institute
of Cardiology, and learned about transitional economies at the Georgian National Bank. Students experience
Georgian culture through museum visits, concerts, lectures, meetings with Georgian students, and excursions.
Visit the sacred eleventh-century Cathedral of Sveti-tskhoveli and the twentieth-century Stalin Museum, take the
ancient Georgian Military Highway to ski in the Caucasus Range, see the birthplace of the wine grape in Kakheti
and the region where Jason sought the Golden Fleece. Participants are housed in pairs with English-speaking
families in Tbilisi, Georgia's capital city. At the end of the course students will write a 10-page paper assessing
their internship experience.

SPECIALS
SPEC 10 Quest for College: Early Awareness in Berkshire County Schools
Today's extremely competitive higher education market places significant pressure on students nationwide to
start planning for college at an increasingly early age while simultaneously demanding ever-higher standards of
excellence for admission to top schools. "Early Awareness" initiatives aim to educate middle school students as
to what lies ahead on the college horizon, empowering them to make sound academic and extracurricular choices
that will keep open a maximum of options. The first week of this course will be spent in the classroom, exploring
and discussing problems and issues germane to the national trends towards greater (and earlier) college-related
pressures. Students will respond to a series of readings dealing with such issues as tracking, paid test preparation
and untimed testing, early decision, parental and peer pressures, special interests, misrepresentation of informa-
tion, independent counseling, and others. Class time will also be devoted to familiarizing students with both the
nuances of the college admission process and the administration of the early awareness game, Quest for College.
Students will spend the next two weeks visiting 10-12 Berkshire County middle schools, administering the game
and inviting students to the culminating College Day. All 8 students will then work together to plan and run Col-
lege Day activities for students and their parents. This day will include a) campus tours, b) general higher educa-
tion info sessions, and c) financial aid/scholarship info for the parents. If student and community interest is suffi-
cient, the course may culminate in a public presentation and open forum early second semester.
Evaluation will be based on completion of field work (school visits), organization and execution of project to
bring local middle school students to the Williams Campus for a day of early-awareness related activities and a
final paper (approximately 10 pages) reflecting on a course-related issue of the student's choosing.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 8. Preference given to a) students with prior education/admission experience,
b) students with access to transportation c) juniors and seniors. Interested students must consult with instructors
prior to registration.
Cost to student: transportation to field work sites and purchase of text.
Meeting time: afternoons.

SPEC 13 Bodies in Motion: Modern Dance Technique in Historic Context
Because so many modern dancers study Graham Technique today, it is tempting to believe that her dance theory
sprang, phoenix-like, from the very first steps she took as a solo artist in 1926. In fact, (her) training method

evolved from sixty-five years of working with dancers and actors, as well as through her life-long work of mak-
ing new dances." --Marian Horosko
This course will be an introduction to the principles of the Martha Graham Technique as a basis for dramatic
movement in any form. Each class will include floor work, standing work and traveling work, and students will
be challenged based on their individual level of dance training and experience. No previous dance experience
required. Live musical accompaniment will enhance students' experience of rhythm, dynamic shifts and dramat-
ic intent.
Students will explore the development of Graham Technique through readings about Graham's life, essays by
noted Graham dancers over the generations, and screenings of films of Graham repertory as well as rare early
technique films.
The class will attend a live dance performance if an appropriate event is happening in January, on campus or at a
nearby venue such as MASSMoCA.
Students will be evaluated based upon participation in all classes, discussions, and final showing. In addition, a
weekly journal, and a 7-page research paper will be required. The final class meeting will be an open studio
showing.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20. Priority given to students with prior interest and study in a form of dance.
Cost to students: approximately $50.
Meeting time: MWF, 10-noon: technique class; Mondays 7-8:30 p.m.: screenings and discussion.

SPEC 14 Emergency Medical Technician--Basic
A course designed to prepare students for the Massachusetts EMT exam and to provide training to become certi-
fied as an Emergency Medical Technician. The course teaches the new national standard curriculum which
makes reciprocity with many other states possible. This is a time-intensive course involving approximately 130
hours of class time plus optional emergency room observation and ambulance work. Students learn, among other
skills, basic life support techniques, patient assessment techniques, defibrillation, how to use an epi-pen, safe
transportation and immobilization skills, as well as the treatment of various medical emergencies including
shock, bleeding, soft-tissue injuries, and child birth. In order to reduce the number of class meetings required dur-
ing Winter Study Period, the course holds a few meetings beginning in the fall semester. These class meetings,
which are mandatory, with the following schedule: 14 October (orientation), 28 October, 29 October, 11 Novem-
ber, and 12 November. Any questions regarding this course should be directed to the instructor, Kevin Garvey,
via email (pece@netscape.com).
Evaluation is based on class participation and performance on class exams, quizzes and practical exercises.

types of medicine. Apprenticeships are arranged in two distinct ways: some students live on campus and are
matched with a local practitioner, while others make independent arrangements to shadow a distant professional.
The expectation is that each student will observe some aspect of medicine for the better part of the day, five days
per week. In recent years, students have shadowed physicians, veterinarians, dentists, nurses, and public health
experts.

SPEC 20 Breaking Out of the Box--Unleashing Creative Thinking (Same as Comparative
Literature 20)
How can we think "out of the box" if we don't know what the box is, how it functions, or how we unconsciously
cling to it? The goal of this course is to familiarize you with the entire creative process-how it operates, how it is
nurtured, and how it is stifled. We will look at some general principals: the nature of the creative mind, a break-
down of the creative process, and the exploration of meaning. We'll also explore specific skills necessary for
creative thinking: finding meaning in our work, understanding and managing our unruly minds, understanding
how to recognize and manage anxiety, exploring creative energy, committing to goals and plans, learning to em-
brace mistakes and to disidentify from our work, and how to support our creative endeavors while leading a life
of deadlines and chaos. Each student will be expected to engage in a self-chosen project for the duration of the
course, working approximately 20 hours per week on the project, exclusive of class time. The class format will
involve the presentation of material, group discussions, and in-class exercises. We will meet three times per week
for 2 hour sessions. One-on-one meetings will be arranged as needed.
Evaluation will be based on preparation for and participation in class discussions and activities, homework exer-
cises--including the keeping of a journal, the development of the creative project, and a public showing/presen-
tation of the project on the last day of Winter Study. Attendance at all classes is expected.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15.
Cost to students: approximately $40 for books and photocopying.
Meeting time: TWR, 10-noon.

SPEC 21 The Psychology of the Workplace, A Field Study
Field experience is a critical component of the decision to enter a profession. Through this field study, students
can clarify their understanding of the rewards and challenges that accompany the practice of many different as-
pects within a profession, and understand the psychology of the workplace. Field placements are arranged in two
distinct ways: some students live on campus and are matched with a local professional, while others make inde-
pendent arrangements to work with a distant professional. The expectation is that each student will observe some
aspect of the profession for the better part of the day, five days per week. It is also expected that the teaching
associate will assign a specific project to be completed within the three-and-a-half week duration of the course
depending upon appropriateness.
Participation in this winter study will require the student to quickly assess the work environment, make infer-
ences about corporate culture, performance norms and expectations, and to take initiative not only to learn from
this experience, but also to contribute where and when appropriate. Understanding the dynamics within a work
environment is critical to success in any organization and this hands-on experience will illuminate lessons
learned in the classroom. Upon completion of the winter study, it is expected that the student write a thorough
report evaluating and interpreting the experience.
Method of evaluation: It is expected that students will complete assigned readings, keep a daily journal, and write
a 5-page expository review and evaluation that will become public record as a resource for other students. Final-
ly, the student will be expected to create a 20-minute Powerpoint presentation on his/her experience due at the
end of Winter Study. If possible the student will make a presentation to fellow students at some time during the
spring semester.
Required activities and meeting times: The expectation is that each student will be in the field to observe some
aspect of the profession for the better part of the day, five days per week. In addition to observation there may be
an opportunity to work on distinct projects generated by the instructor depending upon appropriateness.
Prerequisites: interested students must attend an information meeting in early October, and meet individually
with John Noble to go over the details of their placements. Preference for placements will be given on the basis of
Winter Study Program
­ 388 ­
seniority and demonstrated interest in the profession of interest.
Enrollment is limited by the number of available teaching associates (maximum 20). Preference for placements
will be given on the basis of seniority and demonstrated interest in the profession of interest.
Meeting time: each student will be in the field to observe some aspect of the profession five days per week, at
least 6 hours per day.
Cost to students: Local apprenticeships--local transportation. Distant apprenticeships--costs will vary based
upon location, but are the responsibility of the student.
Teaching Associates (instructors): Williams College alumni and parents of current Williams students will be
recruited to become instructors for this course. A broad range of professions will be represented as the course
develops. It is expected that the course will begin as a pilot program, involving only a small number of students
in its first year and then will grow as appropriate. Alumni and parents will receive a training packet and individu-
al orientations with the course director in person or via telephone conference.

SPEC 24 Eye care and Culture on the Atlantic Coast of Nicaragua
Continuing the model of recent eye care winter studies in Nicaragua, the trip will follow a similar protocol. In
cooperation with Ray Hooker, President of FADCANIC (The Foundation for the Autonomy and Development
of the Caribbean Coast of Nicaragua) who has assisted us in all of our previous course and certain professors of
the New England College of Optometry (specifically Dr. Bruce Moore, Dr. Nicole Quinn and Dr. Elise Harb)
who have previously trained our students in the prescription of reading and distance glasses and have accompa-
nied our trips, we are proposing a follow up course continuing our work of prescribing glasses and also the train-
ing of local medical personnel to prescribe and distribute glasses as a sustaining project. In preparation for this
proposed trip, at the conclusion of our 2007 trip, we left approximately 2500 pairs of glasses and other materials
and supplies in Pearl Lagoon for future work.
After a partial week of classes on campus on the culture and politics of Nicaragua and a weekend of training in
the prescribing of glasses we would travel to Managua for aday of cultural visits (national museum, Masaya V
ol-
cano, Huembes market). We would then travel to Bluefields to continue our work of clinics as well as training
local health care workers to prescribe and distribute reading and distance glasses. We would train and conduct
clinics around Bluefields as well as in Pearl Lagoon.
Finally we would travel to Corn Island and possibly Little Corn Island to conduct some clinics as well as some
training of health care workers. We would then return to Managua to spend the night and then return to the U.S.
the next day.
The course would conclude with the sharing of specific incidents and insights that were important learning about
ourselves and the developing world.

SPEC 35 Making Pottery on the Potter's Wheel
Each class will begin with a lecture-demonstration, followed by practice on the potter's wheel. Each student will
have the use of a potter's wheel for each class. We will work on mugs, bowls, pitchers, plates, jars, lids, vases,
and bottles, and will finish these shapes as required by trimming and adding handles, lugs, lids, spouts, and
knobs. We will also work on several different handbuilding projects. After the tenth class session, all class work
will be biscuit-fired. The eleventh class will be devoted to glazing the biscuited pieces. Glazing techniques will
include pouring, dipping, layering, brushing, and stamping, and using wax resist and other masking techniques to
develop pattern and design. The completed work will then be glaze-fired. The last meeting will be devoted to a
"final project" gallery show of your best work at a location on the Williams College campus. Woven into lecture-

SPEC 39 "Composing a Life:" Finding Success and Balance in Life After Williams
To be at Williams you have learned to be a successful student, but how do you learn to be successful in life? How
will you define success in both your career and in your personal life? How will you achieve balance between the
two? In short, what will constitute the "good life" for you? We borrow the concept of "composing a life" from
Mary Catherine Bateson, as an apt metaphor for the ongoing process of defining success and balance in life. This
course is designed: (1) To offer college students an opportunity to examine and define their beliefs, values, and
assumptions about their future personal and professional lives before entering the "real" world; (2) To encourage
students to gain a better understanding of how culture, ideology, and opportunity affect their life choices; (3) To
provide an opportunity for students to consider different models of success and balance through "living cases"
(in the form of guests from various professions and lifestyles); and (4) To aid students in contemplating their ca-
reer options through individual advising and introducing various career and life planning resources. Using se-
lected readings, cases, and guest speakers, we will explore both the public context of the workplace as well as the
private context of individuals and their personal relationships in determining life choices.
Requirements: regular attendance, class participation, field interview, and a 10-page final paper. Outside-of-class
work includes reading, field interview, and various contemplative assignments.
No prerequisites. Questions about the course: please contact Michele Moeller Chandler at 458-8106 (mi-

religious beliefs, to attend classes or to participate in any examination, study, or work requirement on a particular day
shall be excused from any such...requirement, and shall be provided an opportunity to make up such...requirement
which he may have missed because of such absence...provided, however, that such makeup examination or work shall
not create an unreasonable burden upon such school...No adverse or prejudicial effects shall result to any student be-
cause of his availing himself of the provisions of this section."
